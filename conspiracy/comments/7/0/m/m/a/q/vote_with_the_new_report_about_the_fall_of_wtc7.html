    <div class="md"><p>Got through the first paper, but it is awesome.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014102961300432X">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014102961300432X</a></p>

<p>Check this out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two ten-story office buildings were designed according to the
current building codes and design specifications, namely, International
Building Code [1], Minimum Design Loads for building and
other Structures (ASCE-7) [21], Specification for Structural Steel
Buildings (AISC-360) [22] and AISC Steel Design Guide 19 [23].
The buildings were designed for use as office buildings in Chicago,
USA. As shown in Fig. 1, the buildings have identical plan layouts,
but different lateral load resisting systems:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So they test two different scenarios.</p>

<p>The first scenario yields:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thereafter, the steel columns undergo
yielding and fail by inelastic column buckling approximately
85 min after the fire broke out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As shown in the figure, simultaneous
buckling failure of the four columns occurs and initiates collapse
of the Sâ€“W corner. The analytical results also indicate significant
cracking in the concrete floor slab, and some yielding in the bottom
flange of the heated beams prior to collapse. However, no failure
was observed in any connections or beams till the columns failed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Symmetrical collapse of the whole building does not occur. </p>

<p>The next scenario:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The analytical results show that the temperatures of the columns
and beams and other components were similar to those
described earlier from the analysis of building with rigid interior
core. The interior gravity column C-2 (see Fig. 1(b)) of the southwest
compartment failed by inelastic column buckling (about the
minor axis, as expected) after approximately 85 min of the fire
event. However, the remaining exterior and corner columns did
not undergo buckling failure along with the interior gravity
column. There was no failure in beams or connections either till the interior gravity column failed. The floor supported by the gravity
column and all the floors above it started displacing rapidly
downwards along with the gravity column as it underwent inelastic
buckling (instability). However, after a vertical displacement of
approximately 1.1 m, the vertical displacement rate decreased
significantly and the system stabilized. Fig. 10 shows the deformed
shape of the building immediately after the failure of the interior
column. As shown, only the interior gravity column fails, and no
further instability, failure, or collapse occurs during the rest of
the compartment fire event.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You start to have displacement of multiple floors, however it is stabilized and no collapse of the building occurs.</p>

<p>Which leads them to their conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If gravity column failure occurs, then presence of steel reinforcement
(greater than the minimum shrinkage reinforcement)
in the composite slab governs the redistribution of the axial load
dropped by the failed column to the neighboring columns. The
presence of steel reinforcement in the concrete slab will facilitate
uniform redistribution of the dropped axial load to the neighboring
columns, and thus reduce the risk of additional failures and progressive
collapse of the structure. The addition of steel reinforcement
to the concrete slabs of typical steel building design should
receive more attention during evaluation, rehabilitation of existing
building, and the design of future buildings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in terms of outcomes of the study, they certainly don&#39;t support some kind of progressive collapse that is symmetrical and occurs at free fall speeds.  </p>

<p>Let us look at how it references the WTC 1, 2 and 7.</p>

<p>Concerning WTC 1 and 2 they cite the official explanation, and a model that supports it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, the core softened
with further increase in temperatures, and the load was
transferred to the exterior wall panels. This additional load, in
combination with the horizontal pulling force from the floor
system caused instability in the exterior walls, which progressed
rapidly to other parts of the structure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the extra modeling study did find the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The simulation results indicated that the beams developed
nonlinear thermal gradients, and started sagging with elevated
temperatures. As the temperatures increased, the beams started
sagging excessively and losing flexural strength. These beams
started pulling the exterior columns inwards over several stories,
which led to the buckling collapse of the exterior columns followed
by the overall system destabilization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, ok kind of sort of supports the NIST report. Concerning WTC 7.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After the simulations from the static analyses stopped converging,
the entire model data including the final converged material
state, temperatures, stresses, strains and damage information were
exported to an equivalent model of the entire building in LS-DYNA
[20]. This model was developed to numerically simulate the building
behavior between failure initiation and final collapse. In this
model, beams, columns, and slabs were modeled using shell elements
with just one layer. Only the gravity loads were applied
and the system was allowed to collapse without any additional
thermal loading. The simulations indicated that an interior column
was rendered unbraced due to the failure of one of the longest span
beams and its associated connections. The recurrence of similar
failures over 9 consecutive stories caused the column (now
unbraced over several stories) to undergo buckling failure. This
precipitated the collapse of the rest of the structure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is it, obviously the authors felt there were limitations in the WTC 7 study.</p>

<p>This paper hardly supports the official account. </p>
