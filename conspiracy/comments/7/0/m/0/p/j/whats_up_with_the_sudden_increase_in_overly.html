<p>That doesn&#39;t mean all of it has been.</p>

<p>Use logic, reason, not fallacies like composition or division.   </p>

<p>Archaeological evidence - found across many groups with different purposes -- substantiating the existence of numerous authentic NT manuscripts is not to be brushed aside lightly.</p>

<p>1) You have in no way proved that Christianity or Christian history is a delusion.</p>

<p>2) You assume that just because you believe certain things to be delusions, others should too.</p>

<p>3) You believe that you are in a position to educate others when it is clear that you do not have even a rudimentary understanding of western civ.</p>

<p>Just all-round recipe for disaster.  Go back and get educated.  Come back to the religion conversation in ten years.  In the meantime, you have no right to be an ass to Christians.</p>

<p>didn&#39;t say it was i have faith in god and i love jesus but those are not bound to any church or book.</p>

<p>delusions are pretty easy to identify</p>

<p>I know a shit ton about true tangible history but ok</p>

<p>see you don&#39;t &quot;get educated&quot; thats when you fall victim to peoples agendas and become a pawn you have to educate yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/1_f0zUMkyG4">book of Enki </a> </p>

<p>I spelled it wrong the first time, it&#39;s Enki. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a big believer in forbidden history and ancient astronauts. I believe we are what&#39;s left of a very ancient species genetically modified by alien scientists to be a workforce, mining gold and diamonds. To a hunt and gather culture, gold would have no use and they would have NEVER dug into the ground for it. There was just no need. However those are two elements needing in all technology. </p>

<p>I also like this idea because it means that the &#39;gods&#39; might have been based off real people and I love the idea of Sekmet being some very real, bad ass, lion lady who beat the crap out of anyone who messed with her. Then you think about how these creatures were known to take human partners so you could be related to one. So cool to think about. </p>
