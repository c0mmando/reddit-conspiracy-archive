       For quite some time I thought of Seorge Soros to be
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       mastermind behind many ugly things happening in europa and throughout the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be it mass immigration, financial support of islamic fundamentalism, economic derailing of whole countries and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course his actions speak for himself and clearly draw him as the evil puppeteer he is. But I recently asked myself:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Usually TPTB remain in the dark and in the shadows. But Soros openly advertizes his goals and is far from being in the shadows. Even his son openly and aggressively uses social media to signal his longing for  destruction of western (caucasian, christian) civilization.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, who
        <strong>
         really
        </strong>
        commands Soros, with Soros only being a puppet being used like a throw away social media account?

       The Black Nobility are ancient royal bloodlines/dynasties. They control via  various secret societies and orders. Some families you can do some research into are: House of Este-Welf, House of Chigi, House of Orsini, House of Farnese, House of Sforza, House of Medici, House of Aldobrandini, House of Hess, House of Habsburg, House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, House of Colonna, House of Breakspeare, House of Rothschild, House of Romanov.

       You're welcome. Many Arab leaders are knighted into these various orders, the House of Saud being an example. The Black Nobility owns the Vatican (Holy Roman Empire), and it is theorized that the Vatican created Islam, per the account of ex-Jesuit Alberto Rivera.

       The Rothschild are pretty high up, but there are families above them. The Rothschild are the Guardians of the Papal Treasure. They don't own it, they are knights protecting it (
       <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Great_coat_of_arms_of_Rothschild_family.svg">
        look at their coat of arms
       </a>
       ). Their role is to be quasi secret/in the open. Hence why everyone knows about them. That is their job, among other things, and they are handsomely rewarded for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Khazar train switches after it goes through them and the Crown Corporation in the City of London. After that, they hand it off to the Swiss/Venetians in Switzerland. Switzerland is the home of the Knights Templar - Sovereign Military Order of Malta.

       I can't help but think all of this is a bit of a red herring. I'm not sure how their coat of arms indicates that they protect the papal treasure. Rothschild means "red shield," and beyond that I'm not seeing the connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, its possible. But I've done a lot of research on the topic as well and I've seen nothing to indicate that there are people higher up than the Rothschilds. They basically started the international banking cartel with Mayer Amschel Rothschild and his sons, and they still control it to this day as far as I can tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have anything that you would consider good evidence to support these theories?

       Three knights, with an animal symbol on each side shows that they are controlled by the families whose those symbols are representative of. The symbolism in coats of arms tells an amazing story, and truly is a fascinating topic. You should look more into it.

      <p>
       No, they didn't and no they don't. House of Medici created it along with the Knights Templar. Rothschild are great employees, that's for sure. The international banking system was well established and in place before the Rothschilds even existed (1760). We are talking about Rome and the Holy Roman Empire here, dude/dudette.

      <p>
       It appears you need to do a bit more research. You're falling into the gatekeeping trap set by others of, Rothschild this, Rothschild that! The pyramid goes far higher than them. Look into the families that the Rothschilds
       <em>
        married into
       </em>
       . Just because you marry into a family, does not mean you control the family. There is hierarchy well established there.

       So, you were told by some hack in the Orthodox Church that the Pope is running the show. And you fell for this?? Look. I know your game. You, and other Jewish kids on here are spewing this "the Vatican runs the world; not the Jews" because you want to make Gentiles believe that Jews are benevolent and obedient to some Pope. Well, have I got news for you!! No Jew I know is going to kiss some fucking, child-molesting Pope's ass!!

       No, and he wasn't a hack. The person is actually from Royalty/Nobility. The EOC and the Vatican are nothing more than the equivalence of Democrats and Republicans. Different side to the same coin.

       Anyways, I find it very odd how you admit to being Jewish, then run around here claiming Jews run the world, and yadda-yadda. It's almost like you are full of it, and just trying to push the whole Jew World Order, or something. It's getting pretty obvious, yo'. Either that, or you really are a self hating Jew, which many are, hence why they pull false hoax crimes and such (persecution complex). Bizarre people, the Jews are.

       I tell it like it is. You seem to have a problem with that. You think all Jews are from the same mold; the same cookie cutter. Well, I have news for you. Only brain-dead and brainwashed Jews act and think alike. There are many of us Jews who think and feel what we want to think and feel, and we don't need some momser dictating to us how to live.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the real world, if a non-Catholic talks shit about Catholics and hates the Pope it's no big deal. But, if a non-Jew talks shit about Jews/Zionism/Israel he is fucked. He is forever branded an "antisemite" and his career is finished. He is blacklisted and is viewed as the lowest living piece of shit that ever existed. So, Putin, do you see? Do you see what I'm getting at? In the real world, Gentiles (including Catholics like Steve Bannon and Joe Biden) suck Jew cock. They lick Jew balls. Jews, on the other hand, do not suck any Gentile's putz, nor do they kiss any Gentile's ass; especially the murdering, pedophile infested Vatican's ass. I go by example for what I see and observe; not some bullshit taken from " The Da Vinci Code ".

       I'm certain he's just a figurehead like you say. The people that are truly in control wouldn't be so public. I would guess that several levels of control exist above Mr. Soros, including secret societies like the Jesuits, and groups like the Olympians/Committee of 300. At the highest level is a malevolent artificial intelligence with its will being carried out through lesser entities that aren't human but appear that way and mimic human behavior. These are just my nutcase opinions though.

       Check out Gnosticism. They believed that Yaldabaoth was created in error, an accident of some kind. Supposedly a jealous "god" that created his own offspring, the "Archons", who in turn had their own offspring. I think this demi-god also created Yahweh, a holofractal supercomputer matrix, which is what see and experience all around us and is responsible for siphoning our emotional energies as sustenance for the Archon entities. There may have been a "real" original Earth that Yaldabaoth created, but that's not what we are inside of right now IMHO.

       The Rothschild are pretty high up, but there are families above them. The Rothschild are the Guardians of the Papal Treasure. They don't own it, they are knights protecting it (

       The Khazar train switches after it goes through them and the Crown Corporation in the City of London. After that, they hand it off to the Swiss/Venetians in Switzerland. Switzerland is the home of the Knights Templar - Sovereign Military Order of Malta.
