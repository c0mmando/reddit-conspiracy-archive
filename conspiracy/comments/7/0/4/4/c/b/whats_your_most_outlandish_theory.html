<p>Bullshit.  No offense, of course.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the time or ambition to get into hollow or expanding earth debates right now (have stuff to do), but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ubnt6/the_secret_of_the_world_hidden_in_plain_sight/">here</a> is a post I made about the expanding earth.  I think it&#39;s a simple, straightforward introduction to the idea.  From there, hollow Earth is only a hop skill and a jump away.  And yes, seismology can work exactly the same on a hollow earth model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice qualifiers :)</p>

<p>Do you think, that after 6 or 8 years of being indoctrinated (or failed) into current geological philosophies, that there will be many people who just show up, turn everything on its head, and get all of their tenured employers to agree?</p>

<p>Hardly.  Expecting fresh thinking, from literal indoctrination camps, is insane.  It&#39;s like asking a church pastor for information on &quot;heretical&quot; information.  These ideas are &quot;blasphemous&quot;, and violently opposed.</p>

<p>No, I need something that seems more legitimate than an article that literally admits it&#39;s <strong>&quot;accuracy is low&quot;</strong> and that <strong>&quot;we note that using space-geodetic data (GPS sites over the globe) Wu and his colleagues suggested that space-geodetic observation does not support the Earth expansion hypothesis&quot;</strong>.

If <em>you</em> had read the paper, you&#39;d see that all of the data they had pointed to expansion, but in their conclusion, they handwave it away.  Rationalizing.  Speculating.  They even had <em>specific</em> rates of expansion measured.

    <div class="md"><p>When you say &quot;there isn&#39;t any verified evidence&quot;, it&#39;s a...  wait for it...  &quot;Dogmatic Lie&quot;.  You refuse to see evidence because it doesn&#39;t fit into your...  wait again... &quot;Dogma&quot;.  You, like the author of the scientific paper I linked, absolutely <em>will not</em> see any evidence that conflicts with your church-approved...  here it is again...  &quot;Dogma&quot;.  Even when the evidence is right before your eyes.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting qualities of dogmatic mentalities, is that the believer is literally and figuratively blinded to any evidence contradicting their approved beliefs.  As in, <em>will not see it</em>.  It&#39;s like trying to convince a Bible thumper that his precious book is a Babylonian and Roman pseudo-fiction.  They just <em>can&#39;t</em> believe it.

<p>Again, you don&#39;t understand the basic geological concept of subduction ...</p>

<p>Furthermore, geological constraints on the Precambrian history of the Earth&#39;s rotation in relation to the Moon&#39;s orbit show no significant change in the radius of the Earth for over 600 million yeras ... so.</p>

<p>Earth expansion is so obvious, it&#39;s truly amazing that so many people have been brainwashed into thinking that the current plate tectonic theory is even plausible.  A simple picture of seafloor ages show which way the continents are moving.  But nope.  Let&#39;s invent &quot;subduction&quot; to explain away the plain and obvious truth.  The Earth is expanding from various faults around the world, mostly under oceans, and also the north American west coast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>World Wars I and II were fake.</p>

<p>Both sides were secretly being run by the same people -- with the same goal.</p>

<p>Over 100 million people died -- for a completely different reason than they thought.</p>

<p>Both sides fighting these wars -- Axis and Allies -- were owned and controlled by the same international bankers.</p>

<p>These world wars were used to plunder central banks and private holdings of their gold -- worldwide -- and turn them over to the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>The official number for all the gold ever dug out of the earth is 166,500 tons. This is a lie. The real amount is:</p>

<p>2,420,937.4 metric tons of gold.</p>

<p>The idea was that in order to stop war, we needed to collect all the gold in one place, and then use it collectively to better humanity. Of course, it was all a ruse.</p>

<p>The bankers who sold this idea to the ancient families and governments of the world gained access to what is now referred to as the Global Collateral Accounts. This is the source and true assets for all of the western central bank printing presses. This is why the IMF, World Bank, etc. are all powerful and can do almost anything they please.</p>

<p>Instead of spreading the wealth throughout the world, the hoarded it for themselves and used it to continue the wars, disease, and poverty.</p>

<p>This secretive group of nasty people are what most people refer to as the Illuminati. Many will argue that it is the Masons, or the Vatican, or the Rothschilds, or the Rockefellers, or the Bushes, or the Queen of England, blah blah blah.</p>

<p>The truth is, It&#39;s parts of all of them. In various levels of involvement and performing certain tasks they all collude together.</p>

<p>The common name now given to this collective is &quot;the Cabal&quot;.</p>

<p>They&#39;re aim is nothing short of complete world domination. The most current plan is to reduce the population of the planet to about 500 million people total. It will then be much easier to control things.</p>

<p>They&#39;re a thousand more details but I&#39;ll cut to the fun part.</p>

<p><strong>Most of you have heard this story in one form or another, but what you have not heard is this:</strong></p>

<p>There is another group, even more secret than the others, and they are about to flip the world over</p>

<p>You see, all along, some ancient secret society type folks, together with small bands of very well connected people, have been building a plan to stop them.</p>

<p>It is simply called The Plan.</p>

<p>Without revealing any details of the actions about to take place, here ore some of the results you can look forward to in the very near future.</p>

<p>First, get back control of the Global Collateral Accounts and cut off the funding powers of the Cabal.</p>

<p>Take down the bad guys. The list is millions long.</p>

<p>There is literally about 7 semi truck loads of evidence to convict these people. The &quot;good guys&quot; have been collecting it for a LONG time.</p>

<p>The Global Collateral Accounts will then be used to stop hunger and poverty, clean up the environment, provide homes for all, and create jobs for everyone.</p>

<p>At the same time, the hidden technologies will be released and developed. Free energy, replicators (or constructors), and incredible healing techs (think growing back of limbs).</p>

<p>The USA will move away from admiralty law to a system of common law, with much of the world following in our footsteps soon after. It&#39;s simple, no harm to people or property, and treat other like you want them to treat you.</p>

<p>The global financial system will be overhauled to be what is should have been all along. Real and transparent. All things will be based on actual assets. No more gambling with phoney FIAT crap. The good guys have already cut off access to the Accounts, this is the real reason for the global financial crisis.</p>

<p>Wars will no longer be tolerated by anyone, anywhere, for any reason.</p>

<p>And here&#39;s the best part</p>

<p>We&#39;re not alone, never have been, and this is where the rabbit hole really starts to get deep...</p>

<p>I like you. Shame you posted this in an &#39;outlandish&#39; thread. Anybody who seriously investigates WW1 and WWII will eventually come to the same conclusion. For me, it was a case of working back through the chronology:</p>

<p>Moon Landings pioneered by Werner von Braun.</p>

<p>The same guy was responsible for &#39;V2 rockets&#39; in WWII.</p>

<p>The footage of V2 rockets (and the &#39;damage&#39; they caused) is laughable.</p>

<p>Eventually I got to the point where the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad1iCYcdyiM">following video</a> makes more sense to me than 99% of what is posted on this sub.</p>

<p>Most people will probably never be psychologically ready for it, though. TV is an incredibly powerful tool.</p>

<p>Transgenderism is increasing because of industrial pollutants and chemicals that mimic female hormones. </p>

<p>Companies are so focused on transgender rights now because they don&#39;t want any investigation as to why it&#39;s occurring. If it&#39;s &quot;just the way someone is born&quot;, it reduces their responsibility and they won&#39;t have to deal with lawsuits and fines later. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s one for consideration:</p>

<p>I am a single consciousness and within my being are as many personalities and egos as there are currently in the world. The egos that reside inside me are the same as the egos outside of me. It is all one and the same being.</p>

<p>For every one thing, action or idea; there is an equal and opposite thing, action (reaction) or idea. The consciousness itself is the universe where all of this takes place. (Meaning the universe that is outside of my being, is of the same scope of what is within my being). What I think this may mean is that I am only one. Everyone outside of me is nothing more than another me that is equal to an ego or personality type that is within me (&quot;myself&quot; included). This leads me to believe that the suffering that happens in the world today is likely a result of my own mental imbalance. It seems to be that as I become older and more deteriorated (aging, bad habits, addiction), that the world outside of me is doing the exact same. That&#39;s not to say that there isn&#39;t hope for a  good future. New and fresh ideas are as common as newborns. The problem is ridding oneself of old ideas/ bad habits that are deteriorating oneself (and in effect, the universe/ world/ whatever the fuck void we live in).</p>

<p>As I begin to wake up to the atrocities (suffering, war, disease, poison), everyone else (good) seems to be as well. And as this happens, the old addictions and habits (bad) are fighting against it (only natural).</p>

<p>Consciousness and conscientiousness. We (I, human) have an innate sense of right/ wrong. It has been skewed by addiction and narcissus but it is still there. I (we) want to side with the good, but before that is possible we (I) must rid myself of disease (addiction, greed, selfishness) so that healing may take place. This cycle of healing/ deteriorating is constantly taking place all in one instant. Everything is taking place in one instant. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to sum it up in words but that&#39;s the jist of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The goal is a type I civilisation.</p>

<p>This civilisation will have to be unified to achieve it.  So either one religion or no religion.</p>

<p>Who will control this type one civilisation?  We&#39;re in the beggining stages of the battle for control.  The unknown faces of power are moving their pieces on the chess board and it is a century long game at least.</p>

<p>Once the battle is over the surviors ,now unified, will reap the rewards of all the hidden knowledge and technology being held back for the last 50 -100 years.  This knowledge and technology will then be used to complete the developement of the type one civilisation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you say &quot;there isn&#39;t any verified evidence&quot;, it&#39;s a...  wait for it...  &quot;Dogmatic Lie&quot;.  You refuse to see evidence because it doesn&#39;t fit into your...  wait again... &quot;Dogma&quot;.  You, like the author of the scientific paper I linked, absolutely <em>will not</em> see any evidence that conflicts with your church-approved...  here it is again...  &quot;Dogma&quot;.  Even when the evidence is right before your eyes.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting qualities of dogmatic mentalities, is that the believer is literally and figuratively blinded to any evidence contradicting their approved beliefs.  As in, <em>will not see it</em>.  It&#39;s like trying to convince a Bible thumper that his precious book is a Babylonian and Roman pseudo-fiction.  They just <em>can&#39;t</em> believe it.  Their programming won&#39;t allow it.</p>

<p>Please.  Go on, though.  At this point, I&#39;ve got the popcorn out, and am ready to see how long you&#39;ll go on about this.  I&#39;m mildly amused, thank you very much :)</p>
