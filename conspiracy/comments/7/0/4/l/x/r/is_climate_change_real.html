       So I've been a firm believer that climate change is real and man made for as long as I've known about the issue. It seems to make sense on the surface after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as I have delved into conspiracy theories such as Haarp and TPTB I've begun to question how much I really believe it. So I looked for an experiment that could prove it one way or another and there seems to be an abundance of simple experiments that prove the concept such as this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Ge0jhYDcazY">
        https://youtu.be/Ge0jhYDcazY
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's something that irks me with these experiments. None seem to pay much attention to how much CO2 they are pumping in and all use large levels of CO2 to cause an increase.
      </p>
      <p>
       The atmospheric CO2 level has allegedly gone from around 280 ppm (0.03%) to approx. 400 ppm (0.04%). Could a change in composition of the atmosphere of 0.01% really cause several degrees of warming?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/">
        https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone here have the resources and time to attempt this experiment but with better, more realistic control of how much change is made to the gas composition? I.e measure the level of CO2 and attempt the experiment at different levels. That way we could use the data to plot a graph and work out roughly what the effects of the addition of 0.01% CO2 would have to greenhouse effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: maths

       What proof is there that excessive C02 creates a "shield" that prevents warm temperatures from escaping the Earth's atmosphere? But, if the Earth is flat, and there is a dome covering the Earth, then you can bet your life that the gasses are trapped inside the Earth's atmosphere. The only reason the the world's leaders are pushing a global warming agenda is because they are going to charge the little guy a "carbon tax". They are not going to do away with global warming; they just want to tax the shit out of you.

       You have no idea what Venus is beyond the CGI pictures generate by some guy sitting in computer lab at Langley. Back to the Question why do we know the compound of life CO2, is somehow warming the earth, even though all life requires or produces it as form of respiration. It seems so absurd!

       All I see,  is that a bunch of bankers and politicians found a way to tax your breathing. oh your respiration will cost you dumbfucks because "climate change"

       Breathing, counts in a way. 7 billion people and if we didn't have plants and algae we'd be fucked. We'd inhale all the oxygen with nothing to convert it back to breathable 02 + nitrogen.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we're talking machines, not breathing. Ridiculous argument. Next thing you know you'll bring in volcanoes like those are man made.

       You are essentially claiming that small changes in atmospheric CO2 are more impactful than variation in the sun's activity, changes in earth's orbit and axial tilt, volcanism, reflectivity, the composition of other gasses in the atmosphere, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why are you so hung up on CO2? Especially considering that CO2 levels have been more than 5X higher in the past? Clearly, atmospheric CO2 levels also change naturally, but human's marginal contribution is going to destroy the earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       From the 1940s to the 1970s, Earth experienced a global cooling period, even while carbon-dioxide levels continuously rose. In the early 21st century, global temperature “paused” for 18 years, again during a period in which carbon-dioxide levels increased.

       You asked for proof. It might take a fuck ton of c02 but it can happen. It could happen if say, all vegetation on earth was lit on fire and converted from it's current form to c02-water-other elements it was composed of.
      </p>

       Such a thing could happen if there's no rain and lots of forest fires.

       When we talk man made, think about how many cars that is. There's 300 million people and just as many cars. All putting out a gas that otherwise wouldn't be there without the machine. Every city a power plant or 2. This is just America I'm thinking about too.

      <p>
       It's not that it creates a shield, it's that it mixes with the atmosphere as a whole, and the more CO2 is in there, the more heat it retains.

       The government is using climate change to distract people from other serious issues like the 9/11 inside job, flat Earth and using Trump to gain global domination. They could easily use the dome that surrounds flat Earth to release the harmful gasses, but they would much rather it pollute our minds so that we are weaker and easier to deceive. They have an antidote for this effect of weakness by the way. When the time is right they will stage a terror attack just like they did during 9/11 to get the go ahead from congress and support from the populace to launch the first nuclear strike, sending US and the world into nuclear warfare. Their goal is to come out on top of this Third World War and have control over every nation on the planet.

       There are a lot of ways to verify that the world is flat. If you go on a beach or a plane and look out as far as you can see with binoculars, you will notice that there is no curve to the Earth and that it is flat.

       While a few things you said I agree with, I don't believe space is CGI, and can you please disprove my previous comment on shadow angles from the sun? If you can then I'll be impressed. You say I'm regurgitating information I've gotten from school but some of these things are verifiable, and some of your theories are not. Do I care about the truth? Yeah I do that's why I'm debating you. Why don't you get a weather ballon and a camera without a fisheye lens and test some of these theories yourself? Probably because you're lazy and just like to annoy people with outlandish theories.

       I have tested my theories over lakes, I have flown expensive drones. I am working on the balloon launch.
 There is no curvature, no boats go over the curvature I proved that myself.

       Next - is NASA space work proof of anything in the question of shape of the earth? so far no.  As all images from them are obvious composites. All space footage seems to fish eye lenses too... I don't know it is so hard from them to come clean on their pictures, data and evidence if everything is round and we are there every floating humans in orbit?

       The please explain to me how shadows have different angles at the SAME time of day on different parts of the earth. If the wold was flat then all of earth would have the same angle shadow, which it doesn't. The only explanation for this is that the earth is curved. So suck on my scientific dick you mentally impaired contrarian.

       Firstly, I am sorry if I offended you in some way shape or form. I did not intend to. To answer your question, try putting a single light source in the center of a room at night. The angle of your shadow will change the farther away you get away from the light source. That experiment will demonstrate to you the effect of the sun over flat Earth and the different angles of shadows it makes, as your room is also flat.

       You didn't offend me. Also this little experiment doesn't take into account different objects having different angled shadows on other parts of the world. One place could have no shadow at noon, but at that same time in a different part of the world, there IS a shadow. You get what I'm saying?

       Climate generally refers to long-term weather conditions, beyond the length of the seasons. A place that is hot year-round has a 'hot climate', whereas a place that has hot summers and cold winters has a variable climate.

      <p>
       In the context of this thread, I directly answered OP's question "Is climate change real?". What is your concern?

       Right, and there is still no evidence that small changes in CO2 concentration is the primary driver of climate. In fact, its incredibly naive to think so. What makes you think that plays a greater role than the sun's activity, for example?

       I'm with you. I used to be a huge believer in anthropogenic climate change. It took me a while to finally think critically of it and really examine both sides of the debate. Now I think its incredibly naive to believe that CO2 is the primary driver in climate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you said, atmospheric CO2 has gone from approximately 0.0003% to 0.0004%, and its been more than 5 times higher in the past. So clearly it naturally fluctuates with time, and that didn't cause the world to end.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, if we indiscriminately pumped greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere for a millennia or more, we could probably start affecting the climate in detrimental ways. I just don't think we have done so yet.

       You're being misleading. Swings like this don't happen on the scale of decades. For some context, we are pumping out CO2 at 10x the rate it was being released when the Siberian traps (huge pits of magma) erupted through a fossil fuel field ~250 million years ago, burning huge quantities of coal and gas, causing a massive ocean acidification event and greenhouse gas spike that led to the worst mass extinction in earth's history. To repeat, CO2 emission caused that, and we are putting out CO2 an order of magnitude faster than it was put out during that event.

       My thoughts exactly. I don't doubt that CO2 causes a greenhouse effect, I just doubt that the level of relative increase thus far is enough to cause significant change to our climate. I think there are other factors at play here.

       I don't care if this sub gets down voted to hell. If people are still viewing it and still at least thinking about it then it's served it's purpose. I'm not advocating disbelieving that CO2 is causing climate change, I'm just advocating thinking critically about it and making up your own mind instead of assuming.

       Sadly it does appear as though the massive surge in Flat Earth videos on YouTube was part of an orchestrated plan. Was this aimed at, among other things, discrediting those who challenge official narratives (i.e. conspiracy theorists)? Possibly.

       Yea, I really don't like hating on FE or any other conspiracy theory because I appreciate thinking outside the box, no matter how absurd I find it to be. I enjoy entertaining a thought without accepting it, and I think its a shame when people immediately dismiss conspiracies right off the bat.

       That said, the only reason I do hate on FE is because of the reasons we mentioned above. It really does seem like a tactic they are using to discredit conspiracy theorists.

       As for heliocentrism, I admit it sounds absurd to question it off the bat but I'll give the video a watch later when I have the chance.

       I'm just asking whether we could prove that 0.0001% is enough to cause the changes we are seeing through experiment. I don't agree with believing something blindly. I don't doubt that CO2 levels change the climate but from the videos of experiments they are all ELI5. I want to see something a bit more scientific in approach.

         An experiment similar to the one in the video linked but actually puts some control on how much CO2 is being added and takes several reference points so the data can be used to ascertain a trend. You know, the scientific method.

       Is it really what aboutism? You say that you're concerned about seeing real, scientific results, but 99% of actual scientific work is being done by the people who say climate change is real, and the people who deny it are doing practically none, they aren't being asked to, and they don't seem to feel a need to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't you post another thread asking for predictive climate models from deniers, for instance?

       that's the example I used but pretty much all of them on YouTube are the same style.
      </p>
      <p>
       What bothers me is that the articles being written by these scientists are not readily available to the public and almost nobody has actually looked at the data. I find it hard to believe that you have looked at the original articles let alone the datasets they are driven by.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't trust what is written online just because something states all the scientists say so or they have a graph. I want to be able to verify it myself. The video I've linked does that to a certain degree but my problem is it puts no controls on the parameter in question. I'd be convinced if I could see proof that by adding, say 1% CO2 you get an increase in temp, however negligeable. I'm advocating critical thought essentially.

       Yeah I watched that one too but again he doesn't actually put any control measures in for CO2. Which is exactly what he's supposed to be testing. He just Chuck's a bunch of CO2 tabs into one bottle. How much CO2 is in that bottle relative to the other? That's my question.

       The reality is far more complex, we are pumping aerosols of various types, methane, and other gases into the atmosphere in addition to CO2. How they all interact with the upper atmosphere to create and destroy ozone is a complex process. To me its unlikely that the changes we are experiencing is all from man made emissions. I think there are solar changes that are occuring that are also causing the changes. Evidence for this is the fact that the other planets are also experiencing warming.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a number of explanations I have come across for why the solar activity has been changing the past few decades. I will list 3 of the main ones that I find most likely:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Xavier Borg has done interesting theoretical work describing how Earth's velocity relative to the cosmic microwave background rest frame could be causing the fluctuations that we measure for the strength of gravity (G).
       <a href="http://blazelabs.com/f-u-massvariation.asp">
        See here for details
       </a>
       . This means that our velocity relative to the universal center reference frame is always changing since we are traveling in a helical pattern throughout the cosmos. We rotate around the sun at 1 year per revolution, but then we rotate around the galaxy at 1 revolution every ~230 million years. It seems likely this is related to our ice ages. It seems unlikely that the galactic revolution could be causing the changes we see now (they would be over a much longer time scale in the millions of years range), but it is possible that we are rotating around our local star cluster and that could cause a cycle that is in the tens of thousands of years time frame. Within our current ice age the interglacial period has been on 40,000 - 100,000 year cycles. I'm not sure if this could be related, but it seems possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Along the lines of rotation around our local star cluster, there is the supposed "Planet X" or "Nibiru" that is talked about in Sumerian texts. This planet supposedly has a 3600 year orbit around the sun, and it is a very elongated elliptical orbit in which most of its orbital period it is far from the Earth. However, as it gets closer it will be interacting magnetically with the sun, creating changes in solar activity. Its possible that this body is moving closer to the solar system. However, famous writers such as Sitchin claim it will arrive around 2160, so if that is true it shouldn't be affecting things that much.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) We are entering into a denser region of the interstellar region. In other words, our solar system is entering into some cloud, perhaps from supernova remnants. I'm not sure about this theory, its being pushed by David Wilcock and Corey Goode so take of it what you will. Wilcock has done extensive research on these things and so his opinion is certainly interesting; im just not sure if these people are being fed disinfo.
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion is that there is something outside of the Earth's system causing much of the warming; although it is possible that some is coming from carbon emissions. There is no doubt that our pollution of the Earth's biosystems with hydrocarbons is extremely destructive to most lifeforms on the planet; however the extent to which it is causing the climate changes we have witnessed is far from clear as is touted in the mainstream media. I worked in a climate lab for a few years so I am familiar with the complications involved in predicting these things. We simply do not know the details on many of the minor chemical pathways and we tend to neglect feedback loops formed between biological life (ie trees and algae) and our actions, so the results that are often shown could be way off in either direction.

       You are essentially claiming that small changes in atmospheric CO2 are more impactful than variation in the sun's activity, changes in earth's orbit and axial tilt, volcanism, reflectivity, the composition of other gasses in the atmosphere, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why are you so hung up on CO2? Especially considering that CO2 levels have been more than 5X higher in the past? Clearly, atmospheric CO2 levels also change naturally, but human's marginal contribution is going to destroy the earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       From the 1940s to the 1970s, Earth experienced a global cooling period, even while carbon-dioxide levels continuously rose. In the early 21st century, global temperature “paused” for 18 years, again during a period in which carbon-dioxide levels increased.

       While a few things you said I agree with, I don't believe space is CGI, and can you please disprove my previous comment on shadow angles from the sun? If you can then I'll be impressed. You say I'm regurgitating information I've gotten from school but some of these things are verifiable, and some of your theories are not. Do I care about the truth? Yeah I do that's why I'm debating you. Why don't you get a weather ballon and a camera without a fisheye lens and test some of these theories yourself? Probably because you're lazy and just like to annoy people with outlandish theories.

       Yea, I really don't like hating on FE or any other conspiracy theory because I appreciate thinking outside the box, no matter how absurd I find it to be. I enjoy entertaining a thought without accepting it, and I think its a shame when people immediately dismiss conspiracies right off the bat.
      </p>

       That said, the only reason I do hate on FE is because of the reasons we mentioned above. It really does seem like a tactic they are using to discredit conspiracy theorists.

       As for heliocentrism, I admit it sounds absurd to question it off the bat but I'll give the video a watch later when I have the chance.
