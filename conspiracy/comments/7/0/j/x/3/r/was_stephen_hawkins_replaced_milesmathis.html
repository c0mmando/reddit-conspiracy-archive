        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think it&#39;s possible that people have been <em>replaced</em>, either with &#39;doubles&#39; or maybe clones. This question has been asked before, pertaining to: Hawkins, Kanye &amp; Chappell. Hawkins is a good example.</p>

<p>The only reason to &quot;replace&quot; someone would be because of money (that the person generates) or because they&#39;re considered <em>relevant</em> to tptb.</p>

<p>&quot;First published April 17, 2015</p>

<p>I have written several papers critiquing Stephen Hawking, including a long one on his Brave New World series for the BBC. But this is my first paper really linking my science research with my faked events research. I will use simple photo analysis and facial analysis to quickly show you the current Stephen Hawking is not the same person as the original Stephen Hawking.</p>

<p>This should not surprise you too much, especially if you know something about ALS. ALS is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig&#39;s Disease. We are told Hawking has had ALS for over 52 years, which is a record by many decades. Jason Becker is the only person I have heard of who has lived more than 20 years with the disease, so there is about a three-decade difference between the longest survivor and the second longest survivor. That is a more than 100% difference between first and second place. It would be like Justin Gatlin running the 100 meters in 9.8 seconds, and Usain Bolt beating him with a time of 4.5 seconds. In other words, statistically it doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>The average survival time for ALS is four years. When Hawking was first diagnosed in 1963, doctors gave him two years to live. And yet here we are, 52 years later and counting. Should you believe it? Well, no. Like Becker, it appears the real Hawking did beat the odds and live for about 20 years. But at some point he was replaced. I have no proof he died, but I assume that is why they replaced him. He was a very useful public relations entity for physics, and they didn&#39;t want to lose him.</p>

<p>But rather than speculate on that, let us go right to the evidence. I won&#39;t call it proof, since of course you are free to disagree with me. This is an opinion piece, not a court transcript; and even if it were a stamped court finding, you would be free to disagree with it. You don&#39;t have to agree with anything anyone tells you, ever. Remember that. This paper is nothing more than presented evidence, evidence I find compelling. If you also find it compelling, fine. If you don&#39;t, also fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah respiratory failure is the likely cause of death. Malnutrition is a problem but like you said IV takes care of that. What matters most is age of onset. There are 4 main different strains of ALS. The quick killing 3 happen mostly past 50. Meanwhile Juvenile onset is the slowest progressing and has the longest lifespan prediction. So the death percentage for all varients is a bit skewed. Most of the 5% that live over 20 years with ALS are juvenile onset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want you to know that I say this sincerely and from the bottom of my heart. That was the most idiotic attempt at an analogy that you could have possibly presented. Not shockingly, it does <em>less</em> to further your argument and reaffirms the belief among almost every rational human being reading this that you are <em>somehow and someway</em> as utterly fucking stupid as you appear to be. I had previously considered that impossible. I fully realize that simply calling you out for your world class stupidity will only reinforce your beliefs and embolden you in the future but I just can&#39;t help but let you know that people more intelligent than yourself, that being almost everyone, consider you the punchline to a very depressing joke.

    <div class="md"><p>If you study statistics in depth, or any of its related fields (e.g. epidemiology), you will see that the concept of <em>bias</em> is given a lot of attention, i.e. how data sources represent or mis-represent the true nature of the system being studied.

<p>Point being that the discipline itself entails a great many concepts that are useful for parsing the world.  Yes, math is boring, but if you go deeper than the math, there&#39;s some gold there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The evidence in this paper is overwhelming. It is clear to anyone with eyes to see and a brain to think with that Hawking was replaced by a look-alike who doesn&#39;t really even look that much like him. For me the important takeaway of this paper is that all the scientists who knew him personally before this happened have to be in on it, since they would see it&#39;s not him. This shows that academic science (or physics at least) is tightly controlled at the highest levels and scientists actively involved in misdirection and public hoaxes. And the fact that this switch has never been noticed or reported on by any newspaper or media outlet anywhere is yet another indication of just how controlled the media is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t have anything to do with plausibility or how long he&#39;s had ALS. You can look at the pictures of Stephen Hawking in the paper and clearly see that these are two different people. The evidence is literally staring you in the face, and to deny it one would have to be either blind, stupid or hired to do so. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t know if his look-alike really has ALS or is just pretending. He could also have some other ailment that resembles ALS in certain ways. You will see that in some of the pictures in the paper, the Hawking replacement&#39;s real hands are hidden and instead we see what are obviously plastic or rubber hands sitting on his lap. Perhaps the replacement had tremors in his real hands, so they had to hide them. I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>Again, the fact that this is the case has nothing to do with plausibility. It&#39;s as plain as the nose on my face. This being true, then it follows that at least his family, friends, and others who have known or worked with the original Hawking closely and in person know what has happened and have remained silent. That includes any news source. I don&#39;t know that anyone who had ever seen him in the past would recognize him is a different person, since people are often not good at recognizing others or don&#39;t pay close attention. </p>

<p>As difficult as that is to accept, it is the natural conclusion in light of the evidence. </p>

<p>I will add one other point: we are often sold biographies of people that have turned out to be more or less fabricated either in part or in whole. And as much as we&#39;re told a history of Stephen Hawking, we don&#39;t really know how much of it is true, do we? What if his bio is more or less a sham? In that case, there won&#39;t be very many, if any, genuine people who knew him, other than those hired or paid or cajoled into saying that they did. And yes, that includes some big names in science. And of course the press. But that already narrows down the number of people who would have come in contact with Hawking version 1.0.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, sorry. You obviously didn&#39;t read the paper or you are misdirecting on purpose. It&#39;s not about ageing. In fact he looks a lot younger as he gets younger. The shape of his face changes. He went from having grounded-down teeth in the early 80s to having four huge ugly-looking teeth later on. If he was going to have dentures, fine, but those teeth aren&#39;t dentures. Did he just grow them spontaneously.

<p>By the way, Hawking wasn&#39;t very famous back in the early 80s. His face wasn&#39;t plastered all over TV. So it&#39;s not very surprising that they&#39;ve been able to fool just about everyone, since very few people were very familiar with what the old Hawking looked like, so the substitution wasn&#39;t very tricky. As I said above, the switch does implicate high-level physicists who knew Hawking personally and the media. But they never had to be fooled. They&#39;re in on the con. </p>

<p>Huh, you&#39;re (sic) think the thousands of scientists and engineers that have studied the collapse would have pointed this out by now</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have been pointing it out. You clearly haven&#39;t heard of <a href="http://www.ae911truth.org/about.html">the nearly 3,000</a> (and counting) architects and engineers who have signed a petition for a new Congressional inquiry into 9/11, because they have examined the evidence came to the conclusion that the towers were not brought down the way we were told. They&#39;re not the only scientists who have spoken out about it.</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s the project by the civil engineering department at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The preliminary report was just released 2 weeks ago.</p>

<p>Link to University&#39;s project summary: <a href="http://ine.uaf.edu/projects/wtc7/">http://ine.uaf.edu/projects/wtc7/</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The research team studied the building’s response using two finite element programs, ABAQUS and SAP2000 version 18. At the micro level, three types of evaluations were performed. In plan-view, the research team evaluated: 1) the planar response of the structural elements to the fire(s) using wire elements; 2) the building’s response using the NIST’s approach with solid elements; and 3) the validity of NIST’s findings using solid elements. At the macro-level, progressive collapse, i.e., the structural system’s response to local failures, is being studied using SAP2000 with wire elements, as well as with ABAQUS, and it is near completion. <strong>The findings thus far are that fire did not bring down this building. Building failure simulations show that, to match observation, the entire inner core of this building failed nearly simultaneously.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The part highlighted in bold contradicts the findings of NIST, which is the government scientific body charged with studying the collapse of WTC 7, which was not hit by planes that day but nevertheless suffered a total collapse at free fall speed. We might be able to figure out what they did wrong or at least why their results differ from this newer one, but they won&#39;t release their methodology. So <em>very</em> scientific. </p>

<p>Do you ever think before opening your mouth, or is everything you say just mental diarrhea? You are very clearly suffering from a delusion that you think you know how the world works. But guess what? You don&#39;t need to seek help. You can simply help yourself by taking your head out of your ass. </p>

<p>Not a single one of them has provided any sort of definitive proof supporting their beliefs. If you read the bios of the people that started the group you can see they all basically just fell for the bogus conspiracy propaganda.</p>

<p>You mean the one that is backed by the same group of &quot;truthers&quot; and hasn&#39;t been subjected to peer review? You&#39;re surprised I don&#39;t consider that a valid source? Why don&#39;t you tell me in your own words why the UAF report is more convincing than the NIST report? </p>

<p>You are living in your own little bubble where you already know the answers and only listen to new things that confirm your bias. You need to seek help before you fall farther into your paranoid personality disorder</p>

<p>What exactly are you saying is missing from these reports? They build their findings through peer review. They brought in outside experts from every related field. They held public meetings and opened each report to comments before it was released. I don&#39;t know what else you want</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what? I&#39;m really enjoying this. I could go back-and-forth like this forever. Every time you respond to my comment you find new ways to show how ignorant, ill-informed, naive, and credulous you are. I have to imagine that every time you press the save button to send another missive, you smile and congratulate yourself, believing that you&#39;ve landed a punch or made a good point, while being completely and astonishingly unaware that with every response you only make yourself look more ridiculous, undercut yourself further and dig yourself in deeper. Your complete and utter lack of self-awareness about just how stupid you are, how unable you are to mount an argument or lay down a proper insult is really quite hilarious. </p>

<p>Have you ever taken a good, long look in the mirror? Or do you prefer to take a brief glance to check your hair and then quickly look away, embarrassed and disgusted at the site of your own craven, venal, worthless existence? Oh wait, I forgot, you&#39;re completely unaware of how pathetic you are. But you do have one redeeming quality: you are very entertaining. Sort of like a walking embodiment of fail army videos. As much as I&#39;m enjoying this, I have allowed you to waste far too much of my precious time. So this is my final response to you. After this I will not engage with you further, no matter what you write. </p>

<p>Anyway, back to the matter at hand: how is it that we are having a discussion about WTC 7 and you send me links to NIST&#39;s reports on WTC 1 and 2? It&#39;s a non sequitur. NIST&#39;s failure to release key features of its computer model and other important details of its analysis of <strong>WTC 7&#39;s collapse</strong> is well known. Here is a copy of their response to a FOIA request for the information: <a href="http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf">http://cryptome.org/nist070709.pdf</a></p>

<p>Here is a 30 minute documentary featuring Peter Ketcham and is the best overview of the NIST fraud controversy: <a href="https://youtu.be/GvAv-114bwM">https://youtu.be/GvAv-114bwM</a></p>

<p>Mr. Ketcham was a member of NIST&#39;s High Performance Systems and Services Division. A few years later he was moved into the Mathematical and Computational Sciences Division. He was the chair of NIST&#39;s Applied Mathematic Seminar Series and hosted it for several years. He is on record as saying that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If NIST truly believes in the veracity of its WTC investigation, then it should openly share all evidence, data, models, computations, and other relevant information unless specific and compelling reasons are otherwise provided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are videos of some of the experts involved in backing the University of Alaska Fairbanks study:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/v9WB1A9j8f8">David Topete, MSCE, S.E., Structural Engineer</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Topete discusses how WTC Building 7&#39;s column 79&#39;s failure could not have caused the symmetrical and simultaneous global collapse at free fall acceleration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/3WCcSHpvAJ8">Kamal Obeid, C.E., S.E. – Civil/Structural Engineer</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Obeid, a 30-year structural engineer explains how NIST&#39;s analysis actually disproves it&#39;s own theories on how WTC Building 7 collapsed, thereby confirming the use of controlled demolition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5IgqJXyLbg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=14s">Tom Sullivan - Former Explosives Loader for Controlled Demolition, Inc.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tom discusses the complex process of preparing a building for controlled demolition and explains the reasons why WTC Building 7 was a textbook controlled demolition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJy7lhVK2xE">WTC Chief Electrical Design Engineer, Richard Huemenn P.E.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;An international commission should be formed to look at this in an unbiased manner.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And finally, <a href="http://www.europhysicsnews.org/articles/epn/pdf/2016/04/epn2016474p21.pdf">a link to an article in Euro Physics News</a> dissecting the NIST fraud. </p>

<p>Now please, go find someone else to entertain.</p>

<p>What? No. This is so wrong. Even if you don&#39;t believe red shift is caused by the Doppler effect (which it is), light is absolutely affected by a Doppler shift. The Doppler effect is how police speed detectors work and how radar determines the velocity of objects.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This question is actually nonsense. There is no &quot;time&quot; to get a spectrum. It&#39;s not like you count to 10 and have a full spectrum, but if you only count to 5 you get half a spectrum. The detector is able to get any wavelength in its range and count it. You could get a photon corresponding to every possible wavelength in the visible light spectrum all at once, or none at all. The ONLY way time plays into it is to get better counting statstics (i.e. 1 photon vs 100 or 10,000).</p>

<p>Thats true...but they do work on the doppler effect....Which you claimed up above does not work in light. Police detectors are only using a single wavelength because more isnt really necessary, but they still work on doppler.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen up chump, because you in fact do not know what you are talking about.</p>

<p>You do not know how a radar gun works, and you do not know how to take atomic spectra.</p>

<p>A radar gun works by sending and receiving a packet light and measuring the time between sending and receiving the reflection back against the vibrations of a high frequency time keeping device. This data can be plotted on a graph, and the speed calculation can be done by measuring the number of vibrations of a high frequency count between the sent and received instances.</p>

<p>Red Shifting of spectrum is the observation of absorption lines in the reading of a spectrum of atomic substance measured against the same absorption lines of the same atomic substance here on Earth. It is this &quot;shift&quot; in the spectrum that is used by creationist con-artists to create the myth of expansion and big bang.</p>

<p>The two phenomenon are NOTHING alike and only a completely lobotomized retard would believe that they are.</p>

<p>If you were going to make a measurement of spectrum as a function of time, you would need multiple spectral images with which to determine any change in the red-shifting variable &quot;z&quot;. <em>Do Radar Guns work by taking multiple spectrum and then measuring Δz</em>? They most certainly <strong>do not</strong>.</p>

<p>The Doppler Effect as measured on Radar Guns is a completely computer created artificial construct. The &quot;Light&quot; is not experiencing any doppler effect whatsoever. It is the &quot;wave&quot; that is being generated as a time-based variable, by the onboard computer that is doppler shifted. Doppler shift is a time-dependent phenomenon, it isn&#39;t the &quot;Light&quot; that is experiencing the doppler effect, it is the &quot;graph of the light&quot; that you are creating.</p>

<p>This is simple graphing of data points of a coordinate system. There is no doppler effect occurring, whoever told you that was a second-rate teacher relying on a false analogy.</p>

<p>The radar gun IS NOT taking the spectrum. It isn&#39;t taking multiple images of the spectrum to compare an initial vs a final state of the spectrum. Therefore, it can not be compared to a device measuring Δz as <strong>YOU</strong> most certainly tried to claim.</p>

<p>Its amazing that someone who thinks himself so smart can be so dumb as to be fooled by such creationist garbage.</p>

<p>Light is a quantized event. Unlike the Doppler Phenomenon which is <em>not</em> an event but rather... a <em>series</em> of events. Light is not the manifestation of multiple events throughout time. Your monitor, like all light emitting phenomenon emits light in a binary fashion, the light emitter is either emitting light or it isn&#39;t. Light is a quantized phenomenon.</p>

<p>The interstellar medium is akin to a giant charge electron -- it is the electron plasma of the interstellar medium that creates the redshifting of spectral lines as any scientist worth their salt knows. And only &quot;public&quot; #fakescience retarded followers of creationist phonies would ever say otherwise.</p>

<p>No. It sends out a specific frequency, and determines the speed based on the change in reflected frequency. Don&#39;t believe me? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_gun">Look at the wikipedia page for a radar gun.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A radar speed gun is a Doppler radar unit that may be hand-held, vehicle-mounted or static. It measures the speed of the objects at which it is pointed by detecting a change in frequency of the returned radar signal caused by the Doppler effect, whereby the frequency of the returned signal is increased in proportion to the object&#39;s speed of approach if the object is approaching, and lowered if the object is receding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The whole point of the doppler effect is that an object moving away returns a higher frequency if the object is moving towards you and a lower frequency if the object is moving away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Red Shifting of spectrum is the observation of absorption lines in the reading of a spectrum of atomic substance measured against the same absorption lines of the same atomic substance here on Earth.

The two phenomenon are NOTHING alike and only a completely lobotomized retard would believe that they are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except that the reason for the shift in absorption lines is because all of the light you are detecting from said galaxy is at a lower wavelength due to it moving away (the doppler effect!)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Light is a quantized event.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but as EVERY physicist knows, light is both a particle and a wave. The doppler effect works on that wavelength.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the Doppler Phenomenon which is not an event but rather... a series of events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, the doppler effect happens when a photon is reflected. The actual wavelength of the photon is changed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it is the electron plasma of the interstellar medium that creates the redshifting of spectral lines as any scientist worth their salt knows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funny, every astronomer I know (which is quite a few) would say that is completely wrong. But finally to my favorite part:</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no point in conversing with someone who has built their understanding of physics on false axioms and it no doubt that you try to save face and run upon mentioning Dr. Ari Brynjolfsson.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite simple, a wave is a time dependent phenomenon created via a temporal continuum. It doesn&#39;t take 10 seconds or any time at all to record a spectral image of celestial atomic spectra. Therefore, a temporal phenomenon can not be compared to a single discrete unit of time. </p>

<p>Your interpretation of every phenomenon has been grossly incorrect. Light is emitted in discrete temporal packets dependent upon the discrete light emitting units and each light emission carries its own discrete spectral dataset. </p>

<p>The axiom that you have created makes dataset z-final dependent on the spectral dataset z-initial. This is ludicrous and does not in any way reflect reality. The Spectral Dataset of a discrete light emission from t=5 is in no way connected to the discrete photon emission of t=0. Light is emitted at the high vibrational emission rate of the emitting object, one could say that a light bulb vibrates a million times per second and that thousand photonics plane waves radiate from the emitter, however, each discrete photon plane wave packet contains the unique spectrum from the moment of emission. The attempted to tie one spectral data set at one point of emission to another spectral dataset at another moment would imply the Analog Emission of Light - which is ridiculous because all light emission is digital and dependent upon the vibrational frequency of the emitter.</p>

<p>Quit thinking that you know - you don&#39;t know. You are being schooled and are simply too proud to recognize the faults in your eduction - the only thing you should learn - is that you must unlearn the garbage you have learned.</p>

<p>Simulation conjures up images of experimentation, trial and error, non-playable characters and generally just feelings of meaninglessness, when the truth is the very opposite.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, once you&#39;ve read enough of Mathis&#39;s stuff, you come to the realization that all social movements of any degree of notoriety or influence are almost certainly controlled. I also wrote a few papers he published, including ones exposing <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/fakir.pdf">Gandhi</a> and <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/butler2.pdf">Smedley Butler</a> as controlled opposition. </p>

<p>But in the case of BDS specifically, see <a href="https://cuttingthroughthefog.com/2017/08/10/was-the-mavi-marmara-incident-a-hoax/">my blog post here on the Mavi Marmara incident</a> of 2010. I analyze two sets of footage of the raid: the IDF footage and the BDS footage. I show in what I think is an incontrovertible way that they are not footage of the same event: either one of them is fake or they both are. </p>

<p>And yet, back when the event happened, there was (IIRC) only controversy over the details of the event. When the BDS footage came out, the BDS people never said: &quot;you see, the IDF totally faked their footage of the event.&quot; No, what you had were two competing narratives of &quot;who attacked who first.&quot; And each of those narratives were supported by the two sides (and the footage they were showing). But neither side ever stepped forward and called the other one out on showing fake footage. </p>

<p>So that&#39;s a huge clue that BDS is controlled opposition. Otherwise they would have been jumping up and down shouting about the IDF&#39;s fake footage. I offer other evidence there that BDS is controlled, including the participation of Ken O&#39;Keefe and Haneen Zoabi. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>my burning question with this cloning shit is &#39;Why?&#39; - why replace hawkins? What is the objective behind it and surely that is a lot of effort to go to if the plan is to use him as a means of disseminating dissinfo/missinfo, etc? </p>

<p>Likewise for other celebs ive heard cloning, who the fuck would waste this incredible technology on celebrities? I guess the obvious reason is pushing influence.. though some of the claims i&#39;ve heard, read, etc, are just absurd. Like Nicki Minaj? Seriously? Eminem? :/ </p>

<p>Whilst i&#39;m not doubting the possibility that cloning could exist, i&#39;m interested to know what you honestly think the purpose of it, especially in Hawkins instance is? </p>

If he was replaced then the perpetrators would have just found some random incapable guy who looks like hawking and maybe done some surgery to make him look like the real hawking. The reason I could think that someone would do it specifically for hawking is because he is mute. He would be really easy to control and he has influence in the science community, although probably not that much with real scientists, as well as influence with the public. Even if he is still alive it is almost impossible to actually verify anything that he says as we do not actually know if it&#39;s him or a puppet master talking due to his lack of communication abilities.  For all we know he could be a vegetable sitting in a chair. He really seems to be well liked and trusted by the public, and people seem to take him seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read the linked article, you would know that Hawking was not replaced by a clone. He was replaced by someone who looks somewhat roughly similar, though the differences between them are immediately apparent. So there is no evidence here of cloning technology. </p>

<p>As to why they would replace him with a look-alike, here is what it says in the paper: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But why? Well, we have seen all sorts of weirdness afoot in physics and other science since then [1985]. I haven&#39;t made up this weirdness, you
know, I just circle it and comment on it. See my paper on Hawking&#39;s Brave New World, if you haven&#39;t
already. See my paper on Yuri Milner and the Fundamental Physics Prize. See my paper on the Higgs
Boson announcement, which I show was faked from the ground up. See my paper on Alan Guth and
the faked gravity wave research and promotion which preceded his 2014 Kavli Prize. Well, the reason
for all this weirdness is the reason for all the other weirdnesses in the Modern world: money. Physics
has become a giant cash cow, milked straight from the various national treasuries by the usual suspects.
Hundreds of billions of dollars are siphoned from the people of Europe, China, Russia, and the
Americas via these fake programs. And Hawking was an important PR personality in the early 1980&#39;s,
one they didn&#39;t want to lose. He was a top salesman of their various boondoggles, and he became an
even better salesman once he was replaced by an impostor. Once he was replaced, his puppeteers had
complete control over the product they were creating, with no fear that the real Hawking might develop
scruples.</p>

<p>Remember, this is exactly what they did in art in the 20th century. They got rid of all the real artists and
replaced them with impostors. The scheme was slightly different, in that they didn&#39;t replace Rodin and
Monet and Whistler with look-alikes in 1900. Instead, they just replaced the entire field with their
own manufactured mannequins over a generation or two. But the Modern artists have been impostors
one way or the other. They certainly aren&#39;t artists by the old definitions, since they can&#39;t create anything
beautiful or interesting. They are just PR personalities, the faces that front the fakery.</p>

<p>In the very same way, physics has been taken over. Just as the Modern artists are incapable of real art,
the Modern physicists are incapable of real physics. So instead they manufacture some huge pile of
equations that seems (to some gullible people) to resemble physics or math, and then sell it to Congress
or Parliament as cutting-edge. The important thing is not that any physics or art gets done, but that
money flows from the treasury. It is all a colossal scam, of earth-shattering proportions. And I mean
that literally. All the societies of this Earth are being shattered by this rampant fakery. They are
coming apart at the seams. Not only are they being milked dry of all revenues—revenues that could
and should be going to real programs—but they are being milked dry of all inspiration, all creativity, all
good will, and all belief in humanity. Human potential is shriveling up like a spider on a hot sidewalk
under a magnifying glass, and these rich families are the magnifying glass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thoughts.
We know the wealthy and talented are afforded medical allowances that are beyond the financial grasp of us commoners.
People have successfully cured cancer and AIDS.
Is it impossible that his intellect and prowess in physics afforded him the respect and compassion of many followers and fans.
If people can crowd fund the most inane ideas, why couldn&#39;t Hawking have been kept alive by state of the art practices?
Do NOT forget that the vested interest of most Western medicine is a blind treatment approach. They take money indefinitely by keeping people coming in for treatments, and killer disease and disability keep population down ever so slightly.
This is the kind of rationale that tptb would likely adhere to.
But hey, now I&#39;ll click your link and see what we have :)
Cheers! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The evidence in this paper is overwhelming. It is clear to anyone with eyes to see and a brain to think with that Hawking was replaced by a look-alike who doesn&#39;t really even look that much like him. For me the important takeaway of this paper is that all the scientists who knew him personally before this happened have to be in on it, since they would see it&#39;s not him. This shows that academic science (or physics at least) is tightly controlled at the highest levels and scientists actively involved in misdirection and public hoaxes. And the fact that this switch has never been noticed or reported on by any newspaper or media outlet anywhere is yet another indication of just how controlled the media is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I say the universe is a hologram, I don&#39;t necessarily mean that it&#39;s a simulation. To me, the idea of the cosmos being a &quot;simulation&quot; like a video game is just another avenue through which existential nihilism and moral relativism is being injected into our collective societies.</p>

<p>Simulation conjures up images of experimentation, trial and error, non-playable characters and generally just feelings of meaninglessness, when the truth is the very opposite. Everything means something, and in fact everything means everything. That&#39;s what I mean by holographic. Every electron carries with it information about every other electron in the universe. </p>

<p>Everything is real and here and happening right now, and we can interact with it. Free will is not a given but a choice. Very few people actually utilize theirs on a regular basis. </p>

<p>That, to me is the crux of the grand conspiracy. Some people want everyone to start using their free will for the best outcomes all things considered, while others want only free will for themselves so they can have the best outcome for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice catch with the &quot;Hawk King&quot; reference. </p>

<p>Names are important. I am convinced the only reason Miley Cyrus was propped up by the powers that be is because of her name. It is how they manipulate our conscious reality. She is named after an Annunaki god. By making her an idol the powers that be ensure the old gods are still worshiped by modern society.</p>

<p>When the woke community has not caught wind to this trick yet.</p>

<p>Seth Rich (Egyptian god)
Ammon Bundy (Egyptian god)
Apep/Kek/Pepe (Egyptian god)</p>

<p>Hello controlled opposition. Every time people say their names they are giving their power away.</p>
