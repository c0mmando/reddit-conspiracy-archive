       It's ironic because their inability to socialize without spazzing out the first time someone disagrees with them is exemplified right there and yet they don't even realize it.

       I think you are just experiencing something I call "Internet". Someone will always be butt hurt about anything and everything. Being a science fiction fan I can't wait for he future technologies. There is a series I read by Alastair Reynolds, Blue Remembered Earth, that had a beautiful portrayal of advanced technologies. People had cybernetic implants that let them go full VR into another persons field of vision. Imagine the implications. A long distant couple could have dinne with each other, a dad on an oil rig or a trucker could help his kid with homework.
      </p>

       There are definitely perils, but used correctly technology can help bring people together.

       I do. My family migrated(legally mind you) from Poland to the US two decades ago. Thanks to Skype, my family Christmas(and other various holidays and birthdays) are shared across the world. When my Mother goes to Poland due to a emergency with one of my grandparents we would constantly skype and share moments.

       Being prior military, doing an overseas tour email starts being extremely important. You wake up each day going to work early to sneak on a computer to check your email. Not so much new technology but opening packages was a team experience. We even had a guy get a blow up sheep.

       You connect with your family across the world. That is cool. But how has social media made your average high school kid more social? And no, sitting on facebook talking with 200 other facebook accounts doesn't count. It's not even close to face-to-face encounters.

       Isn't it still socializing? One of my Navy friends and I live across the US. Under normal circumstances our friendship would fade. Instead we boot up Skype and play some games together once in a while. It's helped me maintain friendships.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, facebook is great for making events that include non core friends. I used it a month ago to set up some tranpoline dodgeba fun with people outside my main friend circle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, my local chess club I'm part of uses facebook to coordinate our weekly rapid tournament and spread word of larger chess tournaments to its subscribers. Our last tournament got 127 players including a number of FIDE masters to come together for 3 days to socialize and play chess. Without social media it would be much harder to bring us all together.

       Using social media to organize social events isn't socializing in itself; it's just organizing events, and you can do that via mail, etc. Also, I kinda feel like playing games with each other isn't necessarily socializing if you're just talking about the game and not anything else, it's definitely more social than playing alone but less than just talking

       As for the high schooler it's the job of the parent. Kids need exposure to other kids at a young age to learn social etiquette. Afterwards, a parent needs to teach kids how to properly use social media to network and plan real events.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe a kid should be taught how to use social media and learn to lie without internet. Shut off all internet access for half a year, the kid mostly due to boredom will naturally seek out events and hobbies. A properly socially taught kid will use social media correctly. The problem lies with the parents.

       Yep, this this this. Technology is used as a babysitter way too much in society. I almost feel like this is intentional. Parents are worked for 8 hours, and they're too exhausted to actually be a parent, so they let the iPad do it for them. Then the parent goes and watches Netflix or CNN. This way, the child will be restricted to his technology, be socially awkward, and have a tough time being an actual breathing, free-thinking person, just a slave to media, and the parent won't do anything either, just watch TV after a long day of work. Kids are reading less and less, and doing worse and worse in school. Parents want to brag and seem like they're great parents so they force their kids to take advanced courses, even if they're struggling in regular courses. My AP courses are absolutely filled with kids that I know struggled in the regular classes last year, and they're doing even worse. Education is a fucking meme.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The long term data on this question is clear, people have been more and more isolated, ever since social isolation has been studied.  The American Sociological Review published a very important paper about a decade ago on this topic, and the finds wire unequivocal.

        Discussion networks are smaller in 2004 than in 1985. The number of people saying there is no one with whom they discuss important matters nearly tripled. The mean network size decreases by about a third (one confidant), from 2.94 in 1985 to 2.08 in 2004. The modal respondent now reports having no confidant; the modal respondent in 1985 had three confidants. Both kin and non-kin confidants were lost in the past two decades, but the greater decrease of non-kin ties leads to more confidant networks centered on spouses and parents, with fewer contacts through voluntary associations and neighborhoods. Most people have densely interconnected confidants similar to them. Some changes reflect the changing demographics of the U.S. population. Educational heterogeneity of social ties has decreased, racial heterogeneity has increased. The data may overestimate the number of social isolates, but these shrinking networks reflect an important social change in America

       A former friend of mine would get batshit mad if their spouse called them, and they would about every hour.  I suggested not taking the phone before and that was a crazy suggestion apparently.  I don't understand some people's relationship with their phones.

       Both of them sound like horrible people anyway if one needs to call every hour and the other blows up on said person without reaching a compromise. Not bringing the phone doesn't solve their inability to communicate well with one another, just adds another layer with the passive aggressiveness of it.

       My brother in law basically refuses to communicate via text or email and insists on Whatsapp. If I say something like:"I associate it with Facebook and government monitoring, I know they can monitor the cellphone without it, but I have to draw the line somewhere out of principle and I don't want to install it on my phone" he basically says, well then I guess we won't be communicating very often.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said he is struggling with depression and part of the result of that is he is desperately trying to control his social interactions, but he can't control everything, so it seems to be basically slowly driving him mad. Anytime we try to help or gently ask about it, he cuts us off, so basically all we can do is watch him spiral into madness.

       that's pretty much why they bash the bible so vehemently. everyone can see how fucked up the world is, its just most of us are so fucked up we'd prefer a fucked up world and be unable to live in a not-fucked-up one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not even saying god exists or the bible is right,
      </p>
      <p>
       just that at some level, the vitriol and hate for it comes from the fact that accepting the truth of the world for what it really is absolutely hurts and has the potential to break a person at their very core.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything we know is absolutely lies.
Everything we are 'need' is false and an addiction
everything we love is, in some way rotten on some level
and as such so have we too become rotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       some people are unable to accept the horrors of reality, and live in a comatose sleep, simply because accepting the alternative would drive them down the darkest roads possible in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I see the world this way, and I became a heroin addict and multi-drug abuser for many years.
      </p>
      <p>
       most of me still says "fuck it, go kill yourself, who gives a fuck world sucks anyway" but really, I stopped only because its not worth being sick and staying alive to suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are people a lot weaker than me, and breaking their world view could result in happy, productive people absolutely diving into drug addiction, or even committing suicide because of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they believe in the magic of our day, they believe in the charades put in front of them, and they continue to imagine a happy, bright future, even when the opportunity for that future has long since come and gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have trouble accepting that what we individually want, and how we feel, in and of themselves can be sinful because we do not know what is good for us, only how we feel about it.

       people talk about the double edged sword characteristics of technology that it could be used for good or for bad. it's true. It could be used for good and some people have found positive ways of using it. But is that the majority? I don't think so. 
Yes, I can sit here and talk to someone in another continent and even be friends. But the cost of that is that I'm cut off from the people surrounding me. I get attached to a machine that emulates someone's feelings. 
Think about it and many you of might not get this but when you are talking on the phone? aren't you talking to a machine? 
you are not talking to a person but you act as though you are talking to one. you get emotional and imagine if the person on the line is right in front of you but they are not. 
I feel like we need to differentiate using the word technology to the advances made in the last century to what people had before. 
In ancient civilizations, people had technology, mind you there were engineers too back then. but it didn't have impact on their social life or their behaviour. it made their lives easier but it didn't change their behaviour. 
What we are seeing today is that technology is morphing human behaviour.

       I reply appreciate this thought process and the existence of this comment. Resonates deeply with some revelations I was having the other day thinking about singularities and such. Led me to believe there's a strong disconnect from reality because we anchor ourselves so deeply into an electronic landscape that we become disillusioned. Certain color lights? Still digging deeper.

       This is why I cut off all my social media. I only have a Reddit because they are anonymous. I got tired of feeling like I had to keep up with all the people I knew, or 'oh shit I didn't post my meal before I ate'. It's just mindless word vomit from everyone. After I deleted my stuff, I gave out my number to all my friends. Only one out 40 still speaks to me. It was sad  to realize I was nothing but I icon or a like to these people. I've run into a few in the street who didn't even recognize me anymore and it's only been a year. It's also frustrating when you realize how many sites force you to have a Facebook. Or how hard it is to get a roommate because no one trusts you. When I say I don't have social media people look at me like I'm a serial killer. :/

       I agree with you.  However I wouldn't limit it to phones/internet.  I look at technology they take for granted like indoor plumbing and electricity, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years ago there was a study asking what "modern technology" would you not give up.  Most said Facebook.  They didn't even consider electricity, indoor plumbing, in home washer/dryer, an oven, a/c and heating, refrigeration, motor vehicles, eye glasses, etc.

       Not to mention the current system of delivering food to our locations.  If food and goods stopped arriving via truck and rail, imagine what would happen then?

       Then we'd have to grow food and find water and shelter for ourselves. Modern plumbing is self defeating because the waste that comes out of our bodies is good for soil, but instead we empty into a big underground tank... Not to mention our running water is filled with toxins from the pipes they come from and the additives they put in it. Tesla had free electricity for all in the works but instead of following up on that we have to pay every month. Great deal.

       That may be true but as with food, raw and direct from the source retains all the nutrients. By the time it makes it to the soil, the septic tank sewage is diluted and filled with additives making it less natural and effective overall. On a side note, it's the same with modern burial of human bodies. A dead body is beneficial to the soil but we lock them away (excluding spreading ashes) in a concrete box, never to make it to the soil. If life is a circle, it seems much of the human circle stops there.

       Seotic systems are pretty natural... bacteria breaks down waste until it is liquified then it drains into the soil. If you don't flush chemicals, then your septic system bacteria lives for decades. But I do share your concerns.

       I've been thinking about this often. We have no idea how tough life was simply 100 years ago(which is not long in the scheme of things). No running water, no daily showers, no Walgreens to run to, not even cars or decent roads in 99% of places. Life would be hell for me personally without having an electric fan and AC.

       I think a lot of people are going full futureology and thinking the world is heading to Utopia because of tech improvements rather considering that we might be going full Wall-e because of our actions.
      </p>

       I find myself more bothered by the fact that we hold certain individuals in crazy high regard. People like Musk may have done great things but damn he is a major dick and you just arent allowed to talk about that around here.

       In order to create a utopia we would have to basically remove or modify parts of the brain that deal with aggression, sex drive, the want for power and property, etc. Or we would have to seriously brainwash people to rid them of these things. Basically in order for a utopia to work we would have to become different beings altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason utopia hasn't happened yet is precisely because of how human we are. We make mistakes. We do wrong things. We want power and material possessions so we conquer lands, conquer people, and worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I suppose it's all based on what your definition of a Utopia is.

       I don't buy your premise that communism doesn't work. Please bear in mind that most of what you have been told about USSR is likely propaganda in one form or another. Secondly they didn't have communism there, more like state capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I think if we invent basically a replicator like on StarTrek, then everyone can have whatever materialistic goods and food that they like. So because of human nature people would be competing (for mates, power) in other ways (that may or may not be 'bad').
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, most criminals and psychos and serial killers etc. of today are made from poor ubringing usually brought on by powerty or excess (rich kids). A replicator would remove both (no poor and no rich).

       yeah of course you get downvoted for speaking slightly positive about communism. Anyways there is a lot of propaganda against the Soviet Union. First of all they never had communism, and most of the people there held the belief that they were on the path of communism. BIG DIFFERENCE. Something primarily the western world doesn't comprehend, because for decades they were brainwashed into thinking 'Russians are commies!'. Soviet Union was socialist. Socialism is the step before communism, at least in the system the Soviet Union had set up. Socialism is not communism.
It's impossible to say communism doesn't work because it hasn't ever been achieved before. Because it hasn't been achieved, it's open.

       Everyone knows that the USSR wasn't pure communism. I'm not apologist for capitalism, but I am consistently at a real loss to wrap my brain around any admiration for the USSR experiment in any way whatsoever.

       Remember Jurassic Park? The quote was //
Dr. Ian Malcolm: If I may... Um, I'll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you're using here, it didn't require any discipline to attain it. You read what others had done and you took the next step. You didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves, so you don't take any responsibility for it. You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox.

       Always my impression of Musk. Seems like a talentless PR stuntman who they have leading divisions of men doing the "work" and he's the Steve Jobs on stage with theme music &amp; a slide show.
I've seen that same kind of "Musk is amazing &amp; I cannot believe you'd speak against him."
My favorite LuLz come from the financial analysts that wager his company fails because of the massive subsidization it necessitates.

       Plenty of successful companies work this way, often the scientisty genius guys are socially awkward types who'd have no idea how to engage a crowd or whatever, their work needs a face to take it to the next level and they don't particularly want to or can't do that job aswell.
      </p>
      <p>
       The music/movie industry is a perfect example, usually old guys write the lyrics/script, other old guys produce the movie/song and they pay someone with a following to front it as that's how it will sell.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dickery comes if 'the face' takes all the reward and doesn't spread it around accordingly.

       Totally agree.  Musk is my pet peeve. I don't fathom that people have completely forgotten that he was instrumental in creating one of the most hated companies out there: PayPal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because he took the loot from PayPal and got lucky with investing in a car company (no he didn't create/invent Tesla himself) people think he's the shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       No he (helped) create a really shitty company with really shitty customer service and got lucky with his first investment. That's all. He's not fucking IronMan.

       luddites actually weren't anti-tech, this is a common misconception.
      </p>
      <p>
       they were sort of an early socialist group, but they were more influenced by religion and I don't think related to marx, so people don't talk about the true history of the luddites.
      </p>
      <p>
       the luddites had jobs in the factories of the times, and as the factory owners developed technologies which replaced them, they displaced entire communities with machines and let them starve off and die and pushed a major propaganda campaign against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       they became very vocal, about how the means of production, when automated absolutely REQUIRED them to be owned by the workers themselves, because the owners could fire whomever they liked and replace them with machines.
      </p>
      <p>
       the luddites weren't against technology, but felt it should be controlled, and the people who previously did those jobs should be supported still and not thrown to the streets and left to die.

       Technology is a book, a record, a musical instrument. It's not a spaz, it's what happens when you are born and raised on a TV government, with behavioral modeling in shows, and every other advertisement for more emotional control pills. That is why modern technology also has 'block user'.

       Totally agree! People think I'm crazy because I don't let my infant watch tv/play with my phone. My friends let their toddlers play with ipads all the time saying " they live in a world with technology and need to know how to use it." My granny can work an ipad, it doesn't require that much brainpower to figure out. I get that there are some educational things but I see kids totally zombiefied watching tv- it's freaky wayching them go from playful kid to eyes-glazed-over zombie when certain shows are on.

       When I was a kid my dad showed Me a bunch of fun games from when he was a kid using dosbox. Next day he told me the next day that dosbox stopped working and that I would have to wait to play the games until he could fix it, which wasn't going to happen. I spent a year learning how to work and install real dos onto my computer, learned about Linux and all sorts of stuff about computers just to play master of Orion and xcom. I learned a lot about OSes and how computers function, later learned how to write java because I wanted to make a video game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out it was a lie he made up because my mother threatened to leave him if he allowed me to play the old games, but the PS2 and Xbox was fine with her. Jokes on her because I bugged her for years talking about Linux and how great it is so I guess I win. I remember how she yelled at me the day she found out I could play Detroit on the computer, still makes no sense to me what her problem was with dos games specifically.

       me too, but it always seems like such a vast undertaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always used to try to build a game engine when I was younger but I never got far, I never seemed to figure out collision detection, and dealing with stuff like making a map editor that saved as an array of plaintext, or random sprite/enemy generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       but really the problem always has been I just picked up random books, tutorials, etc and then start projects WAY above my head without finishing learning the basics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't learn about pass by reference/copy until college, which I could kinda get away with in C using REALLLY bad habits, like idk, declaring global variables in a header file lmao.
      </p>
      <p>
       so I'm hoping some education will help, because structure and achievable goals are something I never really had. I'm being forced to learn C# this semester, so I may take it easy on myself over the summer, and instead of forcing myself to ground-up code an engine which I always try (and fail) to do, I might try to do something with Unity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though I really want to be a l33t ASM/C/C++ programmer, writing my own libraries and routines from scratch, I really have to like, actually start getting projects done if I wanna break into the field.
      </p>
      <p>
       especially since I'm not even in comp sci because I have no hope of passing math, I'm sort of in the middle of networking and programming, with a focus on coding and info sec -- although its not cisco cert at all, so its a deceptive degree name.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really have to get on making small shit and releasing it, even for free, under my real name or working on open source projects so I can prove competency and get a job

       I always keep meaning to learn C, I learned java and made many crap games, such as monopoly and chess games. I did learn some assembly when I was trying to make an OS to be dos like. If I was a bit better of a programmer my 8BIT Ultima style game would work on PC and Android. I always had problems trying to do to big of projects, but started to do the small projects and have been able to complete them. I have wanted to join open source projects myself, but I just don't work well with others myself.

       I started with web development, and learned early web app languages as well so I could control databases...

       then learned BASIC, got bored of its inflexibility and learned C then some C++ and a bunch of other languages (python, tcl/tk, bash scripting on Linux, windows shell scripts, and more)

       Congrats on getting clean. I'm 36 and back to school. These screen-addicts don't know shit about AOL chat on a dial modem! We had to do ice breaker activities and most of them could not maintain eye contact or speak about themselves without blushing or stammering. My mom dragged me to a lot of church functions, so I was used to meeting people of all ages from a young age.

       a few months ago i spent 2 weeks doing yoga in a remote valley with about 50 people with no cell phone reception and no internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read the first books i had read in ages. Instead of playing songs on the guitar from online chords, songs were created and sung. We all had to gather food from the farm every day and cook together. We all cleaned every day to keep the place looking amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was so good to not know what was going on in the world. We were humans. Laughing and talking and interacting with each other. helping each other. We can do amazing things when we come together and get on the same page.

       I stayed 2 weeks but it goes on all year round. Its like a cult compound and its very structured but quite an amazing experience. I recommend it to anyone who just wants to develop their spiritual side, have a break from the world, go walking, be happy peaceful and free.
      </p>
      <p>
       I paid 55 per night and had my own room and only worked half days mostly on the farm weeding vegies, burning off , and picking vegies and cooking in the kitchen for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can pay 100 per night and not have to do any work except for 45 minutes in the morning at 8 so that you complete saucha or the cleanliness of yoga (mind , body and physical)
      </p>
      <p>
       There were full time short term volunteers who didnt pay a thing but shared in 4 bed dorms. they got 2 full days and 1 half day of work off per week.
      </p>
      <p>
       there were long term volunteers who were given more leadership duties in regards to kitchen or farm etc. All long term volunteers had to be doing yogic studies (for free) so as to not be developing as a person and were expected to join most yoga activities or have a dedicated practice of their own. ONce there for a little while you may be able to get your own hut in the forrest so as to have more privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       People came to do yogic studies courses (not just stretching but understanding of all that is the 8 fold path of yoga). People came to do retreats. We had one weekend full of dr's doing a conference on yoga and the mind and brain and another with very long term practitioners (amazing energy) and another of weekend city slickers coming to unwind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ashram was part of the Bihar school of yoga in India but is no longer affiliated due to a sexual abuse scandal which caused the australian arm to sell much of its assets (yoga school in wealthy sydney suburb and another in the jungle out side of cairns in northern australia)
      </p>
      <p>
       There are quiet a few ashrams all around the world. Some are expensive and some like this one are truly non profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is very cult like. However at no time was their any sort of religious indoctrination and the ashram is for spiritual development.

       I think it is just harder to ignore how much cellphones are able and activlly spying on people. New features are getting more invasive and I think some people are noticing it, such as the facial recognition on the new Apple. I think people are also developing a health distrust towards the government and corporations in recent years that I don't remember seeing as a kid.

       I think the reason why  people are so resistant to criticisms of tech are:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) You're exposing how vulnerable everyone is.  Basically we've built a society that completely depends on our technology to function, and likewise, each of us as individuals are totally dependent on technology for day to day survival.
2) Everyone is complicit with tech.  We don't like to talk about how child slaves in africa have to go down into bauxite mines to mine the minerals needed to build all of the fancy tools we have in the west, like  the comuters we're now using.
       <br/>
       3)  The idea that technology is just a tool.  Lots of people think technology is agnostic of political considerations, and it just comes down to how you use it. But in reality politics and morality are inseparable from the tech question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Technology and its impact on society is THE biggest conspiracy, in my opinion.  You can trace technology and its development back to the beginning of recorded history and watch as it developed alongside the increasingly complex and dominant power hierarchy.  Its to the point where people think certain technologies aren't even technologies, they are just facts of life, and they can't imagine a world without them.

       People are triggered at just about anything these days. I can't even order a sandwich without someone screaming and going into a convulsive fit because
       <em>
        I assumed that my bread was Italian

       . Apparently you can't assume anything about any subject that even remotely resembles a triggering word. Problem is, when you remove all of the triggering words, you're only left with a few to speak.

       I do. My family migrated(legally mind you) from Poland to the US two decades ago. Thanks to Skype, my family Christmas(and other various holidays and birthdays) are shared across the world.

        People are more connected than ever and yet most people are more socially isolated than they've ever been. Do you truly believe that social media and technology has brought us closer?

       The long term data on this question is clear, people have been more and more isolated, ever since social isolation has been studied.  The American Sociological Review published a very important paper about a decade ago on this topic, and the finds wire unequivocal.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Discussion networks are smaller in 2004 than in 1985. The number of people saying there is no one with whom they discuss important matters nearly tripled. The mean network size decreases by about a third (one confidant), from 2.94 in 1985 to 2.08 in 2004. The modal respondent now reports having no confidant; the modal respondent in 1985 had three confidants. Both kin and non-kin confidants were lost in the past two decades, but the greater decrease of non-kin ties leads to more confidant networks centered on spouses and parents, with fewer contacts through voluntary associations and neighborhoods. Most people have densely interconnected confidants similar to them. Some changes reflect the changing demographics of the U.S. population. Educational heterogeneity of social ties has decreased, racial heterogeneity has increased. The data may overestimate the number of social isolates, but these shrinking networks reflect an important social change in America
