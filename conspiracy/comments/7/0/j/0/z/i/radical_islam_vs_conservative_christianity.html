        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Gonna preface this thread by saying that I hold some conservative views. I believe guns in the hands of citizens is an inalienable right and that SJW&#39;s are perverting democracy with political correctness. </p>

<p>I was raised Quaker on one side of my family, Methodist the other, and attended a Southern Baptist Military School so I&#39;m not ignorant of the Christian faith. </p>

<p>That said: I&#39;m curious about this sub&#39;s perception of Radical Islam versus Conservative Christianity. </p>

<p>-Both believe women should be subservient
-Both believe drugs/alcohol are degenerate 
-Both believe it is your duty to convert non-believers
-???</p>

<p>Outside of geographical differences between the Prophets, I fail to see the contrasts. Am I missing something? Shouldn&#39;t Conservatives be &#39;killing in the name of&#39; right now just like radical islamists? Western Society has been moving hard left for 25+ years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I should preface this by saying I hold agnostic views. Christianity in the past was more similiar. Killing heretics, holy wars, subservant women and slave views. Over the generations the sharp edges got dulled, the heiarchy lost power, and many of the flock broke away. Christianity has been castrated.</p>

<p>I see Islam as the old Christianity, with theocratic governments, controlling the law, and resistant to change. I think over time the same effects will happen to Islam. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s going to be smooth.</p>

<p>I do disagree with the shifting of western society. In one aspect this is true. The majority of western citizens believe gay marriage should have equal right. There is also a huge push for legalized drugs.</p>

<p>Economically I believe there has been a push to the right. Worker unions have been losing power, inequality has risen, the top tax rate in te US used to be 90% a few decades is now instead 39%. This is further evident that the left(democrats) are passing the laws of the old right. For instance, the Afordable Care Act is primary composed of old Republican ideas such as the marketplace and te individual mandate. This isn&#39;t just a shift of the left side, but the right as they no longer support thier prior healthcare ideology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible was written more as an ideology. The prophet Muhammad was in charge of a state. His writing are much more political and meant to facilitate law. This leads to a resistance of adaptation. The interpretation of the Bible is much more malleable. There is a second facet of literacy control in Islam in regards to women. Looking back at Christianity it had a renovation after the printing press as common folk were allowed to discern interpretation rather than blindly accept the official narative. Islam is blunting this change by retarding women&#39;s literacy.</p>

<p>You can see a rather large change in history. The Papal States used to wield immense power being the crowning authority. Likewise the Holy Roman Empire, which was neighter Holy, Roman, or and Empire, used it&#39;s religious roots to wield influence among the Germanic city states before it&#39;s dissolution into Germany in 1806. Just like Islam propagates in the politics of the Middle East today. You can also see similiar shifts between Protestants, Reformants, Orthodox, and Catholics are not too dissimilar from the various Islam sects.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nowhere in the gospel does it say to go slay those who disbelieve, instead it tells us to share the good news of Jesus Christ and if the person chooses not to believe the Gospel, then we should move along as it will be a testament against them for when they denied the good news of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>We are told to love our enemies and to do good to those who take advantage of us and to turn the other cheek.</p>

<p>That being said, the difference between Islam and Christianity is that Christian are allowed eternal life through Jesus only, while Islam says that you have to earn your way to heaven through good works.  Christians depend on God for salvation, while muslims depend on themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can determine who the true God through the fulfillment of prophecy, such as Jesus Christ being predicted over 500 years before His birth and the prophecy about Damascus becoming a ruinous heap which is happening now.  You also need to believe and have faith in Jesus and pray to Him and He will answer your call.  God must be worshipped in spirit and in truth, and it&#39;s impossible to please God without faith, so having faith is a requirement.</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter if Islam likes their version of Jesus more than Judaism, but I can tell you that the Jesus that&#39;s in the quran is not Jesus of the Bible.  Jesus of the Bible is God in the flesh, while the quran has their own version of Jesus called Isa who wasn&#39;t God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For additional information(Laragon cites the Old Testament), Titus 3:10 was the primary citation of heretical killings from the New Testament. It&#39;s words were twisted to suit purposes. You can see this natural progression even in the later years as &quot;heresy&quot; is replaced with &quot;division&quot; and prefering the interpretation of rejecting and ignoring.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>History tells us that Islam spawned 500 years after Christianity and then it contradicted what the bible says, in which The Quran denies Jesus as the Son of God and it denies the crucifixion of Jesus, yet Islam tells it&#39;s followers to go to the people of the Bible if they have any doubts about the quran and the quran claims that allah wrote the old and new testament.  Now if allah wrote the old and new testament, but the quran contradicts the bible, then that tells you that the quran is false.</p>

<p>James 2:14 is speaking about having faith that coincides with Godly works, if you know somebody is in need and you have the means to help them, then you should help them, as that is the godly thing to do, but our salvation alone doesn&#39;t rest on our works, as some people may come to Christ on their deathbed, just as the thief on the cross who believed in Jesus.</p>

<p>A man of God will help when he can and do good when he can, but our salvation is through Jesus Christ alone, therefore we must diligently repent our sins.</p>
