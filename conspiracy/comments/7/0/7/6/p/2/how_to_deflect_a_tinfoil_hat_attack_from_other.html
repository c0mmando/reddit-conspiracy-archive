        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was trying to talk about the problems with secret organ trafficking  in the west on the R/China reddiit when someone attacked me with this:</p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t forget about the lizard people illuminati putting toxins in our water to turn our children into an unstoppable army against their own parents! Thank God I&#39;ve found another person who is not one of these ignorant sheeple.&quot;</p>

<p>I responded with this: </p>

<p>The CIA dug up and promoted the phrase &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; in order to distract Americans from the idea that the CIA may have participated in the assasination of JFK. Or do you think Oswald was some kind of super-marksman. Let me guess, you do not want to know the truth because it hurts too much to think of America killing its own president.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theories like flat earth and lizard people are promoted by powerful groups in order to discredit all believers in any conspiracy theory.
Most people who believe in 9-11 truth don&#39;t believe in flat earth theory. Got it? So go fuck your tinfoil hat bullshit attack.</p>

<p>Can you answer this question? How did the Vietnam war start? It started with the &quot;Gulf of Tonkin attack&quot; which was a false flag attack. Vietnam never launched torpedos at the US navy, yet this lie was used to justify a war that killed thousands of people. Sometimes conspiracy theories just become history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason the false narrative we live under has worked so well for so long is that people see and hear what they want to see and hear.  For example, I&#39;m guessing that half of the conspiracy truths we study are indeed bullshit. We see them and recognize them as possible conflicting narratives because we want to see that. Our eyes are open to that. Convincing someone that is not open to an alternative narrative will only lead to frustration and a confirmed belief that those seeking the truth are all nuts.  The best we can all do is live our lives with an increased knowledge of the world. If you&#39;re intent on educating people, which I was for years, the best success I had was to do it slowly. Introduce a sliver of information through an open ended question and allow them to formulate their own conclusion. Those that are capable of opening their eyes will. Those that are not, won&#39;t. </p>

I&#39;ll be having a civil argument with someone and they or someone else will throw my participation in this subreddit right in my face attempting to derail the conversation or to just make me look like a nutcase.</p>

<p>It pisses me off when they take my open-minded approach to things and use it against me. </p>

<p>BTW, I like your handle. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever bumped into you before, I would have remembered since our names are so similar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>labels are powerful and tend to encompass an entire group into one thing. you are a Christian so you believe the same thing as all the other ones. you are a conspiracy theorist so you believe all the same crazy shit people put on the internet. </p>

<p>I am totally ok with the term conspiracy theorist because I like to use some critical thinking and the term to mean means more than it does to others. I am weary whenever someone else uses the term because I know the connotations that word has. when talking about a conspiracy with someone who believes the official story and they laugh at my ideas I usually give a few hard facts and use logic and reason to back up my ideas. I laugh at them for failing to use any critical thinking and put them in the dunce cap. sometimes we win sometimes we lose. </p>

<p>You can have the same, or similar thought process and come to a different conclusion. </p>

<p>The difference is <em>bias</em> and also the difference between &quot;left brain/right brain&quot; thinkers. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not as simple as how you are presenting it. </p>

Granted, not many people polled but literally every one of them believed 911 was a conspiracy. Out of the three that I got to speak to about Flat Earth though, every one of them believed these people are fucking crazy. Good times though.</p>
