    <div class="md"><p>My guess yes. Further training for the police here to train them up on civil unrest in the near future since the war drums are beating. And since this was the weekend duty for the national guard anyways for training with them. They have been training for this all over the country. Look up operation gladio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have to do more research on the case, but I think he was on trial for murder 1.  Even with the statement during the chase that the cop was going to kill him, I don&#39;t think you can convict someone for first degree murder in that situation.  Its not like he jumped out of his car and started shooting.  The guy kept coming towards the cops with his hands hidden.  I know there&#39;s evidence that he may have planted a gun, but that was after the fact and doesn&#39;t prove premeditation.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure they could have convicted him of something else, but not first degree murder.  First degree murder is like when you google how to poison someone.  Then a week later buy the poison.  Then a few days after that administer the poison.  When you&#39;re a cop and you&#39;ve been chasing someone in a vehicle, then you get out of your car and he won&#39;t stop walking toward you with his hands concealed, after multiple warnings, that&#39;s not first degree murder.</p>

<p>Now many people would say the real conspiracy is why was he charged with first degree murder in the first place?  Its as if they knew they couldn&#39;t convict him of that.  Normally that may be the case, but in this case the DA was Kim Gardner.  She is a black woman, and a former Democratic member of the House of Representatives.  </p>

<p>She really was going for a conviction, and she wanted first degree murder.  That was clearly a mistake, because it wasn&#39;t first degree murder.  I&#39;m sure the cop&#39;s attorneys knew this, and figured a non-jury trial would be a sure thing, since a judge knows the law.  I think he likely would have been acquitted even with a jury trial though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my understanding, since Stockley claimed self defense, the burden of proof was on the Prosecution to prove that it was not self defense.  Since in the judge&#39;s opinion they weren&#39;t able to do this, the judge no longer had the leeway to consider a lesser charge.</p>

<p>Also, people were criticizing the judge&#39;s comments that inner city heroin dealers usually have a gun, but people need to remember that since there was no jury, the judge is acting as the jury.  In a case without a jury, the judge is supposed to use life experience and common sense, just as how a jury would think.  </p>

<p>So is there nothing about government agents &quot;waiving&quot; their right to a jury because they know the judge is a government agent and will have their back? Or is that supposed to be taken care of by the &quot;impartiality&quot; of judges?</p>

Furthermore He was 24 years old and supposedly out on parole for distributing heroin, illegal gun possession, and theft. Do you know how much time the minimum sentencing is for those charges? He must have been a baby when sentenced. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the criminal would have faced due process if he wouldn&#39;t have resisted and potentially threatened the lives of other human beings while fleeing the police</p>

<p>if you were that cop you would have reacted similarly, or you would have started crying because you&#39;ve never been in a stressful situation like that in your life. Someone obviously resisting arrest because they are a criminal isn&#39;t worth dying over. I&#39;m sorry people don&#39;t act the way you would like them to when their lives are in danger. </p>

<p>The fact that you expect every police officer to be on point 100% of the time means you&#39;re probably a pea brained retard with no sense of how the real world works. Criminals die sometimes, police die sometimes, that&#39;s the game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is an update of a close friend of mine on facebook. Sounds like a bunch of fake news from what he is saying...&quot;I&#39;m in St. Louis right now with Coast Modern. Last night the local news was airing a live segment of a police line and reporting about the &quot;violent protest that police are trying to contain&quot;. All we saw was a police line pushing up on a mob of reporters and cameras. No protestors. The protesters we did see were of all races and peaceful. They retired at a reasonable hour.&quot;</p>
