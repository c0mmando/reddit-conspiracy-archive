    <div class="md"><p>naah man. a quick background story. human civilization is so much older then we even can imagen. something happen 12k years ago. natural catastrophe. humans went almost extinct. loss of social order,starvation and what not led to us humans going primal for a couple of thousand of year. loss of consciousness .</p>

<p>then we have some humans living around Mesopotamia and Egypt. they snap out of it and realized there must been something before them. they created a secret order ( for good reasons ) to work as a positive factor for humanity. they created all the pagan religion and all the other mystery&#39;s of the past, thats why they are called the mystery schools..</p>

<p>but whit time even that order got corrupted. it went from pro humanity to a cult who wanted to keep humanity in a state of sheep heard.. &quot;best slaves are slaves that think they are free&quot;  </p>

<p>and a litel later on they split into two groups. one who stood by the original intention. to be a positive factor for humanity, the other is just trying to keep the master and slave narrative alive </p>

<p>so the pyramid of Egypt and the sphinx are all pre flood. 
the Abraham religions is all about rebellion to this slavery. there is a god,he inspires and the humans act upon it. what you read as the battle between good and evil in the bible is just two cult fighting over witch ideology will win </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a copypasta, don&#39;t forget the salt:</p>

<p>Trump is backed by the Gnostic Illuminati, the same responsible for the US, French and Russian Revolutions. They and their various groups have taken power around most of the world at this point from Khazar/Bloodline control and have wrested control of the military industrial complex and the governments of the USA, Russia, and most of Asia, Korea and Japan from the Bloodline family control. The Bushes, Clintons, Obamas, Soros, Rockefellers, Rothschilds, the UN and Vatican, et. al. are the Roman/Khazarian/Bloodline/Freemason globalist factions of the Elite and currently have a (rapidly disappearing) foothold in Israel, China, Germany and the EU states, and are in the process of being almost completely exterminated as a threat from within the United States government. People don&#39;t understand that Trump&#39;s win was a true Revolution at the world stage where a group of white hat Elites, military and powerbrokers dissatisfied or allied against Bloodline control behind the scenes of the world finally showed their hand and took control back. The Gnostic Illuminati wants a world based upon a true meritocracy without Bloodline control with full access to hidden technology, use of the Global Collateral Accounts for the betterment of all of humanity, massive public works projects, the truth about our species and extraterrestrial intelligence, and expansion into the stars; the globalists / Bloodlines just want their New World Order, and are trying desperately to kickstart WW3 to achieve the endgame - the depopulation of 90% of the planet, a totalitarian world government of digital / technocratic slavery with the banks at the top, one religion for all, etc.</p>

<p>The Gnostic Illuminati ties with Trump have been mentioned by Benjamin Fulford, VOTL, David Wilcock and a few others, and jive with what Dr. Steve Pieczenik himself has confirmed many times about a group of military, political and corporate white hats within the United States government that have been biding their time since the 70s to restore true Constitutional governance and push for America to become a true beacon of freedom, meritocracy and example of modern society. Trump was their recruit, due to his independent wealth and ties to Pieczenik, who knew the Trumps from studying under Dr. John Trump of MIT, Donald&#39;s uncle - who, as you may be aware, was hired by the FBI to investigate and study Tesla&#39;s inventions and work upon his death.</p>

<p>The Rothschilds, Rockefellers and the other typical associated names of the globalist elite factions are not Gnostic Illuminati - they are the (distant) descendents of the Mystery Babylon, who grew into the Black Nobility and the Roman/Vatican/Jesuits/Swiss-Venetians that control virtually every government and country on the planet. However people are incorrect when they think that the Rothschilds and Rockefellers are the top of the pyramid - far from it. The true power behind the Elite is the Black Nobility and the Vatican, whereas the Rockefellers and Rothschilds are simply the moneymen, the hofjuden, and the buffer between the Elite and the public. They are on the same sides, after all these people are intermarried generationally going back centuries at least. </p>

<p>They are Babylonian Talmudists and Khazarians that have co-opted the world&#39;s major religions and twisted them into Luciferianism, their true religion. It is an international criminal mafia masquerading as true government. Zionism is just a political ideology propogated by these people to mask their Satanist philosophies and agendas as physical avatars for negative 4th dimensional entities such as the Draco Reptilians and Archons. With David Rockefeller&#39;s and Zbigniew Brzezinski&#39;s deaths and a massive worldwide awakening to political realities, however, there has been a massive power vacuum within the Elite, and Trump&#39;s backers are the guys who got in. The Gnostic Illuminati is a separate faction of the Elite, representing many reformed Luciferians / P2 Freemasons, Asian secret societies, martial arts orgs and ancient/noble families, such as the Dragon Family / White Dragon Society and the Romanovs, that do not agree with or condone the current Bloodline rule and understand that changes need to be made to bring the world into a new age based upon global meritocracy, freedom of information, and plentiful renewable resources. They realize that the Luciferians plan to depopulate the planet and rule as gods would have been counterproductive to our Evolution as a species. Trump and even Putin are just instruments in their plan to put a stop to all of it, which at this stage is reaching its completion. In all things there is dualism: there are many on this planet who are on the side of Light, even amongst our leaders, and realize that it&#39;s simply a matter of inevitability for Humanity to reach its true potential, and that the current system of slavery for all Humanity cannot continue if we are to evolve as a species and take our true place in the galactic community. There are widening splits within the Elite lately as many more of them are born into &quot;The Family&quot; questioning their roles, falling victim to their own propaganda (the current gen of Elites and their kids are essentially mindless, materialistic bougeoisie like the Kardashians), or simply realizing that the jig is up and that they better get on the right side of History or face a very angry and awakened public.</p>

<p>As for money being stolen and poured into research into ETI and hidden technology, Look into William Tompkins and especially Operation Highjump and you&#39;ll quickly figure out that our governments have known about ETI and have been working with them for the better part of the last century at least. What we think is currently possible with technology is at least a century behind what is actually available in black projects and top-secret military applications. Zero-point energy, cures for every known disease, advances in technology that could eliminate all human suffering overnight - it&#39;s all there, and unfortunately until the ruling cabal is completely eliminated, it will stay secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>naah man. a quick background story. human civilization is so much older then we even can imagen. something happen 12k years ago. natural catastrophe. humans went almost extinct. loss of social order,starvation and what not led to us humans going primal for a couple of thousand of year. loss of consciousness .</p>

<p>then we have some humans living around Mesopotamia and Egypt. they snap out of it and realized there must been something before them. they created a secret order ( for good reasons ) to work as a positive factor for humanity. they created all the pagan religion and all the other mystery&#39;s of the past, thats why they are called the mystery schools..</p>
