       If we lead with the Zionism stuff, the uninformed masses will see two things--anti-semitism and wild crazy conspiracy theory, each empowering the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not the way to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recently posted a video here featuring a well-known television and radio personality, Lionel, giving an intelligent, articulate, 30-minute monologue about 9/11 aimed at the uninformed masses. Someone commented something to the effect of "He didn't pin down the Zionist connection. Lionel is a Zionist tool. Downvoted."
      </p>
      <p>
       Had he done that, he would have lost 90% of the people that video reached. Lionel is a very,
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       smart guy. He knows his history like the back of his hand. He also knows how glossed-over and fake most of our official history is. He commonly quotes Tolstoy: "History would be a wonderful thing if only it were true." - there is truth in that sentiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm positive Lionel is well aware of the issue of Zionism and its connection to 9/11 and many other bad things. This is a choice he's making. And it's the right choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       We ought to be thankful that such a prominent and distinguished member of MSM is even willing to put his career on the line to question the official story. Many have lost careers over this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting back to the title of this post--I think it would be wise to follow Lionel's lead here in terms of strategy. We all know about Zionism. We all know the problem. But the masses don't. And it will come as a shock to many of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The masses must be made to care. Too many don't. Find a way to make them want to research. There's nothing better than seeing someone write their
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       red pill prescription. And as for that last one in the bottle...they'll get there.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all do.

       You're wrong. When it comes to 9/11, the best way to appeal to the uninformed masses and get them thinking is to point out the impossible physics, cite the experts, etc. Not blame an ideology. That comes last.

       What? How do you know I'm wrong I didn't say anything yet for me to be wrong? Clearly zionism is a very early red pill. The later red pills being for example CGI and mini nukes.

       I did? Where?? Stop what?? What makes you right and me wrong? Lol take a good close look at yourself mate. If you think zionism is the last redpill you're deluded. It's one of the first ones ffs. It's literally "who did it" type first. The why's and the how's are much much deeper. But oh I'm the one who's wrong. What an attitude on this one

       You

       wrong, and I'll give you a scenario to show you why you're wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go around to people who are uninformed about 9/11 and ask them "Did you know Zionists are behind 911?" and see how many people stick around and listen to what you have to say. You're liable to be cursed, spat on, have coffee thrown on you, etc. but it certainly doesn't add to your credibility and make people
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to listen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, do the same thing, but instead of instantly blaming Zionists, ask them if they're aware that a third building fell that day at total and complete freefall for 8 stories.

       The mini nuke red pill is absolute BS. The fact is, the Twin Towers never existed. Is it just a coincidence that the towers were "built" when CGI was first coming to fruition? We shouldn't be feeding people false redpills (which are more like blue pills), it makes them less likely to accept the harsher truths.

       Precisely. And it does happen gradually. This guilt-indoctrination or "snarl of anti-semitism" as you aptly described it has been programmed into our minds since we were children, especially those of us who attended public schools.

       Just tell them to convert to Islam. We are the only major group that calls out the Jews for what they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we can do it without getting called antisemite because Arabs are semetic people.
      </p>

       Not Arab myself but I can use the argument that since Palestinians are semetic people that makes the Jews Anti-Semites.

       No, none of us know who actually did it. Many have theories, as such, each are mere speculations from the outside looking in. If we actually knew who did it, things would be quite different, now wouldn't they?

       It wasn't just Zionists behind 9/11. Many groups were, imo. One group that is rarely mentioned, even though they have a documented of doing such things, are the Jesuits and SMOM.  Curious how not many people call that group out, even though assassination and political subversion is their bread and butter.

       No worries, and for  the most part I do agree with you. You have to ease people into 9/11 if they are completely asleep to it.

       It was a team effort. The CFO was Saudi, the COO Israeli, and the CEO American.

       I would proffer that the search for truth in this world begins with understanding tribalism in its modern forms, especially when that tribalism is a present danger to the world because it embraces endless confrontation and is institutionalized in a state.  Let's move the study of the danger of Zionism and Israel to Front Center stage.

       Let's have this discussion. It doesn't have to be on this thread--in fact I believe it deserves it's own post. Do you ever post on this sub? If not, PM me and we can talk about co-writing a piece for this sub addressing the topic.

       What you said was right, and worthy of discussion.

       Oh I'm well aware of these. Thank you for posting. No one wants to talk about the bank in Manhattan that was shut down for providing loans to Fritz Thyssen or the amount of profit generated for the English crown and international oligarchs from the labor at Hitler's camps. No one wants to talk about why Henry Ford sued the US government after the war for and won because they bombed a tank-manufacturing facility. A Ford one. In Germany. Making tanks for Hitler. He
       <em>
        won
       </em>
       . No one wants to talk about the fortune made off the war by AT&amp;T, IBM, the Bush crime family, so many others.

       The men you voted for to run this country and the rich bankets use zionism and illuminatie as a diversion from the truth that they are pulling the strings.

         Zionism is a real, tangible thing responsible for documented bad things throughout history. The "illuminatie" as you've called it, is a secret society started in the 18th century which is used as a present-day boogeyman.
