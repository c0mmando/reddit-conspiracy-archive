    <div class="md"><p>Part of the problem with doctors is that if the only tool you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail. They hear your list of symptoms, they think back to medical school, then suggest the pill that they think will alleviate some of those symptoms. In general, doctors don&#39;t know much about nutrition. This is assuming you are dealing with a doctor who wasn&#39;t bribed. They could also just be pushing drugs on you because they were bribed with dinners, which they have to report, or cash. Anyone who thinks all doctors admit to everything they were given is naive. </p>

<p><a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-03-26/health/ct-met-heart-nutrition-20130326_1_mediterranean-style-diet-heart-disease-diet-and-nutrition">On average, doctors receive 19 hours of total nutrition education in medical school; in 2004 the average was 22.3 hours, according to the study, conducted as part of the Nutrition in Medicine project at UNC. In 2009, 27 percent of the schools met the minimum standard of nutrition training, compared with 38 percent in 2004.</a></p>

<p>Even if they weren&#39;t bribed with cash, they are still more likely to push drugs on people if they were bribed with a <em>single</em> dinner. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/free-lunches-pay-drug-companies-study-shows-n595906">Physicians who accepted even one meal sponsored by a drug company were much more likely to prescribe a name-brand drug to patients later, a new study shows.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely correct. 
It&#39;s (they&#39;re) not about preventive measures like nutrition but rather invasive curative care. And those professional who do specialize in preventive care are typically never covered by insurers. </p>

<p>People need to take responsibility for their own lives and stop looking for others (the establishment) to fix every single thing when in reality, they&#39;ll just fuck it up!!</p>

<p>We are way too quick, lazy and/or complacent to turn to the establishment to fix what we ourselves bring on (for the most part)....in this case, horrific diets!!</p>

<p>If you eat processed foods then you WILL get sick. It&#39;s almost as simple as that!</p>

<p>Worked at a family practice.

    <div class="md"><p>None of my doctors show up on the list but for the past 20 years all of them have tried to push SSRI drugs on me for my anxiety and depresssion.

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse me if this is unwarranted... I have felt that anxiety and depression from spending too much time being bombarded by (and often seeking out) negative media. Sometimes I find it helpful to tune out from the internet altogether for stretches of time and focus on things in my immediate life and that of those around me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are biological causes as well. In this modern age of people who are cooped up indoors, don&#39;t get enough exercise, consume too much processed food, not enough nutrients, and don&#39;t get enough sunlight and vitamin D, it&#39;s no wonder that so many people are depressed. </p>

<p>Since some doctors are bribed and a lot of them have very little nutrition education (because it&#39;s not a requirement to be proficient in that area), and since they focus on medication and not cures, they will obviously use medication to &quot;fix&quot; the problems that people come to them with. </p>

<p>For instance, I actually found a good doctor who gave me a vitamin D blood test and requested that I get more exercise for anxiety and depression. Of course I was deficient in vitamin D, so he recommended that I take 5,000 IU per day to maintain sufficient levels, unless we are in mid summer and I get enough sunlight. All is well now. If you look hard enough, you can find a good doctor. Just see what they say. if every solution is a pill, move on to the next doctor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not unwarranted at all. That is a huge part of it for me. I eliminated newspapers and magazines a decade ago. Radio about 7 years ago. and TV about 5 years ago. I never use my phone but I do spend about 99 % of my waking free time on the net and my work time in IT. I cannot escape the beast that is the net. And yes I get very little sun and have a mostly horrible diet. I am the modern American fat depressed and lethargic. I have been eating whole foods lately and minimizing meat and dairy focusing on fresh fruit and veggies and its helped more than anything else I have tried. Seriously considering going full bore vegan or 99% with only meat for very special occasions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Gish Gallop (also known as proof by verbosity) is the fallacious debate tactic of drowning your opponent in a flood of individually-weak arguments in order to prevent rebuttal of the whole argument collection without great effort. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>None of what I posted is weak. It&#39;s just a set of facts about pharmaceutical firms that haven&#39;t gotten enough attention from the public. Now if I posted links to yournewswire and natural news, then they&#39;d have a point, but I didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>They believe a gish gallop is anything that has like 4 or more citations. Many scientific studies have up to 100 or more citations, and they wouldn&#39;t consider all scientific studies to be gish gallops, so clearly the term &quot;gish gallop&quot; has little to do with how many citations you use. It&#39;s more about the <em>strength</em> of your citations, not the number of them. </p>

<p>It is a shame watching patients enter and say &quot;I need some of these pills and some of these other pills&quot; rather than actually having a symptom/diagnosis check. Many of our culture&#39;s have the idea that medicine fixes pain, mental disorders, and just about anything you can think of deeply embedded within, ably assisted by clever marketing and appropriately phrased media pieces.</p>

<p>There is a fascinating bit towards the end where he speaks to the doctors about the dinners and drinks the pharma companies arrange for them to attend, ultimately trying to convince them that they shouldn&#39;t go in the first place.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying medicine is bad per se, but people are too easily fed the company line, and they believe it because it&#39;s the easiest thing to do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. I&#39;ll check it out. </p>

<p>If you look long enough, you can find really good doctors. They do exist. One way to tell is if your doctor either offers pills or mentions diet and exercise when you come in with symptoms, such as depression. If the doctor doesn&#39;t say anything about diet, exercise, or nutrient levels, then you may want to look elsewhere. This obviously doesn&#39;t apply to every patient and every aliment, but if his solution to a problem is always medication, then you might have a problem.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My problem is that I shouldn&#39;t have to <em>find</em> a good doctor! All doctors should be in the job to find the best treatment for the patient, but, as you&#39;ll see from the documentary, there are not enough Doctors OR too many people, and the result is that 10 minutes is all you get. 10 minutes is not enough, as the Doctors say, to make a full proper diagnosis.</p>

<p>My issue is with the state of the system as well as the pharmaceutical &#39;friends to the doctors&#39; situation. Some, not all, doctors will be pushing the medicines simply because the want the money. Whether or not they need the money for survival or greed is kind of irrelevant, it&#39;s the fact that pharmas can feed money into the NHS like that which gives me sour taste in my mouth.</p>

<p>I sure I needn&#39;t mention the problem with drug prices..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes big pharma is a problem, yes there are greedy doctors out there. But I might be a bit biased here as a med student and I can tell you that those unethical doctors are outliers in the medical world. </p>

<p>I read about the Georgia issue on toddlers becoming prescribed ADHD meds. This absolutely is not the norm, and we definitely haven&#39;t been taught to prescribe any sorts of stimulants to children that young. BUT I&#39;ve only ever seen one case of this where the 2 year old was severely autistic and self-harming.  A low dose of adderall and clonidine was prohibiting him from doing so. The young mom had Medicaid to aid her in all his medical costs. </p>

<p>But I do like to read &amp; I have adopted a healthy level of skepticism. So a couple years ago I came across an article about how children in foster care are commonly prescribed psychotropic drugs at young ages. It would only make sense that Medicaid would cover these costs. Just another avenue to explore. I can&#39;t find the article, but I found one doing a quick google search:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just speaking from experience so far, it wasn&#39;t meant to be taken as a universal truth. I&#39;m contributing a different perspective to OP&#39;s post. </p>

<p>That is a plausible scenario as every situation will differ. We both don&#39;t really know what sort of pathological issues those children are dealing with. To generalize that every therapeutic intervention is detrimental to one&#39;s well-being is a bit extreme, no?! Therapeutic judgements are based on the risk/benefit ratio. The majority of doctors don&#39;t just go prescribing medication because big Pharma tells them to. They actually understand the pathophysiological conditions and mechanism of actions (&amp; adverse reactions) of these medications. Another problem is that society stigmatizes mental illnesses &amp; other disabilities. These generalized, biased MSM articles can also contribute to that stigmatization. They say &quot;black and white thinking doesn&#39;t work in a gray world&quot;  and that couldn&#39;t be far from the truth. These topics are way too complex to take any sort of extreme stance. </p>
