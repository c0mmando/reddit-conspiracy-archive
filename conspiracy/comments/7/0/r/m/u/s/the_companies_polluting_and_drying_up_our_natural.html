Superior is pretty deap, and there are so many Canadian lakes although a lot are becoming unusable due to fertilizer runoff leading to many becoming toxic. A lot in Alberta specifically have toxic blue green algae and it will make you sick if you drink the water or eat the fish. although as long as the fish are properly cleaned and skin removed as well all organs before cooking the fish are ok but still taste funny. </p>

<p>I used to go fishing a lot, some of the lakes the algae is so bad that you couldn&#39;t see more than an inch into the water and some lakes it is extremely thick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t mean to sound like a dick, but, you seriously should get out more. The Great Lakes is a hot bed for all of that, and that is just one geographic area. This takes thinking a bit differently. Earth is finite, because if your body decease, you provide nutrition to the earth to grow more, no? It&#39;s all an infinite cycle, and so is your soul, imo. You&#39;re thinking materialistically, not idealistically. I&#39;m going to take a guess and say, you are not spiritual, in the least, but think &quot;science&quot; is the end all, be all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not really giving me any kind of information(besides the oil), you&#39;re giving me vague allusions to magic thinking. You&#39;re not describing the mechanism. Where does the copper, phosphorous, cobalt etc etc come from, good vibes? </p>

<p>If you&#39;re trying to say earth grows it or something the way we do skin cells or hair, then say it. An infinite process still has limits. If everyone switched to drinking, watering their pets and food with lake superior would it stay full forever or what? </p>

<p>I am quite spiritual and regularly enjoy the natural world, that is why I am confounded by your comments. That we can just pillage it forever with no limits because it regrows(or something) is absurd, and I am trying to understand why you think otherwise but you&#39;re not giving me much. </p>

<p>If you want to say that the material plane responds to our beliefs and that there is no objective physical reality, that&#39;d be a much more satisfying answer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I am sure that the bad taste is due to the plastic and chemicals that they add to the bottle water mixing in the water, which I am sure is not healthy. Bottle water tastes like plastic and I don&#39;t get why people would drink it over tap just based off the plastic taste, let alone the chemicals that exist within it.</p>

<p>CNN reports that 5,300 U.S. water systems are in violation of lead rules. EPA employees filter their own tap water because they aren&#39;t confident in the water purity.

    <div class="md"><p>Lake superior has more water than the rest of the others combined. Superior is pretty deap, and there are so many Canadian lakes although a lot are becoming unusable due to fertilizer runoff leading to many becoming toxic. A lot in Alberta specifically have toxic blue green algae and it will make you sick if you drink the water or eat the fish. although as long as the fish are properly cleaned and skin removed as well all organs before cooking the fish are ok but still taste funny. </p>

<p>I used to go fishing a lot, some of the lakes the algae is so bad that you couldn&#39;t see more than an inch into the water and some lakes it is extremely thick.</p>
