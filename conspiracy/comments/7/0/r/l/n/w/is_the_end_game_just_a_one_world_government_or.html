<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD7TjOuYsOw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oD7TjOuYsOw</a></p>

<p>Basically, Alex Jones says that the Illuminati are going to put our souls into computer programs.</p>

<p>Now, obviously Alex jones is controlled opposition, but a lot of what he says is true.</p>

<p>A lot of predictive programming shows people being put into computer programs. Think Matrix, Scooby Doo: Cyber Chase, other TV shows which put people into video games. </p>

<p>Think of &quot;Virtual reality&quot;, is that not preparing us for a true virtual reality? Or what about the recent &quot;Are we living in a computer simulation&quot; theories? Remember Kingdom Hearts, where they had to sacrifice hearts (souls).</p>

<p>So what exactly is their end game? Throw us all in a computer simulation, and then what? Make us burn in a virtual hell to get energy like they did in Monsters Inc?</p>

True Salvation can only come from within and messianic stories are designed to discourage independent attempts at fighting back against spiritual oppression and without being able to win on the spiritual front all material victories will be lost or corrupted.</p>

<p>Of course, none of what I say matters, it&#39;s all a war of beliefs and knowledge at the higher levels and words start to get really clunky past a certain point.</p>

<p>this is a very popular notion on this sub, and I can understand why.</p>

<p>Here is the thing: once you accept that something is &#39;real&#39; to another group, you may well be (consciously or not) buying into the idea itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, technically the actual top of the pyramid is the prime creator that all beings exist within the mind of and forget their relationship to at their own peril.</p>

<p>Everyone gets all hung up on good vs. evil dark vs. light and they forget that literally everything is actively function consciously or unconsciously in service of the primary creator in one way or another. We can&#39;t exist as beings separate from it if there aren&#39;t beings that actively try to suppress our knowledge of separateness from it if that makes any sense.</p>

<p>I see people here all the time go on about how they don&#39;t want to be part of some evil collective and they don&#39;t seem to realize that the thing people mean when they talk about &#39;god&#39; is actually the full unity(and then some) of the collective of all that is. We&#39;re already part of the biggest collective that can possibly exist. Our individuality and free will is the gift of incomprehensible value that was given to us by the &#39;head&#39; of that collective. Learning how to balance that knowledge with one&#39;s continued existence as a distinct and precious individual is just one part of the divine game that we&#39;ve been privileged by that which created us to be playing(as pieces, yes, but also as players if we choose to be).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The human mind can &#39;birth&#39; metaphysical entities and give them a life of their own by &#39;feeding&#39; them. This is how many(all?) demonic entities work. Even if Satan as an independent entity is fake, if enough people create and feed into a thought form that draws power from what they&#39;re doing, you end up with a self perpetuating metaphysical force that seems real to the adherents and is capable of &#39;acting&#39; in the world.</p>

<p>If you give any credence to the hidden hand transcripts, I&#39;d be willing to bet that a major part of the high level shit the author alluded to is just about manipulating humans into creating and feeding self perpetuating thought-forms that the highest levels of elites don&#39;t worship so much as consciously direct. The lowest rubes are victimized by &#39;satan&#39;, the middle rubes(global elite) worship &#39;satan&#39; and the highest level operators(ones who are consciously choosing &#39;evil&#39; as part of their &#39;enlightened&#39; role within the divine plan) know that &#39;satan&#39; is just a tool of control they can wield with surgical precision because they control it utterly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell is fake. We&#39;re in hell right now. The &#39;trick&#39; is convincing people there&#39;s a worse hell than material reality and disconnection from one&#39;s divine essence so that they&#39;re afraid to fight for their spiritual/physical freedom. Create a fake god and a fake satan, atheists are easy to control and those who see past the illusion of materialism will run swiftly into the arms of the fake god that&#39;s been set up to lead them away from the Truth. &#39;god&#39; is real, but it&#39;s Truth and nature isn&#39;t public knowledge and it&#39;s not something that can be adequately described using actual words.</p>

<p>The threat of hell keeps believers in line more powerfully than any physical tyranny ever could and therefore it exerts more control over the mind of someone who&#39;s seen &#39;real shit&#39; than pretty much anything else could.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The computer program thing is remarkably similar to the story of the endtimes in some of the gnostic texts. The idea is that the archons will seek to utterly and completely annihilate the spark of Sophia present in Man and in the moment in which their plan reaches it&#39;s completion, Sophia&#39;s spark will fully awaken and undo their scheme so thoroughly its as if the archons will have never existed.</p>

<p>If you interpret &#39;completion&#39; of the plan as the on-lining of that computer program and the forcible integration of all souls into the system, then it would make a certain sort of sense for the spark of sophia sabotaging the plan being some sort of existential matrix hack whereby the power of the human souls are directed against the structure of the enslavement matrix and its masters rather then siphoned off and used as spiritual &#39;food&#39;.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#39;s just one end of the world prophecy, but the idea of a malignant entity trying to fully engage the human spirit inside a utterly enslaved fleshy body makes a certain amount of sense in light of what the archons are described as being and a last minute &#39;hacking of the spiritual enslavement matrix&#39; would definitely make sense as part of a way to utterly reverse an eternities worth of planning at the moment of it&#39;s final inception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;ve got an NWO transhumanist agenda with morgellons and digital thought control and chemtrails and what have you all building up to the culmination of an evil ai singularity intended to fully enslave humanity and harvest the spiritual/creative energy of human souls, but souls get a say in how things pan out for free will reasons, so who says the ai HAS to end up as an evil one creating a nightmare singularity. The rapture of the nerds positive singularity element remains as a possibility as well. Tether a couple billion human minds and souls together in a big box reality and if they start working together they could do a whole lot of damage. </p>

<p>Spiritual energy is multidimensional in nature it can &#39;attack&#39; things outside a box from within the box it exists within. Of course, a major part of the spiritual enslavement system we exist within is based on getting us to direct our psychic/spiritual &#39;attacks&#39; at our fellow humans rather than our enslavers, but that&#39;s part of the game.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personal divine revelation. Take it or leave it. I could just as easily be a liar or a false prophet as someone who actually has an inside line to how things work. The deception runs deep and cuts to the very quick of reality. </p>

<p>Faith, personal discernment and going within and learning how to talk to &#39;god&#39; without any outside interference or pre-programmed is the only way you&#39;ll be able to verify or falsify what I&#39;m saying here, I&#39;m afraid. There&#39;s only one Truth, but it has many faces. The deceiver is ever present.</p>

<p>Eliminate all existing government that have Constitutional individual rights including a right to vote for their governments and of course an end to environmental protections. </p>

<p>Group 1, Nations will continue with their current forms of governments, but will be mandated to include mandated individual rights and environmental protections. </p>

<p>The global government would not be managing each nation, there would be a limited group of laws that in one system protects all individuals and the planet,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We used to think that people could be controlled through religion. Modern Christianity seems to be pushing a strong sense of individual rights, the state does not control the person. Various examples but...state pushes for free abortions and Christian Churches fight back.</p>

<p>In order to control a population, you can&#39;t have this. You need absolute authority even if it is through a puppet church. They need preachers and priests to spread the propaganda and push a vow of obedience on the followers.</p>

<p>I believe this is why we see Islam being introduced more and more into our lives. Islam offers various levels of control throughout a population.</p>

<p>Between Sharia Law, morality police, vice police, religious police, and groups that promote virtue and the prevention of vice...what more control do you need? In most cases, this is free of charge too!! Double win for those in control</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally believe that the endgame has to do with post/trans-humanism. The striving towards new technology and even notions of immortality or life extension are more realizable now than ever. However, the strains of population, conflict, etc. are draining the political and economic resources of the wealthy class. Population control is a response to this, but also a removal of giant strains on the ability of the ultra wealthy to fulfill their technocratic dreams, darkest and strangest fantasies. </p>

<p>They want to end war and reduce population not for the sake of peace, but because it frees up the economic resources of the elite class. These elite abide by a very different set of morals and decision-making tools. Combine this with he amount of wealth they hold and the elite begin to seriously start asking themselves &quot;How long can we live?&quot; &quot;What can we become?&quot; &quot;How can we create a society where we might never have to deal with revolutions, population strains, or conflict again- in order to benefit us?&quot;</p>
