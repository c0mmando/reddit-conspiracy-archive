       The Holy Bible in the book of Revelation states this "world" will not end for at least 1007+ more years (7 years of tribulation, plus 1000 years of Jesus' millennium kingdom, then satan let loose for a short time (thus the "+")) before God-the-Father creates anew Heaven and Earth.

       Agreed.  Sorry, I didn't mean to insinuate that I agreed with the 9/23 date-setting.

      <p>
       If anything, I believe it will be used by non-Christians to further discredit Christianity because the "world" will not end, and anti-Christians will be around to discuss it not occurring - they have, at least, 7 years before the millennium kingdom begins.

       I'm sorry, do you mean in regards to the "7 year tribulation"?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so, I can see how it is debatable.  The following information is more for people reading this than you, please don't take offense to me mentioning what Revelation states (that I can find) in regards to time:
      </p>
      <p>
       There is the following time preceding Jesus Christ's return (in Revelation 19:11-16: "1 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.
12 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.
13 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.
14 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
15 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
16 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written, King Of Kings, And Lord Of Lords."):
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         After the sixth seal opening, in Revelation 7:14 "And he said, 'These are they who have come out of the great tribulation;".   Although no time given on how long "the great tribulation" is
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Revelation 8:1 "silence in heaven for about half an hour"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Fifth angel sounding his trumpet: The locusts from the Abyss power to torture men for 5 months: Revelation 9:5 "They were not given power to kill them, but only to torture them for five months"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The two witnesses, given 1,260 days, Revelation 11:3 "And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Two witnesses brought back to life after 3 1/2 days, Revelation 11:11 "But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them"
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Woman flees to the desert for 1,260 days, in Revelation 12:6 "The woman fled into the desert to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days".  Also known as the "time, times, and half a time" in Revelation 12:14 "....where she would be taken care of for a time, times, and half a time,..."
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       However, this is probably simultaneous with the 42 months of the Beast's kingdom.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Beast's kingdom, in Revelation 13:5 "The beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise his authority for forty-two months."
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Woman on the beast destroyed in one day, Revelation 18:7-8 "Give her as much torture and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself.  In her heart she boasts, 'I sit as queen; I am not a widow, and I will never mourn.' 8 Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her; death, mourning, and famine.  She will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her."
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Then the Rider on the White Horse (Jesus, appears), Revelation 19:11-13 "I saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse, whose rider is called Faithful and True.  With justice he judges and makes war. 12 His eyes are like blazing fire, and on his head are many crowns.  He has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself. 13 He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God."
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, like I mentioned, this is more for anyone interested in the time references before Jesus' second coming in the book of Revelation.

       The thousand year reign is considered judgement "day", a day for a year. This time period will give everyone ever alive both righteous and unrighteous the opportunity to see what life will be like under a different rulership, God's rule. At the end of this time period mankind will once again with full use of our own minds not deceived by the evil one to make their decision. Of course most will choose to fight against this because it doesn't matter if they never go hungry again, have perfect health, no more homelessness etc... people will not be pleased and will once again be easy targets for Satan once he's released and they will all burn up and be destroyed via the second death.

       I disagree that scripture states what you are stating:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The thousand year reign is considered judgement "day", a day for a year.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The thousand year reign is after the first judgment: Revelation 20:4 "4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years."
      </p>
      <p>
       And I disagree that a "day for a year" is accurate: 2 Peter 3:8 "But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This time period will give everyone ever alive both righteous and unrighteous the opportunity to see what life will be like under a different rulership, God's rule.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Scripture disagrees: Revelation 20:5 "5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At the end of this time period mankind will once again with full use of our own minds not deceived by the evil one to make their decision.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Some of mankind; please see Revelation 20:5
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Of course most will choose to fight against this because it doesn't matter if they never go hungry again, have perfect health, no more homelessness etc.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Pure speculation.  The Holy Bible does not state how many will choose Jesus or Satan (once he is set loose from his 1000 year imprisonment).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        people will not be pleased and will once again be easy targets for Satan once he's released and they will all burn up and be destroyed via the second death.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Scripture disagrees. The judgment of the dead: Revelation 20:11 "11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire."
      </p>
      <p>
       And, further scripture reference to state that those who shall reign with Jesus Christ in the millennium kingdom will have no second death : Revelation 5:6 "Blessed and holy are those who have part in the first resurrection.  The
       <strong>
        second death has no power over them
       </strong>
       , but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years"
      </p>
      <p>
       God/Jesus bless.

       I agree with what you said "the opportunity to see what life will be like under a different rulership, God's rule."  It will be awesome, "the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them." Isaiah 11:6, meaning, no more predator/prey eating of each other in nature!
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I don't agree that it will be for "everyone ever alive both righteous and unrighteous", because the scripture in Revelation 20:5 states "The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended", which means the judgment of the dead that will occur after the 1000 years are over, as noted in Revelation 20:13 "...and each person was judged according this what he had done".
      </p>
      <p>
       This means the people who are in Heaven now, plus those who are raptured, and those who are saved before Jesus' second coming "They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years", Revelation 20:4, meaning they are not in Hell/Sehol/Hades when Jesus kingdom begins and ends.

       Anyone who died a Christian prior to the tribulation/great-tribulation, Christians that were raptured, the "left-behinds" who converted to Christianity and did not take the mark-of-the-beast and were beheaded for it, and Jews who convert to Messianic Jews (Messianic Jews are those who the armies at Armageddon will battle).

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        and what people if separate will make it or be destroyed at Armageddon?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Everyone not in the above list will be destroyed when Jesus ends the battle of Armageddon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The battle at Armageddon is to begin in Revelation 16:12, with the destruction of Babylon following the beginning of the battle, and ending with Jesus Christ descending from Heaven with His armies following as stated in Revelation 19:11.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Revelation 20:7-9, when the 1000 years are over (1000 years of Jesus reign and satan's imprisonment), there will be a small battle: "7 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, 8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the people who Satan gathers are the dead from the battle of Armageddon. No where does it state that alive humans are gathered together, and the reference to them being below earth in "8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which
       <strong>
        are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle
       </strong>
       : the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
9
       <strong>
        And they went up on the breadth of the earth,
       </strong>
       "  makes me think these are the dead of the battle of Armageddon that culminated with Jesus' ending of that battle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, these who were dead and gathered again for battle, are killed yet again, as stated in "fire came down from heaven and devoured them".
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, I believe this is how those dead that are to be judged in the Great White Throne judgment are sent to be judged, as in Revelation 20:11-13 "Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it.  Earth and sky fled from his presence, and there was no place for them. 12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened.  And other book was opened, which is the book of life.  The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.  13 The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what he had done."

       Only God-the-Father knows the details; He wrote/planned it.  The best one of His creations can do is look at the times given in Revelation (and the book of Daniel and Ezekiel in the Old Testament).

       I don't think revelations is accurate though, in fact none of those books translated and reprinted by multiple different people and societies over the years make me feel like it's trust worthy. 
We can't even speak the original language, why do you trust these translations ?! Mind boggling.

       It comes down to faith.  The book of Revelation was written in 95 AD, by John the Revelator, in a vision from Jesus Christ concerning the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are very small portions of the book of Revelation coming true now, today, even though the majority of the book hasn't come to fruition, yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I'll go with faith in Jesus Christ and His plan instead of your reasoning and logic.
      </p>

       Best of luck to you in the future.

       You're able to decide for yourself, I would think.  If you think you should believe Nostradamus, that's up to you.  The beauty of free will, as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're asking me my opinion of what you should put faith in, it's Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did "blindly" put my hope, trust, and faith in Jesus when I was a child.  As I aged, I began learning, and then when I was old enough to think about the information, I put my beliefs aside, questioned Jesus and His Word, and it led me back to Jesus and His Word.
      </p>
      <p>
       I currently "blindly" (have faith) follow, trust, hope, and love Jesus.

       Study the history of religion and it becomes apparent that it is always the end times according to someone, somewhere. Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, and all non-major religions have this in their ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself, why it is that humans are so inclined? Is it divinely ingrained? Or is it just a reflection of our inability to properly reckon with our own mortality?

       What Bible are you freaks reading that you think Jesus would ever invite folks through the fear of the End of Days? I mean, I don't believe he was the son of god, possibly a rebel that gained a following and the story had to be amended, but even by biblical accounts, the dude was smart, compassionate, empathic and like benevolent? He never said,
       <em>
        all ya do this water baptism thing or you fry!
       </em>
       shit. Even in the end, he healed a soldier's ear in the garden and pardoned the thieves. Dude was handing out love, not fear.

       Jesus christ is the most influential human being to ever walk this earth. His words have moved more hearts to do good than any other and he only preached and teached for 3 and half years and then died BECAUSE he declared to be the Son of God. The very embodiment of the Spirit of God taking on flesh. He was killef because the Jews didnt hate his miracles or his words of compassion love and truth. But that he declared to be the Son of God. Then after 3 amd half days dead he rose before seeing corruption as the Psalms prophecies declared. Then he was witnessed by over 500 people. Then many of his disciples who were omce basic fishermen were speaking as if educated for years with eloquence and also performed mircales turning thousands daily into believers.  Not like Islam which by war, rape and violence amd threatening caused the middle east and the world to convert.

       We first will see him coming in the clouds. Plus he comes with his kingdom which is in size almost the size of the continental United States according to Revelations. When he comes he will rule with a rod of iron meaning strikt rules. But we all who know love and truth and life will welcome it gladly.

       <p>
        So what people do you think are living during the 1000 years
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Anyone who died a Christian prior to the tribulation/great-tribulation, Christians that were raptured, the "left-behinds" who converted to Christianity and did not take the mark-of-the-beast and were beheaded for it, and Jews who convert to Messianic Jews (Messianic Jews are those who the armies at Armageddon will battle).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        and what people if separate will make it or be destroyed at Armageddon?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Everyone not in the above list will be destroyed when Jesus ends the battle of Armageddon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The battle at Armageddon is to begin in Revelation 16:12, with the destruction of Babylon following the beginning of the battle, and ending with Jesus Christ descending from Heaven with His armies following as stated in Revelation 19:11.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Revelation 20:7-9, when the 1000 years are over (1000 years of Jesus reign and satan's imprisonment), there will be a small battle: "7 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, 8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the people who Satan gathers are the dead from the battle of Armageddon. No where does it state that alive humans are gathered together, and the reference to them being below earth in "8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which
       <strong>
        are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle
       </strong>
       : the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
9
       <strong>
        And they went up on the breadth of the earth,
       </strong>
       "  makes me think these are the dead of the battle of Armageddon that culminated with Jesus' ending of that battle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, these who were dead and gathered again for battle, are killed yet again, as stated in "fire came down from heaven and devoured them".
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, I believe this is how those dead that are to be judged in the Great White Throne judgment are sent to be judged, as in Revelation 20:11-13 "Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it.  Earth and sky fled from his presence, and there was no place for them. 12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened.  And other book was opened, which is the book of life.  The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.  13 The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what he had done."
