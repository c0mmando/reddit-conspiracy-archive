Everyone knows how to get there and that it&#39;s merely a road that goes to a &quot;top secret&quot; base. My question is why hasn&#39;t anyone organized a large scale rush the gates of the base? I imagine 1k people, 4-5 vehicles just driving out there- what could the government do? They couldn&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t shoot everyone- and with live data streaming it would be easy to show the world what&#39;s out there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously- there&#39;s no way that they would run up on 500 vehicles and just start mowing people down with a mini gun. I was in the Army; even in a situation like that, there&#39;s no way at all that they would open fire on us citizens, especially if it was being streamed to the world. I live in Las Vegas- and I have been to both &quot;gates&quot; I have only seen two trucks with a couple guys in each. Knowing SOP&#39;s, I can almost guarantee that physical and actionable security is very, very light. </p>

<p>So back to my original question- why hasn&#39;t this happened or been discussed previously? Are people really that afraid of some over weight guy busting out his M4 and &quot;pew pew pew&quot; ing people at 1k rounds per minute?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes..
They will all deploy their machine guns and just mow a bunch of US citizens down; Wouldn&#39;t happen dude. Let&#39;s talk about he operational capabilities of a &quot;machine&quot; gun. You are talking about something as heavy as a .50, which has ammo cans of 100 rounds and is only accurate is short bursts- not sustained fire. An M16 shoots around 400 - 500 RPM, once again, anything in full auto is not especially accurate. Most infantry and security forces carry the M4- it shoots 3 round bursts- as for ammo, the average infantry carries around 300 rounds. I guarantee these dudes aren&#39;t carrying that; they are on YouTube running up on people and they usually only have sidearms. Sorry to burst your bubble homey- but the machine guns aren&#39;t going to stop anyone, and they wouldn&#39;t use them anyways. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a mini-gun. Super fun. Accurate-
Sure. They aren&#39;t a lot of them in service due to the ammo use and maintenance- I would be surprised if they rolled up with one. 
You cannot use them for heavy sustained fire-
Short bursts only, you run out of ammo and have to reload in less than a minute. 
The M2 is the .50 I mentioned. An old but goodie, accurate? Eh. Not with sustained fire..anyways, If you want to believe they would open up on people that&#39;s cool-
I disagree.</p>

I&#39;d like to know what&#39;s really in the Area 51 complex, but they will shoot any one coming through.  I think the same number of people proposed, doing research by any possible methods, could be a better use for them.

I&#39;m inviting you to Vegas to have a legit discussion face to face since you seem to be so educated on our military and I would love to show you what you think you know may be very incorrect- and yes, finally, I would love for you Antifa guys to show up and have a good ole throw down- your whole theme seems to be talk a bunch of shit and smash up a Starbucks; don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time to put up or shut up? Since I was just a stooge for the man, it should be easy for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Motherfucker-
The insults need to stop, no one asked for your support and I don&#39;t give a fuck if you support the troops or not. No one here except you started the anti government / military shit and I never asked for your fucking support. I already know (based on your unprovoked and pathetic insults)  you are a coward- so trust me when I say, you are a joke and so is your &quot;Antifa&quot; cause. The sad thing is even though you are a total little bitch, I completely support your right to say it- but you need to back off with the personal shit and insults. </p>

<p>Anyways- You are just an internet tough guy, probably sitting in your room yelling at your mom to bring you another glass of milk. I&#39;d love for you to say any of this to my face. I&#39;m very confident you wouldn&#39;t. </p>

<p>So if you would like to have a legit and fun discussion about my original post- go right ahead. If not, send me your address and I&#39;ll come to you since I&#39;m pretty sure your parents won&#39;t let you borrow the car and you don&#39;t make enough money for a plane ticket working at Teavana.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think I don&#39;t realize that after I got out. U told you before. Antifa is being encouraged by the thing you hate and against. Antifa is being used so there is no antiwar movement, to prevent people from jumping ship so they don&#39;t end up in a draft. Whether you like it or not if you per say are arrested when the time comes. You will be given an option to join selective service or face jail time. From the looks of the antifa crowd i don&#39;t think you would make along side with the Aryan brotherhood or any other gang installment in there. Antifa in the upcoming months are going to push so many people that either love ya or just don&#39;t mind them and switch to the alt right. I&#39;m trying to give you advice and tell ya what&#39;s coming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry dude, no legit soldier, regardless of training, &quot;loyalty&quot; or as Antifa Douche said, &quot;Stooge&quot; would open fire on an unarmed civilian without threat of bodily harm to himself or his team; regardless of orders. My query wasn&#39;t to imply that anyone would rush the gates and put in harms way any of those security forces. The worst case scenario would be the terrain creates a bottleneck and they disable a few vehicles creating an impass where they can then control the crowds. But no, they wouldn&#39;t, couldn&#39;t and never would open fire on civilians who did not threaten bodily harm. Of course that&#39;s my opinion and experience-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually a really good point that an ex-soldier may be able to answer. I heard that paper doing the rounds a while back about how some soldiers were given a questionairre about whether or not they would fire on American citizens if ordered to. Now obviously if there&#39;s people shooting at you and trying to kill you you&#39;ll shoot back - but let&#39;s lay out a story:</p>

<p>You and 100 of your most average, normal, non-crazy awesome selfless soldiers (of which I&#39;m sure there are a huge amount) are guarding a base (in the us), and 100 people with signs and shit come up to the front gate and start protesting. Or even rattling the gate/trying to get in. But nobody is armed and nobody is shooting at you. Your CO orders your platoon or unit or whatever you call it to fire on the protesters. How many of your comrades would pull the trigger? Im sure there are a significant amount of psycopaths and just plain &quot;killers&quot; that join the army - what would happen, in your opinion, directly after that order is given?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great question. First and foremost- when I was in, many, many years ago, the Army and Marines recruited very selectively, especially for Infantry and combat roles. We went through a lot of very specific testing to make sure we weren&#39;t &quot;nuts&quot;. Of course some got through, and a lot of people I know didn&#39;t handle things well while we were there or afterwards. However, we were trained to be soldiers, to take orders and to ultimately use our own moral compass to protect our team and ourselves. I never heard any CO make any reference to killing civilians- we didn&#39;t trust them, ever. But just kill them- never. However, when it came down to it, we are trained to kill. We are also trained in crowd control using NON Lethal methods, similar, but more aggressive than what you have seen the police do. If you are asking me what my experience is, no one in my unit would have accepted that command, but would rather go non lethal and face the heat that would come and ultimately fail. The sad thing is, when you are talking about 100 guys on the line, the chances of there being one or two weak links who crack are very high, but I am sure that after a few shots where fired he would be taken down and secured. Now your crowd of 500 protesters, untrained and emotional, they are much more likely to engage with lethal force, some dumb ass is very likely to pop off with daddies hunting rifle, but assuming the soldiers have seen combat, they know that firing into a crowd of 99.9 percent unarmed civilians means life in prison, the asshole with the gun however, you would definitely not wanting to be standing behind him..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. Thank you so much for your well thought out answer. And forgetting that we are on a conspiracy board and everyone else is giving you shit - I wasn&#39;t born an American, I&#39;m a dual citizen in England and the US. But I have the utmost respect for you and every single other enlisted man and woman who joined to fight for their country. I may not like or agree with many of any moves the US (or UK, for that matter..) military has taken in the last 20 years, but absolutely none of that is the fault of the brave men and women who joined up to fight for freedom. So thank you. For everything you and your brothers have done in the name of protecting every soul everywhere who you guys have saved. Sure, there have been atrocities. But I put them squarely at the feet of the upper command - for the large number of enlisted men and women I have met, I have nothing but thanks and respect.</p>

<p>Now, imagine the same question, but say martial law has been implemented. The US military is deployed within the US, and has been ordered to fire on US citizens in the street (so the point you made of the soldiers fearing legal repercussions is nullified). Do you still stand by your answer that only a tiny percentage of those men would carry out that order?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the kind words.</p>

<p>But to answer your question- you are talking about Martial Law, a completely different scenario. The only way the US Military would actively be deployed is if there was a threat to the nation as a whole. In that scenario you would see the National Guard units first, they are going to be more of a passive security first - enforcing curfews, doing inspections. If the situation escalated to the point of a full on Military campaign on US soil against US Citizens, I don&#39;t think it would happen. You are basically referring to a civil war, and it kind of goes back to what we talked about earlier; the soldiers wouldn&#39;t do it.
However there is a situation where I see what you are talking about happening- </p>

<p>Our government flips and becomes Socialist bordering on Communism; The government orders the troops to secure the population and round up dissenters and disarm the population- at that point what would happen IMO is that about 60-70 percent of our active duty forces would abandon their posts, leaving a vacuum of trained and combat experienced soldiers. The government would then recruit and perhaps even conscript younger and less experienced young men and women (think Antifa kids) who believe in that cause (socialism/communism) to fight and replace those who left- at that point you would have a full on civil war, and while the government would have a larger arsenal and all the equipment, the sheer numbers of dissenters and their combined experience would crush the military and government. It would be messy for sure. </p>

<p>So to summarize my answer; the moment the order is given under martial law to fire on Us Citizens you will have mass dissent across all ranks,
Those left will be morally on the fence and even the most ardent members will be without the support needed to mount that kind of anti insurgency operation. </p>

<p>I look forward to it...</p>

<p>But I am a little off.</p>

<p>First, yes they would mow down citizens, and secondly, they have riot known riot gear that can render crowds useless from sound and heat waves. You also get into like you said, there is only one road in, it would be very easy to see 1000 people coming and prepare.</p>

I know little bitches like you; In Afghanistan they would take shots at us from houses and then run out behind women and children, leaving their weapons behind. Here in the states, you are calling yourselves &quot;Antifa&quot; and act like you are doing some sort of Social Justice Warrior
project, when all you are doing is making your case weaker; you aren&#39;t American, you are becoming exactly what you are pretending to fight against. So here&#39;s my challenge to you- come to Vegas, I&#39;ll show you how to be a man. If you are too cowardly to do that, join the military, become an officer and work to make the improvements you seem to believe need to be made. Or, if that&#39;s not good enough for you, you gather up all your friends with beards, you know, the hipster, scarf wearing sissies you call friends, and I&#39;ll get all my friends with beards, let&#39;s meet up and see who wins..here&#39;s my prediction; it&#39;s not your side. </p>
