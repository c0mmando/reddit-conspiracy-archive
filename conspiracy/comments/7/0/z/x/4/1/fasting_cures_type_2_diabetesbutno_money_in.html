        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The fact that fasting cures diabetes has been known for close to 100 years! </p>

<p>One of the most famous diabetologists in the history of the world – Dr. Elliot Joslin wrote about it in the Canadian Medical Association Journal in 1916! In fact, he thought that it was so obvious that fasting was helpful that studies would not even be necessary. This, from the guy that Harvard University used to name its world famous Joslin Center for Diabetes.</p>

<p>What happened to Joslin and fasting for diabetes? </p>

<p>Well, back then, medical science had not yet distinguished Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes back then. Fasting is not useful for type 1, and type 2 was still quite unusual back then. After the discovery of insulin in the early 1920’s, all the focus turned to it as the ‘cure’ for diabetes. While it was a major advance for type 1, it was not quite the panacea for type 2s. </p>

<p>However, most of the interest in fasting disappeared as doctors focused on what would be their mantra for the next century – drugs, drugs, drugs. All types of dietary therapy fell into disrepute, since they were really not useful in type 1 diabetes, and have stayed there ever since.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This comment doesn&#39;t deserve to stand at -5 as it does right now. Sure many doctors will frown upon the idea of fasting, as they can be just as indoctrinated as anyone else. But there <em>are</em> sympathetic ones; for example <a href="https://www.interludebienetre.ch/retreats">this</a> fasting retreat center in Switzerland employs many such doctors.</p>

<p>That being said I don&#39;t think it is necessary for a responsible adult to consult a health practitionner for this; just know when to stop and be aware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refeeding_syndrome">refeeding syndrome</a> (i.e. don&#39;t gorge yourself on Burger King to break fast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not a doctor, don&#39;t take this as medical advice.</p>

<p>I learned about fasting from a book called <a href="https://www.drfuhrman.com/shop/products/95/fasting-and-eating-for-health">Fasting and Eating for Health by Joel Fuhrman, M.D.</a> I would recommend it as he&#39;s an M.D. but promotes alternative approaches to disease prevention such as nutrition and fasting. </p>

<p>I ended up quitting his diet because it was very time-consuming and expensive to stick with it, and he hawks a bunch of expensive supplements which I&#39;m not crazy about either. But on the whole I think this guy is about as good as it gets when it comes to popular books about dieting and fasting. </p>

<p>He says in the above book that you can safely fast for up to three days without any supervision. If you want to fast for longer, he says you NEED to work with a doctor. Plus there may be certain medical conditions where you shouldn&#39;t be fasting at all if you have them. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t mind the downvotes. Overall I find fasting an interesting option, but I&#39;m just sharing what I&#39;ve read... that it can harmful if you don&#39;t do it right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on your goals and your experience. Research suggests that three days is long enough to completely rebuild your immune system from scratch. There&#39;s some studies showing that 7 days is almost always enough to remove the need for drugs to help control t2d and reverse non-alcoholic fatty liver. If you&#39;re aiming for weight loss and general health you may want to spend a few months doing 2-4 days of fasting once a week.</p>

<p>Single day fasts are good, but  each cond]consecutive day in a multiday fast is more &#39;productive&#39; than the day before it. So a four day fast is better than four one day fasts, but one day or even 16-18 hour fasts have measurable benefits if done as part of a routine.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a handful of health conditions and medications that counter-indicate  fasting, so if your considering doing it do your research and make sure you don&#39;t have any of the (relatively uncommon) conditions that interfere with fasting and make sure your not on any meds that mess with it. Sadly, it&#39;s very DIY at the moment so while fasting is generally safe, you have to do your own research and learn how to listen to what your body is telling you.</p>

<p>I spent a few months building up to 3-4 day long weekly fasts, eventually routinely doing 4-5 day weekly fasts. At ,y peak I did a 27 day one and a few ones out past ten days, but I&#39;d only recommend those types of things for people who are experienced and know what they&#39;re doing. I was/am an unemployed weirdo with a penchant for taking things further than people in my life would consider wise, but thats where the magic is as long as you know how to not hurt yourself.</p>

<p>Read Dr. Jason Fung&#39;s essays on his website and watch his lectures/read his book on fasting. You can&#39;t go wrong if you follow his advice. There&#39;s other techniques and approaches, but it&#39;s the best place to start if you&#39;re new to the topic. There&#39;s an adaptation period that usually takes 2-3 days if you can get past it you&#39;ll feel an amazing sense of clarity and your hunger and desire for food will vanish as if by magic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>water fasting is an amazing thing.  I&#39;ve never heard of it curing diabetes but I wouldn&#39;t doubt it.  I&#39;ve done a couple 3 day fasts and a 4 day fast.  Something I&#39;ve noticed while on a fast is how focused my mind becomes.  All senses become heightened.  I had no particular illness I was trying to cure, but had read so many historical accounts of the benefits and wanted to try it.  </p>

<p>After a fast, once I started eating again, my skin would be glowing.  My girlfriend was telling me how fresh my breath smelled.  It was like my whole body was purified.  And not to get too graphic, but on the last day of one of my fasts, I had to run to the bathroom, and ended up expelling parasites.  </p>

<p>It seems that whenever I read about water fasting, its usually people with eating disorders just looking to lose weight.  Water fasting WILL NOT make you lose weight long term.  Once you start eating again, your metabolism is basically shut down, and you get at least back to the weight you started within a week, if not a little heavier.  If you fast to lose weight you won&#39;t have any luck, I promise.  </p>

<p>Water fasting is for cleansing and healing the body, and works best with a calm mind and in a calm peaceful environment, where you spend all day and all night just resting and relaxing.  I highly recommend people try a water fast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Water fasting outright cures t2d in almost all cases if the subject can make it to 7 days from the research I&#39;ve seen. There&#39;s a doctor in Canada Dr. Jason Fung who&#39;s cured thousands, maybe tens of thousands by now, of t2d patients and t2d is only a teeny bit of what it can do like you said. </p>

<p>Fasting literally saves money, so it&#39;s cheaper than doing nothing and its potential savings in global t2d costs alone is measurable in hundreds of billions of dollars... It&#39;s a medical treatment that if properly utilized may very well be able to reduce global medical costs by trillions with a t annually, but the only big research on the topic is by rich silicon valley billionaires who are concerned about longevity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea the medical industry will never research or advocate fasting.  I think its sad that it also tends to attract people with eating disorders, which doesn&#39;t help the cause of advocating fasting for its health benefits.</p>

<p>In my experience, fasting also can eliminate food addictions.  Its like it resets your body.  Before my first fast, I was pretty much addicted to wheat.  I couldn&#39;t go a day without either bread or pasta.  No amount of white rice or any other refined grain would cut it.  I thought this was normal.  </p>

<p>After the fast, I no longer had any kind of addiction to wheat.  I still liked bread or pasta, but there were no cravings for it anymore.  I was just as happy eating rice or some other grain.  Its as if fasting resets the body when you&#39;re having an abnormal reaction to a food.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is amazing how easily your body takes to it. In my experience. You have good and bad days but then just eat. It&#39;s flexible. I find it liberating and a great way to be frugal because you are not wasting time at the grocery store or preparing so many meals. And with a bit of research, you can find a lot of tips and tricks to make it easier like coffee and tea are allowed. The better quality tea and coffee the better your body will adjust. I enjoy it. Seems to really be the way my body like to function. I was sick recently (a cold from my child) so I haven&#39;t gotten back on it yet but will soon. I usually fast 18 hours from after dinner to about 3 pm and eat from then until about 9 PM. Also eating larger meals last is also against what we have been taught but in my experience, it really does make you feel good and you don&#39;t feel guilty about eating a big meal at night. Also, find it funny that no one acknowledges that Ori Hofmekler the author of the warrior diet around 2000 is the one that brought this back into the consciousness. They all act like they did. (certain doctors who I actually do like and enjoy reading and watching their videos on youtube so will remain nameless.) Non the less it is good. For me. Maybe not you. I acknowledge that. </p>
