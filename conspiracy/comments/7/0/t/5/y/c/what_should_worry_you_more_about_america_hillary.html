       I'm not the guy you're asking, but there's nothing at all to "worry" about ultimately. However, both are things that if you want to work towards improving society you should concern yourself with. It's not about choosing. It's about learning how to most adequately distribute your attention and focus, and then being able to apply measures in your own life and how you act in society that will contribute to manifesting that change as best as can be.
       <br/>
       "Worry" is a whole 'nother thing. Worry is an irrelevant emotion... Well less of an emotion and more of an emotional processing short circuit. When you worry you're not thinking in reality in the here and now. You're in a made up, possible (though not actualized) idea of reality. When a situation concerns you, due to its possible future implications, if you can change it then change it, if you can't, then accept it, or alternatively remove yourself from the situation entirely so it does not concern you. It's a choice. "Worry" is the state of not being able to make your mind up in the moment.

       Eloquently said, but not necessarily correct. For myself, worry is a way to see all (reasonable) possible futures, which allows me to make decision chains that will give me the best shot at reaching the most desirable outcome of any scenario. Worry isn't an idle emotionsuck and/or mindfuck, it's a very valuable tool when properly used.

The police shut down a legitimate rally in Charlottesville, yet these alt-righters, broke no private property, loud no store and blocked no road, like BLM has done in 8 years of Obama, and continue to do.

       You're gonna have to explain this one. Which conservatives do you perceive to be the creators of BLM and Antifa?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I don't think their creators are either conservatives nor progressives in any sense of the words. They're obviously using leftist values to rile up an army of useful idiots from the left and racist/supremacist values to rile up an army of useful idiots on the right, but those who are pulling the strings believe in neither ideology. All they desire is more control.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are legitimate grievances on both sides, as well as illogical, manufactured demands and grievances on both sides too. It's still weird how much the media persecutes one side so heavily while excusing or even glorifying the other.

       Well, there are elements on both sides that are ready to commit violence as well as elements who try to keep things civil, but I certainly agree that it's an active strategy to give one side the appearance of a legitimate protest, while decrying the opposition's protest as bigoted and not tolerated. That violent element within the encouraged group will be more quick to act on their impulses, as they think they're covered by the will of the nation, so to speak. That makes the leftist radical groups currently more dangerous than the radicals on the right. But make no mistake. There are radicals on both sides, and given enough encouragement, the right is just as prepared to let violence reign as the left is.

       I was a little drunk last night and made a few drive by comments. I read  "Hillary has -0- power even among Democratic voters" and you read my comment. Drunk Rick. She may have lost power due to losing the election but make no mistake, she is one of the most powerful people in the nation/world. Her and Bill have friends in high and low places. The Clinton's and the Bush's are old drug smuggling buddies from the Reagan years.

       I say it was a practice run for riot squads. The Loop had high tech surveillance put in years ago for Obama's visit and the Presidential debates.

       This was a coordinated practice effort using ground troops, helicopters, drones, and the latest in surveillance cameras on public streets.

       If you're wondering about st.louis, people are upset how the MSM created a false narrative about Mike Brown. First his friend that was with him told to the truth on local news after everything died down that the whole " hands up don't shoot" thing didn't happen and then cell phone videos popped up with him actually charging the cop. 
Second people realized before the verdict, that schools were being sgut down including the businesses. It was the national guard weekend of duty anyway and they have been training for civil unrest. They waited for the st.lohis cardinals to have an away game so Busch stadium wouldn't be vandalized. We also had a police and military presence at the hospital I work at. 
It was also the judges last case b4 retirement and had already bought a new home 3 weeks before hand out of state and the cop fled down to Texas 3 weeks prior.

       It's Trump and Bernie people desperately trying to keep people from noticing what's going on in this country.

       It's so weird that their hatred of Hillary blinds them to the burgeoning police state.  They're convinced that the police make no mistakes, and everyone they arrest and/or kill is guilty.

       Leave her alone! It was her time! Stop being super predators! Trump is a racist! You probably didn't even read her book. If you did, you would realize she is a great woman.

       BLM and antifa are creations of the conservatives, just like you alt-righters.
