<p>Why is it being promoted by porn sites? Why are the viewers okay with this?</p>

<p>Will the whole new generation be trying to fuck their mothers and stepsisters?</p>

<hr/>

<p>What is it like to grow up with the internet anyway? Was I the last generation to learn about sex from actually having it, not from watching fake incest rape on the internet?</p>

They have massive numbers of &#39;conspiracy theorists&#39;, that are just as complacent  as the  other half of the masses who are entirely deaf to news and war.  Kudos to TPTB for their hundreds of years of steadiness.

<p>Definitely agreed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wouldn’t go as far as to say commended, but it does indeed involve an extreme amount of intelligence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Kudos?  Serious?  Naw, man.  You don’t give kudos to that.  You acknowledge it - certainly.  Know your enemy and respect what they can do kind of thing.  However, you don’t give <em>kudos</em> to it.  You work against it is what you do.</p>

<p>It’s not about any <em>one</em> individual doing anything.  YOU and <em>me</em> and all of us need to come together and do things <em>together</em>.</p>

<p>THAT’S what will really and truly make the change.</p>

<p>If one lone fifteen year old did what you mentioned here, then nothing would ultimately change still because the rest of the world’s citizenry are <em>still</em> in the doldrums and not doing what we need to be doing.  TPTB would quickly sequester the technology, rip it from the people, use it for themselves, and simply continue manipulating the public - likely even more so than before since they have new technology they didn’t have before.  The main problem is that we’re not coming together and working passed all this separatist propaganda bullshit.</p>

<p>I didn’t downvote you, by the way.  However, I would say that we can’t pass off on anyone else what we need to be doing together.</p>

<p>That’s the only way through this.</p>

<p>THAT, I feel, is what people need to be getting out of these comments.  I personally would like people to read these exchanges, and get more and more motivated to keep coming together as one united species; putting down all the bullshit, indoctrinated racism and separatism that makes us all weaker as a result, coming together, and working TOGETHER against tptb b.s.</p>

<p>Both uniting and acting are big jumps for us as humanity. They don&#39;t want us to unite because acting is the easier second step. I respect Our foe&#39;s abilities and deviousness, the same I actually respect Hillary for her ability to pursue her aims with no moral qualms at all. She should still be in jail for the rest of her life but I appreciate her devotion to her goals at any cost at all</p>

<p>Boom.  Exactly this, sir.  Exactly this.</p>

<p>As far as respecting Clinton and others like her goes, I’d say that I respect them in the sense that one respects an enemy - i.e. I acknowledging that they aren’t harmless and one has to be very careful with them - but I still very much feel we need to definitely come together and bring it all down.</p>

Like some have said, jerking it to a Sears catalog was all they had, so when they see a naked woman it&#39;s like Christmas. Now these kids who grew up with the internet expect super hot chicks with huge boobs to demand to suck their dick. Obviously the porn world is far from reality.</p>

<p>Give me a break.</p>

<p>No offense, but the way you single out incest porn makes me just question whether or not you simply have a bone to pick with that particular fetish, suggesting that your argument is biased thus your logic is flawed. Sorry.</p>
