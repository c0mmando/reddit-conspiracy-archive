        U.S. Military Helps Create Hollywood Films on War and Warriors
       </p>
       <p>
        The Pentagon’s partnership with Hollywood starts at this West Los Angeles office tower, where every branch of the military keeps a liaison office to the entertainment industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Our mission here is to get the Navy onto the big screen and the little screen every chance we get, with every production that wants to use us. I’ll be blatant about it: We’re trying to get the Navy out there."
       </p>
       <p>
        And what do Hollywood studios want in return for giving the military screen time? "Usually, it’s equipment. Usually, they’re looking for toys. For them, we’re a provider. We’re a supplier, like everybody else. And Hollywood, they want the real thing. If they can get the real thing, they want the real thing.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you want the military's assistance, you have to give them five copies of your script. They review the script. They make changes to the script to make it conform to the kind of film that they want to see. Most Americans have no idea that the content of the films and TV shows that they're watching are being influenced by military censors, that the military or the government is telling filmmakers what to say and what not to say.

        How the CIA Helped Make “Zero Dark Thirty”
       </p>
       <p>
        When Zero Dark Thirty premiered in 2012, the Hollywood film about the hunt for Osama bin Laden became a blockbuster hit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Behind the scenes, the CIA secretly worked with the filmmakers, and the movie portrayed the agency’s controversial “enhanced interrogation techniques” — widely described as torture — as a key to uncovering information that led to the finding and killing of bin Laden... but the massive Senate torture report released in December 2014 found that the program was brutal, mismanaged and — most importantly — didn’t work.

       A few lines that sum it up, although everyone should read the whole article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Files we obtained, mainly through the US Freedom of Information Act, show that between 1911 and 2017, more than 800 feature films received support from the US Government’s Department of Defence (DoD), a significantly higher figure than previous estimates indicate. These included blockbuster franchises such as Transformers, Iron Man, and The Terminator.
       </p>
       <p>
        On television, we found over 1,100 titles received Pentagon backing – 900 of them since 2005

       This reminds me of Independence Day. I'll try to find the clip after work but the air force was heavily involved in helping with that movie. However, they pulled all support when the movie would not drop the area 51 subplot
