       I'm not arguing with you, per se, but what does this have to do with Russia? Hillary, an American, said to Cooper, also an American, that the pizzagate (albeit a global conspiracy, on Reddit it is usually focused on America) insanity was worse than watergate (an American political scandal). Because of (what I assume are) reasons; twitchy, maniacally laughing, verge of collapse-y reasons...

       Nah. Seth was about to go work for Hillary. And he wasn't a hacker. Nobody have up their email passwords. So there was no leak. Those emails were hacked. And Russia did it.

       Also, the one where seeking justice for an unsolved murder is somehow "political". I could care less whether it was a dem or repub or whatever, the people responsible need to be found.

       You dont care about justice at all. If the dc police said they found his killer and it was a crack head named Steve, would you believe them?

      <p>
       No, you wouldn't. The only answer you will accept is the DNC had him killed. You will accept no other answer. Which means all this bullshit is political. You dont actually give a flying fuck about Seth Rich. Stop pretending you do.

       This is a joke right? You're the one with the theory here. I'm just going off the current reality. Which is that Seth didn't hack the DNC. Let me know when that becomes more than a theory.

       Ok.

       Ok so him saying a blatantly false statement means he's a Russian agent/shill/dick holster/other word-of-the-week?

       Pizzagate had almost no bearing on the election.

       What does her blatantly false statement make her?

       Russian meddling is still just fluff in the wind.
What cost her the election was a combination of her being unrelentingly Hillary Clinton, her being obviously unwell, and her conspiring with the DNC to steal the election from the actually popular candidate.

       Besides, Assange is dead, and captured, and a robot as well as a Russian. He's a busy guy apparently.

       Not to mention if Trump is the Russian red-eyed devil you all say he is then you should hate Hillary even more than most, as SHE HANDED HIM THE PRESIDENCY. He is where he is because she sincerely believed she had the right to purchase the throne. Had she bowed out, or just not run ever, then Trump would be back to losing his own money on hotels, schools, steaks and whatever else, and Bernie would be on the throne.

       There is zero evidence in Pizzagate, and enough evidence in regards to the Russia investigation that a special prosecutor was appointed.

       Are you equally as attuned to the amount of meddling the US has done in the rest of the world? Is it any surprise then that there would be other countries doing the same thing? They have been doing this for years. Meddling isn't new, but acting like Russia somehow came in and made millions of Americans vote for Trump is a bit of a stretch and giving them way to much credit.

       Yeah the US has definitely meddled. But what kind of government do you believe in? The goal when the US meddles in elections is spreading democracy and global stability. The goal when Russia meddles is to undermine democracy all over the world. So what do you want the world to look more like? Russia, Iran, and North Korea? Or would you rather more countries look like Western Europe and the US and Canada? Russia wants one thing. We want the other. I side with the other.

       Well there are places where democracy isn't an option. When that's the case, we go for stability. That's why we backed people like Sadaam Husein for a while. It was the stable choice. You can laugh all you want but it's clear you don't really know what you're talking about. I guess you'd rather side with Russia and have brutal dictators all over the world.

       So we meddle to install democracy until we don't for "stability" reasons. I'm not siding with Russia. I just think it's naive to believe the US has been so noble. It's also very ethnocentric to believe the US knows best.

       You obviously don't get it. When there are two options in an area, we pull for the most stable option. If democracy is possible, we pull for that. Like in Egypt. We really hoped that would work out but it still unraveled. Maybe I'm being ethnocentric but yeah voting for your leaders and peacefully handing off power to the other side seems a lot cooler than brutal dictators. Maybe that's my ethnocentric opinion. Or maybe that's kind of just fucking common sense.

       The massive misinformation campaign that included Pizzagate had a huge bearing on the election. It's starting to become public now, but when the investigations are complete you're going to see that Pizzagate was only a small part of the conspiracy based political messaging that flooded social media and the Internet in general during the election.

       You may be correct, but the media hitmen were out in force for/against both sides. The whole thing, the entire election cycle, was a diversion, a circus to keep people busy and looking the wrong way. I mean, Hillary and Trump? Really? You couldn't ask for a more riveting shitshow...

       There is no proof or evidence that Julian Assange or Wikileaks is not Russian propaganda, and until someone here can point out evidence that he is not that's what I have to go with based on everything that I've read and studied so far...

       funny how Hillary (in linked CNN interview) summarises pgate by mentioning an email with the word pizza in it... how about the 'hot tub' email... the threats against the guy who discovered Alefantis' other property... the Jeffrey Dahmer statue in Podesta's house... the list goes on but it's not up to me to report on that stuff, I'm not the f***ing journalist.

       Revealing the truth is misinformation to shillies, it's very transparent. The Russia nonsense is a litmus test for anyone in this sub, at this point. It was not here pre-election. True CTers know it's just a ruse to make up for the fact that every DeepState swamp thing had their eggs in the HRC basket and she fucking lost.

       This post is nothing more than paragraphs full of misinformation.

       Pizzagate was a manufactured political attack tool, that is part of a much larger political strategy.

       And when the Mueller investigation is finished, and they force Facebook to release the full extent of the fake news that originated on its platform, the guys like you will be forced to admit that you were duped.

       You obviously don't get it. When there are two options in an area, we pull for the most stable option. If democracy is possible, we pull for that. Like in Egypt. We really hoped that would work out but it still unraveled. Maybe I'm being ethnocentric but yeah voting for your leaders and peacefully handing off power to the other side seems a lot cooler than brutal dictators. Maybe that's my ethnocentric opinion. Or maybe that's kind of just fucking common sense.

       This is a joke right? You're the one with the theory here. I'm just going off the current reality. Which is that Seth didn't hack the DNC. Let me know when that becomes more than a theory.
