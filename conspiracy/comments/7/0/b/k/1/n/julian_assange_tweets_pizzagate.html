Hillary, an American, said to Cooper, also an American, that the pizzagate (albeit a global conspiracy, on Reddit it is usually focused on America) insanity was worse than watergate (an American political scandal). Because of (what I assume are) reasons; twitchy, maniacally laughing, verge of collapse-y reasons...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok.</p>

<p>Ok so him saying a blatantly false statement means he&#39;s a Russian agent/shill/dick holster/other word-of-the-week?</p>

<p>Pizzagate had almost no bearing on the election.</p>

<p>What does her blatantly false statement make her?
Oh! North Korea is all over the buzzword machine these days! Let&#39;s say she&#39;s Kim&#39;s dick holster!</p>

<p>This <em>is</em> fun, no wonder you people do it.</p>

<p>Russian meddling is still just fluff in the wind.
What cost her the election was a combination of her being unrelentingly Hillary Clinton, her being obviously unwell, and her conspiring with the DNC to steal the election from the actually popular candidate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok man.</p>

<p>You win.</p>

<p>I forgot all about vault 7 and the endless river of lack of actual evidence for Russian meddling in this election...</p>

<p>Besides, Assange is dead, and captured, and a robot as well as a Russian. He&#39;s a busy guy apparently.</p>

<p>Not to mention if Trump is the Russian red-eyed devil you all say he is then you should hate Hillary even more than most, as SHE HANDED HIM THE PRESIDENCY. He is where he is because she sincerely believed she had the right to purchase the throne. Had she bowed out, or just not run ever, then Trump would be back to losing his own money on hotels, schools, steaks and whatever else, and Bernie would be on the throne.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You obviously don&#39;t get it. When there are two options in an area, we pull for the most stable option. If democracy is possible, we pull for that. Like in Egypt. We really hoped that would work out but it still unraveled. Maybe I&#39;m being ethnocentric but yeah voting for your leaders and peacefully handing off power to the other side seems a lot cooler than brutal dictators. Maybe that&#39;s my ethnocentric opinion. Or maybe that&#39;s kind of just fucking common sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You obviously don&#39;t get it. When there are two options in an area, we pull for the most stable option. If democracy is possible, we pull for that. Like in Egypt. We really hoped that would work out but it still unraveled. Maybe I&#39;m being ethnocentric but yeah voting for your leaders and peacefully handing off power to the other side seems a lot cooler than brutal dictators. Maybe that&#39;s my ethnocentric opinion. Or maybe that&#39;s kind of just fucking common sense. </p>
