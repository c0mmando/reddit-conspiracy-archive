       It is a complex decision. On one hand, they would love to say Julian Assange is a crazy conspiracy theorist. On the other hand, they are afraid people might look at it and think pizzagate might not be a baseless conspiracy theory after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far the strategy seems to be : We don't talk about it. It might change in the future. If they don't want to talk about it, it means we SHOULD talk about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT : Look at the brigading right now. Exemple : "Why isn't the media talking about flat earth? There's a Wikipedia page on it but for some reason the lamestream media only wants to talk about Cassini!
Wake up sheeple!!!!" with five upvotes currently. Do you actually believe these upvotes are legit ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please upvote for visibility as there is clearly some brigading going with coordinated downvotes to bury this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT : When I say the media doesn't talk about it, I'm not talking about pizzagate in general : I am talking about the specific fact that there is a page dedicated to pizzagate on Wikileaks. It should be news, because even according to their narrative, they should report it as "Wikileaks promoting conspiracy theories", which IS news, given the importance and credibility of Wikileaks.

       Exactly! Everyone knows that if there's a few voices loudly shouting something people believe to be untrue, that won't make people believe it to be more true - it has the
       <em>
        opposite
       </em>
       effect. By carefully placing a few voices here and there who claim there's a communist invasion of America, it ensures that people won't pay attention to it. Basically the same thing as conspiracies in general and flat earthing.

       It's a community research page. They probably have to do that for legal reasons. Pizzagate is real. Don't try and pull that "no evidence" bullshit, and if you try and tell me that Alefantis' Instagram isn't pedophilic in nature then you're defending pedophilia.

       I think Wikileaks's may have started with good intentions but now it's simply an avenue for assange to attack his perceived enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a big fan of Snowden because to me he seems pure in his desire for more transparency. Snowden seems to me to be someone of historical significance not because that's what he wants but because his motives are pure and I think privacy is kind of the civil rights of my age group.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange seems to be someone who desires notoriety and he is in my opinion a partisan hack and Wikileaks's is his own personal propaganda arm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yea I know people will say they have never leaked a fake document and that very well maybe true, but that doesn't mean the can sensationalize and editorialize information like they do, which by the way they do with a distinct partisan skew.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange personally tells you what to think of whatever leaks. I'm sorry but Hillarys emails didn't have anything truest nefarious in them, but Wikileaks's chose to act like they included a secret child molestation code, which lacked the slightest bit of actual evidence. An organization without bias wouldn't behave that way, if Wikileaks's leaked info and let readers interpret it themselves I'd think they were doing good work but that's not what they do. They are pretty much like CNN running the break news graphic for every story, they're media not some safe haven for truth. They could be that but they have made the conscious decision to sensationalize and editorialize, media masquerading as bias free is all they are.

       Snowden was probably a CIA agent whose mission was to embarrass the NSA with leaks that were already confirmed years before by Bill Binney.

       Assange was raised in one of those creepy cults that is so central to the secret society mystery school monarch programming whatever... Oh and what happened in October 2016??

       then why did someone inside WL edit all file dates to 1-1-1984 and tweet a code for "Help him?" I guess everyone will just take your word for it that Wikileaks is still the real deal.

       Those dates changing are really sketchy. I don't deny that and it's the only thing of the whole timeline I can't explain. The whole "Help him" stuff I'm not convinced of. You need to switch the order of the tweets around to get that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the concern about it in general is warranted, but I don't see a reason to think Assange is dead or has lost control of WikiLeaks at this point. He's been seen outside good balcony since all of this.

       This disclaimer is saying that there is currently no factual evidence to support it. So the question then becomes why does it exist at all? Because Wikileaks has evolved into a partisan political weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not endorsed by Wikileaks, but it sure as heck is encouraged. And looking at how Assange has been defending trump and bashing Clinton you can see how it's part of a pattern and a larger picture.

       Did you ever think that some of us, who regularly contribute to this sub, just don't believe in Pizzagate?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why does everything have to be about brigading? When I read the title of your post I had the same thought as your edits: just because something has a page on Wikipedia doesn't mean it's worthy of news coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Face it, some of us looked at Pizzagate, didn't see anything there, and view the pushes for visibility as nothing more than Trump supporters out to bash Clinton, which is getting really old.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst part though is you assuming there is some conspiracy against you; maybe we're just tired of hearing about the same old, unproven, lies to smear someone that no one likes (and who lost the election and isn't in power).
      </p>
      <p>
       If this sub cared about children as much as the Pizzagaters claim, there would be some serious digging into Trump and Epstein (yes, Clinton went to his island too. I know. Bill and Donald are both disgusting).

       You are not the person I replied to, nor did you respond to the IMPORTANT part what I said.  Conflating it with a different story is a complete diversion.  Both stories COULD be real.  More "evidence" of a Russian hack does not make Pizzagate a "dumb" narrative.  Where is the logic that?  Tell me how the Laura Silsby part of the narrative is "dumb".  Same thing with Dennis Hastert, or Jimmy Saville.  All just dumb stories, right?

       I read the comment I responded to, and am very familiar with things.    So, yes, of course Trump knows what's going on.  All the world leaders do.  That's what's really gross.  People really don't know what the diplomatic and jet set classes live like.  Saying Trump is AS tied into it as anyone though is disingenuous, because you and I don't and can't even know that at this point.  There is evidence that Clinton is more tied into it than Trump especially in terms of trafficking.  People aren't making Trump jokes about Haiti.

       He also had a major dust-up with Epstein after hearing about him making improper advances on one of his staff at Mar-a-Largo and had him permanently banned from ever setting foot the place again over it and he's never referred to Epstein as being a friend of any kind again after that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he knew Epstein as well as everyone surmises, or was of a like nature himself, why would that infuriate him to that extent? Moreover a great number of people were well aware of the fact that Trump personally kicked him out over that particular incident when he could have easily covered it up and made it go away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now most men are attracted to women that are younger than they are and in some cases even a decade or more younger, just as most women prefer a man that is older than they are and in some cases even a decade or more older, all of which is a private matter between consenting adults and shouldn't be conflated or misconstrued with underage females either being taken advantage of or forced into prostituting themselves by older and even much older men.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as we know Trump only flew on Epstein's plane to his private island on one occasion at a time when he was single.
      </p>
      <p>
       He of course knew Epstein as another partying skirt chaser looking for young and beautiful women in New York which he was also in the market to do and no doubt did at that time. "Clubbing" or "looking for action" isn't exactly a new phenomenon, least of all in New York City and amidst all the glitz, glamour and wealth that abounds there and just like today you find many of the same people turning up in a variety of places who all eventually get to know one another or strike up a casual friendship simply based on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we have no way to know if Trump actively and knowingly engaged in anything inappropriate or illegal with any underage girls either on that plane or at Epstein's island on that one particular occasion or why Epstein either never asked him again or Trump never accepted another invitation from him again but either way it doesn't fit into the narrative of Trump being like Epstein or sharing his interest in any young women that are actually too young to be called that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump also has two daughters of his own, Ivanka who would have been in her late teens and Tiffany who was somewhere around seven or eight around the time in question. Another reason why Trump would have had a distinct disinclination to be attracted to any overly young girls if we give him credit for the normal paternal instincts he's always shown towards all of his children without any reservations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to either defend Trump or leap to any particular conclusions based on what we know but to bear in mind that there are other facts about him that we also know and that when he claims that he strictly knew Epstein "socially" and simply in a friendly manner that he may actually be telling the truth and may not have been privy to his darker activities or in the circle that usually and frequently were. It may be easy to believe that Epstein did nothing but that but there were many who knew him and dealt with him that had no idea at all that until the scandal about it made the news. Something of a good natured and over aged playboy of sorts, but nothing worse than that, which is pretty much how Trump described him when he was asked about him.

       IMO Wikileaks would only endorse pizzagate if it becomes so well documented that it becomes acceptable to the mainstream. Opening the flood gates to the child sex trafficking world is a death sentence.

       pizzagate will NEVER be acceptable to the mainstream. The mainstream media will deny it to their last breath. Only after a revolution and the complete collapse of the current power structure in the USA will pizzagate be "mainstream".

       Why are you going with that pizza gate strawman again? To entertaine your strawman arguement:
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm skeptical on Pizzagate (could be a psy-op) but I'm maintaining an open mind simply due to the fact that other things like this have been exposed in the past from the elite establishment across the world, often times with heavy pushback and denial in the beginning of investigations. It's not impossible something like this could be happening, and there is certainly a lot of circumstantial evidence presented in the community findings. There's no actual hard proof...yet. It hasnt been proven fact or fiction in any way. The fact no formal investigation has even been made into this being a possibility is what really drives it home for me. MSM is so furiously attacking this as "fake news" that it's only adding fuel to the conspiracy fire IMO. I'm hoping there will be more facts and info to come soon so this can be put to bed as either fact or fiction once and for all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate has not been proven or disproven. There has been no formal investigations. There is circumstancial evidence. People get investigated for on circumstancial evidence all the time, even with less circumstancial evidence.

       In my opinion, they are likely hosting a limited hangout, attempting to contain the pizzagate investigation to the limits of their site rather than actively investigating.

        I would venture to say it's because cps is trafficking kids, some to pedophiles, and making an industry of it. If any kids are saved from abuse, others will follow. That's not the narrative here.

       Ooooh. That's why so many sized children are placed into custody of sexually abusive people.

       Pizzagate is not just about the pizza shop. It is about the conspiracy that those in positions of power are deeply involved in-- child sex trafficking.

       You are not the person I replied to, nor did you respond to the IMPORTANT part what I said.  Conflating it with a different story is a complete diversion.  Both stories COULD be real.  More "evidence" of a Russian hack does not make Pizzagate a "dumb" narrative.  Where is the logic that?  Tell me how the Laura Silsby part of the narrative is "dumb".  Same thing with Dennis Hastert, or Jimmy Saville.  All just dumb stories, right?
