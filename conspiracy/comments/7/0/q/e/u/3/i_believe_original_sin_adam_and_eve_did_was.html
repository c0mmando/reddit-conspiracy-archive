       "In the preceding 2.5 million years, when our ancestors lived as hunter-gatherers they worked less, “spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease” than afterward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Farming boosted the population but chained humans to the land and demanded ceaseless drudgery to plant, tend, harvest and process food — while making us more vulnerable to famine, disease and war. People who had evolved over eons for one mode of life were pushed into a different mode at odds with many of their natural instincts."

       Not blaming, or complaining. I love technology for the most part. Just a theory that agriculture was the sin that Genesis alludes to. But go ahead, ridicule and stay boxed in.

       There's something to your idea, it's just not entirely accurate. Think about gardening. is there anything wrong with tending a garden? You're creating life and diversity, expanding the food supply of your own people as well as the plants, animals, and insects involved in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is agriculture, right? Permaculture is a great example. It requires planning and care, all "God-given" human talents, so to speak. Where it gets problematic is the idea of totalitarian agriculture. Cain killing Abel, man killing his competition preemptively so as to expand his own territory. We still do this.

       A great little book on this kind of viewpoint is Ishmael by Daniel Quinn.

       I am pretty sure hunter gatherers worked a lot more hours and were hungrier more hours of the week than those farming for sustainance.  I imagine early groups of people would do both, hunt some and plant some.

       What about traditional farming? As in, the animal forms an important piece of the virtuous farming cycle; his excretions serve to feed the soil which in turn allows the vegetables to grow.

       Well yeah no problems with that, but once it starts being done for anything other than the well being of a family (once it's done for a profit), then we see the evidence of where that leads. It's the desire for profit that turns us into masochistic idiots.

       I don't believe humans were hunters and gatherers originally. We were agricultural from the beginning. We evolved from apes. And apes are vegetarians. They don't eat meat. So it makes sense that we are the same. And our teeth and digestive systems weren't really made for meat.

       I think that the "original sin" (which is something that we are apparently all born with) is simply desire itself. The "original sin" was Eve being tempted by desire for knowledge (the forbidden fruit). Once you let desire into your heart, it creates a void that can never be satisfied and intensifies with every attempt. Before this happened, they had everything they needed. Once they let it in, they suddenly became self aware and God (love) left them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole point of this ongoing story is so simple it's mind-blowing. Jesus' crucifixion was symbolic, as it was meant to be. There had to (and has to) be a way to force people to see the error of their ways (living in desire). To murder someone who stands for all that's righteous and good for nothing more than being just that. He absolves original sin by showing us what it turns us into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turn away from desire and embrace love. When people help each other, there's always enough to go around.
