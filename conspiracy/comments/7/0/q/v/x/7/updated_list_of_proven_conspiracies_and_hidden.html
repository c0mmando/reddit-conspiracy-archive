          Tulsa Race Riot - On May 31 and June 1, 1921, a white mob started the Tulsa race riot, attacking residents and businesses of the African-American community of Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in what is considered one of the worst incidents of racial violence in United States history. The attack, carried out on the ground and by air, destroyed more than 35 blocks of the district, at the time the wealthiest black community in the nation. More than 800 people were admitted to hospitals and more than 6,000 black residents were arrested and detained, many for several days. The Oklahoma Bureau of Vital Statistics officially recorded 39 dead, but the American Red Cross estimated 300, a number supported by historians since then.

          From 1963 to 1966, Saul Krugman of New York University promised the parents of mentally disabled children that their children would be enrolled into Willowbrook in exchange for signing a consent form for procedures that he claimed were "vaccinations." In reality, the procedures involved deliberately infecting children with viral hepatitis by feeding them an extract made from the feces of patients infected with the disease

The mixtures contained radioactive iron and the researchers were determining how fast the radioisotope crossed into the placenta.

          The Imperial Japanese Army's notorious medical research team carried out secret human experiments regarded as some of the worst war crimes in history. Its scientists subjected more than 10,000 people per year to grotesque Josef Mengele-style torture in the name of science, including captured Russian soldiers and downed American aircrews. The experiments included hanging people upside down until they choked, burying them alive, injecting air into their veins and placing them in high-pressure chambers.

Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness.

         Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.
One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines.
         <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/">
          All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic.

         Of the 84,000 chemicals in commercial use in the United States -- from flame retardants in furniture to household cleaners -- nearly 20 percent are secret, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, their names and physical properties guarded from consumers and virtually all public officials under a little-known federal provision. The policy was designed 33 years ago to protect trade secrets in a highly competitive industry. But critics -- including the Obama administration -- say the secrecy has grown out of control, making it impossible for regulators to control potential dangers or for consumers to know which toxic substances they might be exposed to.

"On television, we found more than 1,100 titles received Pentagon backing – 900 of them since 2005, from ‘Flight 93’ to ‘Ice Road Truckers’ and ‘Army Wives.' Between 1911 and 2017, more than 800 feature films received support from the US Government’s Department of Defence (DoD), a significantly higher figure than previous estimates indicate.

       When you say gold do you mean money? I'm sorry but my faith in humanity has deteorated as of the past 20 years.  Iwould hope that someone some where can come up with something to stop the bribes and lies . That would be a good start.Things need to change .i would love to be a part of that change .

       I'm not confident about 9/11. For sure it was exploited by Bush and Osama had been funded by the CIA 30 years before, but the suggestion that the hijackers were not who they say is unlikely IMO. And of course the theory that 9/11 didn't even happen is batshit

       Fiterman hall was demolished due to mold, not because it was structurally unsafe.

      <p>
       Deutsche Bank Building was demolished because it was contaminated with dust and renovation would have been more expensive than rebuilding it.

       9/11 being a government conspiracy doesn't have to depend on speculative aspects like controlled demolition or ridiculous theories like no-planes. al-Qaeda being a CIA asset has already been confirmed by Sibel Edmonds, who blew the whistle on Operation Gladio B. There was even a wire transfer of $100,000 to lead hijacker Mohammed Atta ordered by the Pakistani ISI, which was the CIA's intermediary for funding the Afghan mujahideen during the Cold War. Daniel Hopsicker did great work investigating the flight school in Venice FL where Mohammed Atta trained, finding that owner Rudi Dekkers and financier Wally Hilliard had intelligence connections. Mike Ruppert made a good case for the war games on 9/11 being intentionally planned and run by Dick Cheney to thwart the air defense.

          documentary about the flight schools

         <em>
          Welcome to Terrorland

         . There's some controversy over whether he accurately identified Atta's girlfriend, but that doesn't threaten his other conclusions; Hopsicker went out into the field and talked to people who were involved with the flight schools. His website, Mad Cow, has more stories on this, including how the flight school's planes were used to smuggle drugs.

         <em>
          Crossing the Rubicon
         </em>
         , documented 5 separate war games running on September 11. Some of them drew fighters away from the Northeast US, and others created confusion as to whether the hijackings were real or not. There was also some faulty radar data about flight 11, which Ruppert believes was inserted through a backdoor into the FAA systems. FAA computer systems were subcontracted out to Ptech, a firm funded by Yasin al-Qadi, a terror financier who claims to have met Dick Cheney in Saudi Arabia.

       Building 7 is all anyone really needs.  "Uh yea, that building across the way from where the planes hit?  Well, a rock from the falling towers hit it on there way down, and wouldn't ya know, the darn thing just collapsed in demolition style straight into its own foundation.  Haha, it's the damndest thing..."

       I'm also not a big fan of Trump, I think he's really funny in that Al Bundy/Jerry Springer way and not much else, but I think he knows what happened on 9/11.  He hinted

       before the election that he knew exactly what went down.  Even though he's a shnook, his expertise in at least large-scale construction and demolition was well known in the city at that time, and I think he was at least consulted about demolishing the towers.  Even hypothetically.  He was also right there on the day after int happened going "no way this was planes, this is exactly what controlled demolition looks like.  I'm in construction."

       You're not wrong but your analysis is incomplete.  Take for example Fox News.  When there is an event that aligns with Fox News' ideology you will find they are a crack team of investigative journalists.  Yes, they're full of shit often enough, but when the truth lines up with their agenda they're spot-on.  Sometimes, the fact that the source is habitually unreliable makes the specific example of truth that much more significant.

       I think those types of exceptions are rare and, being the exception to the rule rather than a rule itself, you should always thoroughly attempt to rule them out first before assuming they are correct and if, after significant research, that source is proved to be uncharacteristically correct then sure, I'd believe them for that specific instance only.

       I don't disagree that sometimes untrustworthy sources end up being right, but statistically that is a very rare occurrence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there has been a movement away from what we, as a people, consider a "valid source", which bothers me. There's a lot of "well yeah but [person/source of debate] was right about THIS so that means they're worth our time", which I don't think is the best way to go about this. There is a certain threshold a person or source reaches, almost like a cliff, where they are wrong or lie often enough in comparison to the number of times they are correct or tell the truth that regardless of whether they're telling the truth or not, their previous behavior has rendered them an untrustworthy and thus invalid source for information.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that not many people agree with that, let alone on this subreddit specifically, but that's how I choose to operate. Donald Trump passed that threshold for me a long time ago, even before his most recent presidential run and win.

       I, too, try to use past behavior to judge how someone will behave in the future. I'm usually right if I do have enough info, but I am wrong from time to time. (What can I say? People surprise you, it's what makes us awesome)

       I like Trump, on a lot of levels. There are things I disagree with or am concerned about. But, as a whole, I like the guy. And that's me. I have my reasons :) your reasons are your own, and from where you sit, it's accurate too. (Honestly, as long as

       Obviously building 7's collapse is a lot more complicated that and that's another discussion. But Trump's initial response to 9/11 was to talk about the size of his buildings. He wants to hint at this stuff for attention.

       Just an aside. My ex-husband worked in the Fernald school . . . while he was in prison. They hire inmates who are eligible for daily work details to work with the kids. Fortunately, for those kids, my ex was a decent guy. I can only imagine some of the guys that end up working there.

       Can you explain what exactly is so bad about this? You make it sound like they are leaving kids alone with possibly violent inmates. I doubt all inmates can qualify for this and I think it can be quite therapeutic actually. Inmates and children both tend to be very lonely, so they have that in common.  I think it would be educational for kids to learn about the reality of life and how it can go wrong for anyone. Especially if learning while they are in a safe environment like school. Even if they dont talk about life lessons, they can just have a friend, someone to talk to. I also dont think all inmates are bad people. And they dont deserve the cruel punishments they get, like solitary confinement. Am I crazy here, or do you have more to add?

       No, not all inmates are bad people. My ex certainly isn't. As far as learning the reality of life from the inmates, I don't know how that may be applicable since the Fernald school is for severely mentally challenged kids. Learning to brush their teeth each day is a challenge. Hiring inmates, at $2.00/day is how the school keeps its costs down. And yeah, some of the guys that worked there from the prisons weren't the kind you'd want around your kids, i.e. armed robberies, assaults, etc. The prison they pulled from was a minimum security so the inmates were at the end of their sentences at that time. I guess it's part of how they planned to reintegrate them, by giving them work experience. So, regardless of your original crime if in that prison you were considered trustworthy enough for a job. Doesn't mean they'd rehabilitated, only that they played the game well enough to make it that far. Again, not all were like that, but some certainly were.

       No one is doing that. You completely missed the point. Kids get left alone with dangerous parents/babysitters/relatives all the time. At least in this case they would be supervised. You think the prison bus comes to an elementary school, drops off a bunch of violent criminals, and they say "okay pick you up at 3!"

       The PBS isn't a system or process designed just for you man, it's funded by taxpayers for pensioners and those in need for life changing medicines. Honestly no offense but I am bewildered that I've needed to elaborate like I have in this thread

       Yes, but you obviously don't see the comparison I am trying to make which is why I mentioned cereal at all, you just took my words at face value without seeing what I meant by them. Would it change tour perspective if had said ..."people pay $6" instead of "...you pay $6..."?

       You can't catch this because you interpret and relate to things from the perspective of your ego, because our society is an egoic echo chamber that perpetuates self centered thinking and logic. How's that for a conspiracy

       I still don't get what you are saying, they are talking about accepted deaths and how it impacts studies, the cereal thing could be taken far value, or the fact that people would actually have to do that job,or in the sense of the legs being the dead people in the study, or in any number of ways, perhaps you want to explain if I am too stupid to understand, instead of telling me I'm too stupid to understand.

       I'm not trying to be confrontational, just an attempt to point out to you
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       you are not getting what I am saying lol. I figured that was more important than clearing the cereal point up.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, well in a nutshell:
      </p>
      <p>
       PBS (Or I guess the FDA where you are) is gvmnt funded as a service for the
       <strong>
        entire population
       </strong>
       . If you wanted test trials to be totally death free you'd be asking a ridiculous thing, that could only be done if the cost (in taxpayer dollars) of the whole operation went up for no actual benefit to anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just how if cereal for the
       <strong>
        entire population
       </strong>
       was made insect leg free for an extra $6 on top of what it already is, it would be a huge waste of everyones money because it's already fine as it is, unless you are illogically squeamish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, me writing all this out makes me question why the fuck I spend so much time on the internet typing shit out, I guess I'll say this is the last time I do that shit lol... it's time for me to find a new way to spend my fkn time..

       Nayirah al-Ṣabaḥ, daughter of an Iraq diplomat, gave false testimony before Congress in what sure as hell looked like sworn testimony. It wasn't, so she's clear on perjury charges as well as enjoying diplomatic immunity.

       Hill &amp; Knowlton worked for the Kuwaiti government to create the meta bliz that made the case for the first Gulf war. But they couldn't have pulled it off without the assistance of members of congress, the media, and the President.

       And we knew that we had been lied to before so that we could enter a war.  This happened with Vietnam as well.  But we don't learn.  I remember seeing and hearing that testimony everywhere and something just seemed off about it.  But I was 14 and I lacked the experience and knowledge to go any further than that.  But I remember thinking that she was full of shit.

       What do you think, does she sound genuine to you?  I now realize that we needed an excuse for war and her testimony was part of that excuse.  Then we used WMD's as an excuse some years later which resulted in a war on "terror" which has an ever changing enemy face and no clear end.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I look at the world today and I see NK being painted as our enemy.  Right or wrong, that is not my point here.  My point is that we have an opportunity here for history to repeat itself.  The UN General Assembly is happening and I can't help but wonder what the plan might be to gain support for military action against NK.  Will this plan include embellished propaganda or even an outright false flag?  Our history would tell us that we need to be aware and question the narrative before making rash decisions.  But who am I kidding?  Those of us who question things in this manner are not the ones controlling the narrative and we are not the ones making meaningful decisions.  Those who recognize our past and question the present will be dissenters and we will be ridiculed and ignored.  Then we will one day wonder how we were so stupid ..  again.  I give it 12 months, max.  Within 12 months, we will have an event that will be plastered on every news feed and they all will be saying the same thing.  When this happens, we need to question it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slightly off topic, but I am also concerned about the rise of extremism on both the left and the right.  We had this situation in the 60's and 70's with groups like the Weathermen who were blowing things up in America on a daily basis.  These groups did not go from nothing to blowing things up overnight.  There was a gradual and well documented increase in their numbers and the violence of their tactics.  Then we woke up one day and wondered how it came to bombs everyday when it was playing out right in front of us the whole time.  So now we have our escalating situation today.  Extremist groups and numbers are up.  The violence has started and we have done little to recognize this unless it fits a certain narrative.  So I worry that we are repeating history again.  An escalation of violence is the only logical progression from here.  And here we are being selective in who we condemn and doing very little to address the issue in a meaningful way.  Todays extremists are not so bomb happy, but for how long?  Why can't we wake up before our reality slaps us in the face, or blows up in our face?

       And then when internal violence will seem to get out of hand and will hurt commerce and other interests. Then there will be external enemy, could be Muslims, Chinese, NK, Russians, Indians, who the fuck knows where this roulette stops. Then the US will united again against the common enemy and then some poor foreign schmuck will fuckin be a result of a hate crime. As a brown man, it could be me. Who knows.

       My friend.  I am a white guy and the us government already ran a propaganda campaign against my ancestors which resulted in internment ... twice.  Some in my family were interned.  Families split up, jobs lost, businesses lost and in one case seized.  One of my relatives was interned while his son was serving in the us military, fighting Nazi's.  The very people my relatives wanted to escape.  Hyphenated Americans.  Look it up.  If you are interested, I could copy a previous post I made about this.  Please don't think I am trying to play the victim or that I am making light of anyone's struggles.  That certainly is not my intent.  Just saying, I am white and they came for my relatives.

       Can you give me further detail on MKUltra? I know it’s there already but I heard from a friend that during the experiments something had happened where something got in the water, and the folks who lived at a village nearby were drinking from that water and soon had a disease that killed plenty of people. CIA covered it up, and when someone went to testify, they died of a “heart attack” the day before.

       Sorry for not being very elaborate, makes it harder on you. In my class about an hour ago we were exchanging conspiracy theories to one another, which is why I’m here now. Is there any theories that have changed your perception on certain things?

       Most of these conspiracies are against non-capitalist countries trying to win their own right to decide for themselves what their fate is, but the U.S is like "LOL NOPE YOU ARE COMMIES WE ARE GOING TO OVERTHROW YOUR GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE WE HAVE INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY IN WORKERS BEING OPPRESSED IN YOUR COUNTRIES SO WE CAN BUY YOUR OIL AND FRUIT FOR NEXT TO NOTHING WHILE YOU ALL WORK AS SLAVES LOL WE'RE GONNA INSTALL DICTATORSHIP IN YOUR COUNTRIES SO THAT YOUR PEOPLE WILL NEVER BE HEARD"

       well for starters it's responsible for around 20 million deaths a year and massive global oppression of working people, as well as around 205 million deaths in total when genocide and total slaughter and war is included. And that's a modest number.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the fact that all the poorest countries in the world are capitalist is pretty significant.

       Capitalism, in and of itself is neither bad nor good; it is the implementation that matters.  A government truly invested in the interests of the people is the missing counterbalance.  We want the energy of the capitalistic enterprise under the hood but we need responsible government behind the wheel.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government subsidies.  These are inducements from the government to encourage wanted behavior.  This might be subsidies for green investments, for example.  Conversely, taxation is a deterrent.  A properly functioning government should be able to use inducements and impediments to guide the interests of capitalism to those areas that are lawful, productive and available; sourcing the most easily optimized parts first and taxing the resulting economic growth.

       Too bad it doesn't work anywhere and working people are still being extorted and income inequality is increasing and every single capitalist government is a corrupt cesspool of easily bribed sociopaths.

       I agree with all of your observations.  You're right on each account.  These are the result of the failure of governance.  It is not a failure of capitalism; it is in fact indicative of the slavish obedience of capitalism to respond to positive market stimuli.

       Can't the exact same argument be made about communism tho? Like it's such a non-argument rly. They both seem like utopian ideas. Socialism just makes a fuckton of a lot more sense to me, in the literal meaning/goal of socialism. Capitalism obviously isn't working in mankind's favor right now.

       Ultimately, yes, all methods of governance are susceptible to corruption and when that happens all bets are off.  That said, capitalism inspires and encourages and work ethic and creativity that frankly communism has done a poor job of copying.  With good governance that enthusiasm for capital provides all the horsepower a market needs and with good governance that supercharged market doesn't trample We the People.

       Thats an assumption on your part. 
Did you know that most social scientists and anthropologist agree that (non-sociopathic) humans work better with the motivation of helping eachother, than that of personal gain? 
Communism is human nature. Capitalism divides humans into groups in order for further extortion of the very people that produce everything (the proletariat).
Read Capital by Karl Marx. :)

       Capitalism is based around the idea that the individual should accumulate capital, money. What happens is some of these become so rich they create companies and corporations that produce goods, and compete for it (competition makes prices low, and wages higher).
So basically the rich dudes invest in the market to become richer, and in doing so they enrich the consumers.

       Corporatism is when multiple corporations are allowed (by the government, through regulations) to lobby. (here i've been writing for a good 2 minutes before realizing i could just link you to a [video[(

       I see no version of capitalism that does not result in corruption.

       Corporations and individuals are allowed to lobby government. Its protected speech. Its as if you want to blame government and regulations for greed. That's just a normal human condition.

       Before continuing the discussion i'd like to clarify i don't see capitalism as the best system possible. I'd argue some form of voluntarism/anarchy would best for our current situation, but the jump seems hard right now, a free capitalist market is way easier to grasp.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second thing is we're on r/conspiracy, so you well know that the problem isn't the economic model: the government gets lobbied because it allows it. The problem lies in the privatization of banks and their relations with other influencers (CEOs and politicians). Most systems would automatically fix themselves without poison in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regulations are capitalism's poison. A free market, in which consumers can effectively choose who to buy goods from (not from a "team of corporations") is good for everyone. The richer the producers get, the more they invest the more wealth (this is a keyword: wealth doesn't equal money) is produced.

       Without regulation, the rich and powerful would do want they want unrestricted. Getting rid of regulations would fix nothing.

       I don't know where you live, but I can make my own consumer choices. I don't have to buy from a team of corporations if I don't want to. Yeah certain things like gas, electricity, etc are a lot harder to get without dealing with a corporation, but its possible to go without gas. You can go off the grid for electricity.

       Nope nope: if the government gets asked to "buy my product 'cause there's many of us see? We can help you!" it should deny the offer and investigate the group. Our government

       Corporatism is subtle, you as the consumer can't know who the team is made of. Yeah sure you're less likely to buy the highest price product, but if you fall into a marketplace that is "allied" with others (thus creating a hidden monopoly) the prices will always be higher, and wages always lower!

The district has recently blossomed/gentrified and due to backlash over the Brady name in the last few years, the local business association has decided to rename it. They announced the list of final 3 choices for the public to vote on. Whats not on the finalist list? Greenwood, although I would wager that if Greenwood was on the list it would win in a landslide.

       I don't know why people are downvoting you, and I don't know if I'm really a person to answer your question.  But it seems to me that the only things "everybody" knows about are in the human experimentation section.

       Yeah only because they were exposed by whistleblowers and investigative journalism. Something doesn't become okay just because it isn't hidden anymore. It still would be hidden if the government and corporations had their way.

      <p>
       And they are
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       conspiracies. Maybe you could argue with some of them, but you're really going to say none of these are conspiracies? Then what is a conspiracy?

       If you actually read the links, I'm sure you will conclude that it's not a "gatekeeper list." Adding a conspiracy such as 9/11 would discredit the entire list. This was made to bring people up to speed about what we actually know is true. The average person would assume the entire list is garbage if 9/11 was on there because they can argue that it has not yet been proven. Everything in this post is admitted and beyond any doubt proven.

       Calm down bud. I'm not paid to spread conspiracy information. You're overly paranoid. There's already a guy in another thread who discredited the entire post. He said "that whole list is bullshit" all because of a single link that was technically  just one person committing a crime. That's why I can't make any mistakes or add things that are disputed. There are disinfo agents out there, but you're looking in the wrong place.

       Projection. I don't take kindly to projection from gatekeepers who refuse to address a proven conspiracy. As a gatekeeper YOU decide the criteria of a proven conspiracy. That's what gatekeepers do! It's the definition of gatekeeping!!

       NOVEMBER 1979 – Annapolis:  Operator fails to close valve of fluoride container; causing 1,000 gallons of fluoride to be dumped into the water supply. 1 dialysis patient dies, 1 suffers a heart attack, 1 develops long-term brain damage, while others experience nausea, hypotension (low blood pressure), chest pain or pressure, diarrhea, itching, flushing, vomiting (blood tinged), weakness, dyspnea (breathing difficulty), profuse sweating, shakiness, localized numbness, abdominal cramping, and headache. Others not on dialysis experience nausea, headache, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and dizziness. Pepsi Cola files suit for $1.6 million for damage to product, while a surviving dialysis patient with resulting brain damage sues for $210 million. (SOURCE: Bevis 1981 | Evening Capital 1982.

       Not saying it wasn't LSD, but the hallucinations they described sound more like deliriants. Which produce more frightful and "true" hallucinations which can't be discerned from reality, opposed to LSD which doesn't put you into a delirious state.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are known moulds which act as strong deliriants. They could have also easily poisoned the bread with something other than LSD

       Yeah, all of them could be argued as being plausible. That is how they start, someone finds a piece of evidence or makes an argument to show how the unthinkable is possible.

       "The Enterprise" isn't what Iran-Contra is commonly known as, so perhaps it needs to be renamed. Also, the linked article seems a little short and doesn't really describe the width and depth of the scandal.

       I understand that. I planned on making the majority of the links stuff that many people don't know about. The Enterprise is one aspect of the iran Contra scandal that a lot of people aren't up to speed on, but you are probably right. I should add the scandal itself in there because there probably are some people who've never heard of it.

       If you tried to make your links - stuff that many people don't know about....
why do you assume there are "stuff alot of people did know about?"
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were searching for proavable conspiracies - my first search would be JFK assassination coverup and the mason's secret organization, maybe illuminati
      </p>
      <p>
       but beyond that I cannot think of any other conspiracies - "I know about" to enough of a degree that I feel confident to talk knowledgably on the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like "the church" is a conspiracy to keep people in line - and do what the good book tells them - while also getting their monthly tithe - a voluntary donation of 10% or more of earnings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like "race wars" is some bullshit the mainstream media is selling to convince the minorities to rise up and fight "the man"
      </p>
      <p>
       and I feel like gender equality (and gender neutrality) and gender identity crises - and all that crap - id something that the media is selling and sensationalizing - but I am not sure who stands to gain the most from that crap.

       The quality of Hollywood's more expensive films relative to how much is spent on them, makes me suspicious that Hollywood is just a giant money laundering market for all the slush funds from three letter agencies.
