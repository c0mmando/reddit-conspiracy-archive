<p>Even worse, they&#39;re purposely dividing everyone and teaching us to hate each other so when they pull the rug out from under us, we&#39;re all divided, scared, confused and start blaming each other for what will be happening.</p>

<p>Also: wtf do you expect from a group of people who believes ([cough] quite correctly) that a miniscule group of empowered elites clandestinely manipulates world events to further their own selfish goals over the good of the earth and mankind? It&#39;s pretty fucking obvious that whoever&#39;s in charge are wrecking up the place like it&#39;s their job.  Because wrecking up the place <em>IS THEIR JOB</em>.</p>

<p>Have you not noticed the wonton destruction of Earth&#39;s entire ecosystem to enrich a small group of self-centered douchebags, or the very obvious propaganda mill called the main stream media, or the ceaseless wars waged all over the place that <em>nobody</em> wants?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know.  Bummer.  There could be legitimate reasons though, we could try to speculate what they could be...</p>

<p>I mean, if it&#39;s a prime directive kinda thing then we&#39;re probably boned.  But by many accounts, ETs are among us and/or in contact with our leaders already, so under that assumption we can rule out prime directive.</p>

<p>Although that also kinda leads to depressing conclusions.  If they&#39;re here already, <em>and</em> not helping... That might say something worse than non-interference.  I suppose they could be waiting for some kind of sign that we&#39;re ready, but where would they get such a sign if not from our leadership?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you completely. I&#39;m blessed in that I make enough that I can provide for our household and my wife can raise our kids, and homeschool them. Mind you, budgeting is really important - I was shocked to find the national monthly average for dining out and entertainment/shopping was nearly $1k! In the big scheme of things, I don&#39;t make a whole lot of money, but the fact we don&#39;t spend that on food and junk allows me to own my dream truck.</p>

<p>My thinking is build up capital. Buy and maintain things useful to living. Easy example is a dutch oven. We like to camp, so no-brainer there, but also allows us to cook whatever, whenever, just as was done in the colonial periods. We&#39;re getting a Berky water filter - not only will it get rid of flouride and other toxins, but in a survival situation we will have clean water. Precious metals are a good investment as well, but I&#39;m focusing on capital first. </p>

<p>My worst case bug out plan is find one of the local farms and offer to work for food. We buy raw milk from a place nearby, and I know they&#39;d let us work there in exchange for sustenance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All very good advice.  I hear precious metals are about to / in the midst of price surge as the dollar declines.  So that&#39;s a great investment if you can afford it.  Someone here on this sub periodically posts links to George Soros&#39; investment profile, which contains huuuuge bets <em>against</em> the dollar.  And he made a billion or so betting again the pound sterling back in the early 2000s (not sure of exact date).  But, all that requires capital first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wait until bots start driving these &quot;self-driving&quot; cars.  I&#39;ll bet humans (especially older ones) will &quot;downvote&quot; them too, in their own way. I think the psychology of humans is that there are more people out there that will resent these self driving bot cars than the designers and tech-heads realize.  How will bots react with the illogic and unpredictability of humans? It&#39;ll be interesting for sure when you have bots and humans sharing the road at the same time during the &quot;transitioning&quot; period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. There&#39;s no point on stressing our bodies and minds over something we can&#39;t change. Maybe a war might be lost and the world will change, or maybe not, but we have our own war to fight and finite time to do it. Countries and empires rise and fall, and maybe for good, no man can survive the designs of history.</p>

<p>The only thing I absolutely ignore is how to free ourselves from this thing you call matrix, which I can&#39;t see how I can live comfortable by just changing an apparent reality with my positive thought. This can&#39;t be the only way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While that&#39;s all good advice and all, you also need to cut yourself off from reality. I&#39;m not one of those NGO people, but there&#39;s definitely a lot of propaganda happening, from both sides. No matter what you do to offset it, there&#39;s plenty of incredibly negative stimuli that leads to the conclusion of: we&#39;re fucked.</p>

<p>Perhaps just like everyone on the right thing Obama was going to take their guns, and all the other things far worse that didn&#39;t happen.. Perhaps the left sees Trump just as badly.</p>

<p>I mean.. &quot;fire and brimstone&quot;. If you want to make things worse, that&#39;s what you say. I think most sane people thought to themselves, &quot;ya, maybe don&#39;t say that&quot;.</p>

<p>I know the right are totally okay with nuclear bombs on North Korea, but what I don&#39;t think most are thinking clearly about.. is countries immediately responding to threats that have reached ultimate levels. That doesn&#39;t play out well, and although most of us reading this aren&#39;t old enough to see what nukes can do.. it&#39;s bad. For generations.</p>

<p>So I&#39;m totally not down with propaganda coming from the left, or the right.. yes, we are being divided.. but I think the simpler answer is Russia. Stirring the left with things to hate about Republicans (we do), while also stirring the pot of the right, who are fantastically grabbing onto anything that&#39;s hateful towards the left.</p>

<p>I may have a bias, but I honestly don&#39;t see hate towards the right from the left, it&#39;s more of a defensive position (aka the left isn&#39;t as understanding or conforming to trans people and shit like that.. we simply don&#39;t see a reason for any American to be treated differently).</p>

<p>The &quot;silent majority&quot; is a term I see thrown around quite a bit, but honestly, they&#39;re so loud, trying to get those &quot;liberal tears&quot;.. it&#39;s kind of pathetic really. Nothing they&#39;ve ever said &quot;triggered me&quot;, it&#39;s just downvote and move on.</p>

<p>But antifa? Their newest propaganda to divide us? We don&#39;t support that. But we also didn&#39;t create that. Go around calling people cucks and telling them they have a mental disorder, some are going to subscribe to anyone against that. They made it stronger.</p>

<p>But honestly, the left.. I don&#39;t see us trying to make things worse, create a divide. What words or terminology can you say the left has been using to describe the right? Cucks, shills, libtards, etc.. terms I see constantly from the right.</p>

<p>I think both sides are falling for Russian propaganda, but I think only one side is truly embracing it in the worst kind of way, helping to perpetuate it like it&#39;s &quot;just a meme bro&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are upvoting you because you provide good, comforting info. I trend to agree with you, but when does something go from anxiety-driven fear to reality? I think a lot of people are on edge right now, and I do honestly feel like something big may actually be on the horizon. </p>

<p>The bad thing is that nobody can really tell for sure, so it&#39;s all an educated guess at best. When all is said and done, I doubt anything will happen. Reality just isn&#39;t that exciting.</p>

<p>Anyway, I do recommend relaxing, meditating, and exercising regardless. Live life to the fullest now just in case it actually does all come crashing down.</p>

The Hopi Indians prophesied in the 1880&#39;s that in our day (which is now) millions of Americans will be slaughtered by the U.S. government. Not one Hopi prediction has failed; they have all come true. But I believe the United States collapse is going to be identical to the French Revolution, with different collectives killing each other. During the French Revolution, different &quot;clubs&quot; slaughtered each other with guillotines, while the French army was away fighting in Spain. The government isn&#39;t going to use the guillotines on Americans, the government is going to hand out those 30,000 guillotines to different groups, and then the opposing sides will chop off each others&#39; heads; just like they did in the French Revolution.</p>

<p>Who pushes processed foods into the grocery stores?  Who seeks to keep the dangers of sugars, alcohol, and tobacco off the product labels?  Who glorifies drug use and sexual promiscuity? Who encourages the people to stay indoors because &quot;the outside world is full of hatred and violence&quot;?  Who puts the poison on TV in the first place? </p>

<p>There&#39;s only one answer to all these questions.  It&#39;s the same group who consistently and deliberately sabotages all efforts toward world peace, because war is extremely profitable for a select group of private individuals.  Who is arming ISIS?  Who is demonizing Syria?  Who wants you to cower at the thought of North Korean nukes?  Who wants you focused on bathroom-bills and local civil unrest and the &quot;red vs blue&quot; divide, rather than the fact that over 50% of land dwelling species have gone extinct since 1950, or that there&#39;s a floating mass of garbage in the Pacific 3 times the size of the United States, or that rising seas are swallowing island and coastal communities as we speak?  Who wants you to ignore the 90% drop in global pollinator populations?  Who wants you to ignore that centuries-old fisheries are empty?  That half of all the coral reefs in the world have disappeared since the 1700s?</p>

<p>Who profits from all of this violence towards earth and humanity?  Who has anything to gain by keeping you distracted and fearful?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, of course it is true that each and every human is ultimately responsible for their own choices.  But agency comes in varying degrees - for example, in most or all developed countries there is a standing legal distinction between minors and adults.  Minors are deemed to have less agency than adults because they are not fully developed from either the cognitive or emotional standpoints.  Minors are unable to consent to sexual activity, enter into written contracts, serve I&#39;m the military, or vote in elections <em>specifically because</em> they are less developed.  Similarly, legal distinctions are made for adults with certain mental disabilities because society deems them to have less agency than a fully functional autonomous adult.  In medicine, adults are required by law to give <em>informed</em> consent to receive treatment - a process which in turn assumes that the adult in question has the education and cognitive faculties required to <em>understand</em> the information with which they are presented (aside: this is an <em>enormous</em> assumption).</p>

<p>Agency requires fully developed cognitive faculties.  You might argue that it is up to every individual to seek out the appropriate level of education before engaging in autonomous activity - and I would agree with you.  But you should also recognize that the powers that be (whoever they are) have lead a decades-long (or centuries, even) assault on the cognitive faculties of the average adult.  Every action they take - say, broadcasting falsehoods on mainstream media, or imposing vacuous legal requirements on educational institutions - are actions undertaken with the very specific goal of dumbing down the general populace and robbing humans of their agency.</p>

<p>One might point out that abuse victims are demonstrably much more likely to grow up to be abusers.  How can this be explained under the assumption that turning 18 magically grants a person full agency?</p>

<p>So, your point is valid to a certain extent, and I commend you for bringing this point to the table.  But you should also recognize that a person&#39;s agency is an expression of a plethora of environmental factors beyond the control of the individual in question.  And you should also recognize that those in charge have a very broad agenda geared towards diminishing that agency to the maximal extent.</p>

<p>Should the sheep be wise enough to stay away from the tree-line and minimize their contact with predators? Of course.  But it ultimately falls on the shepherd if the sheep get eaten.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice post, thanks for taking the time to put it together. We seem to agree on some key points.</p>

<p>I suppose our main point of difference might stem from what we see as the inherent nature of humans, and their relationship to the power structure.</p>

<p>In <em>1984</em>, the proles are always the proles. Only the inner part and out party ever fight for control. In <em>Brave New World</em>, the lower castes are just as happy as the upper castes. People fit their place.</p>

<p>In this sub and elsewhere in the conspiracy world, I see people who project their unhappiness with their own lot in life onto the system, while simultaneously doing <strong>nothing</strong> to improve their own lives.</p>

<p>Hypocrisy barely begins to describe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are most welcome.  Despite my username, I do try hard to engage other willing users in meaningful discussion whenever possible.  Sadly, it doesn&#39;t happen as often as I&#39;d like.  But, I consider <em>this</em> exchange to have been productive and even, I dare say, fun.  So I thank you for your contribution as well.</p>

<p>If it pleases you, I would be happy to continue discussing whatever points you think we disagree on.  I do agree that the vast majority are all too eager to blame others (the system, the media, the Jews, or whomever) for their woes without taking any responsibility for themselves.  But this too, it could be argued, is a by-product of the same deliberate dumbing-down of the general populace that I mentioned before.  After all, critical self reflection and the ability to analyze one&#39;s own relationship to the world power structure is the first thing the TPTB would want to quash.  A peasantry unwilling to look in the mirror is far easier to subvert and control.</p>

<p>So tell me your thoughts, if you&#39;re willing, about inherent human nature and the relationship of the average human to the world power structure.  We may have even more in common than you think.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing about this current time that makes it significantly more dangerous than any other time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is just objectively not true.</p>

<p>More than ~50 years ago you didn&#39;t have to worry about:</p>

<p>Global annihilation due to intentional or mistaken nuclear exchange.</p>

<p>Civilization-ending pandemic fed by overutilization of antibiotics and poor sanitation in intensive livestock operations, overprescription, and global supply and transportation chains. </p>

<p>Superintelligence. You can&#39;t handwave away technological progress, it is building towards something. Be in artificial, augmented, conjoined or biologically induced somehow, superintelligence <em>is</em> coming. The benefits of it are so clear, and the inverse risk of allowing another actor to have it unchecked so obvious that arms races to reach it first are nearly inevitable, so you don&#39;t even need a runaway AI too smart to control to end the world; It takes only baseline humans afraid that the other side might be getting close. To be clear though, the control problem for a superintelligence is no small issue, it may itself be as great a problem to solve as superintelligence; if it indeed is even possible. </p>

<p>We are balanced between precipices that never existed before, with consequences that were never before possible.  There are a ton more on the horizon(the horrific potential of synthetic biology and even non-superintelligent AI in rogue and creative hands, corporate entities with ability to launch kinetic strikes that can pierce the crust are two that bubble immediately to mind)   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The situation you describe is one that I keep ever in the front of my mind when I assess where we were, where we are, and all the things that happened in between.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to realize that I&#39;m no younger a young kid. When I realize how old I am now, I realize there are kids who are now driving who weren&#39;t even alive, or were mere newborns when 9/11 happened, so the baseline of normal is TOTALLY reset for them.</p>

<p>And, realistically, I don&#39;t think a person would be cognitively aware of what 9/11 even meant unless they were at least 10 years old at the time. Maybe 13. So that adds another decade to the disconnect.</p>

<p>Maybe we all just remember our childhood fondly. Maybe the older generation is always aware of what was compared to what is. But things were certainly freer in the 80s and 90s than what they are today.</p>

<p>What&#39;s ironic to me is that through all the complaints about people being &quot;accepted&quot; they&#39;ve become very similar to one another. People were more free and had greater freedom to dress, act, and express themselves how they wanted 30 years ago than they are today.</p>

<p>By all the virtue signaling they&#39;ve created this &quot;systematic&quot; culture which they claim &quot;oppresses&quot; them.</p>

<p>The late 80s and 90s were the very time of &quot;grunge&quot; and the &quot;fuck the system&quot; mentality. But generally these people had a mindful purpose to their behavior, unlike today.</p>

<p>I think what younger kids don&#39;t recognize is how the standard is constantly reset. Through small increments your generation and those following you will recognize the difference from where you are to where your going, and then you will realize how much has been lost never to return. And I expect those before me recognized the same.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an old picture of Kennedy (I think) giving a speech in the middle of a town square, and a mob of people are surrounding him listening to him speak. And there are people holding rifles (not threateningly, but they were simply a tool then). Of course, Kennedy was well before my time even. But when I saw that picture it just imprinted permanently in my mind, the impression of it...</p>

<p>Even in the 80s and 90s I couldn&#39;t imagine a president, hopeful, or, well, anyone anywhere dealing with that. How much and how far our sense of freedom is slowly shrinking as the decades pass.</p>

<p>Not only that, but we now have an incredibly large portion of the population absolutely terrified of guns. Who believe they should only be in the hands of soldiers and LEOs. And now the growing sense is mere words are as dangerous as guns and now we need to protect ourselves from dangerous, disturbing, unwelcome, disruptive, uncomfortable words. Mere words are terror.</p>

<p>The decline is immense.</p>

<p>Not to insult your dad, but he sounds like a baby boomer or an early product of them. Those people were expert sleepers and are, I believe, largely responsible for the advent of this new perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An global economic and social calamity is nearing. Even very simple minds can tell by now.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5tdzyh/if_you_realize_all_your_sensory_experiences/">remember</a> there is strictly nothing to fear. Ultimately nothing can harm you.</p>

<p>Also realize the central planners are losing the war against liberty and truth. Every evil action they undertake comes at the cost of more people waking up. One small example is how they are pushing/encouraging narcistic personality disorders - which works in the short term - but also facilitates the spread of righteous individualism. Indeed theirs is an effort with diminishing returns.</p>

<p>Indeed when you take a step back you realize humanity is progressing in the right direction; towards individual self-realization and enlightenement. </p>

<p>Their plan for an evil new world order will ultimately fail.</p>

For every individual who sees the truth, or even suspects that something is grievously wrong with the big picture, there are still 20,000 gobbling up CNN and Fox news, fully believing that Russia and north Korea represent true existential threats, that Assange, Snowden, and Manning are traitors, (and maybe they are to &quot;the US,&quot; but certainly not to humanity), that Israel is somehow being persecuted by Palestinian kids with sticks and rocks...</p>

<p>The last great depression wasn&#39;t all bad. People recovered their sense of humility and got their priorities and values straightened-out learning how to make do. You help others who become willing to help in whatever ways they can and so it goes. </p>

<p>If the war hadn&#39;t come along and wiped the slate clean so the same lousy system could be put back into place all over again, we&#39;d be living in a very different world by now and not seeing the same phenomenon repeat itself all over again.</p>

<p>Actually the crash and collapse has already occurred the only thing holding the effects a bay are rubber bands, paper clips, and a lot of phoney and make-believe book keeping that&#39;s on it&#39;s last legs.</p>

<p>The threat that big or rather bigger war than the ones already being waged by the western alliance will be used once again to restore the same fatally flawed economic system presents the greatest danger at the moment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Russians and Chinese who have it more right than wrong are busily building up a strong and viable middle-class based on greater self-sufficiency and a sound money system while those pushing harder for war and getting tough with them have a vested interest in not seeing them or their methods succeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in my small eastern european country things have always gotten worse.... What does it mean ? Does it mean I&#39;m just getting old ?</p>

<p>For example, When I was a kid , in the 80&#39;s , there were but a couple of newspapers, and they were mostly goverment controlled, and you could read various things, one of which was that someone was killed. I don&#39;t recall that being the main news on the front page. </p>

<p>Nowadays, there are a heap of newspapers that are struggling commercially to stay afloat, all being somewhat in a deal with gov., of what to write and what not. But the front pages on all of them are that always is something &quot;Shocking! Disgusting! Bloody murder! Deadly attack!&quot; with all the gruesome details and pictures. </p>

<p>Internet just put in on the whole new level. They are always aiming at your attention, and the span is getting shorter.</p>

<p>There was a great lecture on youtube or Ted, I can&#39;t recall for the life of me, about how life is actually getting significantly better then ever before. All covered by statistics. </p>

<p>After all, just look at the avg.life expectancy of people, the quality of services we get , the products of any category that are made to make our life easier. Strangely, there&#39;s less crime now then ever before in history.</p>

<p>In my opinion, life has gotten easier, and we have more time to stay informed (and with distorted information we get) and we got more depressed. Depression is (and will be) a strong enemy to beat in the years to come. Especially in the countries that are just coming to a progressive levels.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve recently come to realisation, just by watching the &quot;non-woke&quot; people, basically comparing myself with the people who has little to none interest in internet, that <strong>&quot;the way the world is&quot; is literally in the eye of the beholder.</strong></p>

<p>I laugh at their optimistic outlook, and think to myself &quot;You fools, you don&#39;t know what&#39;s coming!&quot; </p>

<p>You know what&#39;s coming? </p>

<p>Nothing is coming... and everything is coming! Same as it ever was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the opposite feeling. Instead of believing that terrible times are coming I have a sense of euphoria about the future. We have gone through terrible times already with 9/11 and 16 years of war based on lies and propaganda. There was the financial meltdown that nearly wiped out the middle class. We have been subjected to weather warfare. Artificially engineered droughts, floods, hurricanes, and nuclear tsunamis. We have been poisoned by the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breath. Their vaccines have addled our brains as the schools attempted to brainwash us with fake science, fake history, and fake morals. The media lies to us 24/7 with their fake news and yet nobody believes them anymore. Their control system has fallen. With all their power, and all their resources and all their wealth they have failed to control us.</p>

<p>The terrible things things that happened to us in recent decades only happened because &quot;we the people&quot; were asleep. When people put their heads in the sand and pretend that conspiracy theories aren&#39;t real that is when BAD things happen. That is when the powers that be put us over a barrel and rape us in the ass. BUT times have changed. It is not 2003 anymore when Bush dragged America to war with lies and a 80% approval rating. It is not 2009 anymore when Obama protected wall street with 70% approval ratings even as the olygarchs were looting the country with reckless abandon. Peope have awakened in large numbers and the same lies don&#39;t work anymore. They have lost control of the narrative.  </p>

<p>The light at the end of the tunnel is NOT an oncoming train. When people first awaken they see darkness everywhere whereas before they lived in the bliss of self contained ignorance. They think things are getting worse but their awakening makes things get better. The awakening causes people start fighting back, they start resisting not with violence but with ideas. The whole infowar thing may sound cliche but it really isn&#39;t. The powers that be can&#39;t launch their conspiracies if people know about and it is exposed before they happen. I see very good things happening in the fairly near future of the next 6 months to a year. The world isn&#39;t ending.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is my 2 cents.</p>

<p>This is caused by our current day and age, in which we have both globalization and crisis news reporting.</p>

<p>Crisis news reporting is pretty easy to see.  In order to gain a greater viewership, and thus sell more advertising everything is reported as it the result will be the end of days(just check r/politics and Trump)</p>

<p>Now the globalization, IMO helps to attribute to this as the well developed countries are in a stagnate state, while the less developed countries are(should be) advancing.  Have you ever been on a bus or train, next to another bus/train.  You are sitting still, while the one next to you moves forward, you suddenly get that feeling you are going backwards, when in fact you are sitting still?  I think thats part of what some are feeling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always felt that things will get worse in a &quot;glorified way&quot; first. Meaning that religion, in particular Christianity, will all but be erased only after a greater rejuvenation of the faith. The world would sleep into total debauchery even greater than today. Where empathy and compassion are seen as a weakness and everyone is even further for themselves than they are today. Going so far that every day life is lived on the couch plugged into a virtual reality. That our daily lives will become logging in online and being completely out of our bodies. That&#39;s a big far fetched but I just think that morals have to decline even more so than today before the end will actual come about. </p>

<p>I also feel that in order for the rest of the world to fall, the US has to be eliminated. I do not think America will be here for most of the destruction of the world because it&#39;ll be the first to go. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. I don&#39;t know when it will happen, but I think its clear we are reaching an ultimatum.  We have the internet which gives us the free flow of information to communicate, coordinate, and learn about anything we want, but now its coming to the point where all this technology that&#39;s at our finger tips will either be used to enslave us, or save us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it comes just start making a lot of &quot;blame the rich&quot; signs. And remember it&#39;s not the lawyers or doctors or even $200k/year businessmen who you are angry at. Those people are likely your family and friends. It&#39;s the people who inherited billions of dollars and want more who are the problem. A few examples are people like the Waltons and Kochs and Hiltons who couldn&#39;t give a shit about anyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These thoughts are very situational- and usually occur when you&#39;re anxious or depressed.</p>

<p>The thing is, I think you&#39;re right.</p>

<p>In recent decades, corporations have limited or bought out the numbers of new businesses. Advancements in technology have made it easier than ever to run large-scale corporate chains, while the habitual component of human nature keep them running longer than any individual restaurant/store/business could otherwise as competition.
While in the past you might have 500,000 individual company presidents, you now have 10. Stricter employee rules and a vast sea of potential low-wage workers allow these places to maintain quality consistence while exploiting the market of working people who have few to no other choices in securing jobs.
These corporations are basically becoming kingdoms run by the power obsessed: Walmart, Apple, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, AT&amp;T, Comcast…
The consistency and availability provided by these places have been great for the consumers, but not for workers and start-up entrepreneurs.
That being said- we’re living in an entirely new age: Money is Power, and corporations now provide the entire backbone of the US economy. Kill the corporations, and the United States die too.
We have never experienced anything like this in all of human history. Your grandma likely didn’t work at Walmart into her mid-thirties or pay $100,000 for an education or $500,000 for an acre of land.
That being said, I’m still just a young idiot trying to make sense of things. What concerns me is the fact that my parents (upper-middle class people making $200,000+ per year with a retirement savings in the millions) are beginning to not only doubt the economy, but also the American system. There is an inhumane blindness that comes with this kind of corporate bureaucracy- the disposability of workers and the lack of care. 
My father had a stable job at a smaller –unnamed profession- company, which was recently bought out by a larger corporation: As soon as he leaves, they will likely replace him with a younger person (with more years of education, desperation and debt), and that person will probably make less than half of what my dad made.
The thing is… if these corporations were to suddenly die off, they’d either be replaced by equally ravenous ones, or the US will go under. What do you think Russia or China would do in that moment of weakness? Who would actually come to our aid? 
The decline may be slow and stable, or quick and chaotic- but either way, I cannot see a positive outcome for anyone beyond a select few wealthy individuals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually wonder if Russia <em>would</em> come to our after that point. The Russian czars have consistently fought against the people in power over the course of history, including helping the colonists win the Revolutionary War. That one cost one of the Czars the life of himself and his family about 30-40 years later, IIRC.</p>

<p>They already got a lot of folks&#39; homes and pensions and adjusted to financially struggling as the new norm. I think more car loans will be bubbled before the big electronic money wipeout.</p>
