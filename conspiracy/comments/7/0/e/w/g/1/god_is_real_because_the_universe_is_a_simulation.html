        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;In quantum mechanics, a particle can act as though it is a wave, or a particle. It only &#39;chooses&#39; a state when a human is observing it. Somehow the particle knows it is being observed, and it chooses a state. This is the classic paradox of quantum mechanics and it haunts modern physics. </p>

<p>In software, there is a design called the flyweight pattern. Lets say you want to make a forest. You don&#39;t create 1 million trees. You create 1 tree, 1 object is a tree. You copy this same object everywhere, and only when it is necessary to see the uniqueness of an individual tree do you change the attributes of the tree to be unique. This is extremely common in gaming software. It is a trick so that the software can be infinitely more efficient. Particles are doing the same thing. There is no need to know the properties of a particle until it is being observed, because it is more efficient as a system. </p>

<p>The speed of light. When an object approaches the speed of light, the mass of the object increases, and time slows down. Time slows down, because the system is incapable of processing the location of the object from each point to the next. The local simulation is lagging. It is literally putting too much load on the system, and the calculations of the simulation are not being completed fast enough to keep up with our perception of them. </p>

<p>The universe is indeed a simulation. If it is a simulation, there are creators. If there is a creator, there is a God. Doesn&#39;t mean that anyone&#39;s religion is true, but there is a God.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on the perspective you look from. In this reality, there is only you and this reality therefore, not a simulation from your perspective. Should you zoom out to see multiple realities, you could see multiple yours and multiple realities.</p>

<p>Sort of like when you watch a movie, you are watching a simulated reality. Reality was recorded into a digital or analog playback and we are able to access that moment in time over and over. The actors don&#39;t age (because it is only a recording) but it is seen as a reality when you watch it, while what you are watching is not a reality, but a recording of a reality. As long as that exists, that piece of reality can be replayed many times over. But that recording was created or captured by something/someone and it was their will to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, i&#39;ve looked at a lot of ME examples and when one of them is something you are personally, deeply familiar with, the theory falls apart. example: lion vs wolf in the now famous bible quote about which lies down with the lamb. I&#39;ve been seeing years of misrepresentation using a lion in pictures, verbal references, halmark cards, etc. and long before the ME was a thing i found that misrepresentation annoying.</p>

<p>People saying &quot;i remember it from church&quot; might be right, but no one remembers really in depth reading of the Bible saying lion and lamb.</p>

<p>It talks about what you are talking about.</p>

<p>In essence, the fundamental particle is a formless blob.  </p>

<p>I would add to what you have said, that for example in a video game - which is a simulation.  Imagine you are in a FPS ( First Person Game ).  Where you are looking, in your field of view ( usually between 90 and 110 degrees ) is what the video-card and computer are processing - because it is what is being &quot;observed&quot;.  Directly behind you, is not being observed and therefore not processed - so there is no need for computation cycles to be spent on something that is not necessary to be rendered.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really believe in simulation theory, tbh. MS science is now talking about, which tells me, it&#39;s controlled opposition of some sorts. Anyways, as a programmer, side thought... each tree would be unique, because when you create a class, each child inherits something from the parent class, but has a unique identifier on the basic of levels (ie. a uniqid), identify the instance from the other instances.</p>

<p>That being said, I do believe in a Creator or Creators, just not that we are a simulation, at least not what simulation means to the human mind. </p>

<p>I&#39;m buzzed, hope that makes sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Combining A) the proven holographic nature of reality with B) the multitude of cases of proven past life recollections (recollections that reveal information which couldn&#39;t have been known about in other ways - see Dr. Ian Stevenson&#39;s work on this) show that the universe (i.e. &quot;God&quot;, &quot;The Prime Mover&quot;, &quot;The First Principle&quot;, or whatever you want to call it) is not only intelligent, but that this intelligence infuses every part of creation itself.</p>

<p>Everything is intelligent.  We understand and discern only a certain, very limited part of that intelligence because our own particular type of intelligence is rather limited in its scope.  However, everything being a holographic extension of God means that everything is <em>necessarily</em> God Itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for reading! I&#39;ve spent quite a ridiculous amount of time over the last couple years learning about quantum physics, spirituality, consciousness, and the occult, and I continue to learn more to be able to understand and share concepts like this. There&#39;s so much we&#39;ve been kept hidden from. There&#39;s so much potential within everything. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>When an object approaches the speed of light, the mass of the object increases, and time slows down. Time slows down, because the system is incapable of proc..</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It irks me that people pay so much attention to mumbo-jumbo like ¿Que-Atom or time travel. The more you think about them, the more you realize they are phatasmagorical paradoxes, that is to say, fantasy, birthmark of a highly imaginative mind.</p>

<p>If you were to follow more basic concepts, like the thermodynamic/ electric universe - you&#39;d come to the sensible conclusion that what we perceive as time is neither a dimension that one can traverse, or a mathematical variable that one can calculate and resolve.</p>

<p>The only bending-spacetime I know is Cryostasis, or an increase metabolism of a perfect/reversible lifeform. Cryogenics, like sleep, only &quot;transports&quot; you in the future, never the past. And a being a light that has given its corporeal body to become energy, still, can only travel up until the point of present and never into the past.</p>

<p>Time (as we know it) is not one thing, but everything at once. 
Its the human concept that keeps track the irreversible cycles of all simultaneuous lifeforms so as to make sense of it.
You as human can easily alter the natural process of say, an ice cube, by placing it in an environment that is colder, slower that the benchmark of ice formation. Furthermore you can isolate it and this expands the life process of a mere ice cube exponentially. The natural cycle would spare this tiny ice cube, heating it up and evaporating its corporeality and turning it into water (so it can live) and later into steam energy (so it can ascend). This seems to be more of a comment on the power of the environment over the individual, rather than the control of time.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a God exists that is 7 dimensions above us, then we are nothing more than an ice cube waiting to be chilled and preserved or dynamicly melted, liquefied so it can run its course - or turned into gas so it can be used as its basic denominator as pure energy.</p>

<p>But I doubt that even a God can bring something to life as it originally were, without it suffering minute changes. No perfect copy can evade the rule of entropy.</p>

<p>Therefore quantum-particle calculation and its derivate &quot;time-travel&quot; cannot happend without killing the cat and glueing the fur back together with the skill of a talended taxidermist.</p>

<p>That is to say, if you attempt to time travel, it can only happend if the participant if killed and reassembled at its destination, á la Prestige. 
The reassembly will never have 100% fidelity, so - not a 1:1 copy, not yourself, perhaps you come your evil twin. But man can dream.</p>

<p>Quote the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreversible_process">thermo</a>:
In thermodynamics, a change in the state of a system and all of its surroundings cannot be precisely restored to its initial state by infinitesimal changes in some property of the system without expenditure of energy. A system that undergoes an irreversible process may still be capable of returning to its initial state; however, the impossibility occurs in restoring the environment to its own initial conditions. An irreversible process increases the entropy of the universe. However, because entropy is a state function, the change in entropy of the system is the same whether the process is reversible or irreversible. The second law of thermodynamics can be used to determine whether a process is reversible or not.</p>

<p>All complex natural processes are irreversible. The phenomenon of irreversibility results from the fact that if a thermodynamic system, which is any system of sufficient complexity, of interacting molecules is brought from one thermodynamic state to another, the configuration or arrangement of the atoms and molecules in the system will change in a way that is not easily predictable. A certain amount of &quot;transformation energy&quot; will be used as the molecules of the &quot;working body&quot; do work on each other when they change from one state to another. During this transformation, there will be a certain amount of heat energy loss or dissipation due to intermolecular friction and collisions; energy that will not be recoverable if the process is reversed.</p>

<p>Many biological processes that were once thought to be reversible have been found to actually be a pairing of two irreversible processes. Whereas a single enzyme was once believed to catalyze both the forward and reverse chemical changes, research has found that two separate enzymes of similar structure are typically needed to perform what results in a pair of thermodynamically irreversible processes.</p>

<p>No. This is a popular misunderstanding. The waveform collapses when any interaction could measure it&#39;s state. This whole idea of a conscious observer is new age bullshit to promote their pseudo science / religion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Combining A) the proven holographic nature of reality with B) the multitude of cases of proven past life recollections (recollections that reveal information which couldn&#39;t have been known about in other ways - see Dr. Ian Stevenson&#39;s work on this) show that the universe (i.e. &quot;God&quot;, &quot;The Prime Mover&quot;, &quot;The First Principle&quot;, or whatever you want to call it) is not only intelligent, but that this intelligence infuses every part of creation itself.</p>

<p>Everything is intelligent.  We understand and discern only a certain, very limited part of that intelligence because our own particular type of intelligence is rather limited in its scope.  However, everything being a holographic extension of God means that everything is <em>necessarily</em> God Itself.</p>
