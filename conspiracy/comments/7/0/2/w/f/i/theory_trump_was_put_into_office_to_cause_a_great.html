       I read posts on Facebook occasionally and talk of a civil war seems to be amping  up. Many Trump supporters openly talking about executing "dumbocrats," the government forcing their hand if they somehow remove this constitutionally elected president, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really believe in a good or bad side in this thing, except that TPTB benefit from a divided populace, but I see a lot of Trump supporters convinced of things with no evidence- dead people and illegal aliens voted for Trump, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like Trump. I don't like Hillary or Obama. People, however, do. How do we prevent civil strife and help fellow citizens realize the real enemy is the one who benefits when we fight amongst ourselves?

       That's what Obama was for. I called it in 08. Obama was put there to fuel racial divide, paving the way for Trump to be president. I forget what forum I posted that in, wish I could find it.

       Perhaps not him personally, but it was part of the agenda of the ptb to divide the country. You had the tea party. You had the administration spying on the tea party. You had blm and other race driven groups pop up. It was by design.

       That's all he did. He was a black president. Barack Obama was a "moderate" somewhat mysterious pretty much "third way" corporate Democrat who would not significantly rock the boat at a time when Americans were utterly sick of Republicans -- a time when any Democrat was almost sure to win. He was supposed to be a one term president, but that failed.
      </p>
      <p>
       While Barack Obama did a few things to help people other than white males, it was not a major part of his agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       His main agenda was to please capitalists and avoid reversing the unprecedented damage that occurred under the GWB administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before Barack Obama was elected, there were tell-tale sings. The one that comes to mind right away is his glowing review of Ronald Reagan.
      </p>
      <p>
       History is always unique, but there are conceptual repeats. In 1992, people were exhausted by the Reagan/Bush economy, and a Democrat was nearly certain to win. That's why it was so important for the oligarchy to support the "third way" Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton was a better tool of oligarchy than Barack Obama, as he did virtually nothing for the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is no coincidence that Republicans generally receive more corporate money than Democrats except in certain years -- 1992, 2008, and 2016. In the first two, the Democrat was likely to win, so why not get your compliance money in early? In 2016, that's recent history so we all have our ideas.

       It was the Council for National Policy that pushed Trump, along with the usual lobbyists and corporate backers that also bought HRC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steve Bannon is a member of the Council for National Policy, when he got the boot we can assume that the CNP also got the boot.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion the Deep State decided to take the Clintons down a notch and threw the election to Trump. Then they got to work on forcing him to disown all those policies that didn't conform to their agenda. At this point that process has been completed, he is a tool. He's just like Kanye at this point lol. If he steps out of line too much, they will get rid of him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Civil War 2 thing was part of Bannon and the CNP's agenda. Bannon was a fan of the book The Fourth Turning, which explains where he was coming from and what he was trying to do. Now that he's out, I think we're back to a globalist agenda, but who the hell knows what's really going on.

       Of course, putting him into presidency rifes up both the left and the right and when he is overthrown, there will be civil war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the elite's final goal is to cause a civil war, it is not surprising that putting Trump in has its own reasons. It's creative destruction.

        but I see a lot of Trump supporters convinced of things with no evidence- dead people and illegal aliens voted for Trump, for example.

       Sure you didn't get that backwards?  Dead people were voting democratic and Hillary supporters were convinced of Russian collusion with no evidence.

       No evidence huh?

       Better lock that echo chamber tightly to your ears cause that Fox News talking point is eventually gonna run out of time.

       BTW, I'm not a Hillary supporter. I think that she should just STFU and basically disappear like most other failed Presidential candidates.

       Why on earth would illegal immigrants vote for Trump? Did this guy not read his own post, or did he party-swap a post about Hillary?

       My mistake. Yes, they've been saying dead people and illegal aliens voted for Clinton, but offer no proof- maybe a couple isolated incidents, but nothing eyebrow-raising.

       I had for many years, but if everyone congregated at a certain village square and posted and voiced their opinions there, it's only wise to visit to see what they're up to.

       Yes, they're trolling us with Trump. Not sure we'll devolve into civil war though. Certainly done a good job dividing us though. Not sure how to convince people. It's hard to break people out of a hypnotic trance.
