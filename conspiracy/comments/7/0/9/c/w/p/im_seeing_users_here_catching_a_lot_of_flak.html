        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We already possess the technological capability of drastically affecting weather patterns.</p>

<p>Ionospheric heaters (basically multiple high power radio transmitters forming an array) are used to direct and focus vast amounts of radio energy far into the ionosphere with a steerable electromagnetic beam.</p>

<p>The targeted area of the ionosphere (generally 30 to 40 miles in diameter and extending upwards hundreds of miles in a cone shape) absorbs this massive amount of radio frequency energy and heats up immediately, rising like a 30 mile-wide hot air balloon as it does so.  Portions of the ionosphere can be lifted up to 20 miles in altitude further than the surrounding ionospheric layer, creating a low pressure weather system directly below the area being heated.</p>

<p>To help visualize this, imagine a table with a crisp new bedsheet spread across the top. Grabbing the sheet in the center with your fingertips and quickly pulling it up a few feet creates a momentary vacuum underneath the sheet; you can feel this vacuum in the extra resistance offered by the sheet.  Air quickly flows from the surrounding areas into the low pressure area under the sheet until the air pressures on top and underneath the sheet equalize. </p>

<p>This is how hurricanes can be steered and even created. If you can influence barometric pressure, you can influence the weather.  We&#39;ve had technology which can alter barometric pressure by heating the ionosphere for decades. 
That experimentation is now assisted by sophisticated computer programs which further enable the effectiveness of these systems.</p>

<p>Weather control isn&#39;t tin foil hat material.</p>

<p>This is basic fluid mechanics (gas dynamics) being manipulated by old technologies.</p>

<p>Anyone can verify for themselves that ionospheric heaters are possessed by many all over the world. Anyone with a basic understanding of science can understand how heating and displacing upwards huge swaths (thousands of cubic miles) of the upper atmosphere can result in barometric pressure changes below.</p>

<p>That is weather control, and we&#39;ve been experimenting with it for decades. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to point my finger at HAARP or any of the other skyheater facilities currently engaged in research known to the public.  I believe the CIA and shadow government groups are fully capable of setting up clandestine arrays, unknown to most, for their own purposes. </p>

<p>These radio arrays are capable of far more than the simple ionospheric heating I&#39;ve written about here. If you&#39;re​ interested, please check out the links below.</p>

<p>Those still sleeping maintain the perspective that nothing is real unless the mainstream television &quot;news&quot; programs acknowledge it.</p>

<p>Dream on.</p>

<p>The US Air Force and DARPA would like us to believe that they have stopped using HAARP in Alaska for research and experiment. Even then, we all know that there are other HAARP systems out there in the form of radar communication and surveillance systems that are rigged on top of mobile platforms that are deployable in any international waters around the world.</p>

<p>All they need to do is twist a button to change the frequency to microwave range and increase the frequency modulated [FM] transmission power enough to reach and heat up the atmosphere above the target.</p>

<p>The technology is covered under US Patent 4,686,605 on the “Method and Apparatus for Altering a Region in the Earth’s Atmosphere, Ionosphere, and/or Magnetosphere.”</p>

<p>There are a couple of benefits listed right there in the article. Do you not perceive those as benefits?</p>

<p>Here are a few more. There are others which are more subjective, such as checking gender:</p>

<ul>
<li>Confirm early pregnancy using a vaginal ultrasound</li>
<li>Detect multiple births</li>
<li>Calculate due date through measurements of fetus’ skull, femur, or crown-rump length (done in second trimester)</li>

<p>I&#39;m not here to spoon feed you. You can look it up yourself. In summary though, all of those points provide the mother and doctor with more information about the health of the baby. It&#39;s sometimes necessary to make <em>hard decisions</em> based on that information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, had a quick skim through those articles by &quot;Doctors&quot; (are you arguing from authority now? :-) ) and followed the links where possible.</p>

<p><strong>In all cases the speculated risks were unproven. There was no conclusive evidence that ultrasound is unsafe in any linked study.</strong></p>

<p>So the question is: in the absence of evidence, why do you apparently <em>know</em> that ultrasound is unsafe?</p>

<p>At this point it seems you are leaping to conclusions and only considering the speculative parts you already agree with from all the studies undertaken. Classic confirmation bias at work.</p>

<p>The maximum output of HAARP was 3.6 MW. In the middle of the day, sunlight falling on a 30-mile wide area is about 2.49 TW. That&#39;s more than 690,000 times the power of HAARP.</p>

<p>And hurricanes are actually steered by air currents that build up over a much bigger area than just a 30 mile diameter zone.</p>

<p>Do you have any evidence that such a small amount of power could influence a hurricane <em>at all</em>?</p>

<p>Also, how would they get the power to the area needed to (allegedly) steer the hurricane? Do they have ships with HAARP areas going around the ocean that nobody has noticed?</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of cubic miles of ionosphere are raised 80 degrees higher than surrounding ambient temperature and you want to pretend there&#39;s no effects from that?  </p>

<p>So, the officials assured us the energy they were adding to the system is a drop in the bucket. Does that automatically rule out any physical effects whatsoever? That&#39;s some wierd science. </p>

<p>Kinda reminds me of when we were told DDT was safe and they distributed propaganda films showing groups of kids playing in the pesticide fog being sprayed on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, the energy is a drop in the bucket, if <a href="/u/twsmith">/u/twsmith</a>&#39;s numbers are correct. The suns energy output is about 1000 times the output of the radio array, even if all the energy is absorbed, at least 100 times more energy from the sun is absorbed. That&#39;s why I&#39;m comparing it to the sun, because it is the other major lightsource in the atmosphere, so if this radio array has this large an effect, the effect from the sun should be about 100 times larger. </p>

<p>You have one source that adds one unit of energy of energy to the system, and another that adds 1000 units of energy to the system. If any added energy has an effect, which of these sources do you think would cause it? </p>

<p>Yes, there is an effect, but it&#39;s so small to <em>any</em> effect the sun would have. </p>

<p>Air changes altitude all the time, that&#39;s how we get winds. What makes one source of energy more natural than another? The origin of the energy is irrelevant, the amount is. </p>

<p>provided a pretty conclusive argument to why the effect from the array is negligible in comparison to the energy from the sun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are thinking about this inaccurately.</p>

<p>I tried to come up with a better scenario, but this will have to do.</p>

<p>Imagine a bunch of streams of water (say hoses) arranged in a circle all shooting water into a central point. Let&#39;s say these streams combine and make a vortex of water.</p>

<p>These hoses are the energy from the sun. The vortex is the chaotic, but balanced delicate system that arises after the system equalizes and becomes steady.</p>

<p>Now take a much smaller but more focused beam of water, and shoot it at a particular spot on this large vortex.</p>

<p>The balance is interrupted, you get a chaotic effect, even though the energy input is orders of magntitude smaller than what was being pumped into this original system.</p>

<p>Earth&#39;s weather systems go from balanced to unbelievably chaotic from very small changes. This is literally one of the main examples of chaos theory. </p>

<p>The op i responded to tried to show that the power output from the sun being much larger than HAARP&#39;s capability output meaning HAARP&#39;s output is negligible in terms of atmospheric influence. However i pointed out that if you understand how blackbody radiation works, the power output from the sun is spread out over many frequencies, the most dominant being visible light and dropping off exponentially as the wavelengths get larger. </p>

<p>now... take the 2.49TW output, and calculate the microwave energy component. then compare that to the 3.6 MW. i leave this exercise to the reader :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All i&#39;m saying is that your assertion that the dominant power output of sunlight is in the visible spectrum is simply false. Infrared exceeds it. See the chart. </p>

<p>The fact that you can easily pump more power in a specific frequency range (microwaves? sure, why not) than the sun is putting out in some specific wavelength is of course true. It&#39;s the only reason any radio communication works at all, otherwise every signal we&#39;d try to send would be below the noise floor of the sun.</p>

<p>The leap of logic that I don&#39;t follow is why those specific microwave frequencies are able to control the weather, vs well known macro phenomenon like convection that are operating with a lot more energy than you&#39;re saying is being put into one band</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is a leap of logic. so i apologize for claiming to understand the mechanics of how it works. i think it still uses the IR convection process but because microwaves can heat up water particles on the upper atmosphere, you get an overall increase in temperature. that&#39;s what i imagined op was getting at when saying microwave heaters  </p>

<p>The maximum output of HAARP was 3.6 MW. In the middle of the day, sunlight falling on a 30-mile wide area is about 2.49 TW. That&#39;s more than 690,000 times the power of HAARP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Official literature on ionospheric heaters says there&#39;s an average 80 degree F rise above ambient temperatures in the gases being affected. Raise a column of gases 30 miles in diameter and hundreds of miles high (even if you only use a 30M x 30M x 30M cube as an example, <strong>that&#39;s 27,000 cubic miles</strong> of affected gases) 80 degrees Fahrenheit over the natural ambient temperature, and you&#39;re going to get measurable effects down below.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And hurricanes are actually steered by air currents that build up over a much bigger area than just a 30 mile diameter zone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course they do.  The 30 mile diameter is the extent of only the low pressure zone.  Air from all directions flows in from outside the 30 mile diameter area to equalize pressure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have any evidence that such a small amount of power could influence a hurricane at all?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not the kind of evidence you insist on.  You&#39;re still sleeping, so you want a CNN article verifying to the masses that our government possesses and uses a weapon that the government would never allow their mouthpieces to report on.  I do, however, have common sense and the ability to use my knowledge in the area of science to spot when obviously important information is being intentionally withheld, skirted around, or brushed under the carpet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, how would they get the power to the area needed to (allegedly) steer the hurricane? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The electromagnetic beam is steerable itself.  You seem to think an array has to be set up directly underneath the weather systems it is modifying.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do they have ships with HAARP areas going around the ocean that nobody has noticed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The array doesn&#39;t have to be in the ocean or even near the ocean in order to change weather patterns.  Regardless, you just assume that the brilliant military minds of this day and age haven&#39;t figured out how to make this technology mobile?</p>

<p>They&#39;re putting them on trucks, planes, ships, and oil rigs.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You are thinking about this inaccurately.</p>

<p>I tried to come up with a better scenario, but this will have to do.</p>

<p>Imagine a bunch of streams of water (say hoses) arranged in a circle all shooting water into a central point. Let&#39;s say these streams combine and make a vortex of water.</p>

<p>These hoses are the energy from the sun. The vortex is the chaotic, but balanced delicate system that arises after the system equalizes and becomes steady.</p>

<p>Now take a much smaller but more focused beam of water, and shoot it at a particular spot on this large vortex.</p>

<p>The balance is interrupted, you get a chaotic effect, even though the energy input is orders of magntitude smaller than this original system.</p>

<p>Earth&#39;s weather systems go from balanced to unbelievably chaotic from very small changes. This is literally one of the main examples of chaos theory. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You and twsmith haven&#39;t provided <strong>any</strong> &quot;conclusive&quot; arguments.  </p>

<p>Your argument seems to hinge entirely on your incorrect belief that adding a comparatively small amount of energy to a large system produces no effects whatsoever, as if it didn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>The energy added to a hot air balloon is negligible compared to the energy the atmosphere is soaking up from the sun, but the hot air rises and provides lift to the ballon regardless because it is a collection of hot air
which rises above the cooler ambient air. </p>

<p>According to the arguments you&#39;ve offered here, nothing should make the balloon take off, because the amount of energy being directed into the balloon is negligible compared to the ambient energy offered by the sun.</p>

<p>The energy levels and their disparity have no deciding factor in this situation.  You&#39;ve taken something that&#39;s not even a factor and claimed it to be the end-all for your argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you even read my comments? I have never said it produces no effect, just that it&#39;s small. Air has a heat capacity of about 1kJ/m<sup>3*K.</sup> That means if <em>everything</em> is absorbed you can heat a 20x10x10 cube 1 degree Kelvin per second (20<em>10</em>10=2000 kW = 2MW). Or a 20x10x10 km<sup>3</sup> cube 1 degree K every 31 years. Yes. <em>YEARS</em>. The volume is (10<sup>3)<sup>3=10<sup>9</sup></sup></sup> times larger, so to get the same increase in temperature it takes 10<sup>9</sup> times longer time. 10<sup>9</sup> seconds = 11000 days = 31 years. And that&#39;s without considering any energy lost due to the surrounding air. </p>

<p>The air in a hot air balloon is about 120C, that&#39;s not a negligible amount. </p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you can do some fancy math, but when your results say that something that&#39;s been happening for decades isn&#39;t possible, its time to admit you might be missing something in your thought process. You&#39;ve been going around in circles making unfounded claims and incorrectly conflating completely unrelated disciplines in an attempt to muddy the waters, and now you&#39;re trying to say that the effects observed by ionospheric heating facility scientists is impossible.</p>

<p>NO! Are you retarded? What is it you don&#39;t understand? The math I did was for your arrays  ONLY. You would have to do MORE MATH for the effects of the sun, emissions from our factories and everything else. If scientists measure this effect, it&#39;s because of something else than those arrays, THAT&#39;S what my math showed. My math showed that IF these arrays would be used to heat a 10x10x20 km block of air, they would heat it by one degree every 31 years. If the atmospheres temperature does not increase by one degree every 31 years SOMETHING ELSE IS HEATING/COOLING IT TOO. THAT&#39;S BASIC LOGIC. </p>

<p>How big is the area of effect? I looked in your sources, and the biggest I could find was 3.6 MW. If that&#39;s spread over a height of 10 km you get about 360 W every meter. The sun provides about 200 W/m<sup>2</sup> on the surface, so to be comparable your solar array heats a 2m<sup>2</sup> x 10 km block of air. Not enough to have a large effect on the weather, i would say. </p>

<p>3600kW of RF power at frequencies from 2.8 - 10 MHz</p>

<p>Hurricane: 700000000000kW</p>

<p>Modifications of storms of thunderstorm size and larger are unlikely because of the energy required, the unknown side effects, and possible treaty violations.</p>

Power: 3,600,000 Watts (3.6 MW)

<p>This is how much power it takes to heat the volume of air we&#39;re discussing.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re acting like heating this volume of air is impossible, despite the array in Alaska doing it regularly.</p>

<p>Once you realize that what you assumed impossible has been happening for decades, you&#39;ll realize why your comment is absurd.</p>

<p>Read the fucking post next time, at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible also tells you that if you hit your slave and he dies it is bad but if you hit your slave and he lives for at least 3 days, it is okay because he is your slave. 
Or maybe I should refer you to the fact that women don&#39;t have a say so in &quot;God&#39;s word.&quot;
Or if you&#39;d like we can talk about the loads of &quot;legends&quot; in the Bible that have no scientific or historical evidence.</p>

<p>But no it&#39;s much easier to believe that an entity outside our universe controls anything and everything, contradicts himself for good and evil, and told multiple men to write down stories, all of which somehow compiled together to form the Bible.</p>
