    <div class="md"><p>1) In the linked zip package you can find a qEEG in EDF format and much more.
2) Electromagnetic waves are ruled by Maxwell equations and their solutions are studied from more than a century. Frey effect or the work of Lin and Sharp prove that inducing voices is possible but awkward. This technology is precise, selective and incompatible with the constraints of electromagnetic waves for the ability to track a shielded target. If not targeted individuals could easily defend from it, which is not.
3) Who do you think to be to talk of &quot;intentionally disinforming&quot;? I am a PhD in my field, I have an experience of target individual and I suggest you to document much better before criticizing different points of view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) The qEEG is not an image but it is in the form of raw data so it can be Fourier transformed for a frequency domain analysis. It shows brain response to external, superimposed signals. Please note that neither microwaves nor ultrasound can do this in any way.
2) Microwaves have to be targeted to a precise region of the head for V2K, but you cannot do so if target is hidden from view or shielded.
3) Ultrasounds don&#39;t penetrate walls and this closes the discussion about that and sonar.
4) Radars don&#39;t penetrate mountains, I made an experiment about hearing voices in the laboratory of Gran Sasso, which is a nuclear facility under a mountain and is fully shielded from electromagnetic waves. They did not share their measurements with me for state reasons.
5) My field is relevant because I know general engineering and not only computer one, so I had to study a lot of physics for gaining my degrees. Moreover, I have made peer reviewed research work and this proves the ability to do a scientific analysis.
6) Electromagnetic measurements don&#39;t reveal the information carrier, probably a WISP of dark matter, and are mostly useless in this field. I don&#39;t mind about the different opinion of many researchers on electronic harassment.
7) Searching the Web is not enough, you should check the assertions you can find there from a scientific point of view.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The 1400 metre-rock thickness above the Laboratory represents a natural coverage that provides a cosmic ray flux reduction by one million times; moreover, the flux of neutrons in the underground halls is about thousand times less than on the surface due to the very small amount of uranium and thorium of the Dolomite calcareous rock of the mountain.</p>

<p>The permeability of cosmic radiation provided by the rock coverage together with the huge dimensions and the impressive basic infrastructure, make the Laboratory unmatched in the detection of weak or rare signals, which are relevant for astroparticle, sub nuclear and nuclear physics.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) I said the qEEG &quot;shows brain response to external, superimposed signals&quot; but I should have added &quot;locally&quot; to the single functional area. If you succeed replicating such a pattern by microwaves please phone me. Anyway, to influence brainwaves in a much more systemic way, microwaves have to be so strong to affect also domestic electronics up to the point of possibly burning them, as it happens with LIDA machine.</p>

<p>2) The precise region of the head to be hit by microwaves is shown in the original article of Allen Frey and I suppose you know it. Have your radars enough resolution to target it and track it while you are moving? Remember that a single person moving in a crowd can be affected.</p>

<p>3) Ultrasounds reflect on walls and the proof is that they can be used to measure distances with big accuracy by their reflections on surfaces. What other considerations do you need? Infrasounds can penetrate walls, but are not directional and hit everybody in the room.</p>

<p>4) ELFs cannot be modulated in amplitude in the vocal range of frequencies since some theorem of information theory requires an higher frequency carrier for such a bandwidth, which is in the range of KHz. Again, if your radar succeeds in penetrating Gran Sasso up to the laboratory underneath it you should phone me.</p>

<p>5) The laboratory is EM shielded in such a way that only some rare muon, neutrinos and (perhaps) dark matter can enter it. This because experiments conduced there need to be isolated by every interference from the environment. An example of experiment conduced there is neutrino oscillation. As I premised, &quot;They did not share their measurements with me for state reason&quot; but I was clearly able to hear my &quot;voices&quot; also there for a prolonged time.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lngs.infn.it/en">https://www.lngs.infn.it/en</a></p>

<p>6) A prototype and incomplete analysis is included in the paper you have already read but it is necessary to determine the exact carrier of information, before performing any deepening or calculation. This is baffling because also official science is doubtful about the constituents of dark matter. High energy neutrinos could be apt or not, depending from the energy of the beam, but they seem unlikely.</p>

<p>7) A single, simple experiment can exclude a lot of candidates to the role of information carrier for the RNM system. It is much more worthy that a thousand of uncertain EM measurements, which are always under the level of biological alert or so.</p>

<p>5) ELFs are not apt to bring mental voices for reasons already discussed. Also gamma rays could penetrate rock, but are not apt also them and I cannot see why to introduce them in the discussion. You need an higher frequency carrier. Higher frequencies, your pseudo-ELF, are filtered by the rock as the microwave beam which act as a carrier.</p>

<p>Furthermore, altering EEGs is not remote neural monitoring. EEGs do not need to be altered to conduct RNM.Altering EEGs is brain zapping.  A completely different topic.

<p>No. The depth of the rock near the door is considerably less than the depth at the top of the room. The photo depicts a shiny door. Steel or aluminum. ELF, ultra wideband radar and ground penetrating radar penetrate steel and aluminum. voices are not RNM. ELF conducts RNM. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The point is: how the target&#39;s brain currents can be read and influenced (2-way communication) from outside the Gran Sasso laboratory, which is shielded from most known interactions? Surely not by electromagnetic waves of no kind and not by ultrasounds, which have been excluded in the debate. Then, other considerations on sensibility of consumer electronics strengthen the idea electromagnetism is not involved at all. Your wikis are all about known technologies, mostly electromagnetic weapons, but it&#39;s clear the Remote system is based on a different information carrier. This is the main objection.</p>

<p>Then, if I state some specific and unknown assertion I have to corroborate it by something to show to the reader, but when I speak about generally known physical principles, the burden of the check can easily be demanded to the reader himself. So, ELF are not apt for carrying voices, pseudo-ELF (as you call them) and microwaves are not such penetrating, ultrasound are not apt at since they bounce all and infrasounds cannot be directed. Reading brainwaves remotely is even more awkward, no known technology (SQUID-based) can do this from more than few meters.</p>

<p>So I repeat a concept: every target individual can make all the measurements he wants, but my personal experience show that new physics is involved and new detectors should probably be developed. The nature of dark matter is a main research problem of modern science and for sure I cannot solve it by myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Curious, all this hostility when I am here to openly discuss my theory. It is so because I broke some presumed monopoly of knowledge? If it was so I cannot apologize, but it could be worst. As I asked before, is there some hidden business behind the drama of target individuals? How many trials have been concluded with a condemn of the government, in spite of all your electromagnetic measurements?</p>

<p>Moreover, you have not justified how is it possible to read EM signals from outside a mountain of 1.4 Km of altitude, which is a key aspect. And, if you dig a mountain and build an EM shielded laboratory in the middle of it, you can reasonably be sure to be protected in all the directions, also from a geometric point of view.</p>

<p>But I will no more lose my time in responding to objections I have already replied in detail, the readers can judge by themselves and check my assertions and your assertions independently from suggested sources. I don&#39;t fear downvoting or other rating mechanisms. Your attacks will fall in the void, unless some new argument is presented.</p>

<p>Debating is not an act of hostility. I am not hostile. You have more than one theory. I refuted your theories.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is so because I broke some presumed monopoly of knowledge?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You broke laws of physics regarding EMF and ultrasound.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, you have not justified how is it possible to read EM signals from outside a mountain of 1.4 Km of altitude, which is a key aspect. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have not provided evidence that EMF signals inside lab were remotely read. Your sole &quot;evidence&quot; is hearing voices. Hearing voices is not RNM and may not be via EMF. </p>

<p>You continue to refuse to use EMF meters and sound meters. Very strange refusal coming from a self proclaimed scientist. Scientists are trained to take measurements and to rule out the obvious with data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And, if you dig a mountain and build an EM shielded laboratory in the middle of it, you can reasonably be sure to be protected in all the directions, also from a geometric point of view.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I refuted this twice already. Reiterating your beliefs do not make them real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not an expert, but from my understanding. Masers or some kind of infrasound is used to entrain the brain and establish a communication channel. The entrainment signal is a known noise used as a backdrop, once the brain is attenuated. </p>

<p>Some biorelevant feedback may be readable just based on how the Maser changes depending on what it hits.</p>

<p>Ion cyclotron resonance or some kind of ion channels are used to flag and continually monitor the subject. </p>

<p>The reading of bio-relevant feedback is what is almost unbelievable to me. The synthetic phenomenalism is also very surprising. How hallucinations are done, when the visual cortex is enactivist must require some serious computation or maths. Scents too are also surprising. It seems as though some sensory somatic voxels have a common representation or that their experience as sensation does not require all of that individual&#39;s attention, relation content, or conceptual self.</p>

<p>Voices are easy. The Frey auditory effect can be done with a simple circuit.</p>

<p>Brain-to-Brain linking is a bit more trickery, but totally in the realm of possibility. See &quot;the world science festival&quot; on youtube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) The qEEG is not an image but it is in the form of raw data so it can be Fourier transformed for a frequency domain analysis. It shows brain response to external, superimposed signals. Please note that neither microwaves nor ultrasound can do this in any way.
2) Microwaves have to be targeted to a precise region of the head for V2K, but you cannot do so if target is hidden from view or shielded.
3) Ultrasounds don&#39;t penetrate walls and this closes the discussion about that and sonar.
4) Radars don&#39;t penetrate mountains, I made an experiment about hearing voices in the laboratory of Gran Sasso, which is a nuclear facility under a mountain and is fully shielded from electromagnetic waves. They did not share their measurements with me for state reasons.
5) My field is relevant because I know general engineering and not only computer one, so I had to study a lot of physics for gaining my degrees. Moreover, I have made peer reviewed research work and this proves the ability to do a scientific analysis.
6) Electromagnetic measurements don&#39;t reveal the information carrier, probably a WISP of dark matter, and are mostly useless in this field. I don&#39;t mind about the different opinion of many researchers on electronic harassment.
7) Searching the Web is not enough, you should check the assertions you can find there from a scientific point of view.</p>
