        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In 2008 after Obama was elected, I believe the plan between Putin/Russia and Trump to get Trump elected was born. America had just elected someone who was anti-corruption/anti-elitist/big on regulations yadda yadda which of course is terrible for the game of one of the most corrupt countries in the world (Russia) and one of the most corrupt bussiness men in the world (Trump). In November 2008 Obama was elected president. In November 2008, Medvedev (Putin&#39;s hand picked successor) proposed extending terms from 4 to 6 years. This is when the ball started rolling I believe. They made a deal with Trump and knew they would be very busy during 2016. Putin would be much too busy in 2016 conspiring against America to run for a 3rd term as Russian President so they made the rule change the very same month. Trump spent his next 8 years bashing Obama in the media online and on television you well know. And the rest is history.
Also to add to this. I also believe their plan was to get Romney elected in 2012 and then Trump would run as a Democrat in 2016 after turning on Romney (to the public) and take over but obviously that didn&#39;t work out so Trump transformed into a Republican. His stances were very liberal at the time he was helping Romney although Romney was a Republican candidate which is why I believe this was the original plan. Trump left Republican party in 2011.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a little recap about the Obama presidency:</p>

<ul>
<li>Obama expanded the USA into seven(!) wars</li>
<li>Hunted more whistleblowers than all previous presidents combined</li>
<li>Expanded and implemented wide-ranging illegal surveillance on US citizens and lied about the scope of the spying</li>
<li>Illegally spied on political opponents</li>
<li>Knew about Hillary Clinton&#39;s illegal email server that she used to hide her pay-for-play dealings and corruption</li>
<li>Knew about Hillary&#39;s illegal handling of classified intel material</li>
<li>Conspired to cover up the matter of the illegal email server since Obama himself is implicated in the emails</li>
<li>Let laws be passed that enables the use of propaganda on US citizens through domestic propaganda programs</li>
</ul>

<p>There is even more, it was by no measure a good time.</p>

<p>Not really as squeaky clean as MSM wants you to believe.</p>
