<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/">https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/</a></p>

<p>Our enemy has unlimited funding, (nearly) unlimited manpower, and the full backing of our very own Western governments.  They actively intrude on our ability to have genuine conversations and interactions, and persistently inject misinformation and propaganda to corrupt the perceptions of everyday humans, who are just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this crazy world.</p>

<p>The mods are supposed to be our line of defense against this widespread electronic warfare campaign, but they can only do so much.  It&#39;s a daunting task, so we can&#39;t be too hard on them for not succeeding.  A few guys against half the world isn&#39;t exactly a winning scenario.</p>

<p>But at what point do mods become part of the problem, and not the solution?  It seems that calling out the <em>most obvious</em> of trolls and astroturfers gets a swift ban, while the most notorious spammers continue, untouched.  When is enough, enough?</p>

<p>If we won&#39;t take a stand against the organizations who have a well documented history of subverting us, what can we do?  When we double down, and instead, ban the people who stand up to them, how long will it last?</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t only about this one subreddit.  The war is waged against the entire internet forum, with r/conspiracy being one of the latest forums to fall.  Will we even be <em>able</em> to have genuine conversations in a few years?  Or will it be nothing but fields and fields of AstroTurf, as far as the browser can see?</p>

<p>What happens if someone calls you out? Honestly to me, attacking shills and hunting shills and creating a demon about shills is exactly what counter-intelligence shilling would want. Then a safe space of acceptable content is presented to the masses because all else is pushed by a paid shill on the internet a place known for truth.</p>

<p>You&#39;re creating a narrative for me and creating an environment where my speech doesn&#39;t feel protected because I lost internet points. </p>

<p>The only thing that censors my speech is a moderating banning me. Nothing else. I&#39;ll defeat any shill. At least, I&#39;ll pretend I did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno. Plenty of people use Reddit differently. Many of the most respected users here only post to this sub and do so constantly, some only on select topics. Which is what I would do if I were a shill that wanted to control the tone and dynamic of a sub. Lots of people also have separate accounts for general use and places like this, or just creating new accounts. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not in any of those groups. I have 5 years of continuous, varied activity (in comment sections ranging from mindless shitpost comments to discussions/arguments and so on. But I still don&#39;t believe anything conclusive can be drawn from user histories most of the time. What separates a passionate user of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> trying to &quot;redpill&quot; people from a shill trying to push falsehoods that can be seen from post histories? </p>

<p>You&#39;re correct that it is effective propaganda, which is why shills are always hunting for shills, and real users only call them out when there&#39;s a lot of evidence.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t care if small pockets of individuals don&#39;t buy it.  As long as the masses believe it, or if we <em>believe</em> that the masses believe it, the propaganda still serves its purpose, in spite of any <em>individual&#39;s</em> intellectualism.</p>

<p>Being unable to call out shills effectively, is what makes this strategy so effective.  You can&#39;t accurately pinpoint all of them, because they hide in the masses of &quot;anonymous&quot; opinions.  It doesn&#39;t make it intellectually dishonest, inherently.  It just makes it very difficult to do, with any accuracy.  And in the &quot;lashing out&quot;, some &quot;innocent bystanders&quot; can be caught in the mix.</p>

<p>If you stick to those basic axioms, then whether a lie is repeated enough or not becomes irrelevant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Being unable to call out shills effectively, is what makes this strategy so effective.</p>

<p>Wrong.  If you can point out how a &quot;lie&quot; is logically inconsistent or fallacious (or outright wrong) then you do more for your argument than simply calling someone who you disagree with a &quot;shill&quot;.  That&#39;s why this part is important -</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ignoring someone&#39;s arguments in favor of labeling said poster a shill (even if they are a shill) is intellectually dishonest.</p>

<p>I see so many people in this subreddit who do not understand the subject being discussed simply hand wave away a comment while calling the person in question a shill.  If you can&#39;t address a &quot;shill&#39;s&quot; comment and instead resort to ad hominem, then you should spend more time learning about the subject.</p>

<p>That&#39;s false and dangerous. Most people cannot think for themselves, which is why propaganda works. </p>

<p>The mod team here seems to believe this myth, however, and continues to tolerate blatant propaganda, vote botting in the comments, and other shenanigans that they can shut down.</p>

<p>Best solutions are to either have no moderation of comments outside reddit rules (so the sub doesn&#39;t get banned), or aggressively remove obvious shilling.</p>

<p>Wrong, yet again.  If the person posting is clearly a shill then surely they have flaws in their premises.  Attack the logic behind their argument, don&#39;t attack the poster.  It&#39;s literally fallacious reasoning.</p>

<p>Person A and Person B are discussing voter ID laws.  Person A provides several examples to support their argument while person B accuses them of being a shill while ignoring person A&#39;s argument.  What do you think that the readers will think when they see this exchange?  I would think that Person B doesn&#39;t actually understand what is being discussed and is lashing out.</p>

<p>If the mods want to improve this subreddit then they would foster an environment where critical thought is rewarded instead of enforcing a circle jerk.  The Socratic Method is a tried and true method to provoke critical thought.  Again, simply attempting to shout someone down as being a shill is intellectually weak.</p>

<p>Contrived example designed to undermine the point being made. Shills don&#39;t use arguments. They screech and trick a few people without critical thinking skills, then they run vote bots. </p>

<p>The vote botting is the main reason shills need to be aggressively removed on reddit. Mods can&#39;t control the fake votes, but they can deny a platform to no-content garbage and deny them any opportunity to bot it up.</p>

<p>&quot;4. Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent’s argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues.&quot;</p>

<p>Everybody thinks they are part of the 2%. You think you&#39;re in it with absolute certainty, and I think I&#39;m in it with absolute certainty. It&#39;s obvious some of the ideas we have are false, that&#39;s just life, but we don&#39;t know which ones. Saying only 2% of the population is capable of critical thought is incredibly narrow minded.  Perhaps they come off sheepish to you because their opinions are different, but we all have lived different lives- its impossible for us to see things the same way. Perhaps somebody doesn&#39;t think 9/11 was an inside job. That doesn&#39;t mean that person is incapable of critical thought- just that they may have come to a different conclusion than you.</p>

<p>Try to put your inherent bias aside and go talk to people. I bet you&#39;ll find them smarter than you assume. It&#39;s easy to think someones an idiot online where the only connection you have with them is a tiny text box with no context or backstory. </p>

<p>From this Oxford research paper on astroturfing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no doubt that individual social media users can spread hate speech, troll other users, or set up automated political communication campaigns. Unfortunately, this is also an organized phenomenon, with major governments and political parties dedicating significant resources towards the use of social media for public opinion manipulation.</p>

<p>... In many countries, political actors have no reported ability to field social media campaigns. In some countries, one or two known political actors occasionally use social media for political messaging, and in a few other countries there are multiple government agencies, political parties, or civil society groups organizing trolling and fake news campaigns.</p>

<p>&quot;7. Question motives. Twist or amplify any fact which could so taken to imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other bias. This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the defensive.&quot;</p>

He has been in this sub far longer than you, or any other &quot;alt&quot; that you may or may not have, and he has always been someone who will challenge somone&#39;s views. That said, he has always been civil and polite about it, sometimes he can seem a little dickish, but in the end he&#39;s not a bad dude and has been in this sub for years. He&#39;s like Rockran and a couple other guys who will disagree with others without being disagreeable. </p>

<p>He&#39;s what is known as a &quot;longtime regular&quot; of this sub. His questions and challenges have value here and he has a solid track record of keeping things civil, even in the midst of all the shit he has to put up with sometimes from those he calls to question.</p>

<p>&quot;4. Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent’s argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he is talking more from his own personal experience. He gets accused of being a shill a lot, but I have seen him around for years and years, and he has been always been exactly like he is. He has always been someone who will point out logical flaws in people&#39;s arguments. He has been doing this well before &quot;shill&quot; became the buzzword that it is today.</p>

<p>I find, especially today, that &quot;shill&quot; is becoming a more and more meaningless term, despite the wall of links and articles posted by the OP. Yes, political, commercial, corporate and MIC shilling exists, and it is only increasing as time goes on. Shills have been spreading and this sub is not immune.</p>

<p>However, not everyone who disagrees with you, or points out someone&#39;s logical fallacies is a shill.</p>

<p>&quot;10. Associate opponent charges with old news. A derivative of the straw man usually, in any large-scale matter of high visibility, someone will make charges early on which can be or were already easily dealt with. Where it can be foreseen, have your own side raise a straw man issue and have it dealt with early on as part of the initial contingency plans. Subsequent charges, regardless of validity or new ground uncovered, can usually them be associated with the original charge and dismissed as simply being a rehash without need to address current issues — so much the better where the opponent is or was involved with the original source.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;24. Silence critics. If the above methods do not prevail, consider removing opponents from circulation by some definitive solution so that the need to address issues is removed entirely. This can be by their death, arrest and detention, blackmail or destruction of their character by release of blackmail information, or merely by proper intimidation with blackmail or other threats.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;18. Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can’t do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how “sensitive they are to criticism”.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary attack the messenger ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as “kooks”, “right-wing”, “liberal”, “left-wing”, “terrorists”, “conspiracy buffs”, “radicals”, “militia”, “racists”, “religious fanatics”, “sexual deviates”, and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Hillary had to cheat to beat Sanders. This is common knowledge and why the Wikileaks dumps had sunk her later in the campaign. This is common knowledge.</p>

<p>She would have cheated in the general if she could, but it&#39;s much easier to rig a primary than a general election. I thought this was common knowledge but apparently not.</p>

<p>The cheater yes, will more than likely accuse someone else of cheating because she is so narcissistic due to the fact that she lost to President Orangutan.</p>

<p>Good example of what I am talking about right here. The term &quot;emotional shills&quot; makes no sense if you understand &quot;shill&quot; to mean &quot;someone who is paid to post content.&quot; They are by definition, not motivated by emotion - they&#39;re motivated by money. It&#39;s a contradiction of terms. It completely makes sense if you understand &quot;shill&quot; to mean &quot;people who disagree with me,&quot; though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see you comment in this sub a lot and most of the time what you say makes sense, so this comment seems really out of character for you. Claiming that not all shills get paid is just silly. That&#39;s admitting that the definition of &quot;shill&quot; is so watered down and misused that it is completely meaningless. It&#39;s just a buzzword that can be thrown at any and all criticism, opposition, or unpopular opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoy your posts so thanks for the question.  As an example, if you take someone who is a zealot, or useful idiot as some might call them, someone that is very much into a certain point of view and trying to change people&#39;s perspectives to theirs - they are not getting paid, but they are very much pushing a narrative.  It ends up being a behavior that is no different than one that is paid.</p>

<p>There was a lot of motivated posting during the election, whether by pro or anti Hillary - strongly pushing their opinions and trying to convert.  This is the behavior I am talking about.  It is indistinguishable to posts by those that are paid, other than the zealot works around the clock.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a huge difference between these two groups of people though. The zealots as you call them actually believe in what they are arguing for. No matter how little evidence they have or how much evidence is against them, they aren&#39;t likely to change their views. I know plenty of people like this in real life and it&#39;s frustrating trying to debate with them. I believe these people make up the majority of the problems in this sub (and on Reddit in general).</p>

<p>Actual shills on the other hand are only motivated by their paycheck, which probably isn&#39;t even that big. They are the ones posting weak, overused talking points. I&#39;d also be willing to bet these are the ones running a lot of the political subs and organizing the narrative that the zealot users then eat up. I&#39;m sure there are shills on Reddit, but I have the feeling that gullible, easily manipulated users outnumber them 100 to 1.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure they could!  They just have to disagree with you &quot;strongly&quot;.  I usually enjoy your posts, but it&#39;s odd to see you espouse these ideas as I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ve seen folks accused of &quot;shilling&quot; for no reason.  I  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been called a shill many times in this subreddit.  It usually happens when I post a wall of text, including links, or just post a contrary opinion.  It&#39;s essentially an intellectually dishonest &quot;get-out-of-debate-free card&quot;.   The term has been watered down, much like SJW, racist, and facist has. </p>

<p>The forum sliding (a negative Trump post gets traction then 30 anti-Clinton/Liberal posts attempt to push it off the page etc), along with being called a shill for simply having a different opinion (plus obvious mod bias) pretty much ruined this subreddit for me.  For all of the shit that we got, the level of discourse was usually really good.  Since the election, however, we get &quot;daily reminders&quot;, accused of being a shill for having a contrary opinion, and intellectually dishonest discourse.  Maybe it&#39;s my rose-tinted glasses, but I swear that discourse used to be so much better than it is now.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about making a post about the Socratic Method, but I procrastinate too much and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s even worth the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;4. Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent’s argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to agree with that notion because in really stupid posts, like chemtrails or flat earth etc I will be the one that is against the conspiracy and I am not a shill, just a scientific mind.
However in other cases, where shilling is obvious, you can tell if someone is just passionate or a shill by looking at the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are they just &#39;onelining&#39; with stupid comments and insults? = Shill</p></li>
<li><p>Are they taking their time and using effort by making a proper case with links etc. = someone who believes the opposite and tries to convey this [rightly or wrongly].
You can then follow their links and point out where they are going wrong [or maybe right].</p></li>

<p>So how do you fight shills without having to lose out on privacy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I go into a thread, usually some sort of political thread, and see that the majority of users commenting are accounts that are less than 6 months old and only comment or post about a single topic it&#39;s becomes pretty obvious that particular thread is under a shill brigade. The problem I have with it is I don&#39;t want to waste my time talking to bots or people with fake opinions</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right, but I think that the dynamics of mass manipulation can&#39;t be handled in the same way as personal-level defenses.  Even if a single person resists the direct manipulation, he still has the impression that &quot;everyone else&quot; believes a certain way, and that is also a powerful tool for suppression and social &quot;intimidation&quot;.</p>

<p>But either way, awareness is half the battle, and I hope some people opened the link and read what this other poster compiled.  It&#39;s a start.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not counter intelligence. That&#39;s propaganda. Counter intelligence is thwarting enemy intelligence operations.</p>

<p>You&#39;re correct that it is effective propaganda, which is why shills are always hunting for shills, and real users only call them out when there&#39;s a lot of evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary attack the messenger ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as “kooks”, “right-wing”, “liberal”, “left-wing”, “terrorists”, “conspiracy buffs”, “radicals”, “militia”, “racists”, “religious fanatics”, “sexual deviates”, and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.&quot;</p>
