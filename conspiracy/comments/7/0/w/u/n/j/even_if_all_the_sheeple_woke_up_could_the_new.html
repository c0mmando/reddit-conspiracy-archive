       The people hold the power. They should be scared of us, we out number them by a large margin.

       If everyone was aware of everything our governments and people in power were doing there would be an uprising. That said, the chances of that happening are pretty slim.

       the nwo rely on the fact that our "collective systems" are easily corrupted and the users of them can't see the corruption.  we will always be predated by this crowd until we fix this problem.  that's why it's easy for them to pick off people  and how it's difficult to grow a seed of collectivism - because when we self-organize we don't typically include protections for the individual.  people just tend not to think about building systems that are resilient to external abuse.  that's pretty much where we fall down.  those groups who do are capable of perceiving threats and adapting to them - which is why you see power accumulate amongst those who can defend themselves.

       groups are like hackable machines.  members can be selectively removed/replaced, and bad actors can be hidden from view.  the lack of d against this kinda thing = external predation.
      </p>
      <p>
       if we organized so that what we wanted to do was clear and on a checklist, and for some reason an item wasn't handled, everybody knew about it, and this checklist was held redundantly by everyone and couldn't be corrupted, then people would see when the machinery of their org would break.  do this at every level.  double checks on double checks.  and this makes its own machine that can achieve its goal despite individual mistakes along the way.  we don't do that kinda thing well.  as a result we spin our wheels.  look at gov.  it's a coopted machine that spins its wheels.  it's not like we don't know what needs to be fixed.  it's that we can't fix them because gov is actively hacked by special interest and we don't audit sufficiently to protect against this.

       it also must be global.  if its localized to the us only, the united nations will spring into action.  but its lucky they are located in jew york, they could be paralized.  if we could have the military, maybe its also lucky there are us military bases everywhere..

       Everyone waking up isn't sufficient, everyone must also become aware that others are woken up too. The central planners very much understand this.

       We complain (incessantly, I might add) about how botted and controlled the front page of Reddit is. We moan, tiresomely about how much control over information the "powers that be" have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, we think in terms that assume the surveys by "respected institutions" are correct. We think in terms that cede ground I'm not willing to cede.

       I know a lot of different types of people. I'm super nice and a great listener, and understanding demographics, I'd say that 70% are at the stage where they are saying, "This is all bullshit. We need to do something."
      </p>
      <h1>
       1. No one has a realistic plan of what to do, because
      </h1>
      <h1>
       2. Everyone assumes they will be in the minority if they propose something rational, so they adopt a position, by default, that is out of line with what people actually believe.
      </h1>
      <p>
       Of that 70%, I'd say that 2/3 of them think that some of the perpetrators of 9/11 got away with it, and made a lot of money. They only differ on the details.

       Will people wake up?
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 1970's, a BIG majority of Americans thought the CIA was in on the JFK assassination. That's woke as fuck.

       We are misjudging this situation.

       I just think there are a lot more "awake" people than people generally think. There's a lot of support for that position.

       stop working.  go outside and stand in silence.  send a list of demands to washington.  demand a complete restructure of the system.  refuse to operate as a country until demands are met.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a side note our entire govt and all systems within could probably be replaced with an app that allows us, the people, to vote on every issue.  we could have civilians run the necessary positions and have a rotation for who holds these positions.  do a complete teardown of the bullshit laws and loopholes and keep it simple.  dont kill, harm or bring harm to others ir thier property.  there are many real solutions but the system itself needs to be demolished.  it isnt the people but the positions in which they reside that allows them power.  restructure our govt using the constitution and maybe we can get somewhere.

       It's not enough for everyone to be aware.  Everyone also has to be aware that everyone else is aware.  If everyone knows, but nobody is willing to speak about it, the effect is as if no one knows.
