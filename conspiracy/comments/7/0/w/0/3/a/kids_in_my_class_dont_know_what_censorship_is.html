       , and we have a new German kid in our class. One of the kids asked him if they censor things in Germany. The rest of the group including the German student did not know what he meant by censorship. It led me to this; will the generations over time slowly forget fundamental ideas and political and social techniques like censorship? Censorship is the fear of reform by knowledge, but how could we reform if the future adults of America loses the knowledge that censorship exists?

       a lot of people are just particularly oblivious or self-obsessed. most people don't pay heavy attention to the news so  may have not read or seen articles about "fake news", youtube content 'mafia', or net neutrality and investigatory powers act.
      </p>
      <p>
       many people probably don't consider the implications of carrying a GPS tag in their phone or the government cataloging everything you do and everywhere you go, and selling this information to the highest bidder.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm afraid though, that future generations will be extremely aware of censorship, or so poorly educated that they could not access the restricted information anyway.

       Funnily enough, Aldous Huxley had
       <a href="https://imgur.com/jRgB8OR">
        something very relevant
       </a>
       to say on the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, some people will say that it was
       <em>
        Orwell
       </em>
       who wrote about censorship, not Huxley. These people clearly have not read both books. In Huxley's, it was the director who had a book shelf, nobody else. In Orwell's, even Winston was able to get his hands on a copy of Goldstein's writings.

       To be fair, I think I'd want clarification on what is meant by the extremely broad question too.  Censorship can exist in many different forms from different groups.  I just highly doubt that their was this big of a group that didn't understand the basic idea of censorship.

       It was mostly in regards to political censorship I think. I'm sure everyone knows what censorship means, just not the knowledge that it is used on the political scale.

       If you want the German kid to fucking lose it ask him about the Stasi and if his family lived in the east.
      </p>
      <p>
       If his family is from the east he will go absolutely insane and make it very clear his family had NOTHING to do with the communists! Nope, no way, not his family. If he is from the west he will also go insane and say he has never met a single person from the east outside of Berlin and that's it- communism in my country till 1994? What no way 😂

       You guys talk about the Germans and the Holocaust shit, they LOVE talking about the Nazis- that was dramatic and in the past and its a huge identity issue.

       Germany wiped the East German government from history and they are keeping it that way.

       <a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2Ff%2Ffb%2FOverton_Window_diagram.svg%2F1200px-Overton_Window_diagram.svg.png&amp;amp;f=1">
        Overton window
       </a>
       , it's not only that you won't conceive of it, it's that you can't conceive of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Germany, there's a ton of concepts and ideas that are unthinkable, or at least undebatable in any public setting. Propaganda and censorship are treated as vague memories from the "before-times", and virtually never as inevitable realities of a corporate (and therefore political) media landscape. Unless it's someone else doing it, of course, then they scream propaganda all day long.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, you can push and move the boundaries of the overton window rather easily though by thinking and working on big ideas for big things and talking about them with others.
      </p>
      <p>
       High Level Insider repeated the very feasible concept of an orbital ring-type space elevator asking candidly why we haven't built one yet. There is no logical reason against it, other than the fact that it would benefit the general population so much that our entire established structure (which only still works because it's greased with the sweat and blood of poorer people) would have to collapse completely, meaning everyone on top stands everything to loose.
      </p>
      <p>
       The investment for such an elevator would be a joke compared to a days worth of military spending and the potential benefits from building one would be as boundless as the stars themselves. About $450 billion dollars would be the cost for the first ring and elevator, with every subsequent payload and elevator we get up there costing a tiny fraction of that cost, because we would thenceforth not rely on expensive rockets anymore. If we built more reusable rockets, which certainly seems to be the plan, then even that initial cost could likely be lowered significantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are things you'll never hear discussed in parliament, or anywhere that seems to matter. We'll have to think about these things ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another fact is that people are wildly more ready to think about controversial things outside of their Overton window than they are ready to talk about them if they feel they'll get ridiculed or shunned for thinking such things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find those in your circles who you think already instinctively know what's up and expand their Overton window. Those who do not sense the lies at this point and prefer to keep their heads in the sand are likely never going to lift it.

       Indeed. As Aldous Huxley once wrote:

       "For most people, nothing which is contrary to any system of ideas with which they have been brought up since childhood can possibly be reasonable."

       American society has been systematically dumbed down. They are making the common man as much like cattle as humanly possible. Fat, retarded, consumers. "Censorship? Derrr? What?" I hope you expressed your disappointment in the class so that
       <em>
        someone
       </em>
       might have questioned themselves for their lack of knowledge. I honestly think that society is breeding two kinds of people right now: the man who is completely immersed and lost in Ego thinking and whose entire life is a perpetual escape from himself via consumption (mindless activities like over-eating, video games, television, worrying about and figuring out relationships, etc.),
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the man who looks out at the world and senses its collective ill-logic and who, then, begins questioning reality and discovers his own innate power of being able to think critically and for himself.

       Congratulations kid, I admire the level of understanding/wisdom you display at such a young age. You will achieve self-realization sooner than most. It took me much longer to develop independent thought and heterodox thinking. Don't ever become cynical when confronted with morbid ignorance. And don't watch too much porn ;)

       Of course. Google "bill Ivey John podesta wikileak". Bill Ivey is a chairman of the Nea and he describes how they are "demeaning civics education" on purpose. This is the same reason people now say "you have the freedom to speak but not freedom from consequences" when it used to be "I abhor what you say but I'll defend to the death your right to say it."
      </p>

       This is called "closing the Overton window". Don't even teach children the concepts and they won't even understand what's being given to them is propaganda.

       Yes, I mean look around. Look who our president is! The government has so many people lulled into a false sense of security. So the more we speak up the harder it is for the man to take complete control. All we need to do is get people to question what they are told.
