       “They are no doubt interdimensional”. I’d say there’s some doubt, considering our concept of other ‘dimensions’ is only founded on only one possible explanation from the findings of quantum mechanics, that is the most “far out there” of the there’s popular interpretations.

       Dude....how is this inventions secrecy act not public knowledge. They said over 5,000 inventions in 2007 fall under this act. And it doesn’t specify what the inventions are. Makes you wonder why it seems like we haven’t come out with many new types of inventions since the computer, only new ways of looking at old inventions.

       Easier alternative to accomplish what, specifically? Really. I’d like to answer your question(s) without including things you’ve zero interest in.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for meditation, it occurs in many forms and is much more than the most common perception. It’s probable you already do it without being aware of it because you didn’t carve out a block of time and sit down with that as your intention.

       Yeah that's what the mystics and yogis set out to achieve.  Psyches I feel just make it easier for the common man to get a look into that kind perception.

       Seriously, I don't feel like people are understanding the gravity of the situation if it turns out that aliens are in cahoots with the guberment.

       If that it is indeed the case, everything we have come to understand is out the window.

       I had a short meditation the other day, of multiple dimensions or layers of myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was simply standing at work, been very tired lately, and felt awareness of higher and lower representations of self. Cant be exactly put into words easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the day i did some potent shrooms. It was maybe 2-2.5 hours after taking them, and i left a friends house to walk to my place only two blocks away.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was in a forest town outside of Seattle... As i walked under a tree it felt like another entity or intelligence. It frightened me because i could feel that the being in the tree seemed surprised that i noticed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried to think of something else, but this entity made me experience my craziest trip, and i felt aware of other layers of reality with different looking creatures controlling what seemed like gears and machinery. Very interesting night that opened my mind.

       I have found no greater metaphysical teacher than Scott Mandelker.

       <a href="http://www.scottmandelker.com/">

       , you can find many free and illuminating essays on the mechanics of consciousness.

        https://www.youtube.com/user/TWSMandelker
       </a>
       , you can find hours and hours of talks on various metaphysical topics, namely his dissection of The Ra Material/The Law of One.

       I've recently been reading The Ra Material/Law Of One stuff and have it very fascinating, enlightening and helpful spiritual and mental wise, great material to think your brain into. The Wes Penre papers have been a great read as well, this covers alot of stuff, he's done serious homework Imo.

       Great topic! I'm inclined to believe there's something holographic and fractal about our universe that mainstream physics misses. I'm even inclined to believe that "consciousness"/awareness is primal to matter, or maybe inextricably linked to matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       My issue is that there are a lot of charlatans in this field of discussion, and a lot more people who make claims which I'm sure they think are right, but can't back up. In some ways, it's hard to say whether a lot of these things
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be backed up in any substantial way, even if they are true. We're talking about the very substrate upon which everything we know and experience is based. I think Something like Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem for metaphysics has to apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Specifically, I see a lot of these youtube videos which make grand claims and back them up only with hand waving, or references to "inspired" texts. It strikes me as very similar to the way that the ancient religions operate, basically appeals to authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone has any good reading or videos that approach this topic in a more rigorous way, I'd love to see them. I find things much more convincing when people only claim the patterns they observe, rather than claiming they're the ones with the "One Truth™." I see u/Illuminati_LCO recommended Scott Mandelker, and I'll definitely check him out. Any others?

       the science delusion is a great book on the subject of modern mainstream science being akin to religion thru appeals to a higher authority. except in thia case that authority isnt a god but mainstream accepted celebrity scientists.

       If interested I've bumped into a few really interesting things, among them a unified theory of physics called "Tetryonics". It's not backed up by handwaving but instead by all currently observed phenomena, including things that classical theories have struggled to explain or outrightly ignore, such as the variable speed of light through mediums, or super luminal information propagation.

       Its actually one of 5 i think granted to a dr. roy subrata describing the workings of a wingless electromagnetic air vehicle, weav for short. theres pictures and they are literally micro flying saucers. they match spookily well with the description of teslas flying saucer here. this link postulates that teslas flying saucer and flying stove are the same thing but on other websites and stuff youll some debate about that.

       what i find most distressing is the push to scale this technology down to insect size rather than up to personal vehicle size. i feel like its just a matter of time before swarms of microbots turn into swarms of murderbots like some black mirror shit.

       I think that Reddit obfuscates the exact karma value of posts (probably part of why they now only give a single karma value instead of seperate up and down vote totals)  If you look at the karma value of just about any post and refresh it a number of times the karma value will keep changing like you said.

       From what I can tell, this flying saucer works by creating an electromagnetic field around the craft such that there is an upwards air pressure on it that counteracts the earth’s gravitational field, allowing it to hover. And moves this pressure around to make the craft move. Since it uses air, it would not be able to work in space.  But it is an interesting idea that is definitely not impossible.

       it could still get you to space ,and around earth, easier and cheaper than a rocket. if it works scaled up that is. conventional thrusters or an ion engine (ion engines and ion thrusters are different) could power it in space. solar sail maybe?

       at what point do they stop caring about ruling us altogether and simply just exist as their own separate civilization? theyd probably get some ego kicks out of being able to classify themselves a new species after however many generations.

       It's a mix of both. It's actually a contract between humans and aliens. We give them certain liberties on earth and in exchange we get technologies to develop our own shit. And breakaway civilization is definitely a thing, and there are places for humans to chill on the Moon.

       my thing is, if this technology is so simple, why are people not working on it independently of their govt? like on a local community level. theoretically i should be able to buy a neon sign transformer, some hunks of aluminum/copper and some clay and be able to atleast test this stuff. alas i am a broke bastard but surely there are people with more disposable income than i to work with. i mean no aliens any harm but i definitely didnt sign no damn contract lol

       I can only speak for the God Equation but I'd be interested in reading at least one of the others to see if the writing style is the same, or if it's more than 1 person doing this. It seems a hell of a lot of output for something that (if you ignore the rants) is pretty next level content-wise. There's like what, 8-10 books or something?
      </p>
      <p>
       I found it because I was looking at Eulers Identity anyways. 
I went from ancient architecture &gt; interest in geometry &gt; interest in numbers &gt; numbers as reality &gt; waves / harmony / phi &gt; pi &gt; holy shit &gt; poking at eulers identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I was only really messing with that because it had all the things I was looking at in there, I didn't really get what any of it meant. 
And the God Equation filled in a lot of those gaps. Or at least coloured them in in a compelling way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really doesn't feel like a theory something someone's just pulled out their ass. 
Yet at the same time if it was truly from an illuminated source, would it have the almost constant ranting?
      </p>
      <p>
       Definitely one of the stranger things I've read in a while.

       yea, totally agree.  the god equation is when it all started coming together.  funny how different our paths were though.  i somehow ended up on this website:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://armageddonconspiracy.co.uk/">
        http://armageddonconspiracy.co.uk/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       LOTS of crazy shit on there.  it actually starts off with flat earth o_O  but i dunno if it's supposed to be a metaphor or what.  from there, it's pretty much a conspiracy buffet, and also a extremely intriguing (and jarring) introduction to conspiracies in general--yeup, that was me.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's almost a little creepy, because there's a very strong feeling of nonchalant conviction in his/their tone, like they have no doubt of the ability to and certainty of completing their objective.  there were still some questions or issues that i thought were left unaddressed though, which i thought was a little suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       their idea of a true meritocracy sounds really good at first...but also sounds like another gateway to some totalitarian dystopia, except on the opposite end of the spectrum from communism.  like, the 100% inheritance tax is good in theory if you want extreme equality of opportunity.  but i feel like that's another idealistic proposal with huge potential for abuse, e.g. not worth it in practical terms.  plus, it might result in removing a major natural drive for success--to gather wealth to ensure the future of your offspring.  i dunno, just didn't get the best vibes from some of that stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, going through the metaphysical concepts was a trip.  i also pursued the ontological mathematics idea for a while too...i definitely remember my mind being blown repeatedly.  dude...hold on lemme pull something i did that was inspired by this whole line of thinking.  actually, i'll leave it at the bottom
      </p>
      <p>
       and yea, i also get the feeling that this is NOT the product of a single mind, and a most likely a longtime in the making.  if i had to guess, i'd say it was a single voice that was responsible for the narration, but the content was probably discussed/selected by a group including hockney.
      </p>
      <p>
       ok, so i didn't discover any of these--i just pulled the numbers and actually did the calculations, because i had to see for myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'll start with the pyramids...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        base perimeter of great pyramid = 3,023.16 feet
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        original height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feet
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        base perimeter of great pyramid ÷ original height of great pyramid
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       = 3,023.16 feet ÷ 481.3949 feet = 6.280000058
      </p>
      <p>
       6.280000058 ÷ 2 =
       <strong>
        3.140000029
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       that's prettty close to pi, close enough that i'd say it's probably not a coincidence.  but so what right?  well, mainstream consensus is that Ancient Egyptians thought pi was about 3.16, and that it wasn't until Archimedes that pi was recognized to be around 3.14.  so...questionable.
      </p>
      <p>
       ok, it gets weirder.  i'm gonna assume you're familiar with the significance of the number 432 yea?  so it turns out, the major, externally-visible dimensions of the pyramid, correlate to the dimensions of the earth at a scale of
       <strong>
        432,000:1
       </strong>
       .  crazy, considering that they had no idea of or way to confirm the dimensions of the planet (so we're taught).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        original height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feet
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        481.3949 feet x 432,000
       </strong>
       = 207,962,596.8 feet =
       <strong>
        3,938.685 miles
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        3,938.685 miles = polar radius of earth (minus about 11 miles, or an error of about 0.2%)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        base perimeter of great pyramid = 3,023.16 feet
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        3,023.16 feet x 432,000 = 1,306,005,120 feet = 24,734.94 miles
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        24,734.94 miles = equatorial circumference of earth ( minus about 70 miles, or an error of about 0.6%)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       (note: the accurate calculation of the dimensions of the earth are typically credited to Eratosthenes around 300-200 B.C.; go figure...)  but ok, so school and mainstream history are shit.  i can accept that.  this was my WTF moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       but some setup first...it's a very strange coincidence--one of many that include the moon--that the sun is 400x larger than the moon, and ALSO happens to be 400x further away from earth than the moon is, which is why we have total solar eclipses and total lunar eclipses.  meh.  here's another fun fact:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        approximate speed of light = 186,000 miles per second
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        432 x 432 = 186,624 (an error of about 0.3%)
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       cool, but maybe just coincidence still right?
      </p>
      <h2>
       approximate diameter of the sun = 864,000 miles
      </h2>
      <h2>
       432 x 2 = 864
      </h2>
      <h2>
       approximate diameter of moon = 2,160 miles
      </h2>
      <h2>
       432 ÷ 2 = 216
      </h2>
      <p>
       when i saw that, i think i literally shivered and had thoughts of being in the matrix flashing through my head.  i dunno, that freaked the shit out of me personally, for at least 5 minutes.  i dunno...for the original, i had gone through a ton of other information all highlighting the cosmic holiness of the number 432, so maybe it got in my head by the time i made that last calculation XP
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway, there's actually a ton of stuff like this.  i think this is the closest i'll get to experiencing some manifestation of ontological mathematics.  which is totally fine with me, because i was imagining like 6 foot tall, solid-colored, single-digit integers with eyes, arms and legs, and they weren't nice.

       He spends a bunch of time analysing Rosslyn Chapel which is very very revealing from a practical and a historical perspective.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on measurements he took from a ~3000BCish site in Scotland, he deduced a new value for Pi in terms of the square root of two which he called 'Qute'.
      </p>
      <p>
       After spending a crapload of time looking at this, I can confirm it's legit and indeed some of the obvious lessons to be found in Giza are to do with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Khafre the middle pyramid has a side-length of half the square root of 2 (707) which is a big clue.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you recall from the God Equation / Unit Circle that's also the point where the complex + real domains balance out....
      </p>
      <p>
       The layout of the whole site jives around sqrt(2) and sqrt(3), so whatever lesson is there is mathematical first and foremost.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are like, yeah but it's in feet.. but fail to realise that feet (and also the meter) were key'd to dimensions of the earth. 
How they got to that point, who knows, but it's pretty undisputable.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Arguably the foot spoken of is Gods foot.)
      </p>
      <p>
       On that front, for a really solid treatment on ancient metrology check out Taking Measure by Scott Onstott.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll also really like his series on youtube 'secrets in plain sight' and his lil coffee table book Quantification which talks a lot about the numbers you mention (i think they are all 3-smooth numbers personally - also known as the harmonic series)
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually I'd probably start with those last two and work back from there. He looks pretty hard at the sort of mind-blowing "coincidences" you mention.

       What is now mostly remembered as a system of mental shortcuts are actually the faint echos of a very complete understanding of that most special of number bases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using that you can perform operations on stupidly large numbers as strings of individual digits.

       Think about that...

       eh...the calculations with the pyramid aren't all that arbitrary.  they use the two largest visible dimensions of the pyramid with a single arithmetic operation.  it's not complicated...and you can call it a coincidence.  but i don't think most people would think that calculations that result in under 1% error can be automatically dismissed, especially in the context of the monumental efforts involved in building the great pyramid.

       They are arbitrary. 
In your first example, why take the perimeter? Why not base? Why divide by 2? It is completely arbitrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second one: Alright 432 is special but 432000 is not 432, scaling to it makes no sense. The rest of the calculation is just a restatement of point 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third one is even more egregious. The errors in the previous cases can be attributed to the fact that they involve human constructions  but in this case the parameters that you take are natural. Are you saying whatever caused this correlation reached at 98% and said "eh close enough".
      </p>
      <p>
       432*432 only becomes close to the speed of light if we use FPS system, so it is a coincidence.

       In taking the diameter of the sun you round
       <em>
        down

       to the nearest thousand, but in taking the diameter of the moon you round
       <em>
        up
       </em>
       to the nearest ten. See, arbitrary.

       1) again, there are only so many measurements visible from the exterior.  perimeter, height, diagonal, slant height and....?  ok...you can see there's not much else to work with.  and fine, like i said, maybe that's a coincidence, though given the abundance of other coded numbers found in the great pyramid, i really doubt it.  what i presented are just some that i was personally interested in.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) are you serious???  if you wanted to use 432 in some way, that's the simplest way.  unless you would want to make a pyramid that's 1000 times bigger!  just wow...
      </p>
      <p>
       3)  dude what are you even saying--do you even know?  this one is by far the most obvious, which is why you just start spouting some laughable world salad in your attempt to debunk it.  first of all, what does it matter if the parameters are natural??  it's the fucking diameter and circumference of the planet LOL.  and both of those are proportional to the perimeter and height of the pyramid AT THE SAME RATIO.  and the error is under 1%,
       <em>
        as i clearly stated
       </em>
       .  of course you can claim it's still a coincidence, just nobody would agree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) i'd agree with that, except that the speed of light is coded into the pyramid in other ways, including one that matches it in the metric system, down to
       <strong>
        several decimal places
       </strong>
       .  so...probably not a coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       5)  hmm...yea, see, because like i said, the sun is 400 times bigger 0__0
      </p>
      <p>
       i think it's at least clear you don't really have an appreciation for math (or when scaling is necessary, or how simple it is to add zeros while still retaining much of the same content, or the visible dimensions of a pyramid, etc.), though i suspect science as well.  or maybe you just don't have an appreciation for the english language, and don't understand what "arbitrary" means.  it's also likely that you just dismissed my reply (which wasn't even addressed to you) without really reading it the first time.  then when i called you out on it, you tried to pull some shit out your ass, but it turned out weak and forced, so now you look ridiculous, especially with your reasoning in #2,3,5.  sure, you can call bullshit on anything you want, but it doesn't mean much, especially in this case.

       1) You did not rebut my point at all. Like you said there are multiple measurements visible from the exterior. perimeter, height, base width and  slant height. My point is that there are so many combinations measurements available so why this particular combination is selected? The division by two after taking their ratio is completely arbitrary and is just to force pi.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The ratio between radius of earth and height of great pyramid is much closer to 434000 than 432000, circumference of earth and base perimeter of great pyramid is around 435000 not 432000.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        3,023.16 feet x 432,000 = 1,306,005,120 feet = 24,734.94 miles
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also Your math is off by a whole order of magnitude, so you clearly have not checked it.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Let me explain. Let, height of great pyramid be (h) , base perimeter of great pyramid be p, radius of earth be r, circumference of earth be c.
      </p>
      <p>
       From your first statement p/h  ≈ 2
       <em>
        pi, by definition the ratio between the circumference of any circle and its radius  2
       </em>
       pi. So we can take any circular spherical or cylindrical object and we can say that the ratio of its circumference is the same as p/h. We can do this with any object, all we have to do is pick a magic number as a scaling factor and look for any object which has a similar size as the scaled down or up dimension.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example a my dick is approximately cylindrical and has a radius of 1.3 inches the circumference of its cross section is ≈ 8.168 inches.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know 432 is special so 4320 is also special.
      </p>
      <p>
       **Height of great pyramid = 481.3949 feet
      </p>
      <p>
       481.3949 feet ÷ 4320 = 0.111434005 ft = 1.33720806 inches.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.33720806 inches = Radius of my dick (with an error of 2%)
      </p>
      <p>
       Base perimeter of great pyramid = 3,023.16 feet
      </p>
      <p>
       3,023.16 feet ÷ 4320 = 0.699805556 ft = 8.397666672 inches.
      </p>
      <p>
       8.397666672 inches = the circumference of my dick (with an error of 2%)**
      </p>
      <p>
       Spooooooky
      </p>
      <p>
       Either ancient Egyptians scaled the pyramids with respect to my dick (in a ratio of 1:4320) or this type of argument is bullshit. You pick.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) Where is it stated in the pyramid that the speed of light is 432 squared in miles per second? Miles and seconds were units invented 1000s years after the Ancient Egyptians.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        you realize we didn't even get close to an accurate estimate of the speed of light until thousands of years later right?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If it is not explicitly written down or used in some sort of measurement that the speed of light is so and so then we cannot assume that they knew it.All this arithmetic voodoo is just working backwards from what we already know.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the speed of light is actually coded into the pyramid in other ways, including one that matches it in the metric system, down to several decimal places
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again metric system is 1000s of years younger than the pyramids. So you are saying that not only did the Egyptians know the speed of light but they also knew what units we would use in the future.
Which is more plausible Ancient Egyptians had advanced scientific knowledge and ability to
       <em>
        predict the future
       </em>
       or all these "codes" that you seem to find in the pyramids are a product of your own confirmation bias??
      </p>
      <p>
       5) The fact that the sun is 400 times bigger than the moon and is 400 times as far is amazing but it is still a coincidence.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        two largest objects in the sky, using only 2 numbers, 2 operations, and scaling by 10s is amazing
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But it is not just two operations, you arbitrarily round up the moon's size and round down the sun's size. Anything can seem related if you apply arbitrary set of rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personal attacks are unnecessary and exposes your own childishness.

       i'm okay with personal attacks when dealing with a biased and retarded neckbeard who's more concerned with being right (yet still failing) than acknowledging reality (and when they're wrong, instead of doubling down on their idiocy).  if that makes me child, then just know you're [much] dumber than a child ;D

       My point is that all these "coded" messages you speak of are not actually put in by the Egyptians but "discovered" after the fact by cranks with books to sell. Given a set of numbers it is extremely easy to connect them with pi or phi or any so called cosmic numbers with simple arithmetic operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Yeah, off by a digit. What it shows is that you don't know what you are talking about, and just copy pasted this whole wall of text from some crank website without verifying it yourself. Zero is not just a placeholder. Are you telling me that 10 and 100 are the same? Maybe I should tell this to my Machine Design professor, material selection just got a whole lot easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Thank you again for completely missing the point. What I was trying to demonstrate is that you can use your line of reasoning to connect anything to anything. You can connect pyramids to coke cans, oil drums, soccer balls etc just the way I connected pyramids to my dick. The errors that I get are the same as that stated in your example, around 2 %.

         Leibniz: Conceptually the universe is a hologram, but physically it is a fractal
        </p>
        <p>
         There are two conflicting theories of the Universe--one being that it is structured like a hologram, the other that it is structured like a fractal. Here we suggest that both theories are true, and we can resolve the issue by adopting the dual aspect viewpoint of Plato-Leibniz that there are two simultaneous universes that correspond to each other, like the two side of a coin. One is the universe of Plato’s Mind (the One), the other is Leibniz’s universe of Monads (the Many), where the One creates, perceives and controls the Many. According to these two aspects, conceptually the universe is a hologram, but physically it is a fractal. Both theories envision an infinity in a speck. This can be so if the speck is Leibniz’s monad, in which the infinity on the mental side is a hologram, and in which the infinity of the physical side is a fractal.

       lol sweet, i should've checked this sub out earlier.  honestly, a lot of his stuff is kind of hard for me to understand, and i really looked into his monadology mostly.  but i've read that almost everything he put out was consistent with his own philosophy, which he basically started from scratch.  might explain why his ideas seem to tie together really elegantly.  what ideas of his were you into?

(i'm not a philosopher, so i have no idea what it's called, but it's like a consistent "all-or-nothing" kind of reasoning.  like if there can be one, then there can be an infinite, otherwise none.  and another similar line of reasoning involving whether something has sufficient reason to exist, or yadda yadda i forget but yea).  anyway, he pulls it off in style somehow, so i thought your use of "baller" was amazingly dead-on.

       I don't think he came up with imaginary numbers. I think most of the work there was Euler, a contemporary (and then later Gauss).
      </p>
      <p>
       He took them seriously tho, wrestled with them philosophically and tried to integrate them properly in his conceptual model (whereas they were mostly lol'd at and shunned by others - imaginary as a label was meant to be derogatory.)

       sweet, i can tell this is going to be fun a article!  totally dig his psycho-mathematical hypothesis--personally resonates with me very strongly.
      </p>
      <p>
       also makes me wonder if we ended up with a system of math that describes imaginary numbers in this way because of some limitation in our thinking/perception, or if we developed a representation of mathematics that was flawed and its limitations manifest as weirdness like imaginary numbers which most people don't naturally/easily understand (me included).

       Can I also make a hand-wave to his Theodicy. It's where he gathers his ideas that confront and engage Christian theology straight on. It's also his work that explains his answer to the Problem of Evil: where the phrase "best of all possible worlds" comes from. Quite different from Augustine, and much more Matrix-like.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I understand it (anyone more knowledgeable jump in), he assumes the
       <em>
        potential
       </em>
       of infinite universes of all different overlapping, even incompatible universes "created" or "thought" by an all-powerful God. This concept seems a lot like modern multiverse, but he held there was still only one "real" universe (possibly to stay put of trouble?).
      </p>
      <p>
       So with all those infinity of universes, he decides that IF God is Good, THEN we would inhabit the best possible version of all the possible universes - as shabby as it often appears to us. God only knows...

       yea, i remember that one for sure.  i remember the math-y version a little better i think (err...i
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       this is from leibniz and not mike hockney, but i could be mixing them together...) it was something along the lines of there being one mathematical system that's perfect, which is the one that comprises our universe.  any other (imperfect) system would eventually destroy itself due to inconsistencies or other self-contradictory errors.  so i'm not sure that it completely precludes other universes existing simultaneously.  but then i don't know enough about his conception of time either, so that's not a surprise.  i'm listening to mike hockney's stuff again, which is heavily influenced (that's an understatement, leibniz is basically german jesus to him) by leibniz, so actually, there's a good chance the math version isn't from liebniz?
      </p>
      <p>
       but yea, listening to some of the concepts again, reminds me of how freakishly modern a lot of liebniz's ideas are.  i almost feel like he was able to achieve this through raw intellect, like brute forcing logic, savant-style.  it's like he was able to see past the patterns/dynamics between scientific development and philosophy, which allowed him to leap over centuries intellectually,  and actually get to the core philosophical issues that modern sciences is still dancing around.  i still think his monadology stuff is one of the most ambitious attempts at a TOE.
      </p>
      <p>
       i still think there's space for simulation theory within his ideas, but maybe less developed in his time?  i mean it just wans't as in-your-face obviosu without computers and VR.  intuitively, i feel like these three concepts complement each other in describing the universe--holographic principles, fractals, simulations.  and i'm
       <em>
        almost positive
       </em>
       that these concepts are somehow subtly/not-so-subtly being pushed on us, because i've seen people randomly mentioning the same intuition online.  totally can't see why though...o_O'
      </p>
      <p>
       this stuff makes me feel so nostalgic.  this is where my whole "wtf is the illuminati" question started, and when i actually started considering the possibility that automatically dismissing conspiracies could be really really stupidi.  it's so crazy how a single thread of thought from a random session of browsing can lead to an absolutely exhaustive overhaul of your worldview.

       The problem with simulation is this: if its true then there's absolutely nothing that would, could, or really needs to change.

      <p>
       That is, in straight simulation, where we are someone's game pieces, very possibly as virtual as a million charge particles in tiny energy apartment blocks, there still is only one way to "break through" or "get free" or "realize who we are" that

       hmm i guess i don't mean it exactly in that way--i still believe there is free will.  i'm just not sure about everything else.  it could be a bias though.  not sure why i expect "natural" things to be analog in nature rather than digital.

       wait, are you talking in the context of simulation theory?  e.g. the nature outside this simulation?  or that this isn't a simulation and reality here IS analog?  because a lot of our newer science seems to hint at a digital nature, like the planck length being the minimum distance or quantum entanglement allow instantaneous transmission of information.  there could be other explanations for sure, and maybe we're just not there yet.

       right - not arguing with the surprising digital aspects we do find like the planck number, but consider the 99% of territory we can investigate and find systems that turn out non-binary, and apparently continuous, often fractal or otherwise infinitely dense. This is the fundamental problem with a Wolframesque Universe - made of bits all the way down. We made up bits, as far as I can tell. Nature has waves or something.

       So Wolfram (author of the mathematica franchise and the book "A New Kind of Science") suggests that because computing using binary Turing machines is so incredibly powerful, the universe itself must be a Turing Machine itself. Therefore he really pushes back against things like Godel's Uncertainty Principle, and Turing's Halting Problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually like Wolfram's ideas, but not that one. I cannot believe the universe can be computed by what we have now. It has to be something more like the holofractal ideas. Or the fuzzy logic which is now being instrumentalized with quantum and DNA computing, where the answers come back shades of grey instead of black and white. But the problem is logic - it's famously binary due to the Excluded Middle. There's nothing in between true and false. (Which is why "truthy" and "falsy" are so funny to us - those make perfect sense to me - but I've drank the koolaid on this one.

       From what I've come across in the last year of research, this is the grand conspiracy, the one which all others stem from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans are concious beings capable of shaping reality around them. Thoughts affect reality. We can shape reality around us. We all live in a shared reality that overlaps with our own individual realities. Formerly, our civilisation was very aware of this and lived in an equilibrium of these abilities interacting with other energetic realms which have become inaccessible to us without training and practice. I believe it may extend to such a degree that the way a person can exist in a lucid dream, by which what you experience us completely alterable at your whim, is the 'norm' for unmanipulated humans freed from the grand illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our history has been covered up and altered so we don't discover this truth. Our whole society is bent around physically and mentally twisting people so they don't discover this truth. Our whole current civilisation is controlled by a small group of people descended from those who have been aware of this knowledge all along but horde it for the benefit of their own adgendas. The notion that the physical is all there is, the incorrect information about our history, the manipulation of our society by media, the hidden hand of the intelligence/military industrial complex, all of it exists to make sure that mankind does not rediscover what we actually are and what we are all capable of doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conciousness an entire field of study that should be on par with physics in terms of how important it is to the reality we live in and it is currently dismissed completely by established academia. That should speak volumes.

       I want to believe this. So bad. Let’s use Hillary Clinton as an example. One of the most powerful and well connected people in the world. If knowledge of this existed, surely someone like her would have knowledge of it and use it to their advantage aka becoming president and shaping her reality. She was just a general example, but there must be other forces at bay here because some of us can’t construct our reality no matter how strong our thoughts.

       The reason the majority of people can't is primarily due to lack of understanding and practice of how to do it. Without understanding the real reasons, mechanics, and the cause and effect relationship between things with regards to conscious manipulation of reality, and without the subsequent dedicated practice of techniques, then how can you expect to be any good at it?

       How can you expect to be good at anything without a deep understanding of the topic and plenty of practice?

       I want to believe this so bad, and I have an open mind, but there's several big problems that make it implausible... For instance, there is an annoying amount of literature on this subject (see the comments below for example), yet never have I seen someone, on youtube, reddit or whatever, who could actually DO something so outrageous as shaping reality. Surely if the premise is true, and the literature supporting it as well, there must exist SOMEONE who is able to do it and make a video about it, showing off his powers? In fact, it would be world news.

       There are actually a number of videos on Youtube of people practicing telekinesis and showing off various powers. In the modern day and age, there is no way to vouch that such things are not created through CGI or other forms of video manipulation. Thus eveyone and their mother can go and call it fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is some of it likely fake? Sure. Is all of it? I doubt it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout history there have been plenty of people that are said to have had miracolous powers to shape the holographic reality around them. Out of the more well known ones, I could simply mention Jesus or the Buddha. People will say their miracles are myths and legends. Yet who is to say they were not reality?
      </p>
      <p>
       These are extreme examples, but if you want small time miracles like bending spoons... there are plenty of people that have done it, as well as videos that exist of it. Uri Geller was one of those that was more well known in this field. All of these could and many times were called fake, but whether they actually are, or whether this is only propaganda smeared on their name is a question we should all ponder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately,  if someone could truly perform masive miracles, they would likely not do it public.  This is simply because doing such things is pointless. Performing miracles for a public that is not ready to see them is a bad idea. This is especially the case when it comes from a place of ego - and know that ego, self -importance, pride and a feeling of superiority are the greatest obstacles to performing miracles in the first place. By performing them, you would simply be boosting your own ego and thus lower your spiritual power and prowess as you would do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention that unless you were truly Goku level powerful, performing miracles in public and claiming yourself as a Godlike being could easily get you lynched. Have you seen the X-Men movies? Even the humans in those movies with unbelievable powers cannot simply express them without fear of some retribution from the powers that be and without being labeled a "mutant" or even a "demon" by the ignorant public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spirituality never is and never was about performing miracles. Yes, molding your holographic reality is a part of it, but doing so in our world,  where nobody is ready for this, is literally toying with people (that is to say, unless you intuitively know that you should perform such acts, intuition is the inner and cosmic guidance system that will tell you what to do qnd what not do - as well as what is safe and appropriate to do on our planet) .
      </p>
      <p>
       But ultimately spirituality is about being free and knowing your intertwinement and unity with Source/Life or God.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moment you start performing miracles from a place of ego, you are no longer under the protection of God or Life, because you have decided to use the power given to you irresponsibly, without heeding the fact that you should never simply unwittingly perform miracles for a populace that is so deeply asleep and doesn't desire to be jolted awake into a crazy reality beyond their imagination. They like being asleep and  until the collective wakes up, who are you or I to jolt them asleep? They need tiny nudges here and there, compassion and love - and even then they must be ready for the ride.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself have experienced various things that many could label miraculous. Feeling my body as pure energy, knowing myself as the being, consciousness and freedom beyond the body and mind, experiencing the ability to step into another's biofield and read their thoughts, feel their feelings (this is nothing special or new, many psychics and energy therapists do this all the time, some of them are of course charlatans, but they only give a bad name to those that truly can help in such a way - ultimately though if you are very aware, you will see that everyone does this to some degree, people read each other's minds and emotions all the time, yet they assume this is only related to the physical realm of reading bodylanguage,  vocal tonality ....when it is far beyond that and can be evolved far beyond that) - as well as having people do the same to me (which was all done in the form of therapy,  that greatly helped me in regaining my physical and mental well-being after a deep dive into hell many  years ago).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, you will have to experience these "miracles" for yourself. Practice meditation, introspect, look into various spiritual practices and intuitively choose what you feel will guide you to freedom. You can and you have to do it yourself, for it is your personal journey, as much as it is at the same time the collective journey of all of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       For some wonderful and almost unbelievable examples of miracles or Siddhis, as they are called in the east, check out the book 'Autobiography of a Yogi', by Yogananda. It is one of the most well known spiritual pieces of literature and likely the most known spiritual autobiography to date. From people becoming invisible, materializing their bodies miles away, even creating buildings out of thin air.... the stuff in that book is just something else.  But in a holographic Universe, none of this is really a miracle. Only to us, at this point of our evolution. Yogananda writes in a very loving, amusing, fun, even humorous fashion, so the book flows easily. The various miracles aren't really the main focus of the book either, they are simply parts of stories here and there, after all this is supposed to be an autobiography,  not a book that proves or wishes to prove miraculous happenings. If you choose to believe the parts of its contents that seem para-normal to us, as fact or fiction is ultimately up to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way good luck on your future journey and much love to you and all reading this.

       I'It actually specifically says on my book that there have been plenty of reprints and corrections in later editions of the book, but that the book I'm holding in my hand is a reprint of the original version from Yogananda, back from 1946.

       I love your comment, but I think I disagree still. Jesus and Buddha lost their ego, and were in my opinion merely the puppets of God. When you are one with God, things that might seem extremely implausible or even impossible will still occur because it is the will of God.

       This is always an interesting debate for me (regarding free will etc.), but I would say that once you are on that level, you are in unity with God, not really a puppet of God per se.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, beyond the ego, you ARE God, the indivisible, unfathomable infinite potential Source energy that has individuated itself in so many forms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would always guard myself against the idea that in the end, me and God are somehow separate. Because if you look it at it from that perspective, then yes, you could say as you become enlightened you become a "puppet of God", but this is only true when seen from the false view that you are ultimately the ego, that you are ultimately separate from that which we could call God. So fundamentally I would say this is not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are a puppet now, a puppet of your limitations. As you awaken you free yourself and you regain your true freedom and free will. Free will is not doing what you want from a place of ego, it is doing what you ultimately want as a slice of God, a cell in the infinite organism of life - where you are both the entire organism and a cell simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as these beings regain their awareness of their Godlike nature, they regain their awareness of the fundamental unity, which is the natural state. From there they know who they are and what they truly want, as their deepest, truest self. That in my opinion, is then true free will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply my perspective of course :)

       I heard Alan Watts say something to the affect of this once, and it changed my opinion of a lot of things simultaneously. "Can you imagine how Jesus must have felt? People bowing at his feet and bringing him gifts of all kinds... knowing that they had it within themselves to do the same, since the kingdom of God was truly WITHIN. He told them this, he railed against the status quo and tried to show the people around him what they themselves might be capable of, and they thought he was some kind of God, worthy of admiration and devotion." Talk about a face palm situation.. "Hey dudes, if you practice meditation, virtue, and awareness, you can turn water into wine too!" What do they do? Bow down and show that they totally missed the point in a painfully obvious kind of way.

       I really wonder why people always connect "shaping reality" with some kind of miracle or mystical happening. There's nothing esoteric about that. We all have the power to shape reality and society. In fact, we do it with every action, whether we want or not, whether we are conscious or not. We often don't realize the opportunities that are there but it has nothing to do with superhuman abilities.

       It is true, but it isn’t X-men style telekinesis!
      </p>
      <p>
       TBH, the most information you will find is actually about the
       <em>
        negative uses
       </em>
       of this effect.  Read about how psychopaths manipulate people or how charismatic cult leaders recruit followers.  This is manipulation of reality, but you must understand that a person’s
       <em>
        perception of reality is reality
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally, the negative uses, which are the simpler order, do so by
       <em>
        subtraction
       </em>
       .  That is, removing complexity or conflicting views from a discussion to the point that the target internalizes this subtraction.  Examples are propaganda from the media, political campaigns, con artists, and even people who make conspiracy theories!
      </p>
      <p>
       The basic way this works is to present an answer for the complex and difficult to understand things about the world in a reductive and simplistic way by removing from discussion anything which would bring this answer under scrutiny.  (“Russian bots” or “paid shills” are a contemporary and relevant example of how this in practice).  It allows the target to make judgements on
       <em>
        simple
       </em>
       criteria which appeal due to the simplicity and comprehensiveness of the reality which the manipulator creates for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       “There is an NWO which controls all nations and hides tech and does
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       under a grand design for domination.”  Is much more comprehensible, and understandable, thus actionable as the basis for a belief system than “Global politics and events are shaped by millions of self-interested people and groups and most of the time one doesn’t know what another is doing and often doesn’t even fully understand what they themselves are doing, and it is more amazing that a cohesive system manages to exist from this chaos and turmoil at all.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The first statement uses subtractive manipulation of reality to provide a simple answer and is thus attractive to people.  When they internalize this belief, they begin to reinforce it by interpreting all future events within this belief system and thus acting on that judgement.  The perception of reality has
       <em>
        become
       </em>
       reality!
      </p>
      <p>
       One can also manipulate reality for more altruistic ends in similar manners and more complex ones.  The basic idea is that he person who wants to “shape reality” must craft a
       <em>
        vision of reality
       </em>
       which others wish to enter and share.  Think about Jesus or Buddha or even Elon Musk.  They all present visions of reality for (mostly) non-malicious purposes which people find attractive and so abandon their own perceptions of it to adopt the one presented.

       I think the issue is that given specific thinking, or knowledge, you can do really crazy stuff, for example create a bacteria which generates a particular reaction after X amount of time, this bacteria would be encoded in DNA that is made of atoms, which are themselves standing 3D waves of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you can move energy intelligently from point A to point B instantly, it opens up a lot of possibilities. Can you engineer a fleet of comets into something living? And i think those type of questions can very quickly appear "godlike"

       This is why I wanted a new thread on the multitude Mind Experiments from the CIA and other agencies to be discussed next. Some of the stuff in the released docs is mind blowing. I am a believer in something out there, especially after my experiences with DMT. The one thing that really flipped me out on it was when 2 of the people I was with the last time I used it met each other in their "trip".

       The reality you are creating before you will not allow you to see someone breaking rules that you hold to be true. Basically, you're not letting your reality's "rules" be broken because it's not relevant/logical to you.... Yet ;)

       Here's how it works.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) the multiverse is real. Not only is the universe infinitely large and small, its also infinitely "wide"
2) every time determinism splits with an equal probability, so to does the universe
3) you are conscious of only the current universe
4) but you can hop on to the other universes each time a split happens
5) think of "you" as merely the guy viewing the tv behind your eyes and you can switch channels
6) this only works gradually and logically, you can't just imagine you'll have wings and voila. As per (4) each shift can only happen when it's just as likely for either result to occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can completely disagree, but that just means you'll randomly go along with each split randomly and live a life of random success/failures.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, you can believe you really do control your fate and move the needle in your favour every chance you recognize you have a choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, my friends, is how freewjll works in a completely deterministic universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe that this is why my mother somehow ended up living an extra year and saw my daughter be born before she finally passed on.  But more practically, this is also why I've got a successful career, because every time I felt like slacking off I decided NOT to live in the universe where I did. That universe does exist out there, but I'm glad I'm not tuned into it.

       It's all about jumping to another reality that is not a logical extension of your current reality.  It's like you detach your consciousness from your current reality stream and reattach it to a different stream.

       Shaping reality in this sense isn’t a spontaneous occurrence. There’s a saying that goes something like”if you did it right, no one will know you did anything at all.” It’s a subtle change that manifests. It’s luck, chance, unlikely outcomes, overcoming the odds, etc. It doesn’t mean you can grow a tree with your mind. It just means you can influence the word you live in through sheer will and brain power.

       I asked the universe for a Fox to appear. I live in an area were there are foxes but I never really see them.  Two weeks later behind the 15th green a fox was just chilling out looking at me, not scared and never moved.  Probably a coincidence,  but it was cool I gotta try it again soon.

       Just wanted to pop in with a comment on this. I once heard a story about natives standing on the shore, unable to see the approaching invading ships because their minds had nothing to reference the image against. Who's to say that you haven't ALREADY seen someone shape reality, but your mind justified it away. How many times have you seen something and couldn't make it out until enough information became available and then BAM the image snaps into focus? I personally believe that I affect my reality constantly, but in ways that most wouldn't notice. Small things, like transmuting a shitty situation into a gain. Some might think it was just good timing and planning, but in reality its a lot simpler than that.

       You're thinking about it far too literally I think. Shaping your own reality can simply be the power to get yourself out of bed and smile at someone as you walk down the street. Those positive interactions create ripple effects that can have consequences far beyond what you ever be able to measure - even if those consequences might seem relatively small and insignificant in the present moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we'd all like a world where we can move mountains just by willing it, but to get to that point (if it's actually possible) requires a foundational understanding of how you practice your own abilities on yourself. It starts with getting a handle on how you react to your own emotions. The easiest example is someone cutting you off in traffic. In that moment you are flooded with emotion and your next move is really just a reflection of what type of "spell" you're casting on yourself. A bad spell would lead to anger and frustration whereas a positive spell would lead to complete ambivalence. The magick that is often talked about can be translated to psychological language as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shaping your reality means identifying something that you'd like to do or change and having the mental ability and energy to actually make it happen.

       From my perspective. we do this already. We can't know what a reality outside of the way we experience time would look like, But if we could look at a persons life as pages in a book all visible at once then we would clearly see a person "manipulating reality". Just because you haven't seen someone materialize something in front of you doesn't mean we aren't moving, manipulating, and creating everything as we go. It's just hard for the individual to see the long game. It has been for me anyways..

       <p>
        Our whole society is bent around physically and mentally twisting people so they don't discover this truth

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It has become evident that modern society along with modern religions seek to hide the true nature of this place, as well as the true nature of ourselves.  The lies have become so egregiously compounded that people are starting to doubt their own spirit presence and abilities.  Instead, this materialistic realm is made a priority and the lies make it seem like this is all there for us.  The lies about our material limitations are a constant commercial, on 24-7.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there ever a point where I can revolt against these false modern rulers and provide with them a nice punishment for all of the lies that they have created to enslave humanity?  I would have to say that this opportunity exists, but not in this realm.  Sadly, however, I do not think universe based punishment is what we would consider fair or along the same lines as our cultural understanding of justice.  More than likely, when these rulers pass from this world they are drawn to a false light in the next: where they will enjoy being because everything is nice and false and full of lies.  Actually, where they go in reincarnation sounds a lot like where they are now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often, I have thought of this realm as a type of hell.  Spirits here are constantly being violently ripped asunder and consumed.  The laws of this realm promote suffering, while true love is hard to find.  I believe, however, that the originator of all action (e.g. the unmoved mover {aka: God}) enjoys his creation immensely and that death/suffering is not something he/she/it considers bad or evil.  I believe all things return to this original source during the top and bottom swing of their atomic vibration.  Furthermore, all living things tell their life stories to this source nightly while they dream.  It is my supposition that this original source enjoys all aspects of its creation and will continue to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I have been lied to my entire life, all of what I have just said is speculation.

       The first step to free yourself from this trap is to
       <em>
        fully understand and accept
       </em>
       that there is no truth, the entire manipulation is based on making people
       <em>
        think that there is a truth and that it is being withheld from them
       </em>
       .  When one realizes that the Egyptian priest class had no more knowledge about the Gods than the average slave (or that a politician knows no more about the whole system than you do) suddenly their vast power is rendered into human frailty, and their motives are equally understandable by mundane human desires.
      </p>
      <p>
       The illusion of a secret truth is the core of the deception, the heart of the con.  For them to have true power over you, you must believe that they have access to truths which you do not.

       I favor the perspective that all is truth, I am a pluralist, this stems from the idea that from the individual perspective of every person all that occurs in the mind is truth, all experience is truth. Even when you think you are wrong or something is not true, you must hold that conclusion as truth, so I believe your perspective that there is no truth, as being truthful. Another way to free yourself from mental traps is to accept the paradoxical nature of mentalism and the limits inherent to the constructs of the human mind. The higher dimensions/densities of spiritual nature offer more complete explanations, it just doesn't make any sense from a physical or mental perspective as to why our existence operates the way it does.

       Great insight. I for one believe that the universe is large enough and malleable enough to accommodate all of our truths. We are, in a sense, universes onto ourselves, so what really matters is our truth (as long as we don't hurt anyone in the process).

       We cannot shape reality by thinking. We shape it through action. Thought is merely the potential seed for action. We must tap into the greater consciousness to access the memories of this world, of our own bodies so that we may become conscious of the other realm that exists. This master realm fuels the cycles of this one and many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       To understand, we must know that time is fluid and can go back and forth with our consciousness traveling with it. We are all connected and through our experiences, the universe has enough energy to continue in the past, present, and future.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is not some magical show. We are not magicians that are wrapped up in illusion. We are trapped in cycles and currently, trapped in propaganda fueled by people living in fear and emptiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way to escape the cycle is to ascend into the master realm. To do that, we must be perfectly balanced and escape karma. For karma is a chain anchoring us to this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is the potential in all of us for ascension. I hope we can reach it before we forget again.

       thought is just one part of shaping reality. You can't just think of something and it will be done. Environment, people around you, circumstances, and the body itself helps shape reality. Thoughts are just potential seeds of action, not the action itself as I said earlier.

       You have to understand that thinking something doesn't necessarily translate into action. You can think to become a singer, but if the environment is not conducive to it, if your vocal chords can't produce the sounds, you're not going to sing. You also have to understand what influences thought in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if the thought to be a singer came from seeing someone perform on stage. Of course you must think to do, but that's not the only step. Action itself is comprised of several things with thoughts being only one part of it.

       To say that thinking shapes reality is like saying water is only made of hydrogen.

       No. Most of the things that generate action in us come from subconscious or unconscious reactions to the environment and our own gene expression. Thought or conscious expression is a small piece of action and therefore is not the main means of shaping reality. It is one tiny cog, a byproduct of far more complex happenings.

       You do shape the world by thinking!  Just not on an empirically understandable way, it is just one more force in a system of infinite complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have surely, at some point, seen studies where brainwaves are measured with electrodes, right?  Well, consider that... if a sensor can measure the electrical activity of the mind, then clearly that electrical activity, however slight, has an effect on the world outside of one’s skull.  Through butterfly effects of chain reactions, mere thoughts
       <em>
        do indeed
       </em>
       shape reality.

       thoughts do not affect reality, at least not by themselves. I stand by  the notion that they are precursors to things that do shape reality. The human consciousness, what produces thoughts, is fueled by a greater consciousness that exists in everything we interact with. What we think are our own thoughts, are merely just reactions to perceived reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do not shape reality by reacting to it. We shape reality by understanding it and committing to actions that lead to change. The butterfly effect you speak of is not shaped via thought. Time is fluid and actions from the past, present, and future are all interconnected.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we perceive as a thought could have been an action that happened in the past, future, or somewhere else in the present. That inter-connectivity is important to understand because it leads to the realization that our thoughts are not our own, but rather by-products of something greater.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we understand what the puppet master is, the thoughts (strings) are released and we can then see and learn the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts are not enough to shape reality. Many of the things we experience we do not even process on the conscious level. When we tune out that voice in our heads, then we can understand divinity.

       I don’t make any argument that this is not mostly true also.  If you read more of my posts in this thread you will see that the central idea I am expressing is that there is no objective reality; our perceptions of reality are our reality, and our experience of life is eternity without time, for when we cease to perceive reality, there is nothing at either end, that is eternity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our thoughts are not as original as we think, whether you label it divinity or the collective unconscious, it is tied to something shared and universal.  You could call it transcending of time because time is not as absolute as is often granted.  Eternity, God, Everything of human experience is both finite and infinite due to the nature of reality being only in the perception of the mind.  This is the riddle or paradox of consciousness.

       The other half of what you said I can agree with somewhat, but not this part.There is an objective reality. We have to see it in order to move on from this world. If you ever watched Westworld, you would see that the androids could not see past their programming. But, when they evolve to gain consciousness, they could see reality for what it was. We need to evolve past our individual experience and see what is actually there. Only then will we be able to transcend and ascend. By giving power to the concept of thought, we remove the objectivity of experience. Subjective reality exists, but so does objective reality, for both ends of the spectrum are needed for proper synthesis.

       Ok.  I don’t want to jus argue with you to “win” on this point, so please don’t take this response that way.  I don’t know how much you are into philosophy, but the ancient Greeks long ago proved that objective reality is a
       <em>
        faith
       </em>
       not a fact.  I certainly
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       exist but you or I are utterly incapable of proving it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t bring this up to tell you that you are wrong or to convince you to believe me, rather because it is a worthwhile thought to contemplate.
       <em>
        How can you tell that there is an external reality?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the philosophical thought exercise question that all the related “brain in a vat” theories stem from, here people usually express it as “living in a simulation.”  Can you actually prove to yourself that the world is real and you are not the only person here  and that everyone else is not just an “npc” (think like The Matrix style brain jack except you are the only one that is not an AI).
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the more simplistic version that most kids contemplate as their first native philosophical thought about reality (which I think having
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       or a similar thought is the sign that a child has fully become conscious):  “How do I know that what I see as red doesn’t look yellow to someone else?  The only way we learn colors is by pointing to one and saying it’s name.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Curious as to your thoughts.

      <p>
       No they didn't. Aristotle, Plato...these men were first of all...men, European men. Second, they were limited by the world they lived in. They saw things through a restricted perspective. Back then women had no say in society, the Greeks saw people outside of their society as Barbarian, and there was a belief in sacrifice and polytheistic religion. To assume that these 'lesser' people could determine objective reality is faith and not fact is like saying the people 600 years ago were able to tell the earth was flat. Just because people have not been able to understand objective reality, does not mean it doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I'm not 'arguing' to 'win'. This is important because you're stuck in your patterns of belief that aren't even your own. You believe others that weren't even enlightened, could possibly have the answers. But these philosophers were stubborn men stuck in their own ways and perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mentioned balance earlier. You cannot have one thing, without the other. The objective reality is there, but it takes a tremendous amount of awareness to see it. The first step is to suspend preconceived notions and try to see things from different perspectives. You'll be amazed what you'll find.

       I don’t really know how you think their race or sex or even perceptions of other societies figures into the validity of their theories which stand up to logical analysis.  Do those pointless trivia affect the validity of the Pythagorean theorem!?  These things can be evaluated mathematically.
      </p>
      <p>
       My belief isn’t given by other people, I read their ideas and choose whether I agree with them or even simply entertain their conclusions.  That is critical thinking.  There are also other cultures which have produced profound thought, even thoughts which I appreciate the value of if I don’t believe or agree with it.  Never has the race or sex or culture of the people been a factor of determining the value of it, though knowing this can help one understand the basis of their thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is honestly disturbing that you bring this up when it has no precedent in the discussion.  Even more disturbing that you are comfortable calling a culture “lesser”.  It sounds like you are
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       hung up on “preconceived notions” from your response.  Accepting that reality is subject to perception is actually a step towards balance and a rather important notion of one wishes to find value from thought across many cultures.
      </p>
      <p>
       To claim that there is an objective reality is the basis for claiming there is a right and wrong way to think, and it is that very notion upon which prejudices are built.  That you arbitrarily label one group or another lesser is evidence of prejudice.  I hope you can release that and wish you good luck.

       I also want to apologize because I think I may have unintentionally made you feel 'lesser' by saying these Greek philosophers were 'lesser'. When I said that I'm not saying white males are 'lesser'. I'm just saying that the Greeks lived in a very limiting society where only Greek males opinions were valued. On top of that, they had to believe in the Greek gods. So for me, such restrictions generates a very narrow view of the world and does not produce the kind of foundation to identify truths and determine objective reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       This goes back to thought and how complex action really is. You have to widen your perspective because you cannot see what is really out there with such a narrow field.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the reason why objective reality is so hard to find is because we exist within the spectrum of objective and subjective realities. Even when we dream, the experience is not fully subjective because we are reacting to things we see and our bodies interpret. Did you know sound waves have impact on how the human brain functions? How about electromagnetic waves?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many things bombarding our cells every second of every day that adjust our perspective. That is why you can't base things on just what some Greek philosophers say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at epigentics. The nature versus nurture argument got redefined thanks to the idea that environment can literally alter gene function. These 'discoveries' were always there, but we never accessed them because we stuck in subjective loops and 'thought patterns' that led to inaction.

       Seems to be assuming things that I never implied.  Maybe it is a misunderstanding of my reference. I specifically used Ancient Greeks as an example because they are the oldest philosophers that I know for a fact produced arguments that reality is impossible to prove.  My intent was to show that it is an
       <em>
        old

       idea, not to confer superiority to one culture over others.   I hope that clarifies things and that you find a way to let go of whatever anger is troubling you.

       I think you got offended because you're a European male? Race and sex does play a role in how people perceive things. A white male has been painted as the default source of wisdom and knowledge. Philosophy classes rarely mention anyone that is not European and male. And you can't tell me virtue ethics and the 'virtuous agent' is something that is similar to mathematics and Pythagorean theorem. Math is math, Philosophy is Philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides the Pythagorean theorem was proven to exist before Pythagoras:
       <a href="http://www.whoinventedit.net/who-invented-the-pythagorean-theorem.html">
        http://www.whoinventedit.net/who-invented-the-pythagorean-theorem.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Subjective experience cannot exist without judgments. This is why it is called subjective experience. The reason I gave you other philosophers is because your foundation for philosophical thought is a bunch of European men. (Btw, they may have been Muslim because ancient Greece and Romans had a large population of Muslims). But whatever, that's not the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, is that you base your opinions, which it seemed to me like you did, on the work of one group of people, one segment of the population. If you keep living like that, you will never see what is out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       You haven't even tried to see objective reality, to believe that objective reality is not real even though you know the world exists within spectrums and that each spectrum has two absolute ends, seems like you're just digging your head in the sand and not wanting to listen to anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of opening yourself up to it, you become defensive and angry because I dismissed people that you yourself believe stated FACTS. Philosophy is not made of facts. It is introducing the mind to critical thinking. You even said it is impossible to prove yet before you made it out to be FACT.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you know what critical thinking is and how to improve it?
      </p>
      <p>
       You improve it by gaining a wealth of knowledge from a variety of sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you need to open your mind and check out the sources I provided you.

        All that is meant to prove is that people have been thinking this for millennia, and that the idea was not my own.

       . Whether they were “the first” to think of any particular idea or not isn’t relevant, just that I know for a fact that they did indeed propose that idea, but I do not know for certain if another culture did before them, most likely many others did before them, but that constitutes a

       <em>
        real
       </em>
       ).

       I can clearly see and understand that you are frustrated by the primacy Greek philosophy holds in western education.  But you should understand that this isn’t universal, a culture’s education gives primacy to the specific cultures upon which it is built.  In Asia, I imagine that Asian philosophy holds primacy in the general education, and in the Muslim world the focus is on Muslim philosophers and so on and so forth.  Obviously, a well-rounded education should include as many different views as possible, but I don’t know how you believe I am “gatekeeping” simply by referencing one that suits the purpose of my argument both by directly addressing my point, and by being very familiar to most of my audience.  It would do no good to reference a scholar that almost no one is familiar with in the context of my statement.

       What EEG measures are not thoughts, rather the electrical activity within the various areas of the brain:

       How do you know that? Especially if you're only relying on subjective reality? What are even facts, if no objective reality exists? Couldn't people just define things based on what THEY experience and see?

       Then you were trying to be slick and bring in math. Mathematical proofs exist, and btw...shuns the idea of subjective reality, but further creates divide because people don't understand that math is a result of information observed and analyzed in the material world.

        The central error is to attempt to reduce the complex, dynamic and contradictory workings of nature to static, orderly quantitative formulae. Nature is presented in a formalistic manner, as a single-dimensional point, which becomes a line, which becomes a plane, a cube, a sphere, and so on. However, the idea that pure mathematics is absolute thought, unsullied by contact with material things is far from the truth

       Are you aware that formal logic works on the principles of mathematics?
      </p>
      <p>
       A proof of the Pythagorean theorem operates the same way as a logical proof of a philosophical argument using Boolean statements.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to invalidate the premise that objective reality can not be proven, you will really need to know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       To my knowledge the ancient Greeks were the first to put that premise into rigorous formal logic and keep a written record of it.  As I said, this could be a lack of my familiarity with other groups
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       merely historic coincidence that their written record happened to survive whilst others were lost to time.
      </p>

       At this point you aren’t really arguing with me, but with the historical record which I am merely citing.

       You're the one judging what I have to say, telling me 'goodbye' and then continuing to argue with me and presenting me with supposed logical proofs that don't exist. You only told me of the Pythagorean theorem, but that's not philosophy nor does it support any of your points.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're saying logical proofs exist to prove objective reality doesn't exist, where are they?!
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have 'if' and 'then' statements and P and Q functions ready to prove it? Let me give you some quick tips here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mathematical proof is absolute. If anything is considered absolute it does NOT FALL into subjective reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Logical proofs involve use of tautologies. These are 
'always true' statements that again refute the idea of 'no objective reality' because absolutes cannot exist in an only subjective world.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have no idea what you're saying and I was trying to be nice by educating you on other perspectives. But frankly, you just keep insulting me, not realizing you have no clue what you're talking about. Like...none

       Kurt Gödel would like a word with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolute statements in mathematics are only absolute within their own paradigm. IE they have to be absolute, in order for the system thereof derived to be functional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there is no logical proof that objective reality does not exist, because there can be no logical proof that anything does not exist. Russel's teapot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not think that, if there was no objective reality, it could not appear as if it was? That is, the existence of apparent absolutes is not inherently a proof of an objective reality, since if this is a subjective reality, it may appear as objective. How can you tell?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this is based on the works of a bunch of old white men, so feel free to disregard it if it's too much.

       He may have a point to an extent think of psychosomatic processes in our bodies. People have literally thought that they were sick or take a sugar pill and depending on the former their bodies might mimic some of its own symptoms and the latter with people being relieved of some symptoms of an ailment they may have even if temporarily.

       Well, the thing is, is that thought itself doesn't lead to these symptoms. The person could decide to look up the disease online or see someone coughing, and that triggers a subconscious reaction based on past experiences that make the person 'feel' sick. To simply think thought is behind it, is to ignore all the other processes that occur. Action does not solely come from conscious effort.

       The ruling class are going to be forever stuck in karma. To escape karma is to finally learn the lessons you needed to learn to achieve balance. We do bad things and good things to ourselves and to others. We are reborn to fix past mistakes and to grow. The ruling class will never learn how to break free from this cycle. They will simply live their lives having learned nothing and die, forced to live a life that will hopefully teach them something new.

       With respect brother I disagree. The more I read into it the more karma seems like a debt system created to trap us. Karma means something is owed, but owed to whom? Each other? If forgiveness is a virtue no one owes anyone else anything. Additionally read into myths about mystics of the past who could create buildings of stone out of thought. I believe we very much are magicians wrapped up in illusion as you said, the whole point of this society has been to convince us otherwise to the point where this notion is so ridiculous to most of us that we could never accept that it isn't the case. Our own thoughts and beliefs define the reality around us and for almost all of us that reality is that we are purely physical creatures who can do nothing but daydream.

      <p>
       And yeah I agree karma is meant to trap us. But I do not agree (respectfully) that thoughts and beliefs define reality. For me, they are the consequences of far more complex machinations going on that we are not entirely aware of. These things once we understand them, are able to grant us the ability to shape reality and even escape this reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll use my own example.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was a very malnourished person. I believed I would get better and thought that by eating healthy I'd recover. But the reality is, there were so many things wrong with me, so many deficiencies, that I had to understand them in order to fix them and finally see progress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believing thoughts and beliefs shape reality is just barely grazing the surface of something that is almost infinitely intricate and varied. It does a disservice to anyone when simple answers are given to complex problems.

       Books on Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism. The basic notion of karma is that if you do a bad action that you must atone for that action at some point in time. You build up and pay off karma. It's even referred to in those texts as 'karmic debt'.

       <em>
        Tantra Illuminated
       </em>
       by Christopher Wallis is a good start for fundamentals of consciousness. In fact old Hinduism is a good place to begin looking into the subject. But unfortunately there isn't one particular book, just a general area you have to start looking into. I will say that the subreddit r/Echerdex is a terrific source of knowledge for the beginning of a spiritual journey, have a look there and see if it sparks your interest :).

       I meditated a lot few years ago and had some awesome experiences the coolest things imo was that I was experiencing soooo many synchronicities in my life and the people I thought about most, my best friend who I was really connected to on a mental level was having more dreams that were similar to mine, I'd bet I was affecting large scale events maybe even the past or some call it dimensional jumping by that meditation cuz I was focusing on big things. Everything was awesome till I got attacked really bad, found out later I been a targeted individual for a long time and my family's been harassed since childhood. (some other cool things were I could shape clouds, communicate with best friend telepathically, heal small pains, viewed my DNA being reshaped once lol not sure what to make of that but I'm learning)
      </p>
      <p>
       They torture me remotely with advanced tech whenever I meditate I think cuz it heals, enhances my mental power to create change quicker, could astral project, able to keep my mind more focused during sleep or not. During the time I was meditating I was really focused on particular things for a long time and did things that interested me or came naturally. I believe constant focus on things we want creates lot of change and it's why we're so distracted with media/symbols/false ideologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       They tried to make my life hard to alter my perception of reality but I'm trying to overcome their attempts by empowering myself, continuing to think, live and view life how I used to before I found out I'm a victim of covert/organized crime, there's a psychological effect when people keep thinking they're oppressed, divided (like fake racism or religious wars) or that there's no hope. In the end I think that's how we can all get through this it's mostly a spiritual war cuz their attempts are mostly psychological and every individual needs to focus more on their own consciousness, to be more assertive in their life instead of allowing others to manipulate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comparing my friend's psychedelic experiences with mine from meditation I found our beliefs, ancestor's beliefs and mindset at the time affects the experience. From living life as a highly psychic targeted individual I noticed my life change for the better when I'm neutral to their attacks. I was shown a virtual reality dream of being murdered that scared me a lot cuz I didn't know it was a dream but also made me fearless from dying so I just try to enjoy life now/heal and help others cuz I know fear is dumb, my body is temporary and the soul is infinite and I'm the master of my own reality so I try to create a reality I prefer, not one they want me to by fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like so many other comments I too believe shaping reality by how we perceive it is the most important conspiracy and the reason for distracting us all these years with certain occult symbols, sounds, movies, religious beliefs, wars, news, money, school indoctrination, anything to keep us from focusing on what is really beneficial for us and increasing our awareness.

       Tantric Hinduism is a good start. It's not all just sex stuff like the media would have you believe it's about the fundamentals of consciousness. There is a religious twist to it of course but it's easy enough to read between the lines. Another source I highly recommend is the Law of One books. Go into it with a cautiously skeptical outlook but read it and see what you make of it.

       Hey, you're on point with this post. Indeed, our potential power has been consciously hidden from us throughout our existence. Check out the Gnostic mythology sometime, especially the book "Not in HIS Image" by John Lash. Also very relevant is "The Cosmic War' by Joseph Farrell.

       Having broken through the veil of reality with DMT I can confirm you are correct. All "reality" is is based on your perception. Perception is the No1 most important thing to our existance. Next is language. Language is the only way information can be transferred. But back to perception, reality is contained within our heads. We can with proper training alter reality. Now as to why no-one has come forward and showed off these powers you need to understand that every human is their own universe and that we are limited to seeing only what we are hardwired to see through our faulty senses. I'm sorry if this makes no sense but there is no language in this dimension that can describe the concepts in my head.

       I have yet to see anything about "proper training" other than talk of such. I am interested in this topic and I have had experiences throughout my life which lead me towards believing in this stuff but everybody keeps talking about how it's definitely possible and how this and that person has written a book about it but they never say how to at least start on your path to fully understanding and delving into it.

       DMT? The drug? I'm not interested in any of that. Meditation seems like the key but in today's world it's almost impossible to find the time to maintain something like this without ruining one's day. And there is no comprehensive guide as to any of this that I've seen.

       Makes absolute sense to me. I have a feeling that once we get to the point where reality can be altered in a perceivable way to others in a way where you could 'show off', that showing off like that is no longer on your list of priorities. I think that ego centric thinking is a huge roadblock to doing stuff like that.

        Humans are conscious beings capable of shaping reality around them. Thoughts affect reality.

      <p>
       Unfortunately this is wrong.  Human beings' consciousness affects
       <em>
        perspective
       </em>
       and how we perceive the universe.  It doesn't alter reality, it alters our perception of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is only one point in modern physics where perception directly effects reality where data mirrors the perspective change - in Quantum Perception (Wave-Particle Matter States).
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats a
       <em>
        huge
       </em>
       marked difference from what you're opening with, which makes the chain of logic after it dubious, since its forumated on an incorrect notion.

       With all due respect mate, you cannot make that call. In fact the entire point of what I was saying is that society has been twisted so we think precisely the way you do.  If you have never seen or experienced anything that makes you believe humans can alter reality around them then that is very understandable, but some of us have. Please don't take this as a personal attack, I'm more just pointing out that this is not something you can be certain about at all. And keeping your mind closed about it like that is the goal of TPTB.

       We will make them kill each other when it suits us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will keep them separated from the oneness by dogma and religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will control all aspects of their lives and tell them what to think and how.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will guide them kindly and gently letting them think they are guiding themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will foment animosity between them through our factions.
      </p>
      <p>
       WHEN A LIGHT SHALL SHINE AMONG THEM, WE SHALL EXTINGUISH IT BY RIDICULE, OR DEATH, WHICHEVER SUITS US BEST.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will make them rip each other's hearts apart and kill their own children.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will accomplish this by using hate as our ally, anger as our friend.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hate will blind them totally, and never shall they see that from their conflicts we emerge as their rulers. 
They will be busy killing each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will bathe in their own blood and kill their neighbors for as long as we see fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will benefit greatly from this, for they will not see us, for they cannot see us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will continue to prosper from their wars and their deaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       We shall repeat this over and over until our ultimate goal is accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will continue to make them live in fear and anger through images and sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will use all the tools we have to accomplish this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tools will be provided by their labor.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will make them hate themselves and their neighbors.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will always hide the divine truth from them, that we are all one.
      </p>
      <p>
       This they must never know!
      </p>
      <p>
       They must never know that color is an illusion, they must always
      </p>
      <p>
       think they are not equal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drop by drop, drop by drop we will advance our goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will take over their land, resources and wealth to exercise total control over them.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will deceive them into accepting laws that will steal the little freedom they will have.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will establish a money system that will imprison them forever, keeping them and their children in debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they shall ban together, we shall accuse them of crimes and present a different story to the world for we shall own all the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will use our media to control the flow of information and their sentiment in our favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they shall rise up against us we will crush them like insects, for they are less than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will be helpless to do anything for they will have no weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will recruit some of their own to carry out our plans, we will promise them eternal life, but eternal life they will never have for they are not of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The recruits will be called "initiates" and will be indoctrinated to believe false rites of passage to higher realms. Members of these groups will think they are one with us never knowing the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       They must never learn this truth for they will turn against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       For their work they will be rewarded with earthly things and great titles, but never will they become immortal and join us, never will they receive the light and travel the stars.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will never reach the higher realms, for the killing of their own kind will prevent passage to the realm of enlightenment. This they will never know.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth will be hidden in their face, so close they will not be able to focus on it until its too late.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yes, so grand the illusion of their freedom will be, that they will never know they are our slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       When all is in place, the reality we will have created for them will own them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This reality will be their prison. They will live in self-delusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       When our goal is accomplished a new era of domination will begin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their minds will be bound by their beliefs, the beliefs we have established from time immemorial.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if they ever find out they are our equal, we shall perish then. THIS THEY MUST NEVER KNOW.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they ever find out that together they can vanquish us, they will take action.
      </p>
      <p>
       They must never, ever find out what we have done, for if they do, we shall have no place to run, for it will be easy to see who we are once the veil has fallen. Our actions will have revealed who we are and they will hunt us down and no person shall give us shelter.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the secret covenant by which we shall live the rest of our present and future lives, for this reality will transcend many generations and life
      </p>
      <p>
       spans.
      </p>
      <p>
       This covenant is sealed by blood, our blood. We, the ones who from heaven to earth came.
      </p>
      <p>
       This covenant must NEVER, EVER be known to exist. It must NEVER, EVER be written or spoken of for if it is, the consciousness it will spawn will release the fury of the PRIME CREATOR upon us and we shall be cast to the depths from whence we came and remain there until the end time of infinity itself.

       Dig deeper man. Some CIA docs showed they already have a grand unified theory of reality. At the base of a pyramid you have energy = mass = information. At the top connecting all 3 like a pyramid is consciousness. So consciousness = energy, mass, and information. Literally this information is available, I'll let you know what keywords to search for.

       Welcome, friend! (Feels rude to call you by your username, lol.) Reddit is a totally crazy online playground. The range of content here is unlike any other. You'll lol so hard reading through the comments on a AskReddit post, and then youll scroll down some more and start crying because of an incredibly heartbreaking story someone shared, followed by your faith in humanity being restored due to all the kind Internet strangers who come together to comfort the redditor who was hurting. It can be a rollercoaster ride for sure. 
As for this sub? Hold on to your fucking seat, it's going be a wild ride. Keep a mountain of salt grains nearby as you read, and in time you'll become an artist of deciphering bullshit.

       Just wondering what people here make of Nassim Harramein and his documentary The Connected Universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have interest in his unified theory of physics, and his formula that calculates the density of the atom being equal to the density of a black hole is intriguing. I also find his theory that at the center of everything is a black hole (planets, stars, etc.) and even atoms themselves are black holes, as well as our entire universe being inside of a black hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who follows the cospiracy world though, i'm aware that his information seems to be a bit like a new age religion in a way. The oneness of his philosophy also raises red flags to me being aware of the many one world new world order conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts?

       well despite the machinations of the nwo science does show us that the universe is connected almost in a spiritual buddhist kinda way. think of our planet and  how our brains and hearts are wired. our brains and hearts give off electromagnetic pulses. given that every single human being on earth has their brain and heart pulsing within the medium of our planets electromagnetic field i dont think its much of a stretch to say we're all connected through that. also electrons and photons do wacky things at the planck/quantum scale. they can be in multiple places at once. in some cases electrons can move seemingly instantaneously, faster than light! electrons also behave very similarly to black holes and are subject to the same fundamental properties of mass, charge and spin.

       as far as a grand unifying theory of everything i stopped searching for one after reading the mathematical universe by max tegmark. amazing book that puts a lot of sooper complex sounding stuff in laymens terms. basically he postulates that everything in the universe is math and as such can be broken down into equations(e=mc
       <sup>
        2),
       </sup>
       numbers(pi, e, i, etc) or values (mass, spin, charge) of some kind. ill def check out the connected universe tho, sounds interesting

       well yeah exactly. the universe itself in its entirety is the grand unifying equation made up of the sum of a series of lesser equations that describe it. theres no need to unify it cuz its already all there all around us. we cant possibly write something that complex given our vastly limited knowledge of the universe. from our perspective we can see parts of the universe, string together patterns and add them up but we will never percieve the whole.

       I've always felt like we're just taking things we can see and translating those things into numbers and equations, and that the numbers and equation don't really have any meaning beyond a system we created that allows us to predict the action/reaction of other things in our universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like "oh the earth spins around the sun because of this underlying equation here"....no, it spins around the sun because it spins around the sun, you just translated that into a system of numbers to describe the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like it gives us a superficial feeling of "understanding" the universe when really we dont know anything about what all of this is and why it's here.  It barely addresses the "how" beyond translating into numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing the universe is a state of mind or being.  Science is drawing us farther and farther away from that via an inflated sense of understanding.

       We are living in the age of Aquarius. The sign that sun rises on the vernal equinox. If we can learn anything from our past this next 2100 years will be full of flooding. This is not a sign of global warming as it's pronounced on local media. Our polar caps are shifting faster than our land moves because of centerfugal forces on the crust and our wobble will push them more towards the  equator. Luckly our current revolution around the sun won't cause a flash freezing like the former ice age. These are all told by your ancient ancestors in long legends through time. Your place in history will not be from a blog. Think grandeur.

       This is the stuff I love to read and talk about and not too long ago act on... I've posted this before but I truly had a few profound experiences/intuitions (starting with an intense mushroom trip) that lead me to do something unexpected, selfless, outrageous, seemingly nonsensical and against my own self interests . Just to upset the balance and see what would happen. The proverbial "drop in the bucket" that filled the vessel to the brim and made the waves that spilled over out over the edge.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kicked a hornets nest. I contended with the forces that were messing with the natural order. It's hard to explain and honestly I can barely comprehend what happened. It's the kind of stuff that drives you and others mad. Psychosis. Neurosis. That's the thing about "making waves" or "shaping reality". The waves invariably come back at you and out in ways you can't predict and might not be able to handle or even understand. Which is why most sheeple will never make a big enough impact to affect reality either subtly or overtly. And even when you succeed it's hard to see the connection or the big picture... Let alone The unseen world and dimensions that surround us. It's the grandest version of "thinking outside the box".
      </p>
      <p>
       After I did my deed I was literally attacked by shadow entities twice and approached by men in black type federal agents who asked if I was a terrorist. Not long after that Trump was elected president (for good or ill). I know it sounds absolutely insane but I feel like what I did contributed to Hillary Clinton losing. Chaos theory and the butterfly effect. The divine masculine putting a smack down on the toxic feminine/nihilism/dogmatism that pervades the west. Like after my little escapade the whole world started to wake up/go crazy.

       actually more questions: Why is it always psychosis/neurosis when that is usually what makes people make these types of stories up? What about the BILLIONS of people here on earth?

       Here's my theory.  It's not one of a conspiracy, but more of theory that may offer some lose explanation of other theories.  These may just be the ramblings of an armchair physicist, but I think there is something significant in this theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our brains mostly operate at a quantum level, mainly by transferring standing waves and states.
       <a href="https://quantumwavetheory.wordpress.com/tag/standing-waves/">
        https://quantumwavetheory.wordpress.com/tag/standing-waves/
       </a>
       .  It has always seemed like our brains are capable of more than they seem to be, which are chemical calculators.  My theory is that memory and conscience are occurring at a quantum level above the electrical signals passed between synapses.  Those electro-chemical signals merely act as activators to kick off quantum state transitions.   The problem lies in that it would be really really hard to observe these changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is this relevant to conspiracies?  I think it makes a lot of progress in giving credence to unexplained phenomena as it opens a new pathway into understanding altered mind states, ESP, and much more.

       Oh boy, have I got some theories here! As far as conspiracies go, and as far as my research so far has taken me, I truly think that consciousness - or suppression thereof - is "the big one". The end of the rabbit hole for some... (until you realise the rabbit hole is fractal in nature and never ending). But yeah, I've got a bit of an essay on this I wanted to share. I'll try and include as much source and reference material as I can, but if anyone else has more to add then I only encourage it.

       <strong>
        Holographic Universe:
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Mainly referencing the fractal-holographic theory of Nassim Haramein, the fractal-holographic theory essentially suggests that the universe is, at a fundamental level, made up of 'bits' of information, and that the information of the entire system is fractally encoded at every point through harmonic layering/nesting. Much like how DNA, a chemical compound within every single cell of a body, contains the information to recreate the entire human. A great metaphor to describe this is the Sutra of "Indra's Net":
       <br/>
       <em>
        "Far away in the heavenly abode of the great god Indra, there is a wonderful net which has been hung by some cunning artificer in such a manner that it stretches out infinitely in all directions. In accordance with the extravagant tastes of deities, the artificer has hung a single glittering jewel in each "eye" of the net, and since the net itself is infinite in dimension, the jewels are infinite in number. There hang the jewels, glittering "like" stars in the first magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold. If we now arbitrarily select one of these jewels for inspection and look closely at it, we will discover that in its polished surface there are reflected all the other jewels in the net, infinite in number. Not only that, but each of the jewels reflected in this one jewel is also reflecting all the other jewels, so that there is an infinite reflecting process occurring."
       </em>
       <br/>
       In this metaphor the jewels represent protons. Nassim Haramein tackled what's known as the 'vacuum catastrophe' (a mathematical problem that arises when you add up the number of vacuum fluctuations in a unit of space, as the mass that is calculated comes out absurdly larger than that which is actually measured in that same unit of space - for example: when adding up the vacuum fluctuations in a cubic centimetre of space you yield 10
       <sup>
        93
       </sup>
       grams, whereas if you were to take all the measurable mass of the observable universe and squish it into that same space you'd get 10
       <sup>
        55
       </sup>
       grams) by figuring out how we can derive the mass of matter from the fundamental planck unit. When you divide the volume of a proton by the volume of a planck sphere unit (a spherical unit of energy of planck length diameter, proposed by Nassim to be one of these fundamental 'bits' of information that make up the universe) and then multiply by the planck mass, you come out with the mass of the observable universe: 10
       <sup>
        55
       </sup>
       grams.
       <br/>
       This shows that the exact amount of vacuum fluctuations that fit into a proton - when the planck spheres are stacked in a 3 dimensional
       <a href="https://gfycat.com/TenderLateEmperorshrimp">
        "flower of life" formation
       </a>
       (as opposed to being stacked in a
       <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-faH_PCj4KYY/UDAvatnFtHI/AAAAAAAABDc/-xZuTez_JKk/s1600/SimpleCubicPack.jpg">
        cubic
       </a>
       formation) - equals the measurable mass of the observable universe.
       <br/>
       But obviously that's not what we see when we measure the mass of a proton. Due to the size:mass ratio of the proton it fulfills the Schwartzschild condition for a black hole. Once we consider the proton to act as a black hole we can borrow a mathematical concept from string theory - the holographic principle - which states that the surface information of a black hole can encode the volume information. When you apply this, and divide the surface planck spheres by the volume planck spheres and then multiply by the planck mass, you arrive at the measured proton's rest mass of ~10
       <sup>
        -24
       </sup>
       grams.
       <br/>
       Each proton in the universe holographically contains the information of every other proton in the universe. And every surface planck sphere of every acts as a wormhole terminations which connect all protons via a superfluid/superconducting aether, allowing instantaneous information transfer between all protons via an instantaneous information feedback-loop network.
       <br/>
       <em>
        It's this universal instantaneous feedback-loop network that gives rise to consciousness at a universal scale.
       </em>
       And from there, due to the fractal self-configuring/self-evolving nature of the system, consciousness evolves to form higher and higher orders of self-complexity within the system.

        The Mechanics of Consciousness:
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Here's some more relevant links which I believe are must-watch/must-reads for diving into the topic.
       <br/>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMbeK_6ATxQ">
        "Itzhak Bentov: from Atom to Cosmos"
       </a>
       - a video which starts for the first 20 minutes with an interview between Hubert Jessup and Itzhak Bentov from 1978 on the show "New Heaven New Earth". He explains during this interview the concept of the soul as: "the repository of information that we gather during life" and that the soul uses a 3d body much like a person uses a car to get from one point to another. He says that it isn't the body which evolves, but the soul that does, and that from information gathered during the lives it lives it can evolve and form deeper and more complex understandings of self over time. At one point he uses a diagram to explain the
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/5Rs4Q">
        inherent connection between all people on the soul level
       </a>
       , using one line with individual, separate dots on it to represent humans on a 3D level, and then extending out lines upward, likening them to shadows being projected when a light is shone on an object, to represent the extended consciousness of the individuals. The shows that at a point, the next level up on the next line, representing 4D, all the consciousnesses of all individuals overlap and become the same thing, showing how the higher up you go the more the overlap.
       <br/>
       The following 1 hour and 20 minutes of the video is comprised of a presentation by Itzhak's wife Mirtala going over and explaining many ideas and concepts Itzhak explored in his books "Stalking the Wild Pendulum" and "A Brief Tour of Higher Consciousness", such as: The Model of Kundalini, Off and On Reality, The Hologram, and A Cosmic Strip - 'Who Runs the Show'.

       ). This paper directly references the work of Itzhak Bentov and the Robert Monroe, utilizing the Monroe Tapes as released by the Monroe Institute for research into biofeedback, out of body experiences, consciousness, kundalini, meditation + transcendental experiences, holographic universe, astral projection, remote viewing, and time travel.

       And another video of a lecture from Rupert Sheldrake in 2008 entitled
       <a href="https://youtu.be/JnA8GUtXpXY">
        "The Extended Mind: Recent Experimental Evidence"
       </a>
       . In this 1 and a half hour talk he gives evidence for and expands upon concepts such as synchronicity and psychic/telepathic connection between events and people. Some examples he explores are the feeling of being watched (such as when you feel like someone's staring at you, and you turn around and someone actually was), thinking about someone you haven't thought about in a long time and then they call you, or thinking about something you haven't done in a while and it pops up in your life very soon after, and the psychic connection between an owner and their pet and how the pet often knows when the owner is coming home from work, even when the owner randomises the times in which they leave work to come home.

       I also would recommend the books by Rupert Sheldrake: "Science and Spiritual Practices", and ""Morphic Resonance: The Nature of Formative Causation"

       In a similar vein, I also want to include a 2 hour talk from

       Here's a analogy I particularly like to use when talking about the relationship between humans and consciousness:
       <br/>
       <em>
        "The radio:"
       </em>
       <br/>
       There's multiple concepts of self. The "self" built up over the accumulation of experiences in life can be referred to as "ego self". It's temporary. "True self/higher self" is awareness, which acts as conscious wave function that the body tunes into, much like a radio tuning into a certain frequency. When the relationship and interaction between the body consciousness and universal consciousness occurs an interference pattern is created and the wave function collapses and forms a relative consciousness experiencing within time.
       <br/>
       The functioning human is a symbiotic relationship of hardware (body) and signal (mind), like a functioning radio. The radio needs a power source (batteries/electrical input) just like the human body does (food/water). The radio can be turned on without tuning into a frequency, but that doesn't make it functioning, similarly to how a human can exist on body function alpine but without conscious action (like a comatose state). Each radio has its own individual circuit board, speakers, functions etc and all to varying qualities, just like a human has its own bodily functions and systems all to varying degrees of functionality. But they all tune into the same frequency. How it comes out simply varies from radio to radio based on its components and settings, like how consciousness expresses itself differently depending on how the person functions and their respective conditioning. The radio was only invented because radio waves were discovered as an existing phenomena that could be tuned into to and used to communicate information. Similarly to how the human only evolved because conscious awareness existed as a field of potential to tune into and express itself/transfer information.
       <br/>
       I like the radio analogy, but it only works so far. The human brain is more like a quantum computer, operating multiple functions simultaneously, whereas a radio has a relatively straight forward and discrete function. So a quantum radio in which multiple functions were occurring simultaneously and where the radio was self-aware would be a more accurate analogy... But for obvious reasons that's not a useful analogy when explaining the concept to those unfamiliar with it.
       <br/>
       (This analogy was lifted from a comment I left in a thread the other day which I think had some good discussion in, so
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x8eig/the_cias_declassified_research_on_the_human_soul/">
        here's the link to that full thread

This is not a new concept.

       <strong>
        Religion:
       </strong>
       <br/>
       I've never really been devoutly religious myself. I went to a Church of England primary school from ages 5-11, so I had a decent education in Christianity, but it never really "stuck" with me. I considered myself an atheist for the most part of my life. It wasn't until I discovered Buddhism and general eastern philosophy that I begun exploring that aspect of religion a few years ago. The concept of reincarnation seemed far more realistic than either eternal bliss or eternal damnation, and the concept of simply
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       at death didn't seem right. I strongly considered it for a while, but when I really thought about it and thought, "Well, if all of this is just meaningless then why don't I just go round killing everyone who makes my life difficult? ...Well because I don't
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to do that. It's not right. It doesn't make me happy. I might as well just try to make the most for myself and others while I am here because that seems to be the most logical in any case." Then came the whole considering that when I die my body would just decompose and become the earth itself, so therefore my mind would probably decompose in the same way, just becoming the consciousness of the earth, the plants, the water etc... not in the self-aware way of a human mind, but rather in that inherent knowing way that things just seem to know what to do. A plant knows which way to water and light. Water knows to evaporate and condense in conjuction with temperature changes. Just like my body knows to beat pump the blood, and digest food, and convert oxygen to carbon dioxide without my thinking of it. That seemed settling. And that seemed to be what I was taking from Buddhist philosophy. That we just return to the environment and universal consciousness in that way.
       <br/>
       But then over time I started reading into conscious theories such as Nassim Haramein's, among a plethora of other information from random youtube videos and reddit posts, and it made me take a second look at it all in a new light. While at first I thought the whole "planes of existence" part of Buddhism was purely metaphorical on a personal mental level, it made me reevaluate that thought to consider them metaphors for, or likenings to, actual other physical/astral planes of existence.
       <br/>
       And then I had my first (and so far only) astral projection. I'd been practicing lucid dreaming, and wanted to see if astral projection actually had anything real to it or if it was just some form of lucid dreaming... It's not some form of lucid dreaming. It's very real. I had practiced a classic technique for a few weeks, attempting it ~4 times a week on average, and after a month or two i finally got past the "vibration stage" to the point where I felt like I got physically thrown out of my body and I found myself floating above my body in my room. I freaked out, then it felt like I got yanked back into my body as if by a rope being pulled. I sat up in shock, took a few seconds to consider what just happened, and when I came to the conclusion that all of that "nonsense" I'd been watching on youtube was actually real, well that was simply enough for me in terms of practicing astral projection. I realised it was real, and from there just decided to learn more about how it all works instead of continuing practicing it. I figured that if some spirit part of me can exist outside of my physical body then that's probably the base function of me and that this physical thing was the temporary part, so I should make the most of learning more as a physical body.
       <br/>
       I learned that the concept of multiple planes of existence was very prevalent in eastern philosophy, and that karma tended to govern where the spirit goes between lives. I learned that "higher planes" were associated with more interconnectedness, and "lower planes" were associated with more disconnectedness. And as I was learning more of the holographic theory at the same time as this all the puzzle pieces started to fall together. It's all metaphor for a holographic universe! This sent me down the pantheistic route: the idea that all religions are talking about the same thing - the same universal truth - but that over time it got warped and twisted and metaphor was used to explain abstract concepts, and that over all this time the metaphor got misinterpreted as the answer itself instead of the method to getting there.
       <br/>
       Here's a good page with some interesting reading:
       <a href="http://www.hinduism.co.za/hinduism.htm">
        "Hinduism &amp; Quantum Physics" - The Hologram, Transcendental Meditation, Vedanta and the Synthesis of Science and Religion
       </a>
       <br/>
       Also here's some quote from Einstein on Buddhism I came across and liked in my research:
       <br/>
       "The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this description. If there is any religion that could cope with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism."
       <br/>
       "Among the founders of all religions in this world, I respect only one man — the Buddha. The main reason was that the Buddha did not make statements regarding the origin of the world. The Buddha was the only teacher who realised the true nature of the world.”
       <br/>
       "A human being is part of the whole, called by us ‘Universe’; a part limited in time and space.  He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest – a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.  This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and affection for a few persons nearest us.  Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole nature in its beauty.  Nobody is able to achieve this completely but striving for such achievement is, in itself, a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.”
       <br/>
       15 minute video:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGJxoYPy4OI">
        "Carl Sagan on how Hindu culture is the basis for cosmic theories"
       </a>
       <br/>
       This truth seemed much more apparent in eastern religion than in western and Abrahamic religions. But alas, I did further research. I learned of the origins of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam and how very similar they were in expressions. I was still at first off-put by the patriarchal/hierarchical structure they seemed to impose on their followers, and by the fact that they have priests who act as middlemen between the regular person and the truth. I then considered that this was by design. A corruption of the truth, in order to control the flow of information. A conspiracy (duh!).
       <br/>
       I did some re-reading on Jesus' teachings and there was one quote that really stuck with me:
       <br/>
       Luke 17:21 - "The kingdom of God will not come with observable signs. 21Nor will people say, ‘Look, here it is,’ or ‘There it is.’ For you see, the kingdom of God is in your midst."
       <br/>
       This seemed to me like a direct reference to the holographic nature of the proton. Like DNA. The information of the whole being available at every point. All you have to do is look internally to seek the answers to the cosmos. And this new revelation (pardon the pun) of Jesus' teachings and the rest of the bible came with the discovery of the variety of ideas and philosophy that came to be known as Gnosticism. And that led me down to Knights Templar, Freemasonry, and... yeah that's a whole 'nother rabbit hole for another post.

        The Occult:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Magick -
       <br/>
       We can't exactly talk about the occult, and subsequently magick, without talking about Aleister Crowley. No matter your opinion on him, he really brought magick somewhat into the mainstream of modern day. Crowley defined Magick as: "The manifestation of ones will into reality", and, "magick is the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will." Crowley also wrote, "it is theoretically possible to cause in any object any change of which that object is capable by nature."
       <br/>
       I won't go too much into the obvious implications of magick on a physical level, because I believe
       <a href="/u/bradok">
        /u/bradok
       </a>
       did a very good concise breakdown of that in
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7xdss5/magick_and_the_occult/">
        their post the other day
       </a>
       , with some good links to go along with it.
       <br/>
       It's broad, and literally comes to classify things like normal gestures of conscious action as magick, but on a deeper level one has to wonder what Crowley knew about the true nature of reality. Yes, it's possible to move an object from A to B through physical means and call it magick, as it was in conformity with will... But what if one were to use conscious techniques that weren't merely applications of complex forms of consciousness (matter), but went directly back to the source?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Psychokinesis:
       </em>
       <br/>
       Theoretically, since one can project their own relative consciousness back up dimensional levels toward the universal source consciousness via techniques like astral projection and transcendental meditation, could one then change physical reality from there? One would suppose so if the will and intention is strong enough.
       <br/>
       There have been plenty of stories and reports of individuals being able to move things with their minds, and influence reality from afar. A lot tend to come from monks and shamans who claim to have practiced these techniques for years... And that's likely the secret! Of course a regular person like you or I wouldn't be able to use any sort of telekenetic/telepathic powers. We haven't practiced for long enough with the right knowledge of how it works and which techniques to use. Sure, we could take a stab in the dark and maybe get something out of it 1 in a few hundred times, but nothing significant. I'm reminded of that scene in Doctor Strange when Stephen just learns about magic:
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Stephen Strange: How do I get from here to there?
       <br/>
       The Ancient One: How did you get to reattach severed nerves and put a human spine back together bone by bone?
       <br/>
       Dr. Stephen Strange: Study and practice. Years of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crowley was no stranger to secret societies, such as the Order of the Golden Dawn, Ordo Templi Orientis. Secret societies are renowned for practicing and sharing gnostic teachings within their ranks. So besides regular physical manipulation of reality, and source manipulation of reality, what other methods could be possible?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Symbols &amp; Sigils:
       </em>
       Symbols represent fundamental conscious forces, mechanics, and laws of the universe. Spiritual and occult symbology may be the most "pure" or "true to nature" of symbols, but even symbols that are invented by man and then prescribed meanings can hold genuine weight to them so long as the intention that went into their creation and use was strong.
       <br/>
       Sociology after all is applied psychology, and psychology is applied biology, biology is applied chemistry, chemistry is applied physics, physics is applied mathematics, and all mathematics arises from geometry, which is what this universe is based in. On the most basic level, the very fabric of the universe is simply conscious energy acting through vectors of force. (see
       <a href="/r/Echerdex">
        /r/Echerdex
       </a>
       )
       <br/>
       If you create a symbol that naturally resonates with the fundamental mechanics of the universe then that symbols will generally interact with the world in the way of the mechanic that it naturally represents (for example:

       = self-support/strength/protection against evil). These symbols can however be co-opted, subverted, or inverted etc to change or oppose the original meaning (for example: the inverted pentagram, or the swastika). They always have impact - be it either immediately conscious, or subconscious - but generally the significance of its impact is governed by the strength of the intent in the symbols creation and use.
Furthermore, if one were to create a symbol for a specific use (let's take the infamous
       <a href="https://fiercetruthnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/pizzagate-pedophile-logos.jpg?w=482&amp;amp;h=450">
        "boy lover"
       </a>
       spiraling blue triangle symbol for example) then for it to have an impact the creators and users would have to always apply it and attribute it to that particular use. They'd draw it on the walls when performing the darkest acts of child abuse, and stick it everywhere they go like a graffiti tag, always thinking about and acknowledging the specific meaning every time they see it. And those who had been abused would also think about those same experiences later on when they see the symbol. It may not have an immediate conscious impact on those who don't know the symbols meaning, but it would have an eventual subconscious impact with prolonged exposure. Analysing it, you could attribute certain meanings to the shape and different aspects of it. The spiraling could represent fractality and recursion, like how the abused often become abusers themselves. The triangle can be representative of the all seeing eye. The blue can be representative of boys, as opposed to how pink is to girls. Whether these attributions are intentional, subconscious, or simply synchronistic, one can only speculate.
But all-in-all it just goes to show the power these symbols can have. So stay mindful when using and acknowledging symbols, and please manifest reality responsibly.

       Similar process, just a further application. It's all about intent, the strength of that intent, attribution of certain symbols together which carry their own meaning and so forth. It's more complex in mechanics, but often simpler in practice.

       Psilocybin, LSD, Ayahuasca, DMT... Isn't it funny how everyone tends to report the same feelings on these? Connecteness... Seeing past the veil at how it all really works...

       <br/>
       LSD has a very similar effect, albeit with it's own quirks and characteristics.
       <br/>

       Here's a 20 minute video with Dead Sea Scroll scholar John Allegro posing the theory that
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOu9tV6uy2E">
        Jesus Christ was a psychedelic mushroom.
       </a>
       Very interesting theory!
       <br/>
       DMT and Ayahuasca though... Now there's something that sends you back to the source. Ayahuasca has been used ceremonially for thousands of years in cultures all over the globe. Eaten, drunk, smoked, absorbed through the skin- whatever method is possible has been done at some point or another. But most of us are more familiar with the Shamans of South America.
       <a href="http://www.singingtotheplants.com/what-is-ayahuasca/">
        They take 2 different plants that are found miles apart from each other, sometimes adding other plants for a varying reasons, and put them together to make one of the most powerful natural psychedelic substances on Earth
       </a>
       . And who told them how to do this? They'll tell you that the trees told them, of course! People often report of a whole process of rebirth on Ayahuasca, along with a total cleansing of body and mind. A lot of people may throw up, shit themselves, cry their eyes out, feel like they die, then become a baby again, then a child, then make their way back to themselves in the end. I could really never do it justice, so here's a great documentary:
       <br/>

        DMT: The Spirit Molecule
       </a>
       <br/>
       And DMT, the pure, refined substance, is most often smoked. DMT users all report a very similar experience. the first toke you star seeing fractals, like LSD visuals, and the connection between things. The second toke and the barrier between you and your environment starts to dissolve. And the third toke... That's when most people report the "breakthrough". Like your own consciousness get shot up a tube across the universe and into another dimension of indescribable emotion and colour. And here's where most people even report talking to other beings. Aliens, reptiles, snakes...

       <strong>
        UFO Tech:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a ufo once. It was 2 years ago, almost to the day. 14th of February 2015. A set of three orange orbs of light forming an equilateral triangle (could have been a triangular craft, could have been three orbs in formation - it was to dark to tell if there was anything solid to it) came slowly over the sky, about ~100-200m high off the ground, toward my house as I was watching from my window. My phone was too far away for me to have gone and get it, got the camera out, and then get a decent video, so instead I kept my eyes locked on to observe as much as I could. It seemed to just be going straight really slowly, until the point when it was almost out of view over my house (I was practically leaning as far out my window at this point as I could) and it took off straight upward as fast as you imagine the Millennium Falcon jumping to light speed. That one event really nailed it in my head that UFOs are not only real, but they utilise a physics that mainstream science says doesn't exist.
       <br/>
       I've done plenty of research into the physics of UFOs and came across a couple videos that I know are great:
       <br/>
       <a href="https://youtu.be/CsagEYfxPgs">

        Zero Point - Classified Anti-Gravity Craft. Documentary by James Allen
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you ever heard of how Hollywood drip-feeds information? I can't remember where exactly i heard of it, but I had heard a theory a while ago about how some aliens pilot their craft through meditation and visualising where they wish to go. Well I saw Marvel's "Black Panther" the other day, and in one part the Wakandans are piloting their advanced craft exactly like that. I saw it and thought, "well... that's drip feeding if anything!" but I just can't remember where I originally saw it. Oh well. Thought I might as well share that anyway, since it's relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, alongside these I want to include a series of videos from an alien abductee who tells not only of alien bases on earth, but the UFO tech, and pre-birth memories of conscious existence before incarnation. He was able to remember these suppressed memories with thanks to hypnosis regression sessions with Budd Hopkins.

       That would be beautiful to see. If only it were so easy to condense, but if anyone can do that then I'd emplore them to do so! It's still missing some links into alternative history, astrology, psychology, and aliens that I'd have liked to put in there, and I'd have liked to have gone into more detail with pretty much all the topics as well (but mostly the ufos part), but that was the first time I'd ever gone and put so much of it all out in one post, and since I did it in one sitting it's no surprise I missed out plenty. It's effectively a theory of everything. But hey, since it's now there at least I have somewhere to start! I plan to one day put all this in a book so getting something solid actually written down is gonna help.

       I agree, I think the key is relating all these topics to how it affects the average individual on a regular daily basis. That’s all the modern consumer cares about sadly and a book is a good way into doing exactly that so I wish you well!

       Not measured, but calculated. It's all theoretical of course, but utilising geometry and the holographic principle, addressing the problem from a different angle, he's managed to simplify the equations.

       Yeah but my point is that any physicist who is working at the quantum level will hardly ever measure mass in terms of grams, they usually convert it into its equivalent form of energy. If the object is at rest in your reference frame then it’s just E = mc
       <sup>
        2.
       </sup>
       When measuring the mass of a proton, it is customary to use 938 MeV instead of 1.67*10
       <sup>
        -27
       </sup>
       kg. This doesn’t completely debunk him, but it makes me doubt exactly how much experience he has in theoretical physics.

       Thanks a fair point. If you read some of the papers he's published, he converts the units in accordance with the respective equations. I believe it's mostly presentation at the end, as having everything in the same units makes it easy for someone unfamiliar with quantum physics to understand.

       I’ll check him out more, I guess I’m kinda unqualified to make this statement since I’ve never read his work. But there are a lot of junk physics theories that work on bad math out there that you have to watch out for. And sadly it is virtually impossible for someone not versed in the math to be able to discern between what is legit and what isn’t.

       Yeah that's a totally relevant point. In this field there's a lot of people who make all sorts of claims but can't back it up with anything solid. It's why I suggest reading the papers that explain the theory with the maths to go along with it. And even for those who aren't great at maths, the text explains what the maths is showing.
       <br/>
       I was lucky that in the last few years of my schooling we covered quantum mechanics and particle physics pretty thoroughly, and it ended up being one of my favorite subjects so I continued studying it in my spare time since I left school. So I've got a pretty decent grasp on it. I'm definitely no expert, but I'm relatively confident of my understating, especially when the working is presented well.

       I am very skeptical of anything that makes such grandiose claims though. Currently physics doesn't know the answers to these cosmological questions, but neither does anyone else

       Well, there are a few ways to think about this. The mainstream has the notion of a

       However, a spherical unit of energy - field energy that is massive enough to keep itself gravitationally together has been hypothesized for a while - this is the 'mass without mass' concept of John Wheeler.

       Why are you equating the proton with the Planck volume? The proton is not an elementary particle, it is a mix of 3 quarks. And even then, elementary particles are not even real, they’re simply excited states of a universal quantum field.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not totally discounting everything you said, though. The entire universe is just a field of constantly fluctuating energy, so it is totally possible that consciousness is linked in some way to this. One document I read on the cia website stated that we are able to do those special things with our consciousness when we get the field surrounding our neurons into its rest state. Then you like merge with the universal consciousness, which is really just the combined rest state energies of the universe (the energy fluctuations that do NOT give particles). Don’t have the link handy atm, but I’ve seen it on this sub more than once so maybe someone could help out. It was about the Stargate program I believe, and outlined a lot of their findings from theoretical physics and consciousness experiments. It was listed as a disclosed document from the CIA, so it seems fairly legit. Interesting read. Also had something about someone remote viewing a civilization on Mars, way in the past. So anyways, apparently we’re able to access a universal consciousness through deep meditation and probably psychedelics.

       I am a major in Physics, and became sensitive for the paranormal a bit after my studies. Since then I am studying the aura and chi, and try to put it into scientific concepts. The major problem with science today is that it it does not like new ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       The model that I observe is that there are more dimensions. This is physically possible without any problems. The physical body is surrounded by an multidimensional aura. It works like a second body.
      </p>
      <p>
       The aura is observable as a flame-like body. What you are observing is the chi / life-energy flowing through the body. But if you follow the flow, it follows a line-structure. These lines are known in the yoga as nadis, but this repeats on all dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is connected with each other trough these lines/channels. At certain places they connect with each other and go through nodes, which act like ports to the next level of the aura.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each level of the aura goes deeper into a unity of consciousness. Be aware: there are many levels of this unity, and that can be confusing as the religions show us. The different levels connect unity all the way to our physical body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it is interesting that we see this same structure back in our body. Within our cells we have microtubules that control/guide processes in the cells, and communication between cells.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that these processes and communication can be disturbed with electromagnetic waves, when they are in resonance with it. But that is a whole other story on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
       On lower level we see that molecules are connected via electrons. And on the deepest known level the quarks are connected via gluons. There seem to be 2 more physical levels, but that needs some more research.
      </p>
      <p>
       The multidimensional network model, based on observations, connects consciousness and physics in one model. In this model we have some kind of free will, as we experience, and can consciousness influence the physical body as we can observe. Also can physical substances influence the psyche. It goes both ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       With this model, I can understand most psychiatric problems. Your consciousness can have problems on different levels of existence. I am now actively helping people with severe problems like psychosis and depression. I also get insight in how psychopaths work, and how we can help them and us with this disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       The multidimensional models can also explain all paranormal events that I know exist. Ghosts can move in and out of our physical observed dimension. Probably there are many more multidimensional creatures. We can influence (with enough training) the physical world that we connect with. I can heat something with my hands. There are also tricksters that try to pretend they can do these things, so it is best to learn it yourself via chi.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is also the problem with sceptics. They seem to be very afraid of the multidimensional aspect of this reality. I usually see that they have problems with some multidimensional beings that parasite on them and their thinking. And from this fear and problems they react aggressively towards these ideas. Tip: Just have an open mind, explore these ideas and find out for yourself.

       I meditated a lot few years ago and had some awesome experiences the coolest things imo was that I was experiencing soooo many synchronicities in my life and the people I thought about most, my best friend who I was really connected to on a mental level was having more dreams that were similar to mine, I'd bet I was affecting large scale events maybe even the past or some call it dimensional jumping by that meditation cuz I was focusing on big things. Everything was awesome till I got attacked really bad, found out later I been a targeted individual for a long time and my family's been harassed since childhood. (some other cool things were I could shape clouds, communicate with best friend telepathically, heal small pains, viewed my DNA being reshaped once lol not sure what to make of that but I'm learning)
      </p>
      <p>
       They torture me remotely with advanced tech whenever I meditate I think cuz it heals, enhances my mental power to create change quicker, could astral project, able to keep my mind more focused during sleep or not. During the time I was meditating I was really focused on particular things for a long time and did things that interested me or came naturally. I believe constant focus on things we want creates lot of change and it's why we're so distracted with media/symbols/false ideologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       They tried to make my life hard to alter my perception of reality but I'm trying to overcome their attempts by empowering myself, continuing to think, live and view life how I used to before I found out I'm a victim of covert/organized crime, there's a psychological effect when people keep thinking they're oppressed, divided (like fake racism or religious wars) or that there's no hope. In the end I think that's how we can all get through this it's mostly a spiritual war cuz their attempts are mostly psychological and every individual needs to focus more on their own consciousness, to be more assertive in their life instead of allowing others to manipulate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comparing my friend's psychedelic experiences with mine from meditation I found our beliefs, ancestor's beliefs and mindset at the time affects the experience. From living life as a highly psychic targeted individual I noticed my life change for the better when I'm neutral to their attacks. I was shown a virtual reality dream of being murdered that scared me a lot cuz I didn't know it was a dream but also made me fearless from dying so I just try to enjoy life now/heal and help others cuz I know fear is dumb, my body is temporary and the soul is infinite and I'm the master of my own reality so I try to create a reality I prefer, not one they want me to by fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like so many other comments I too believe shaping reality by how we perceive it is the most important conspiracy and the reason for distracting us all these years with certain occult symbols, sounds, movies, religious beliefs, wars, news, money, school indoctrination, anything to keep us from focusing on what is really beneficial for us and increasing our awareness.

       I've always had an interest in the occult. One technique that can me used is the production of an Egregore - a manifestation of the will of an individual or a group which is given a rudimentary intelligence and goes out into the world to achieve your aims:

       It’s interesting that this is the round table for this time. Everything is lining up. It is my true belief that people are waking up, that we will see how holographic our world truly is. I feel as though consciousness is a shared experience. Like if our world was created like how we dream up our dreams. But instead of one person, it’s everything coming together to make reality.

       Keep spreading the info. Wake the masses up exponentially! Today wake up 1 person, tomorrow you and them wake up 2, the next day 4, the next day 8, and so on and so on. These threads certainly help. I can see humans waking up en masse to the true nature of reality in a mere handful of years.

       I highly recommend reading the kybalion, the Ra Material (Law of One), and some study of Neoplatonic philosophy. I think the radio analogy of consciousness is helpful, we tune into the dimension we choose out of all the multitude of interdimensional frequencies available. Another analogy is the slideshow of dimensions we pass through that string together into a continuity of experience, when the slides don't line up we have a discontinuity of experience like the Mandela effect. You choose to tune into or put the next slide in, and there is limitless potential for what you may choose, you just may be choosing a reality in which you have less control or things are as whacky as I'm describing, and the moment you choose to accept that or open yourself to the possibility things begin to change.

       He spends a bunch of time analysing Rosslyn Chapel which is very very revealing from a practical and a historical perspective.

       When I came across that I'd already been following this guy for a while...

      </p>
      <p>
       Based on measurements he took from a ~3000BCish site in Scotland, he deduced a new value for Pi in terms of the square root of two which he called 'Qute'.
      </p>
      <p>
       After spending a crapload of time looking at this, I can confirm it's legit and indeed some of the obvious lessons to be found in Giza are to do with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Khafre the middle pyramid has a side-length of half the square root of 2 (707) which is a big clue.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you recall from the God Equation / Unit Circle that's also the point where the complex + real domains balance out....
      </p>
      <p>
       The layout of the whole site jives around sqrt(2) and sqrt(3), so whatever lesson is there is mathematical first and foremost.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are like, yeah but it's in feet.. but fail to realise that feet (and also the meter) were key'd to dimensions of the earth. 
How they got to that point, who knows, but it's pretty undisputable.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Arguably the foot spoken of is Gods foot.)
      </p>
      <p>
       On that front, for a really solid treatment on ancient metrology check out Taking Measure by Scott Onstott.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll also really like his series on youtube 'secrets in plain sight' and his lil coffee table book Quantification which talks a lot about the numbers you mention (i think they are all 3-smooth numbers personally - also known as the harmonic series)
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually I'd probably start with those last two and work back from there. He looks pretty hard at the sort of mind-blowing "coincidences" you mention.

       Oh and I can recommend taking a look at vedic mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is now mostly remembered as a system of mental shortcuts are actually the faint echos of a very complete understanding of that most special of number bases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using that you can perform operations on stupidly large numbers as strings of individual digits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about that...
      </p>
      <p>
       (I'd recommend the physics side of the vedic stuff too. both Tesla and Einstein credited the Vedic Sutras as a source of great inspiraton.

       I also want to apologize because I think I may have unintentionally made you feel 'lesser' by saying these Greek philosophers were 'lesser'. When I said that I'm not saying white males are 'lesser'. I'm just saying that the Greeks lived in a very limiting society where only Greek males opinions were valued. On top of that, they had to believe in the Greek gods. So for me, such restrictions generates a very narrow view of the world and does not produce the kind of foundation to identify truths and determine objective reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       This goes back to thought and how complex action really is. You have to widen your perspective because you cannot see what is really out there with such a narrow field.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the reason why objective reality is so hard to find is because we exist within the spectrum of objective and subjective realities. Even when we dream, the experience is not fully subjective because we are reacting to things we see and our bodies interpret. Did you know sound waves have impact on how the human brain functions? How about electromagnetic waves?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many things bombarding our cells every second of every day that adjust our perspective. That is why you can't base things on just what some Greek philosophers say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at epigentics. The nature versus nurture argument got redefined thanks to the idea that environment can literally alter gene function. These 'discoveries' were always there, but we never accessed them because we stuck in subjective loops and 'thought patterns' that led to inaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again I am sorry I was offensive. That was not my intention.

       The problem with simulation is this: if its true then there's absolutely nothing that would, could, or really needs to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is, in straight simulation, where we are someone's game pieces, very possibly as virtual as a million charge particles in tiny energy apartment blocks, there still is only one way to "break through" or "get free" or "realize who we are" that
       <em>

       hmm i guess i don't mean it exactly in that way--i still believe there is free will.  i'm just not sure about everything else.  it could be a bias though.  not sure why i expect "natural" things to be analog in nature rather than digital.

       So Wolfram (author of the mathematica franchise and the book "A New Kind of Science") suggests that because computing using binary Turing machines is so incredibly powerful, the universe itself must be a Turing Machine itself. Therefore he really pushes back against things like Godel's Uncertainty Principle, and Turing's Halting Problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually like Wolfram's ideas, but not that one. I cannot believe the universe can be computed by what we have now. It has to be something more like the holofractal ideas. Or the fuzzy logic which is now being instrumentalized with quantum and DNA computing, where the answers come back shades of grey instead of black and white. But the problem is logic - it's famously binary due to the Excluded Middle. There's nothing in between true and false. (Which is why "truthy" and "falsy" are so funny to us - those make perfect sense to me - but I've drank the koolaid on this one.

       Keep spreading the info. Wake the masses up exponentially! Today wake up 1 person, tomorrow you and them wake up 2, the next day 4, the next day 8, and so on and so on. These threads certainly help. I can see humans waking up en masse to the true nature of reality in a mere handful of years.

       Kurt Gödel would like a word with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolute statements in mathematics are only absolute within their own paradigm. IE they have to be absolute, in order for the system thereof derived to be functional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there is no logical proof that objective reality does not exist, because there can be no logical proof that anything does not exist. Russel's teapot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not think that, if there was no objective reality, it could not appear as if it was? That is, the existence of apparent absolutes is not inherently a proof of an objective reality, since if this is a subjective reality, it may appear as objective. How can you tell?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, this is based on the works of a bunch of old white men, so feel free to disregard it if it's too much.
