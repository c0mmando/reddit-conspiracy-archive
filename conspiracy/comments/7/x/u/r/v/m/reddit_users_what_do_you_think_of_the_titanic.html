    <div class="md"><p>But you said he only got paid for 4 buildings,  and that settlement was for 4 buildings, so your point about 7 buildings was not valid.  Building 7 was a separate transaction.  He also voluntarily gave up his rights to One World Trade (Freedom Tower) he was not forced to do so.  My guess is nobody cared to work with the dirtbag anymore on it, and Port Authority was ready to go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a friendly reminder:     </p>

<p>1) The right of the people to control their own money through congress is a <em>constitutional</em> right.      </p>

<p>2) The Federal Reserve is a <em>privately</em> owned bank.     </p>

<p>3) After the Financial Crisis, the Fed printed 4 <em>trillion</em> dollars, and showered it on Wall St. Neither the Fed, nor Wall St, needed to do anything to earn this money--as is always the case. They simply print free money and buy crap from Wall St. It&#39;s a circle jerk where nothing of value is created and they get rich by devaluing your money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you&#39;re just essentially printing money like that, it decreases the value of every other dollar in existence. It&#39;s analagous to stealing your money. This is the hidden tax of inflation. If unchecked, things get very bad very quickly. See: Zimbabwe, Venezuela, etc. When they decreased interest rates to almost zero for years, it made people much more willing to borrow money = more economic activity. Now, they have to try to steadily raise those rates back up to avoid more and more inflationary pressure, and when that happens, people will be less willing to borrow money = less economic activity = recession/crash on the horizon. It&#39;s a dangerous game they play, and most of the benefits go straight to the most wealthy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a total hoax.</p>

<p>There was no opposition to the Federal Reserve in April, 1912, because the Federal Reserve <em>had not even been proposed yet</em>! Woodrow Wilson was running on a platform that included reform to the monetary system, but he hadn&#39;t said exactly what, yet, and he wasn&#39;t even the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination in April.</p>

<p>Of course, Guggenheim, Straus, or Astor might have been against central banks in general, or maybe they were against Senator Aldrich&#39;s National Reserve plan. So I&#39;ve searched for evidence that Benjamin Guggenheim, Isidor Straus, or John Jacob Astor IV ever said <em>anything</em> about Wilson, a central bank, or Aldrich&#39;s National Reserve plan. What I found: nothing! Astor&#39;s great great grandfather was, however, one of the <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/second_bank_of_the_us">six major backers of the second Bank of the United States</a>,</p>

<p>You should also note that most opponents of Aldrich&#39;s plan were <em>for</em> the Federal Reserve plan and vice versa, because one was a Republican party plan and the other was a Democratic party plan.</p>

<p>A few years ago, some random guy on the Internet <em>made up</em> this story about these three being the main opposition to the Fed and that was why the Titanic was sunk. It&#39;s a fabricated story with no evidence at all.</p>

<p>Also, sinking a ship is a <em>stupid</em> way to try to kill somebody. There were lots of survivors, including 32% of male passengers in first class. It&#39;s well documented that both Straus and Guggenheim were offered places on life boats and turned them down!</p>

<p>This all happened post 9/11 which I do believe was an inside job but because so many believe this they are quick to think everything else is. Accidents so happen and very common and Titanic was an accident. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There weren&#39;t plates. The names were etched on the hull. They may have looked the same at a glance but they were very different and shared MANY staff and crew who would have known they were back on the same ship they&#39;d been working on for a year and not a brand new, different one the inside and out. </p>

<p>People aren&#39;t stupid. </p>

<p>It&#39;s complete bullshit. The numbers 401 are on the ship at the bottom of the ocean. The number 400 is still on the back of the Olympic fittings reused and found in hotels to this day. Changing the numbers on ever propellor blade and wooden panel on both ships when they were only together a short while? Nope.</p>

<p>I live in Belfast, I see the slipways every day of my life, Belfast people talk and someone would have talked. I have many friends whos grandparents and great grandparents worked in Harland and Wolff, I moved here from Scotland when I was 11 because my father was made general manager of ship repair there. It&#39;s an interesting story but complete and utter bullshit made up by some mad bastard to sell some books. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting video. They correctly identify the Rothschilds but then simply state the Rothschilds are servants of the Jesuits and the Pope.</p>

<p>What evidence is there the Zionists/Rothschilds are subservient to the Jesuits and/or the Pope? The Catholic Church has a long tradition of judeoskepticism (up until Vatican 2 and the <a href="http://www.tldm.org/news3/impostor.htm">Paul 6 switcheroo</a>).</p>

<p>I am genuinely intersted, I would be grateful if you could give me info on that. You are a prominent participant in this sub, I agree with most of your contributions here, except for this recurring theme of “Jesuits control the Zionists and therefore the world”. I subscribed and parsed r/RomeRules to explore this idea, but found no compelling evidence. So I would be grateful if you could point me in the right direction.</p>

<p>Everything I’ve seen so far seems to show it’s the other way around; the Rothschilds are <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12909-rothschild">“guardians of the Papal treasure”</a> and Loyola has long been suspected of being a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrano">Maranno.</a></p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How is it expensive if the ship was insured?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in <em>that many</em> coincidences which is why I come here.</p>

<p>If you look into it, they actually did a lot of simple things wrong. Not just the fact that they hit the iceberg. For example they were shooting off white flairs instead of red and had the band continue to play with all the cabin lights on so any nearby ships would think they&#39;re anchored and partying instead of sinking.</p>

<p>There are so many things that point to the fact that this was set up. Please look into it. You might be surprised to find it&#39;s not far fetched in the least.</p>

<p>I assume you don&#39;t think 9/11 was an inside job of any kind? Would have been way too expensive, right?</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if half the people in this sub now actually believe the official 9/11 story. It&#39;s taboo to be a conspiracy theorist in our own sub anymore..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking into this as one of my main hobbies for over twenty years.  </p>

<p>Flares - James Cameron did a dive a few years back that showed flares of all colors were fired in the end, not just white.  They were shooting anything that could be shot.  Now, there&#39;s been some back and forth about this, even from surviving officers from that night.  Odds are they were mostly white, which explains the discrepency.</p>

<p>As for the cabin lights, I have never heard of a policy that says when you are sinking, make sure the lights are off in every single cabin.  Also, how could the Californian tell that the band was on deck playing from miles away?  I can&#39;t hear my neighbor practicing his guitar two doors down.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s reverse a bit to your first point.  Yes, the ship was insured.  Underinsured.  They lost money on the ship sinking, not to mention money lost on cargo, mail, lawsuits, and a payment to Cunard Line for services rendered by Carpathia.</p>

<p>There may be a few things that make it look like a set up, but that&#39;s if you&#39;re looking to find that specific evidence.  There&#39;s far more that says this is honestly a long list of failures, which all would have been nothing more than inconveniences until they hit that iceberg.  This was an era when the rules were not super important.  Lifeboats?  Ugly, they clutter the deck.  Double hull?  That will slow the ship down and cut into passenger space.  Watertight bulkheads running the full height of the ship?  Again, passenger space.  Ice warnings?  Nope, put those aside and focus on our passenger&#39;s incoming and outgoing messages, we are White Star, and we put the passengers first.</p>

<p>I was recently on a Cunard cruise with a speaker who&#39;d been with the company for many years.  He said the only claim to fame White Star truly had was the promise that they could get their passengers to the bottom of the ocean the fastest.  They had an appalling safety record, even for the times.  Titanic was just their last major mess-up before the company would eventually be sold two decades later, then sold again and absorbed into Cunard.</p>

<p>Still stands in my mind that it would be a lot harder to build a ship for the express purpose of sinking it to off a few people, and then keep an entire shipyard, crew, and company quiet about it until they all went to their graves.  Seems like a lot of work to get rid of a few people.  It&#39;s an entertaining theory, but it doesn&#39;t stretch much past the theory stage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zionists swapped the Titanic with the Olympic and then sunk it so they could have their precious Federal Reserve. The “unsinkable” was sunk. They said the same thing about the WTCs, “No plane can destroy this whole building.”</p>

<p>What I’m curious about is if an iceberg actually did sink the Olympic.. Did the captain crash into it on purpose? Was there no iceberg and maybe a bomb or something somewhere? If it really is an orchestrated plot the sinking would probably have been planned as well.</p>

<p>What was supposed to happen was they were supposed to switch the ships to get the insurance money for the Olympic. Claiming it as the “titanic” the Californian ship was near by that was supposed to be the rescue ship all those people were not supposed to die. That ship was 12 miles off path so no one got rescued. However the ship did have 3,000+ cargos and blankets but not carrying any passengers (because it was intended for rescue)  not to mention under water years later and you can search it at any titanic museums the letters O and P appeared after so many years they had just covered it with the letters of titanic and paint. Multiple people bailed last minute after finding out it was switched. People claimed they were too sick but many eye witness claims it was the ship being switched. The port holes are different then the titanic and the swimming pool shape. There’s much more. It’s all in the link and any museum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking into this as one of my main hobbies for over twenty years.  </p>

<p>Flares - James Cameron did a dive a few years back that showed flares of all colors were fired in the end, not just white.  They were shooting anything that could be shot.  Now, there&#39;s been some back and forth about this, even from surviving officers from that night.  Odds are they were mostly white, which explains the discrepency.</p>

<p>As for the cabin lights, I have never heard of a policy that says when you are sinking, make sure the lights are off in every single cabin.  Also, how could the Californian tell that the band was on deck playing from miles away?  I can&#39;t hear my neighbor practicing his guitar two doors down.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s reverse a bit to your first point.  Yes, the ship was insured.  Underinsured.  They lost money on the ship sinking, not to mention money lost on cargo, mail, lawsuits, and a payment to Cunard Line for services rendered by Carpathia.</p>

<p>There may be a few things that make it look like a set up, but that&#39;s if you&#39;re looking to find that specific evidence.  There&#39;s far more that says this is honestly a long list of failures, which all would have been nothing more than inconveniences until they hit that iceberg.  This was an era when the rules were not super important.  Lifeboats?  Ugly, they clutter the deck.  Double hull?  That will slow the ship down and cut into passenger space.  Watertight bulkheads running the full height of the ship?  Again, passenger space.  Ice warnings?  Nope, put those aside and focus on our passenger&#39;s incoming and outgoing messages, we are White Star, and we put the passengers first.</p>

<p>I was recently on a Cunard cruise with a speaker who&#39;d been with the company for many years.  He said the only claim to fame White Star truly had was the promise that they could get their passengers to the bottom of the ocean the fastest.  They had an appalling safety record, even for the times.  Titanic was just their last major mess-up before the company would eventually be sold two decades later, then sold again and absorbed into Cunard.</p>

<p>Still stands in my mind that it would be a lot harder to build a ship for the express purpose of sinking it to off a few people, and then keep an entire shipyard, crew, and company quiet about it until they all went to their graves.  Seems like a lot of work to get rid of a few people.  It&#39;s an entertaining theory, but it doesn&#39;t stretch much past the theory stage.</p>
