       And to add on to this... we don't know word for word what the bail bondsman said to the agent at the time, what his inflection was, or if he was dismissive about it. He's of course going to say he was passionate about it all now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not necessarily saying this guy WAS dismissive or he decided he didn't want to get involved. There was hard evidence and the FBI could've done something about it on their own. But, let's keep in mind we don't completely know what went on behind the scenes prior to the event.

       I just watched Alex Jones and Roger Stone complain ... “why wasn’t he interrogated? Why wasn’t he surveilled? He was a clear domestic terrorist! Etc.”
      </p>
      <p>
       So this is probably the idea behind this ... not gun grab (impossible to do in the USA) ... but getting more conservatives on board an increased surveillance / repression program by the State.
      </p>
      <p>
       They already got many of them on board with the militarization of police, using Trump and the fake BLM dialectic ... “oh you’re against the paramilitary force we call the police? That means you support the black-supremacist thugs!”
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly they got many of the anti-war leftists to support the most warmongering president in the history of the US (Obama).

       It's not like the FBI has the whereabouts on every single person that makes a YouTube comment. Also there are laws that prevent the FBI from using certain methods to try and find someone unless they get a court ordered warrant providing enough proof. Believe it or not people make a lot of threats on social media platforms in joking or serious matters, and when they looked into this it was just a single statement that was reported in Mississippi with only a username that happened to be his actual name. So even after searching regular databases they couldn't find out what state he was from or who he was. There's also a thing called free speech. It's in the constitution you can say whatever the hell you want unless it's a credible threat with enough evidence to go after, but how can you tell if it's a joke or not?

      <p>
       He didn’t make a direct threat against a specific individual. He made a general statement.

       They can’t arrest him for precrime and they can’t have an agent tale him in perpetuity. They can’t force him to get psychiatric evaluation. They can’t take away his access to firearms.

       I get that, but googles not turning over his info assuming it’s even real without a warrant. They found the guy reporting it because he was engaging in willful communication with the FBI, all they had to do was ask “hey can we send someone out to you?”

       Nicholas and it’s variations is a common name, Cruz is a common surname. Realistically how many of these dumbass comments get made per day across the entire internet? It’s probably 1,000s.

       There’s no reason to tear down heaven and hell to find 1 commenter out of what is 100s or 1000s of similarly stupid shit that gets said online everyday when there’s no recourse even if you find him.

       You think there’s only 11 people with a similar name? We know for certain what his name is now. Doesn’t his handle have Macrov in it too? How the fuck is the FBI supposed to know that’s his full real name based off a single YouTube comment.

       I understand it’s collected, but the argument as to why that’s awful is based on the assumption that the data can and will eventually be used against us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don’t live in a police state yet, not even close. But the FBI taking information obtained by the NSA without a warrant and making stops at everyone’s house that made a threatening comment on the Internet is a good start towards precrime and the
       <em>
        complete
       </em>
       destruction of our civil liberties.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean with this logic, why stop at just this Cruz kid? I’m sure they get plenty of other threat tips and since there’s no way to know which will ultimately prove prescient why not track down every asshole online?
      </p>
      <p>
       So he’s a conspiracy user that to push a specific conspiracy wants the FBI to just go full minority report, which I’m sure he’s very against in any other scenario.

       The release highlights an instance where one idiot disclosed a direct threat and included where and when it would happen. Unsurprisingly, the FBI went to that location prior to the time and was able to make an arrest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cruz made a threat with no information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI got the You Tube tip and conducted database searches and couldn’t locate the kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       What’s more believable, the IC groomed this kid for over a year to murder 17 children? Or the vague threat got overshadowed by the 1,300 threat responses that happen every day for the FBI?
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn’t not follow up on it. They interviewed the man that contacted them. If this was some secret elaborate plot why wouldn’t they kill the guy who reported the tip? No loose ends right and if they’re A-ok with plotting the murder of 17 kids, well what’s one more random bail bondsman as collateral damage? This sub points out suspicious suicides all the time. If they didn’t want their plot busted they would’ve suicided the guy making the tip and then eliminated all evidence of said tip.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s patently unbelievable that they would groom a kid to murder 17 other kids, but then leave such an obvious loose end walking around with a story to tell.

       Oh no. I don’t think there’s a conspiracy or anything. Just frustrated that they don’t do better at preventing things with all the invasive tech they’ve established. Make security theater actually work I guess.

      <p>
       The conspiracy here would be just to keep people fighting about gun control and mental health versus actually having a dialogue That could affect some change.

       I agree on your point about invasive tech, but I actually think the fact they didn’t use illegal methods of tracking this kid down to precrime him is indicative that we don’t live in the police state we fear. At least not yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean in an alternate reality where the FBI tracks this kid down using our warrantless spying apparatus and puts him on a watch list or arrests him, I could see people here doing posts that we now live in a real world version of Minority Report and we now live in a police state and how unacceptable that is.

       Oh I mean it would be effective if they completely unleashed it, which I think is the fear really. Now does the fear modify behavior yet? Probably not, but if the my made a few examples out of people maybe it would. So yeah, I guess it would be like the Panopticon if they were to make a show of its power and people modified behavior as a result.

       I’m going off of the Panopticon idea though, you don’t actually need a horde of scanner darkly people, you just need to make enough examples of people that the rest of the populace modifies their behavior because in the back of their mind they’re thinking “shit, those guys all got precrimed, I better not step out of line at all.”

       They took the time to go to Hattiesburg because the guy who emailed the FBI gave them his information to contact him and visit him at his office. So you are misconstruing what's happened to what should have happened.

       How would they know he was living in Florida? They couldn't get any location information. You seem to take facts known now and make it seem that a comment from YouTube can be traced quickly and easily to the person sending it. This kid wasn't even living in Miami he was living around the Fort Lauderdale area. Using a real name doesn't immediately show exactly where the person is from with an address. I'm sure there's other people named Nikolas Cruz in the US. There's a billion active users on YouTube as well. I mean your expecting the FBI to find and follow up on every YouTube comment that is a threat being reported to them? I'd like to see that, but even if they found him they can't just arrest him to prevent him from doing an attack 5 months later. What are they gonna do charge him with a felony for making a threat and adjudicate him guilty in less than 5 months to prevent him from buying an AR-15 to carry out a mass shooting? I mean come on that's a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find out how many people are named Nikolas Cruz in the US, and then follow up on every single person to figure out where that single YouTube comment came from to prevent that person from carrying out an attack 5 months later. Yep makes sense!

       You know how many people come up in a search for "Nikolas cruz"?  11
      </p>
      <p>
       Eleven people in the whole fucking country.  He also used his Google+ account.  Any one of us probbaly could have found this kid on 30 minutes frankly. No one says they arrest him, but the cop out of "we didn't know how to find the kid" after taking the time and resources to send agent to Mississippi is unacceptable and suspicious.   Don't be naive.

       What did you use to search for that to come up with 11 names only? Show the proof. Naive? Really...I just find it funny that you think a comment on YouTube will instantly prevent a mass shooting. Dude even if agents found him what will be done? He didn't threaten to shoot up a specific school, and he could easily deny that he would do it. Also cops were always involved with him so maybe cops could have done more, but still it's not enough to lock someone up to prevent them from doing what they want. This is America. Shit will happen regardless and then only after people will say why couldn't this happen or that happen.

       Just trying to play a little devil's advocate here. But do you think that a troubled kid who may be planning a shooting, would maybe not follow through after being questioned by the FBI? It's a pretty intimatating thing to happen to someone. Especially somebody crazy? I don't know. No ill from my end, just asking questions.

       Perhaps, but if his point of view was that he didn't have anything to live for maybe he would find it exhilarating. News today was another tip with all kinds of info about him were given to the FBI yet they failed to follow up in Jan so the first time wasn't a big deal, but the second time should have been a huge red flag. That right there means that the FBI did fail, but if he's had 39 visits from police officers I think he's beyond that point of caring if the FBI was knocking on his door. He would have probably threatened them in some way as well after talking.

       Are you going to show me what site you used to find out how many Nikolas Cruz's live in the USA? I'm just interested in seeing what you used to find that number, but more importantly does it even show Nikolas Jacob Cruz's information in that list of 11 people "in the whole fucking country" ....guess you can't respond because it doesn't right?

       A guy I know from way back in highschool posted on FB something that came off as a vague threat at police. FBI showed up at his place of work, and someone else's place who made a joke in the comments, within an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that youtube is not facebook. But i agree. The FBI could probably have cross checked his name to his instagram and confirmed that it might be a real threat fairly quickly and easily.

       Being a psycho or mentally ill isn't a crime though. What felony crimes did he commit before the shooting to prevent him from buying a gun? Seriously people in Florida can buy guns at age 18 without a felony conviction so even if the FBI knew him what are they gonna do?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you are saying that the dossier was the only evidence the FBI used for a FISA warrant that's laughable. FISA warrants need more than just a single piece of evidence and they need to renew it every 90 days providing evidence throughout. It's not just a bullshit way of going to a judge and saying this dossier is all we have on the trump campaign we need the warrant now since that's all we have. Lol it doesn't work like that. If it did then that's hilarious! Good one!

       It wouldn't be too much too much to go knock on the guy's door and ask him what's going on.  The police do 'welfare checks' all the time.  Your right though, that still might not have changed anything though unless the guy was doing something illegal at the time or had some illegal shit laying out in plain sight.

       the FBI is not competent enough to handle the complexity of an mk ultra asset. they are just there to muddy the investigation, same thing they always do.

       There must be something to this, because the "No, couldn't be!" debunker-wannabes are out in force here. Whenever there's such adamant, coordinated pushback, you know there's something to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, seriously, how obvious is this? The FBI interviews the guy who warns about the shooter to be, but not the shooter? How is that not an obvious Red Flag for everybody?

       Not sure that theory holds water. Could it be, perhaps, many people just don't believe there isn't anything more to this than a single shooter?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't have it both ways... if no one says anything it's a false flag. Too many people, it's a false flag. Just sayin'

       This is probably “out there” but I think this is how they find subjects for mkultra. They look for someone that is already capable of doing something, then push them to actually go through with it. I don’t necessarily believe this is what happened, but I wouldn’t be surprised
