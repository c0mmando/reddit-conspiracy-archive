        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So the conspiracy here is that a UNC Professor was on the Antifa side of the Charlottesville protests, and he admitted on social media to being armed and chasing down James Fields in his car right before Fields crashed into the crowd, leaving the 1 girl dead who suffered a heart attack:</p>

<p>I guess nothing was ever done about this, so some guys went to ask him about it on camera:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/kcFfz7TtPog">https://youtu.be/kcFfz7TtPog</a></p>

<p>Posted 3 days ago, low views. Anyhow, if this guy had his rifle aimed at Fields and chased him down with it, doesn&#39;t that make him guilty since he already admitted to as much on social media?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s just not how the legal system works. Someone doing something doesn’t give you license to do something else. Especially not if it’s a civil violation (cause for a lawsuit). </p>

<p>Lawsuits: can only be filed if you suffer harm to redress same. What harm did the driver suffer as a result of seeing a guy with a gun? He drove away under his own volition so any harm he did suffer is his own fault and being found criminally liable for an act is not a harm you can recover for. </p>

<p>You win a case in 4 ways none of which apply at the moment. </p>

<p>1) plaintiff hasn’t proven a primary facie case (we’d need to wait for trial to reach this determination)</p>

<p>2/3) defendant has absolute or qualified immunity (he isn’t a government official acting in their official capacity so clearly doesn’t apply) </p>

<p>4) defendant proves an affirmative defense. I.e.:</p>

<p>Self defense: you can only respond to a perceived threat with the minimum force required to end the situation. Someone with a gun doesn’t mean you can drive into a crowd of people. You could maybe run them over, but even that’s a stretch. You’d more than likely be expected to drive away from everyone, now down an alley etc. putting at others at risk. </p>

<p>Duress: would allow some leeway, but the other person has to be shown to be forcing you to do something. Someone walking around with a gun isn’t the same as them forcing you to drive into a crowd of people. </p>

<p>See you are spinning it the sauna defense counsel would in a law suit. The other side will say, &quot;Someone threatening to kill you with a rifle, will cause unforseen circumstances to happen as a result of the utter fear the driver faced.&quot;</p>

<p>Now which one is true is the question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What are you even talking about?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a valid legal defense. I just told you the two things he could claim that would get him off and neither works in this situation. </p>

<p>You can use deadly force to defend yourself against a deadly threat but that doesn&#39;t apply to someone other than who is threatening you and it truly has to be a deadly threat. Someone walking around with a rifle does not qualify unless they&#39;re actually threaenting you. </p>

<p>Duress only applies to a specific act you are threatened into doing, just because you feel generally threatened doesn&#39;t mean you can do whatever you want. For duress to be claimed you also can&#39;t be involved in creating the situation. Driving through a crowd kinda negates that claim. </p>

<p>Good question. Perhaps a source that shows that ONLY the way you have laid it out, is how it would go in a trial/law suit.</p>

<p>I completely disagree of course. Everything you have laid out, my lawyer bud has used unimaginable angles to get reasonable doubt. I am 99% sure when he e-mails back, that he would use the threats/chase/rifle pointed at him to get reasonable doubt, to bring in psychologists/Neurologists showing how the brain/emotions/choice making is skewed and changed under such conditions including the physiological change based on adrenaline, fear, etc, because he&#39;s used this before in another case.</p>
