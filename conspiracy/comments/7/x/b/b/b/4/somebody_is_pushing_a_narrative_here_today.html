      <p>
       Have you ever seen a more civil discussion on Pizzagate?  It's almost as if the thread is designed to be debunked by a team or coordinated effort seeking to look level-headed and reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we have the repeating Abramovic posts, with comments proclaiming her innocence and disbelief this poor 71-yr old woman is being scrutinized.  Kinda odd Abramovic is getting any press at all.  You'd think they want to hide her.
      </p>

       Just an observation on some things that caught my attention.

       I never said the collage was well made or even correct, just implied that it was set up to be dismissed. I'm glad for disinformation to be addressed, that was just too easy and could very well be used as evidence to dismiss the subject altogether.

       The infographic is what tipped me off.  Like... could one assemble a worse collection of "facts" or circumstantial evidence surround p-gate?
      </p>
      <p>
       I was sorta giving each piece of info during p-gate a 1-10.  10 being absolutely damning, 1 being useless fluff.  The infographic is a collection of 1s, 2s, and 3s.

       Yeah it's pretty weird...  I'm trying to be genuine, respectful, and grounded.  I think that you catch more flies with honey than vinegar and I think that the useful idiots over at tmor likely respond positively to my attitude.  I'm not trying to promote anything but the truth.  Right now, I don't know if pizzagate is real or not, but I do know that there's a lot of evidence and a lot of things that should be explained.
      </p>
      <p>
       Biggest thing I want is a COMPLETE mapping of the DC tunnels as well as a forensic analysis of the portions and entrances near the Pegasus Museum and other suspicious locations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that it was somehow easier for JA to get Megyn Kelley to give him a softball interview in which he's just declared 100% innocent without addressing any of the facts than it was for him to just open Buck's basement for tours and/or open the Pegasus Museum for tours is astounding.  It's very suspicious that the news media rallied around and proclaimed the whole thing debunked before any real investigation took place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would have probably completely dropped the whole thing after a couple months if they got on the TV and said "Yo yo yo calm yo tits, angry mob.  The police are evaluating the whole thing and doing the best they can.  Please don't be vigilantes.  We don't know the facts of the situation."  Instead they vehemently denied and it was frustrating to see the mountains of evidence debunked by their word!

       I don't think you get what I'm trying to say. Shills purposely created an easily debunkable Pizzagate info-graphic; that way, the shills can comment in their own threads in debunk Pizzagate.

       Pizzagate is not a cover-up for pedogate.

       Why aren't similar things happening in The_Donald which has far more subs and viewers? If it is a gaslight why aren't they gaslighting the far more popular T_D as well?

       Aren't they doing such in t_d? I don't go in there, but I have seen plenty of gaslighting posts in CBTS_stream. There were even a couple classics here the last week or so saying Kim Moore's art was hanging in CPP.

       I see them posting conspiracy theories all the time and referencing Pizzagate in every one. I saw tons of threads about Pizzagate before the Reddit admins cracked down on it in every sub.

       Sorry I read your original comment too fast. If David Brock Media Matter shills really do lurk this sub and the_donald, I think they would have a much easier time blending in on r/conspiracy. T_D is just an echo chamber, so obviously you're not going to see many shills commenting without getting banned from the sub. You're really going to stand out trying to debunk Pizzagate in T_D, so your argument doesn't really hold up.
      </p>
      <p>
       r/conspiracy isn't a circlejerk like T_D, it would be much easier to infiltrate. I mean, didn't a Voat Pizzagate mod just get outed for being friends with James Alefantis on Instagram?

       That I don't know, I don't go to voat what little time I spent there was unpleasant and showed me why I prefer at least a tiny amount of moderation.

       That said, if a person was following Pizzagate wouldn't following Alefantis on Instagram be one way to keep track?

       I think that there's definitely people who get on reddit and shill one way or the other...  I'm not a shill.  If you think the infographics are easily debunkable, that's fair.  I didn't think so.  And despite someone's best efforts, I'm not convinced they are debunked.  I'm still looking into his debunking, but this whole thing blew up a bit so I've been distracted with a bunch of angry PMs calling me a shill and telling me to die and shit...

       I posted a large info dump of research material from early on in the pizzagate investigation in reply to one of OPs comments, in case there was anything in it he hadn't seen before and wanted to look over. It subsequently got downvoted into oblivion.
       <br/>
       Admittedly, I think my comments got singled out for downvotes because in my first comment in the thread I said that I didn't trust the user "pizzagate_researcher" because his comments tend to always dismiss pizzagate and use dismissive language, rather than objectively analysing it or even entertaining the idea. I recognise it's an ad homenim when used in a debate and I that do have a slight bias against people who don't entertain both sides, but it was my opinion and I thought I'd share it.

       Noticed that as well, highly suspicious to say the least.  Why anyone would ever take the time in an attempt to make her appear anything but a revolting creature with elite ties eludes me.  At minimum it's a good distraction.

       So let me get this straight - it's not the three or so posts all at once that are negative about Abramovic that are suspicious - it's that anyone would take the time to "defend" her? Lol

       and I said that it's funny that you think it's the people defending her who are the suspicious ones -i.e. the ones trying to "get ahead"-  and not the totally "organic" three or so negative posts about Abramovic that got posted here today.

       I don't find it the slightest bit suspicious that there would be posts in r/conspiracy about the Guardian article that want to talk about her obvious ties to a conspiracy that has been talked about at length for nearly 2 years. I do think it is suspicious that there are (including yourself) immediately running to defend the witch and her "art".

       I can confirm that I am not a shill...  I'm polite in my discourse and I do appreciate people trying to debunk the shit I posted.  I'm just trying to generate a healthy discussion and that definitely involves people who are decidedly against pizzagate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to be polite, anyway.  Regardless, I'm not in on the game, if there's some coordinated debunking effort...  There definitely is evidence that there is a coordinated effort to debunk pizzagate, but even if they are being paid, I appreciate them actually putting together arguments and evidence, rather than what they did all last year and just ridicule and deny and claim it's all been "completely debunked" despite never actually addressing it.

      <p>
       And what is that evidence? I've been called a paid shill, a paedophile, and even been accused of being Alefantis's boyfriend simply for pointing out the weakenss of the pizzagate case, but I've never been paid to post, I've never coordinated my posts with anyone else, and I've certainly never met Alefnatis (or Podesta or any of the others). Is it so hard to conceive that there are people who require a much higher standard of evidence than has been presented? Why are you not simialrly charging that there has been a coordinated effort to promote pizzagate (what with the creation of a pizzagate sub here and at voat, the psoting of numerous Youtube videos, and the organisation of protests in Washington)? Why is that unremarkable but when a few people post rebuttals to the pizzagate narrative it's suddenly some conspiracy in itself?

       You can totally post arguments against pizzagate, I'd be fine with that, but you can't acknowledge that you've seen evidence while feigning that you need help finding it.  It doesn't lend much to your credibility.

       Regardless of what you think about pizzagate, FUCK ambrovavich!  Someone who is a self-avowed Satanist whose idea of a good time is mock cannibalism (or real cannibalism?) CAN NEVER be considered a sweet old lady.

       You don't have to be a religious person to recognize that some people are religious and their religion is like serving the dark lord...  Like imagine if someone was convinced Voldemort were real and they openly praise him and pledge to do his bidding, you don't have to agree that Voldemort is real to know that that person is up to no good.

       because theres accounts in here and the other thread saying thanks for posting and nothing else, yet the tone of each thread is different.
      </p>
      <p>
       It almost seems like someones just flooding new accounts into conspiracy to fvck with everyones minds here. Especially, considering the new rul concerning no comments/posts from under 3 month old accounts, and yet alot of the accounts have very very little activity any where else or are accounts that have about a year or more age to them but with little activity at all. But very specifically have conspiracy activity.

       I did a lot of studying on Abromovic right before the elections when pgate was in full force. Interestingly her brother (I think her brother... if not, it was a relative) is heavily invested into studying Nikola Tesla. He has written many things about his life etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure why I thought this was significant at the time... I found it very interesting though. I think my interest spurred from curiosity of if his sister, Maria, had the same interest in Tesla.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think I was trying to figure out if Tesla's findings could somehow be related to Maria's beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a fan of Tesla, I don't want or try to connect him to Satanism. I just feel that it could be significant that the Abromovics, Maria and her brother, are interested in two subjects that are shrouded in mystery and controversy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't find any significant connections at the time, but I just wanted to mention it.

       Interesting point. I have listened to this interview a few times, but never really related it to occultism etc in that way. It is interesting that he mentions Lucifer. I didnt remember that. Tesla was a smart mofo, weird that he mention this. I wonder what he meant by this... I wonder if there is more to it, like why he thinks this...

       And its not even reddit. Changing people's mind is damn near impossible. I've found that only the individual can change their mind when they are ready.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a fight or flight response, and on the internet you'll see someone try and fight back with words or never show up again. 
But for someone to change their mind during an internet argument? Might as well take a shit in a river and wait for it to turn into a calculus textbook.

       I don’t know if people don’t change their I’ve changed my mind when presented with new evidence. I think it depends on how passionate or involved you are about a topic. If it something that you care about a lot then it’s harder to accept a different perspective

       I posted this on a previous thread. Kinda fucked up shit,
I started researching some of Aleister Crowley's books because of your information and it's very dark. I came across a ritual called the "Mass of the Phoenix". So how it's performed is basically a wafer made from meal, honey, olive oil, Oil of Abramelin and blood/bodily fluids. It's stated in his book about what blood to use. Reminds me of spirit cooking with Marina Abramovic.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The best blood is of the moon, monthly: then the fresh blood of a child, or dropping from the host of heaven: then of enemies; then of the priest or of the worshippers: last of some beast, no matter what. (AL.III.23-4)"
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, so I decided to do a youtube search on "Mass of the Phoenix". I found a disturbing result. A mom and a young girl performing the ritual together. The other videos they posted are kind of weird, almost like the mom is showing off the little girl for who knows what.

       maybe i peaced-out too early in that thread, but i thought the point of the post was to show evidence that pizzagate was legit. i thought it was trying to show the connection between the child-smuggling from Haiti to the US, while also showing that the children's charities doing work there were full of pedophiles having orgies with underage prostitutes.

       Pedophilia exists. Child abuse, child smuggling, underage prostitution, all exist. All of the above being coordinated by a group of democrats out of a pizza parlor? No, not even close.

       That's the interesting part to all of this. 
There is plenty of evidence out there to support the theory that there's an international ring of child trafficking pedophiles - that at the very least is frequented by high profile politicians, celebrities and law enforcement.

       But then it gets wrapped up into a Pizza Parlour, with a lot of odd circumstantial evidence and a lot of red herrings, and now people bicker back and forth only about the Pizza place stuff while ignoring everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point goes to the elite for dividing the Conspiracy subculture and making everybody chase phantoms and their own tails.

        Kinda odd Abramovic is getting any press at all. You'd think they want to hide her.

       Seriously? She's pretty much the most famous contemporary artist, and is quite a star fucker. She's all about the press.

       It's probably because the artist (Kehinde Wiley) who painted that bizarre official portait of Barrack Obama has been linked to Marina Abramovic.

       Weird. Why are they attacking pizzagate again right now? What are they scared of all of a sudden? It almost gives me hope that something is actually going to happen finally.

       I know a couple of girls in their 20s who claim they religiously follow Wicca, do rituals and have alters with baphomets and hanging pentagram tapestries ECT ECT. They are the sort of people who would actually worship and appreciate the work of abramovic. We live in a world where everyone is able to practice what they want and unfortunately for a lot of young women, abromavic is portrayed as their Tumblr edgy role model. It really doesn't surprise me that she's not hidden away.

       I was going to bite my tongue and not comment but those girls are morons. Wiccans honor the Goddess and the Green God.They worship the Earth and nature. Pentacles are used to represent the 4 elements and Spirit. Baphomet and pentagrams have nothing to do with Wicca, they are practicing a bastardized version closer to Satanism. Just my 2 cents.

       There has been a coordinated, full-spectrum propaganda and action push across America in the past few days. The shills are out in force all over social media and Reddit, there's another big school shooting, the military is ramping it up against Syria and the Russians. Today we've got a New Yorker story about Trump's affair with a Playboy playmate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of wheels in motion. Can't tell if it's a desperate last Hail Mary play or the bad guys are back on top for sure.

       But that Pizzagate post is a total disgrace, from the initial "info graphic" to the enormous engagement from people who are there to cheer on the debunking. Very concerned about what's going on in this sub. :-(
