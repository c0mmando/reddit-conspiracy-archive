You know self proclaimed socialists like bill gates/warren buffett that donate to palestine loving dems could give up the wealth they are hoarding but they dont.  Keep blaming Israel.

<p>Actually, we&#39;ve been told over and over that Trump and his supporters are anti-semitic, when it&#39;s plain to see it&#39;s his opponents who exhibit such thoughts and behaviors more than anyone else.</p>

<p>This was just another obvious use of the tactic: accuse your opponent of doing what you yourself have done.</p>

<p>So, yes... what else did they lie to you about? What else have they done that they accused Trump of doing? ;-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You conveniently avoid all of the voting here. You avoid facts to continue your delusion. That&#39;s your problem.</p>

<p>Just take a quick look through the official BDS Movement twitter account and tell me: does this look more like a conservative cause or a liberal cause? Be honest.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bdsmovement">https://twitter.com/bdsmovement</a></p>

<p>The current far-right Indian and Israeli governments share a common political vision of repression, exclusion and and a blatant disregard for human rights. @narendramodi not welcome in Palestine. #ModiPalestineVisit</p>

<p>That&#39;s just one example. They explicitly state their beliefs of right-wing politics. They don&#39;t like it, you dope. They also post all kinds of Black Lives Matter stuff. So, again, you&#39;re just delusional if you think this anti-Israel stuff is coming from Trump supporters.

    <div class="md"><p>Though third party, Jill didn&#39;t. We have to get away from the two party system. </p>

<p>&quot;US Green Party presidential candidate Dr. Jill Stein says she would end all military aid to Israel and has recently called the Israeli government &quot;very oppressive.&quot;</p>

<p>In an interview with Newsweek published Friday, Stein said that as an American Jew she has a relationship with Israel, but called that relationship &quot;ethical&quot; and blasted right-wing donors such as Sheldon Adelson who &quot;contributes a huge amount of money to [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu.&quot; She said that if she were an Israeli citizen she would be &quot;up in arms about it.&quot;</p>

<p>When asked about military aid to Israel, Stein responded she would end all military funding, adding that, &quot;This would be decisively against our common values, to support apartheid, to support home demolitions, to support occupation, to support violations of international law.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://m.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Green-Party-presidential-candidate-Stein-End-military-aid-to-apartheid-Israel-463555">http://m.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Green-Party-presidential-candidate-Stein-End-military-aid-to-apartheid-Israel-463555</a></p>

<p>The Green Party presidential candidate, Dr. Jill Stein, on Monday released a statement in support of the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement.</p>

<p>“The United States has encouraged the worst tendencies of the Israeli government as it pursues policies of occupation, apartheid, assassination, illegal settlements, demolitions, blockades, building of nuclear bombs, indefinite detention, collective punishment, and defiance of international law,” the Stein campaign said in a statement quoted by the Jewish Insider website.</p>

<p>“Therefore, the Stein campaign calls for ending military and economic support for the Israeli government.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/epa-grant-flint-water/">https://www.snopes.com/epa-grant-flint-water/</a></p>

<p>The $100 million grant was funded by the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016, or WIIN, which was signed by President Obama in December 2016:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Barack Obama [has] signed a bill authorizing water projects across the country, including $170 million to address lead in the drinking water in Flint, Michigan, and $558 million to provide relief to drought-stricken California.</p>

<p>Obama said the bill advances vital projects across the country to restore watersheds, improve flood control and rebuild water infrastructure — including pipes in Flint, where residents have struggled with lead-tainted water for more than two years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although this legislation carried President Obama’s name, the EPA did not officially award the grant to Michigan until March 2017, by which time President Donald Trump was in office. As such, it was technically correct to say that “Trump’s EPA” awarded the grant money, although the funding for that grant was originally provided for under legislation signed by President Obama just before he left office:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has awarded a $100-million grant to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to fund drinking water infrastructure upgrades in Flint, funding that had been approved by Congress and former President Barack Obama late [in 2016].</p>

<p>Provided by the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016, the funds awarded Friday, March 17, are designed to allow the city to accelerate work to replace lead service lines and make other infrastructure improvements, including upgrades to Flint’s water treatment plant. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Crediting President Trump for this $100 million water infrastructure grant was touted as hypocritical by some critics since his 2017 blueprint budget contained several major cuts to the EPA’s funding, but the blueprint maintains that the proposed budget “provides robust funding for critical drinking and wastewater infrastructure” and that “these funding levels further the President’s ongoing commitment to infrastructure repair and replacement and would allow States, municipalities, and private entities to continue to finance high priority infrastructure investments that protect human health.”</p>

<p>The EPA itself noted that President Trump’s budget blueprint would not cut the EPA’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The WIIN funding supplements EPA’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF), a federal-state partnership. In addition to the federal funds announced today, the State of Michigan is providing the required 20% match of $20 million. Over the years, EPA has provided more than $32.5 billion to states for infrastructure upgrades through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.</p>

<p>Under President Trump’s budget blueprint SRF remains fully funded, and the proposal provides robust funding for the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program to finance critical drinking and wastewater infrastructure.</p>

<p>Both Democrats and Republicans let their religious beliefs shape their policymaking, because religion shapes our moral beliefs. This is undeniable.</p>

<p>Can you tell me how long it took for us as a country to get to that point? Protip, it was less than 10 years ago lol dont play stupid</p>

<p>They don&#39;t, but it would be imposing christian values and ideals onto non christians, which is what makes you so averse to sharia law right? I don&#39;t want Christians to be writing laws because it goes against their christian values. Thats just as bullshit as whatever future you think is going to happen by allowing muslims to come to the US.</p>

<p>At the end of the day if a muslim started to stone somebody in the united states they would be put in jail. Letting a couple thousand muslims into the US isn&#39;t suddenly going to destroy your little utopia you envision in your head </p>

<p>The dodgy areas in London are mostly that way because of the drug gangs operating and fighting each other. Fuck all to do with Muslims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/epa-grant-flint-water/">https://www.snopes.com/epa-grant-flint-water/</a></p>

<p>The $100 million grant was funded by the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016, or WIIN, which was signed by President Obama in December 2016:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Barack Obama [has] signed a bill authorizing water projects across the country, including $170 million to address lead in the drinking water in Flint, Michigan, and $558 million to provide relief to drought-stricken California.</p>

<p>Obama said the bill advances vital projects across the country to restore watersheds, improve flood control and rebuild water infrastructure — including pipes in Flint, where residents have struggled with lead-tainted water for more than two years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although this legislation carried President Obama’s name, the EPA did not officially award the grant to Michigan until March 2017, by which time President Donald Trump was in office. As such, it was technically correct to say that “Trump’s EPA” awarded the grant money, although the funding for that grant was originally provided for under legislation signed by President Obama just before he left office:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has awarded a $100-million grant to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to fund drinking water infrastructure upgrades in Flint, funding that had been approved by Congress and former President Barack Obama late [in 2016].</p>

<p>Provided by the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act of 2016, the funds awarded Friday, March 17, are designed to allow the city to accelerate work to replace lead service lines and make other infrastructure improvements, including upgrades to Flint’s water treatment plant. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Crediting President Trump for this $100 million water infrastructure grant was touted as hypocritical by some critics since his 2017 blueprint budget contained several major cuts to the EPA’s funding, but the blueprint maintains that the proposed budget “provides robust funding for critical drinking and wastewater infrastructure” and that “these funding levels further the President’s ongoing commitment to infrastructure repair and replacement and would allow States, municipalities, and private entities to continue to finance high priority infrastructure investments that protect human health.”</p>

<p>The EPA itself noted that President Trump’s budget blueprint would not cut the EPA’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The WIIN funding supplements EPA’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (SRF), a federal-state partnership. In addition to the federal funds announced today, the State of Michigan is providing the required 20% match of $20 million. Over the years, EPA has provided more than $32.5 billion to states for infrastructure upgrades through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.</p>

<p>Under President Trump’s budget blueprint SRF remains fully funded, and the proposal provides robust funding for the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program to finance critical drinking and wastewater infrastructure.</p>
