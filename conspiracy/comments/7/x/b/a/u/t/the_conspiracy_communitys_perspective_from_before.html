        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The conspiracy community, before the election, knew the exact goals and agendas being worked towards.  The conspiracy community also knew that both political parties and all of the media had been infiltrated by those working towards this agenda.</p>

<p>You can find thousands of books, months worth of videos, and terabytes of forum discussion on the subject. The most documented and fully researched conspiracy ever. The agenda to restructure the world order for the creation of a one world government ruled by the central banks and oligarchs. </p>

<p>Now the conspiracy community seems to have been distracted, divided, and given amnesia by the results of the presidential election and all the propaganda that came with it. </p>

<p>The agenda has not changed. The fiat debt based currency will continue to control and enslave society. The oligarchs and banks will continue to consolidate world power. The media will continue to indoctrinate you with a false understanding of reality.  The constitution and sovereignty of the US will continue to be a thorn in the side of their agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO Trump/Russia IS the distraction on BOTH sides of the political spectrum.  Here we are over a year later and it is still the primary daily discussing and yet we haven&#39;t maid an inch of progress in over a year.  What better way to keep people completely distracted and forget what they even care about than to turn the government into a reality TV show?  Works just as charmed and they even have people screaming for sanctions against Russia when if it weren&#39;t for Trump people would not even care and may even be denouncing it because it was a growing consensus that we continually fight wars/wasting tax dollars we have no business being in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it doesn&#39;t have anything to collusion with the Russians, yes I would chalk that up as no progress.  These are just people with skeletons in their closet being prosecuted for relatively petty crimes.  Like happens everyday in America to people that are never discussed and don&#39;t make the news.  It only matters to people because they were on Trump&#39;s campaign team but their crimes are completely unrelated to the campaign itself.  </p>

<p>I would guarantee that if many of us here on Reddit had a special counsel setup to investigate us that we would also be found guilty of something.  That&#39;s what they do.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, I don’t understand this attitude. People talk about the “1%” running society, but as soon as you say yeah here are some of the families involved and who have maintained power and wealth through multiple generations” then you get called a conspiracy theorist. Why is it even questioned that people with power will want to pass on that power to their friends and family for as long as possible? It would be more shocking if people weren’t doing it </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism is the most natural self regulating, organic, fair system their is, because of the self regulating nature of supply and demand. The problem is that our system has been corrupted in so many ways it is no longer really capitalism and no longer organic and self regulating. Subsidies, micro managed markets, and regulatory systems designed to create protected monopolies are just a few of the subversions of capitalism.</p>

<p>The true subversion of capitalism is the encroaching socialism/fascism that has thrown the system out of balance, out of it&#39;s organic self regulating nature. </p>

Control a nations money supply and you control the country.  </p>
