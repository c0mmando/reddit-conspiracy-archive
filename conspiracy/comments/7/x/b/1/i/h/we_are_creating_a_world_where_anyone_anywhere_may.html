       "John Perry Barlow was an American poet and essayist, a cattle rancher, and a cyberlibertarian political activist who had been associated with both the Democratic and Republican parties. He was also a lyricist for the Grateful Dead and a founding member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Freedom of the Press Foundation. He was Fellow Emeritus at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, where he had maintained an affiliation since 1998." -Wikipedia

       SS:I know I don't need for text but figured I would leave a footnote anyways. John Barlow who passed away this week, known to few outside of the Grateful Dead and Tech communities was a man to be respected, admired and remembered.

       I wish i could agree with this guy.  But we are currently using a website where the CEO edited user comments he didnt like.  This website also kept changing it's rules b/c they didnt like how frequently T_D was being seen on r/all.  Also if you are posting on t_d you are not allowed to do this
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       but if you are on
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       you can type
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       .  Not everyone is allowed to say whatever they want to on the internet &amp; in Europe you can get arrested for telling people how silly Islam is.

       That was the guy the post was about who said it and wanted that was
       <em>
        his
       </em>
       goal... I posted it because he was a long-time advocate of freedom of press and internet and he just passed away. I posted hoping to inspire people to continue the message. Thought that was pretty clear..

       I don't know about that last part. There's quite a bit of attempts at coercion and attempts to silence. Sometimes it's just comments, but it can also grow into harassment. Heck, certain groups have been known to ruin people's real lives over stuff they've said online.

       I should have clarified, that it was the intention of amazing folks such as JPB to create a space free of censorship, coercion, or conformity. Which is
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       I wanted him to be spotlighted in his death, and remembered, so we can continue that purpose, which carries an ever-growing responsibility to speak up in these days.

       He was all about throwing stones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky, brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me
A peaceful place, or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace, is the human face
But afraid we may lay our home to waste
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
      </p>
      <p>
       Now watch as the ball revolves and the night-time falls 
And again the hunt begins and again the blood wind calls 
By and by, again, the morning sun will rise
But the darkness never goes from some men's eyes
(Well I know)
It strolls the sidewalk and it rolls the streets
Staking turf, dividing up meat
Nightmare spook, piece of heat
It's you and me, you and me
      </p>
      <p>
       Click flash blade in ghetto night
Rudy's looking for a fight
Rat cat alley, roll them bones
Need that cash to feed that Jones
And the politicians throwing stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
      </p>
      <p>
       Commissars and pinstripe bosses roll the dice
Anyway they fall, guess who gets to pay the price? 
Money green, or proletarian gray 
Selling guns instead of food today 
So the kids they dance and shake their bones
And the politicians throwing stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
      </p>
      <p>
       Heartless powers try to tell us what to think
If the spirit's sleeping then the flesh is ink
History's page will be neatly carved in stone
The future's here, we are it, we are on our own
On our own, on our own, we are on our own
      </p>
      <p>
       If the game is lost, then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame
We will leave this place an empty stone
Or that shining ball of blue we call our home
      </p>
      <p>
       So the kids, they dance, they shake their bones
And the politicians throwing stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
      </p>
      <p>
       Shipping powders back and forth
Singing black goes south and white comes north 
And the whole world full of petty wars
Singing I got mine and you got yours
While the current fashions set the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
The radical, he rant and rage
Singing someone got to turn the page
And the rich man in his summer home
Singing just leave well enough alone
But his pants are down, his cover's blown
And the politicians throwing stones
So the kids, they dance, they shake their bones
'Cause it's all too clear we're on our own
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
      </p>
      <p>
       Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
It's dizzying, the possibilities
      </p>
      <p>
       Ashes, ashes, all fall down
[Ashes, ashes, all fall down]
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
[Ashes, ashes, all fall down]
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
[Ashes, ashes, all fall down]
Ashes, ashes, all fall down
[Ashes, ashes, all fall down]

       You should check out any of the Adam Curtis documentaries --
       <strong>
        Hypernormalisation
       </strong>
       and
       <strong>
        Watched Over By Machine of Ever Loving Grace.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of an internet utopia that Barlow created is examined and framed in a pretty interesting light. The docs are very well done, thought provoking and wildly entertaining.
