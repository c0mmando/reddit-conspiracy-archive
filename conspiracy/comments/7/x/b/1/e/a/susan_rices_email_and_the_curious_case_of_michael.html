      <p>
       In light of the recent disclosure of Susan Rice's email regarding a meeting in the Oval Office on January 5, 2017, I feel there are some interesting coincidences and dots that plausibly connect regarding how the Michael Flynn saga went down.
      </p>
      <p>
       December 28, 2016:  Obama issues Executive Order 13757 announcing new sanctions with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       December 28, 2016:  Russian Ambassador Kislyak contacts Flynn.
      </p>
      <p>
       December 29, 2016:  Flynn contacts Kislyak.
      </p>
      <p>
       January, 5 2017:  Here is how Susan Rice describes an Oval Office Meeting
      </p>
      <p>
       "On January 5, following a briefing by IC leadership on Russian hacking during the 2016 Presidential election, President Obama had a brief follow-on conversation with FBI Director Jim Comey and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates in the Oval Office. Vice President Biden and I were also present.
      </p>
      <p>
       President Obama began the conversation by stressing his continued commitment to ensuring that every aspect of this issue is handled by the Intelligence and law enforcement communities "by the book". The President stressed that he is not asking about, initiating or instructing anything from a law enforcement perspective. He reiterated that our law enforcement team needs to proceed as it normally would by the book.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a national security perspective, however, President Obama said he wants to be sure that, as we engage with the incoming team, we are mindful to ascertain if there is any reason that we cannot share information fully as it relates to Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Classified text here remains undisclosed)
      </p>
      <p>
       The President asked Comey to inform him if anything changes in the next few weeks that should affect how we share classified information with the incoming team. Comey said he would.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Comey, Sally Yates, Susan Rice, Obama and Biden have an off the record discussion following an IC briefing discussing the above.
      </p>
      <p>
       January 24, 2017:  FBI agents interview Flynn regarding December contact with Kislyak.
      </p>
      <p>
       January 26, 2017:  Sally Yates briefs White House on the contents of the call and implies Flynn must have misled VP Pence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit storm for Flynn and White House ensues after media report leaks this information in early February.
      </p>
      <p>
       February 10, 2017:  Flynn resigns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Susan Rice has access to SIGINT as National Security Advisor.  Susan Rice has also been accused of unmasking Trump Admin officials.  She denied this until ultimately claiming the unmasking was limited to intelligence related to a UAE officials visit to the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comey would've been involved in directing agents to interview Michael Flynn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sally Yates received the contents of the FBI-Flynn interview immediately after its occurrence and goes directly to the White House to imply Flynn is open to Russian blackmail since he misled VP Pence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contents of the interview and White House interaction leak to the press in February and result in Flynn's near immediate resignation.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to this news report, the White House was kept in the dark about the interview until 2 days after it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article also states that "Later that day (Jan 24), two FBI agents arrived at the White House to speak with Flynn. A lawyer for the National Security Council typically would be informed of such a meeting and be present for it, one person familiar with the procedures said. But that didn't happen in this instance, and Flynn didn't include his own personal lawyer, two people said. He met with the two federal agents alone, according to these people."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/flynn-kept-fbi-interview-concealed-white-house-trump-n840491">
        https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/flynn-kept-fbi-interview-concealed-white-house-trump-n840491
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Comey and Yates were directly involved with Flynn's interview and subsequent disclosure and Susan Rice is accused of unmasking Trump Admin officials and that issue never had any real clarity as to exactly what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       These 3 people were all in a January 5 meeting, one week after Kislayak's contact with Flynn was captured, and all 3 had a part to play in the Flynn interview-process crime debacle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Susan Rice goes out of her way to document a cover that Obama wanted everything done "by the book", but also discusses that withholding information from the incoming administration was discussed.  She also makes sure to make it seem like she had no meaningful interaction, but if that's true...why was she included in the conversation?
      </p>
      <p>
       The White House was kept in the dark regarding the Flynn calls and FBI interview until 2 days after the interview and one month after the calls occurred...
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly Susan Rice felt it was important to document this meeting in a way that made it seem clear there could be no impropriety discussed.  She went out of her way to leave a record of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I wonder, did Susan Rice see the SIGINT regarding Kislyak-Flynn call and was the game plan for taking action on this information discussed at this January 5 meeting?
      </p>
      <p>
       All major players (and only those players save Biden) in the Flynn saga were present and they discussed possibly withholding information from the incoming White House administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very coincidental that the Flynn information was subsequently withheld from the Trump White House...
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also reports that Comey in his March testimony admitted the interviewing agents didn't think that Flynn intended to mislead them, that he didn't actually lie...
      </p>
      <p>
       Flynn's sentencing has been delayed at the behest of Mueller and now this very strange Susan Rice email is coming to light...
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all just food for thought.  Thanks for reading, sorry this was so long I tried my best to be concise.  Let's discuss.

       Submission Statement:  Susan Rice's email opens up a host of questions and seemingly goes out of its way to demonstrate that absolutely nothing discussed at a January 5, 2017 Oval Office meeting could have been nefarious or not "by the book".
      </p>
      <p>
       Very coincidental that the only people present for the meeting had a direct role in the Flynn-Kislyak-FBI interview saga, except for Susan Rice.
      </p>
      <p>
       If she had no role in this though, why was she included in the conversation?
      </p>
      <p>
       I contend that it's quite possible the real "Susan Rice Unmasking Scandal" is that she unmasked Flynn in the captured Kislyak call transcript from December 29, 2016 and this January 5, 2017 meeting was a discussion between the major players on what action to take.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why send an email covering for those involved in the discussion if something "big" wasn't discussed?

       Great analysis.  I appreciated that you didn't try to make this a "blame Obama/blame Trump" post.  You stuck to the facts and then tried to make inferences connecting some of the dots.

       It was a breath of fresh air that this wasn't outwardly partisan.

       Thanks man. I just wanted to present it for discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously I think Rice’s email in the context of what developments were happening at the time, is beyond suspicious, but I’m more than open to contradictory lines of thinking.

       Too bad we can't have any discussion on this because the people screaming "everything's a distraction from Trump/Russia" make sure to bury any posts that may indicate there is much more to the story than we have originally been led to believe.

       I’ve seen posts/comments buried from both viewpoints though so I mean it’s hard to place blame squarely on one group versus another.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this gets traction and people want to discuss then that’s great, I just found this outline interesting to talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do find it frustrating that in general well thought out detailed posts don’t get attention as most aren’t willing to read something that requires detail. A lot of times the stuff that is “hot” is basically a super partisan throw away post that really adds nothing to the discussion or just links to an article that no one reads and/or just goes “so now we’re cool with anonymous sources lol”.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I post it’s usually my own analysis and I try to incorporate supporting links.

       Take a moment to browse controversial and see which side of the discussion gets buried more.   I have seen perfectly logical and well thought out posts not even have a chance to see the light of day. Look at what happens to any post mentioning Bill Priestap.

       That’s fair, I actually don’t sort by controversial often, but I’ll keep an eye out for it for curiosity’s sake.

       Good point on Priestap. It definitely is strange that his name is never on either side’s radar despite being in a pretty integral position relative to all these developments.

       I wouldn't have even known about him if I hadn't sorted by controversial!  That is what planted this idea in my head in the first place.  If you look in those threads all comments are massively downvoted but without a single rebuttal.  The thread are also obviously massively downvotedand and never make it anywhere near the front page.  Way to many downvotes for a thread that was only seen in new and controversial IMO.  It makes me wonder why there is so much activity in a buried post.  It might just be me not being that good at navigating Reddit but I can't even find the post that I am primarily describing and I just posted in it yesterday night.

       I do get irked at well thought out comments that are just downvoted with zero rebuttal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get downvoting for obvious contrarian trolling bullshit, but if you’re gonna downvote a post/comment someone actually put time into at least provide a reason. The whole point is to discuss, open up people to viewpoints they hadn’t considered.

       I definitely agree.  And don't think I assume one side to be right and the other to be wrong.  I think there both a little right and both a little wrong.  I obviously lean a certain way just because of what I believe to be the truth.  When I see people screaming for action against a country, and such an intense campaign in the media to make that country look like villians without really any evidence at all, it makes me raise my eyebrows.  Also essentially being irate at Trump while giving Clinton a pass for allegedly essentially doing the same thing.  We have proof Clinton paid for dirty opposition research. Then we theorize Trump may have worked with Russia to obtain the same thing, opposition research.  Are we really that enraged about a minute difference that is really just a technicality?

       We're just seeing the missing pieces, now. The Brennan / Clapper connection still to come. I'm willing to bet Kislyak and Veselnetskaya and possibly Papadopoulis were "in on it" trying to catch Trump's team doing something they shouldn't be. The house of cards is going to come down, it's just now that the national feeling - thanks to the media, is so anti-Trump, will anyone care? Will anyone face consequences? Obama admin AND DNC AND HRC AND McCain (maybe other GOPers) AND DOJ AND FBI AND CIA conspired with RUSSIANS to setup the opposition.

       Now, why?

       I"d look through the site itself to see what else may be there. I'm just on a quick break so can't do to much digging. But I recently found this site and it's what helped me get my head around all of this.

       The best guess we have as to the initial warrant is October 2016 from the memo.

       He was repeatedly rebuked for suggesting meetings between the Trump team and back-channels (Ivan Timofeev, etc.) to Putin. He was also hand selected by the Clinton DoS several years before serving on Trump's team as a top young foreign policy mind for UNESCO 2011 and had his writings featured on the DoS website.

       Have you done any reading on this? She was denied entry into the US several times (bc of her ties to Russian intel) previous to her meeting w/ Don Jr. which was finally approved by the Kerry DoS and Lynch DoJ under the pretenses of the Prevezon case.

       It's not groundbreaking. They just knew exactly what was happening and lied about it repeatedly to congress, et. al. Brennan is a classic snake and Clapper has been lying about surveillance for years, so this should surprise no one.

       I’d need to see where you’re getting this info from so I can read it all you’ve done is made claims in an anonymous forum with nothing to back them up.

       I’m not attacking you you just made three rapid fire allegations and still haven’t explained where this information came from.

      <p>
       I’ve read up on the Russian lawyer, what you’re stating is half true. She was allowed into the country for a court case and then inexplicably remained in the country to meet Don Jr. 5 months later. But it’s not like she had no reason to be here and they authorized her one week before the meeting.

       I actually have a different theory as to what it could’ve been about as well, but I still find this post’s theory to be more likely given the very coincidental people in the meeting and in relation to Flynn’s interview and fallout.
      </p>

       I agree, people don’t generally talk like this, but I actually think he probably did use “by the book” just maybe not repeatedly.

       The fact this email was sent though really makes you think that clearly something substantial was discussed and this “contemporaneous note” was sent to herself as a “in case shit hits the fan” type of information leak.

       It was way before the delay was announced, I don’t think it’s connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       The delay has two viewpoints that I’ve seen:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Flynn has more info to divulge and/or Mueller wants to hold him out in the wind a bit longer so to speak. Or,
      </p>
      <p>
       2) There’s procedural issues related to his initial charges and plea deal that may negate the validity of said charges, thus complicating any information’s usefulness related to his cooperation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m sure there’s more takes, but that’s what I’ve seen. I view both as pretty much equally possible explanations.

       I agree. I was just curious as to whether Strzok was still on the case at the time of Flynn's plea. I believe Strzok was the guy who interviewed him so I wondered if something may have come to light that we weren't aware of that may have been a factor in the delay. Just kinda thinking out loud.

       I feel both 1 and 2.  More so he has unverifiable information or evidence that could be great for Mueller but is not yet corroborated? Mueller needs more time to connect the dots in a way that cannot be argued another way.  Heck, maybe Flynn is a witness against manafort?   Whatever be going down, I bet we only know half of each story at best..  My long shot bet is Flynn ratted on nunes and they are watching him dig himself in further and further which adds substance to any claim Flynn made..

       Supposedly it is the kidnapping of an American citizen for Erdogan* as he claims that the American started a coup.. though I'm not sure I have heard much about this in a long time. Not in a place to provide a source at the moment sorry.

       It was way before the delay was announced, I don’t think it’s connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       The delay has two viewpoints that I’ve seen:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Flynn has more info to divulge and/or Mueller wants to hold him out in the wind a bit longer so to speak. Or,
      </p>
      <p>
       2) There’s procedural issues related to his initial charges and plea deal that may negate the validity of said charges, thus complicating any information’s usefulness related to his cooperation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m sure there’s more takes, but that’s what I’ve seen. I view both as pretty much equally possible explanations.

       Dude I just said I’d need more info.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d need to see where you’re getting this info from so I can read it all you’ve done is made claims in an anonymous forum with nothing to back them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not attacking you you just made three rapid fire allegations and still haven’t explained where this information came from.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve read up on the Russian lawyer, what you’re stating is half true. She was allowed into the country for a court case and then inexplicably remained in the country to meet Don Jr. 5 months later. But it’s not like she had no reason to be here and they authorized her one week before the meeting.
