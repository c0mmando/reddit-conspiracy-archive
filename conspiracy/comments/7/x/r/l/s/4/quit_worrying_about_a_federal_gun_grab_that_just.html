<p>Gun grab? </p>

<p>There’s about 300 millions guns in the United States and only the legal registered ones would be rounded up, now we have criminals with assault rifles and nothing to defend ourselves.</p>

<p>If we had gun grab initiative to prevent gun violence we would just end up with more gun violence, the black market would explode and there would be so much f*cking violence on the border and inner cities, violence like you’ve never seen before.</p>

<p>We’re beyond the point of a gun grab so all you angry gun enthusiasts can rest assured all your toys are safe, we’ve accepted that mass shootings are pretty much an everyday occurrence here in America.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a pretty well-known pattern for people wanting to hoard guns and think the government doesn&#39;t know about it. May or may not work depending on how aggressively they investigate you and how well you hide them. Falsely reporting your guns stolen is a crime, but buying them from a private party isn&#39;t a crime and doesn&#39;t create any paper trail at all. Expect to pay a little bit more, but unless you want something really powerful like a .50 cal, you can probably find it pretty easily.</p>

<p>Although, if we&#39;re being honest, mass gun confiscation would be a major error by the oligarchy, leading to an immediate armed revolution that is nearly certain to have the support of the military. In other words, gun confiscation would be one of the biggest mistakes they could possibly make, and we should pray they are that stupid.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s be honest here. We can&#39;t win the war on drugs because the <a href="https://isgp-studies.com/cia-heroin-and-cocaine-drug-trafficking">CIA</a> is controlling the drug trade. And we can&#39;t keep illegal guns off the street because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATF_gunwalking_scandal">the government</a> is selling them. </p>

<p>Not saying this to support prohibition, just to give a sense of the real root of the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm. I’ve never grown drugs in my yard yet somehow I’ve acquired them from time to time. True drugs and guns aren’t the exact same thing, but prohibition of guns would be just as fruitless as it has been for drugs. You can argue that they should be illegal, just as I believe some drugs should be illegal, but that won’t make the law against them any more effective at eradicating them. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not true. Drugs can be grown in backyards, made in basements from totally legal components, or smuggled in through Mexico usually.</p>

<p>Guns can&#39;t be grown in backyards.</p>

<p>Guns can&#39;t be made in basements from totally legal components.</p>

<p>The vast majority of guns in Mexico <strong>are smuggled in from the US</strong>.</p>

<p>There are just a few, very common sense gun laws that would reduce gun violence in this country by orders of magnitude, but the gun lobby and half the country&#39;s gun festishization simply won&#39;t allow that. It&#39;s terrible tens of thousands of Americans need to die every year because we can&#39;t enact laws that would respect the rights of responsible gun owners while simultaneously cutting off the outflow of guns into criminal and crazy people&#39;s hands. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m sorry but your argument doesn’t seem to come from a logical standpoint. What do you think happens to all the guns currently in possession of US citizens? Guns are not like drugs where they are constantly being consumed and need to be replenished. You have to understand that seizing guns from citizens will never work. How many guns do you think are out there that aren’t registered? Do you think gun enthusiasts will give up guns the government doesn’t know about? Do you think criminals with unregistered and illegal guns will turn them in? Unless all guns are confiscated, which isn’t possible, there will be a black market and it will be just as fruitful as the black market for drugs. So what have the common sense laws against narcotics done to reduce drug crime in this country? Is there not a heroin epidemic? Isn’t heroin illegal? How about common sense laws for guns? Better background checks and disallowing mentally unstable people from acquiring guns legally? Well murder is illegal but that law doesn’t stop them. How about outlawing assault rifles? They make up only a fraction of the gun deaths per year in America. They only get the most sensationalized media coverage. If we want to make a dent in guns that cause the most harm we would need to outlaw handguns and shotguns. Still, in any of these scenarios, the black market will still exist and the only people that won’t be able to secure guns to protect themselves will be law-abiding citizens. </p>

<p>But let’s say that magically all the guns in circulation vanish and the military and police are the only ones with guns. I don’t even understand this solution because the people that seem to want it are the ones that hate the police, hate our government, and hate the military. Yet they want those powers to be the only ones with guns. Just seems counterintuitive. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I never said anything about seizing guns. I take this topic very seriously, so please don&#39;t strawman me if you want to have a real discussion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unless all guns are confiscated, which isn’t possible, there will be a black market and it will be just as fruitful as the black market for drugs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not even remotely true. According to the ATF, the vast majority of guns used criminally are originally purchased legally in states that have very lax gun laws, and then ferried around the country to states where guns are harder to get. By closing down the avenue by which these guns enter the criminal cycle, namely private sales which are legal in half the states in America, the tap by which criminals get their guns will be mostly shut off.</p>

<p>Then you only have to worry about the guns that are already on the streets, but those will eventually dry up through attrition, as tens upon tens of thousands of illegal guns are confiscated by law enforcement every year.</p>

<p>So that solves the problem of new illegal guns entering the market, as well as drying up the reserves of illegal guns already out there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what have the common sense laws against narcotics done to reduce drug crime in this country? Is there not a heroin epidemic? Isn’t heroin illegal?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not remotely the same topic. Heroin is either grown here, or imported.</p>

<p>Guns cannot be grown, and are exported from this country illegally, in massive amounts. No other country produces even fractionally the same amount of guns we do. By cutting the supply to criminals, there won&#39;t be guns to export, and so there won&#39;t be any guns to reimport if wanted here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How about common sense laws for guns? Better background checks and disallowing mentally unstable people from acquiring guns legally?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m proposing. It shouldn&#39;t be legal for some crazy person to walk into a flea market and buy a trunk full of guns without even having to give their name, never mind a waiting period or a background check. But that&#39;s legal all over the country, and that&#39;s exactly how guns end up in the hands of criminals everywhere.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Still, in any of these scenarios, the black market will still exist</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The black market can&#39;t exist if there&#39;s no access to firearms for criminals in the first place. That&#39;s like saying the black market for Heroin will still exist even if criminals don&#39;t have access to poppy plants or seeds. The logic just doesn&#39;t follow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But let’s say that magically all the guns in circulation vanish and the military and police are the only ones with guns. I don’t even understand this solution because the people that seem to want it are the ones that hate the police, hate our government, and hate the military. Yet they want those powers to be the only ones with guns. Just seems counterintuitive.</p>

<p>Again, that has nothing at all to do with what I&#39;m saying. </p>

<p>&quot;It has been estimated that nearly 40 percent of all guns sold in America are sold by private, unlicensed sellers either online or through guns shows,&quot; McAuliffe stated in his Oct. 15 executive order.  </p>

<p>Christina Nuckols, deputy press secretary for McAuliffe, said the source of the 40 percent figure is a 1997 study by the National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners’ responses to a 1994 national survey asking how they got their weapons. The study found that 30 percent to 40 percent of all gun transactions were made through an &quot;off-the-books&quot; transfer in which a background check wasn’t required.</p>

<p>McAuliffe’s statement misses a key distinction in the study: The research looked at all gun transactions - <strong>including when a gun was obtained as a gift or as an inheritance - and not just being &quot;sold,&quot; as the governor said.</strong></p>

<p>The Fact Checker at The Washington Post in 2013 asked one of the co-authors of the study, Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, to crunch the 1994 data just looking at sales. <strong>Ludwig replied that 14 percent to 22 percent of guns were purchased without a background check.</strong></p>

<p>There&#39;s two very important points to that. First, it&#39;s much easier to supply criminals with guns by going into flea markets in half the states of the country and buying a gun no questions asked, without even showing ID, or even straw purchasing dozens of guns at a time to spread to the other half of the country, than it is to start massively importing millions of guns every year and networking them to criminals across the country. </p>

<p>Secondly, half of the world&#39;s guns are in the U.S. By banning private sales, you just cut out half the world&#39;s supply of guns to criminals across the U.S. </p>

<p>Then why does it work in literally every other high income country in the world? Why is it only here, where the laws are the weakest by miles?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You said yourself that drugs can be imported. Why can’t guns?</p>

<p>Guns are harder to import, and we possess half the world&#39;s guns. We&#39;re the supplier, so how are they going to import them? Why doesn&#39;t this happen in any other high income country?</p>

<p>Not only is this empirically wrong, but it&#39;s intellectually dishonest. It&#39;s not about people not breaking the law because it&#39;s the law, it&#39;s about people not buying and using guns illegally without the currently ridiculously easy access to guns. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t said to do either of those things. I think banning private sales will fix the majority of the problem. 75% of criminal guns in places with strict gun control, come from states where you can just walk into a flea market and buy a trunkload of guns without even showing your ID.</p>

<p>Other means like what?   I cant think of anything more destructive yet just as cheap and plentiful than firearms.  Even a reduction in magazine capacity would lessen the impact of most mass shootings, as every additional second spent reloading is a second more innocent people get to safety away from a shooter.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the kind of bullshit statistic that makes me lose respect for people that argue for gun control.</p>

<p>Why would we care <em>how</em> people are killed more than <em>wether</em> they are killed? If the incidence of homicide in general is the metric to look at.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m guessing they are not limiting it to criminal homicide and they are probably including suicide. It would be great just to look at how likely am I to be murdered relative to the level of gun ownership rather than trying to tweet the numbers to make it look as bad as possible.</p>

<p>But then we have the whole chicken/ egg problem. Do people in dangerous neighborhoods have more motivation to have a gun for defense, or do people with guns have more motivation to commit murder?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well they say in the first paragraph of the abstract that they included suicide.</p>

<p>And I think technically suicide is a subset of homicide. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s particularly helpful to include in the same study of what you want is a real sense of how safe an area is.</p>

<p>So we know that if we compare <em>total homicides</em> rather than <em>firearm homicides</em> the ratio (between gun ownership and homicide) will be less impactful than 1% : .9%. And we know if we leave off suicides the number will be lower. And we know that if we leave off justifiable homicides it will be lower. So what is your relative risk of being murdered as correlated to the level of (legal?) gun ownership? I don&#39;t know because that statistic never seems to get published. One wonders if that&#39;s because it is less impressive. Hell, it could even be an inverse relationship, can&#39;t say til we have data.</p>

<p>Even after you determine a useful metric you still have a <strong>long</strong> way to go to establish causality. For instance it is quite plausible that in a neighborhood that is dangerous for whatever reason; extreme poverty, lack of police presence, active black markets and organized crime, etc.; people will be more likely to want to own (and use!) a firearm for protection. I can&#39;t say wether or not that&#39;s how the causality goes but it really is plausible. And if we can&#39;t show causality then we have no reason to say that when people own guns an area is less safe because of it.</p>

<p>This is how I know the whole thing is just a politicized pile of garbage. No one is looking at useful statistics to determine what the actual relationship is between gun ownership and public safety. They are starting with an unstated bias and working backwards to justify it.</p>

<p>Seems to me that we have moral, educational and cultural problems, we have long before guns came around. Gun&#39;s don&#39;t kill people, people kill people and they don&#39;t require guns to do it. The thing that you are to stupid to understand is that these problems are manufactured, a hand leads it.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s time for some soothing fist sucking while rocking back and forth. Bitch.</p>

<p>Overall, Branas’s study found that people who carried guns were 4.5 times as likely to be shot and 4.2 times as likely to get killed compared with unarmed citizens. When the team looked at shootings in which victims had a chance to defend themselves, their odds of getting shot were even higher.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see it like this: It would accomplish exactly the opposite of what it meant to do, people would give up their guns but the second the government turns its back, the people will be seeking to arm themselves to the teeth with whatever they can find or produce themselves. 
But the ideal still remains: A civilian population entirely disarmed, (not the eradication of military forces, that is another kind of ideal for another time), that is the ideal or utopia if you would, i say ideal because its not grounded in reality, its impossible right now. For that to happen the entire planet would have to be civilized to the point of being non violent towards other human beings, you ever think that is gonna happen? Not in our lifetimes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think your adding two post together. </p>

<p>I was commenting to someone asking what was the point of a gun grab/ gun ban.</p>

<p>If you are talking about the recent shooting which of course you are. Then I would say after being placed on psych meds he should of been told to place his guns, if these guns were in fact his, with either a family member or to place them into secure storage. </p>

<p>That is a rather aggressive stance and most wont like it but that would be my thoughts.  </p>

<p>Also after posting online that he was going to be a pro school shooter under his own name then specialists should of been brought in and talked with the kid. </p>

<p>Then if it was decided he was a threat, and considering students and teachers was fearful of him he most likely would of been, they should of taken his weapons and placed them in a secure lockup. Where once he got better he could have them back.</p>

<p>But if he really just needed to kill the evil white people he could of just taken a meat cleaver and then hacked the kids to death that way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Listen, you fantastically retarded motherfucker. I&#39;m going to try to explain this so that you can understand it.</p>

<p><strong>You cannot control an entire country and it&#39;s people with tanks, jets, battleships, and drones or any of these things that you so stupidly believe trumps citizen ownership of firearms.</strong></p>

<p>A fighter jet, tank, drone, battleship, or whatever cannot stand on street corners. And enforce &quot;no assembly&quot; edicts.** A fighter jet cannot kick down your door at 3AM and search your house for contraband.
**
None of these things can maintain the needed police state to completely subjugate and enslave the people of a nation. <strong>Those weapons are for decimating, flattening and glassing large areas and many people at once and fighting other state militaries. The government does not want to kill all of it&#39;s people and blow up it&#39;s own infrastructure.</strong> These are the very things they need to be tyrannical assholes in the first place. If they decided to turn everything outside of Washington D.C. into glowing green glass they would be absolute rulers of a big, worthless, radioactive pile of shit.</p>

<p>Police are needed to maintain a police state, boots on the ground. And <strong>no matter how many police you have on the ground they will always be vastly outnumbered by civilians which is why in a police state it is vital that your police have automatic weapons while the people have nothing but their limp dicks</strong>.</p>

<p>BUT** when every random pedestrian could have a Glock in their waistband and every random homeowner an AR-15 all that goes out the fucking window** because now the police are outnumbered and face the reality of bullets coming back at them.</p>

<p>If you want living examples of this <strong>look at every insurgency that the U.S. military has tried to destroy. They&#39;re all still kicking with nothing but AK-47s, pick up trucks and improvised explosives</strong> because these big scary military monsters you keep alluding to are all but fucking useless for dealing with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gun free zones were created for the purpose of allowing mass shootings. The Gun Free School Zones Act was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun-Free_School_Zones_Act_of_1990">passed in 1990</a>, and it took away the right to self-defense in school zones. During this time period, Australia and Britain had their rights taken away shortly after false-flag mass shootings, and the assumption was that by leaving children unprotected, enough MK Ultra killers and false flags would be enough to get Americans to turn them in.</p>

<p>They managed to get &quot;Assault Weapons&quot; banned in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Assault_Weapons_Ban">1994</a>, but the bill had a 10 year sunset and grassroots efforts by the NRA (perhaps the only political organization funded mostly by regular people that has enough power to inspire fear in members of Congress) ensured it was not renewed.</p>

<p>By the time Obama got into office and the false flags or psy ops like Sandy Hook got going, there were already so many AR15s out there that it was senseless to try to ban them. There were already enough to ensure a popular revolution would have adequate small arms to compete with any military on planet earth. Also, people started to get wise to the false flag nature of these shootings, particularly with the Sandy Hook hoax.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. The guns aren&#39;t going anywhere, and if the government attempted to &quot;round them up&quot;, I don&#39;t think the American population would take too kindly to it.  As someone pointed out in another thread, the US army is much more dedicated to it&#39;s citizens than to it&#39;s government right now, especially with the current president.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope that if the gov did turn on it&#39;s citizens ala violating their second amendment rights, revolution would happen. </p>

<p>All that being said, I think the focus should be put on mental health here. If enough people stood up to big pharma, or maybe paid the people who are on the ground floor dealing with people who have mental health issues (ie. not taking kickbacks) a living wage, we could move away from the corruption. Its all about the fucking dollar, and we&#39;re just cash slaves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guns will exist as long as there is a market they could profit from. So who can still profit off of banned guns? The black market. If Americans are stripped of our rights to firearms, only the government and cartels will have guns; and that&#39;s fucking scary.    </p>

<p>Gun control is the one of the dumbest issue politicians talk about, it&#39;s just another way to create a divided America. The issue lies in how our money is used by the government, I mean 50% to military, and the rest to &quot;others&quot; doesn&#39;t make sense at all. Imagine an America where we spend 50% on education or health care and tell me how that wouldn&#39;t make the US a better place?  </p>

<p>More places where the mentally ill could get treatment, free healthcare, more afterschool programs for the ghettos, more education on gun safety, etc. </p>

<p>First of all, requiring a background check and waiting period for your right is stripping you of it without due process. You&#39;re assuming everyone is guilty until proven innocent, which is not how a free society works. </p>

<p>It&#39;d be akin to having to get your free speech approved by the government. Seriously what other right would it be okay to do that with?</p>

<p>Now onto the wonderful history of gun control/rights violations!</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>1837</strong>
Georgia passes a law banning handguns. The law is later ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court and is thrown out.</p>

<p><strong>1865</strong>
In a reaction to emancipation, several southern states adopt <strong>&quot;black codes&quot; which, among other things, forbid black persons from possessing firearms</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>1927</strong>
The U.S. Congress passes a law banning the mailing of concealable weapons.</p>

<p><strong>1934</strong>
The National Firearms Act of 1934, <strong>regulating the manufacture, sale and possession of fully automatic firearms like sub-machine guns</strong> is approved by Congress.</p>

<p><strong>1938</strong>
The Federal Firearms Act of 1938 places the <strong>first limitations on selling ordinary firearms. Persons selling guns are required to obtain a Federal Firearms License</strong>, at an annual cost of $1, and to <strong>maintain records of the name and address of persons to whom firearms are sold</strong>. Gun sales to persons convicted of violent felonies were prohibited.</p>

<p><strong>1968</strong>
The Gun Control Act of 1968 - was enacted for the purpose of “keeping firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age, criminal background, or incompetence.” <strong>The Act regulates imported guns, expands the gun-dealer licensing and record keeping requirements, and places specific limitations on the sale of handguns. The list of persons banned from buying guns is expanded to include persons convicted of any non-business related felony, persons found to be mentally incompetent, and users of illegal drugs.</strong></p>

<p><strong>1972</strong>
The Federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) is created, listing as part of its mission, <strong>the control of &quot;illegal&quot; use and sale of firearms and the enforcement of Federal firearms laws.</strong> ATF issues firearms licenses and conducts firearms licensee qualification and compliance inspections.</p>

<p><strong>1977</strong>
The <strong>District of Columbia enacts an anti-handgun law which also requires registration of all rifles and shotguns</strong> within the District of Columbia.</p>

<p><strong>1986</strong>
The <strong>Armed Career Criminal Act increases penalties for possession of firearms by persons not qualified to own them under the Gun Control Act of 1986</strong>.</p>

<p>The Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act (Public Law 99-408) bans possession of &quot;cop killer&quot; bullets capable of penetrating bulletproof clothing.</p>

<p><strong>1989</strong>
California <strong>bans the possession of semiautomatic assault weapons</strong> following the massacre of five children on a Stockton, CA school playground.</p>

<p><strong>1990</strong>
The Crime Control Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-647) <strong>bans manufacturing and importing semiautomatic assault weapons in the U.S. &quot;Gun-free school zones&quot; are established</strong> carrying specific penalties for violations.</p>

<p><strong>1994</strong> – The Brady Law and Assault Weapon Ban –
The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act <strong>imposes a five-day waiting period on the purchase of a handgun and requires that local law enforcement agencies conduct background checks on purchasers of handguns</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 prohibited the sale, manufacture, importation, or possession of a number of specific types of assault type weapons for a ten-year period</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>1998</strong> 
A Justice Department report indicates <strong>the blocking of some 69,000 handgun sales during 1977</strong> when the Brady Bill pre-sale background checks were required.</p>

<p><strong>1998</strong> 
Permanent provisions of the Brady Act go into effect. <strong>Gun dealers are now required to initiate a pre-sale criminal background check of all gun buyers through the newly created National Instant Criminal Background Check</strong> (NICS) computer system.</p>

<p><strong>1998</strong> 
President Bill Clinton announces that the instant background check system had prevented 400,000 &quot;illegal&quot; gun purchases. The claim is called &quot;misleading&quot; by the NRA.</p>

<p><strong>1999</strong>
By a 51-50 vote, with the tie-breaker vote cast by Vice President Al Gore, the U.S. Senate passes a bill requiring trigger locks on all newly manufactured handguns and** extending waiting period and background check requirements to sales of firearms** at gun shows.</p>

<p><strong>2004</strong>
Massachusetts becomes the first state to implement an electronic instan<strong>t gun buyer background check system with fingerprint scanning for gun licenses and gun purchases</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>2005</strong>
California** bans the manufacture, sale, distribution or import of the powerful .50-caliber BMG**, or Browning machine gun rifle.</p>

<p><strong>2008</strong>
President Bush signed the <strong>National Instant Criminal Background Check Improvement Act requiring gun buyer background checks to screen for legally declared mentally ill individuals</strong>, who are ineligible to buy firearms. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/02/10/the-gop-is-making-it-easier-for-mentally-ill-people-to-buy-guns-they-have-a-point/?utm_term=.4d790cd45dd6"><strong>Despite that there&#39;s no correlation with mental illness and violent gun crimes</strong></a> - mental illness is far broader than just psychopaths. <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/06/american-psychiatric-association-half-of-americans-mentally-ill/">1/5-1/2 of people are considered mentally ill and are responsible for only about 4% of violent crimes</a>)</p>

<p><strong>2008</strong>
In its landmark decision in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment affirmed the rights of individuals to own firearms. The ruling also overturned a 32-year old ban on the sale or possession of handguns in the District of Columbia. (Woo-hoo!)</p>

<p><strong>2015</strong>
In an effort to close the so-called “gun show loophole” allowing gun sales conducted without Brady Act background checks, U.S. Rep. Speier, Jackie (D-California) <strong>introduced the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2015 (H.R. 3411), to require background checks for all gun sales including sales made over the Internet and at gun shows</strong>.   </p>

<p><strong>2016</strong>
President** Obama again called on Congress to enact or renew a law prohibiting the sale and possession of assault-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines** after a man identified as Omar Mateen killed 49 people in an Orlando, Florida gay nightclub on June 12, using an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle.</p>

<p><strong>2017</strong>
Less than a week after the Las Vegas shooting, U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-California) introduced the <strong>“Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act” that would ban the sale and possession of bump stocks</strong> and other devices that essentially turn a semiautomatic weapon to fire in fully-automatic mode.</p>

<p>“It shall be unlawful for any person to import, sell, manufacture, transfer or possess, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, a trigger crank, a bump-fire device or any part, combination of parts, component, device, attachment or accessory that is designed or functions to accelerate the rate of fire of a semiautomatic rifle but not convert the semiautomatic rifle into a machine gun,” the bill states.</p>

<p><strong>2017</strong> 
U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-California) introduced the Background Check Completion Act Sen. Feinstein said would close a current loophole in the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act that allows gun sales to proceed if a background check is not completed after 72 hours, even if the gun buyer is not legally allowed to purchase a gun.</p>

<p><strong>The Background Check Completion Act would require that a background check be fully completed before any gun buyer who purchases a gun from a federally-licensed firearms dealer (FFL) can take possession of the gun.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly, I really don&#39;t understand how people could say mass shootings are a ploy to take away our gun rights. If I had to guess, the NRA pushes that narrative through social media so they can get ahead of the negative press. If anything, our gun rights have expanded since this explosion of homegrown terrorism through lunatics shooting citizens. I mean, they were about to legalize silencers through the &quot;Hearing Protection Act&quot;, LOL, before Vegas happened. No politician would ever have the balls to take away a gun from an American citizen with the legal right to them via the constitution. </p>

<p>There’s about 300 millions guns in the United States and only the legal registered ones would be rounded up, now we have criminals with assault rifles and nothing to defend ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And they will become less and less til there are basically none anymore, it may take some time but other civilized countries somehow also manage to not escalate into an arms race.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If we had gun grab initiative to prevent gun violence we would just end up with more gun violence, the black market would explode and there would be so much f*cking violence on the border and inner cities, violence like you’ve never seen before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, because the US is the savest country because of all the guns they have to defend themselves... oh wait.</p>

<p>The irony is so hilarious, yet sad. </p>

<p>Greetings from a civilized country where we have no guns because we are not literally retarded :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure this will be unpopular around here... but I&#39;m in Canada... </p>

<p>in the past 10 years we have had 6 massacres that involved multiple homicides.  In total 28 lives were lost to these incidents.  I think it should be noted that one was a crossbow attack which accounts for 3 of those deaths, so we are down to 25 gun related deaths in a multiple homicide situation.  16 of those deaths also involved a situation where the shooter knew their victims (and not just through things like school, they were often domestic related situations and sadly innocent people were also murdered during these incidents)... so that brings us to 9 random gun related multiple deaths in 10 years.    I guess I should also account that three of them were someone shooting RCMP officers while they were attempting to apprehend him (though it can be argued that perhaps this individual intended to shoot innocent people, motive seems unclear).   So that leaves us with 6 people randomly killed in a single multiple random shooting... and it should be noted that was a single incident for those 6... involving someone walking into a Mosque (racially motivated obviously).  </p>

<p>Now... I recognize that the US has a population 10 times that of Canada... however without even looking, I feel that the US has had way more than 60 victims resulting from a mass shooting related event over the past 10 years.</p>

<p>Gun control though should not be noted as the only single factor that contributes to our lower gun related violence.  We have a health care system that I understand does a better job dealing with people with mental health issues.  However I don&#39;t think that is an isolating factor and the relaxed gun control policies in the US are definitely a factor.  </p>

<p>We also have a much different mindset when it comes to gun culture as well.  I know a LOT of people because of work and a number of work related moves.  I have yet to meet someone that owns a firearm for protection purposes (well outside of a few trappers that carry a side piece while setting their traps, some prospectors might carry them as well.  None of them are protecting themselves from other gun owners, they are carry side pieces to protect from animals).  </p>

<p>Anyway... I feel I&#39;m rambling a bit, but I will add that I don&#39;t understand why someone needs a gun like an AK-47 for &#39;protection&#39; or the gun that was used in yesterday&#39;s shooting.  Seems overkill and if these things ever fall into the wrong arms... well you are just asking for these types of situations.  I think having a different mindset about gun culture and gun control will help reduce the amount of gun violence in the US.  It won&#39;t happen overnight and there won&#39;t be a &#39;gun grab&#39; type situation.  We don&#39;t even have that in Canada... again, I can easily purchase a firearm if I so decided I need one, but that is my point... because we don&#39;t have a lot of firearms to begin with, I don&#39;t feel the need to protect myself with one.  </p>

<p>Just thought I would share... </p>

<p>What? You&#39;re own link proves it. 60+% is the majority of gun sales. Furthermore, that&#39;s one skewed study. None the less:</p>

<p>So, you are cherry picking the off chance and small minority of guns sales to prove your point. </p>

<p>Well considering that the US is turning into a police state anyway I don&#39;t think the threat of a well armed population matters to the government. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Civilians always outnumber the police/military -- it absolutely matters.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t control a populous by destroying them.</p>

<p>Do you really think the rest of the world would stand idly by while the US mass murders its own civilians without any due process? Or that the people within the military would follow through on these orders?</p>
