</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this in principle, very much so, but I think the idea of &quot;drilling it&quot; into kids is part of the problem with how we approach education and raising children in general. Kids are little sponges that pick up on everything their parents do, and take on a lot of the habits, mannerisms, and even dispositions of their parents. It&#39;s not that parents need to drill compassion into their kids; they need to practice it consistently in their interactions, while also explaining the importance of it. </p>

These are the kinds of kids you don&#39;t want to slip between the cracks, the best way you do that is through by legally forcing kids to go to school.</p>

<p>Not to mention he&#39;s 19 years old, an orphan and exhibited signs of mental instability since at least middle school. I don&#39;t think bullying or being a social outcast is why people do these things; I think being unhinged and unstable is why these people are typically social outcasts. </p>

<p>I think fellow children (and, by proxy, their parents) share a bit of the burden too, honestly. Our culture is too dog-eat-dog for my tastes, people lack concepts of solidarity and comparison, instead they&#39;re eager to position themselves on the social ladder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure. As much people on this sub rail against liberal/marxist indoctrination in the school system and especially post-secondary (and I agree it&#39;s a problem to an extent), there&#39;s a lack of actual focus on community. Allegiance is bred toward institutions and the state rather than solidarity with each other. </p>

<p>It is a culture problem, and not one I think can really be solved by having schools impose a solution in a top-down fashion. It has to start at the home. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong. Lets say he was a social outcast because he was unhinged and unstable. Kids aren&#39;t dumb. He would almost certainly be aware of being considered an outcast.  I don&#39;t see how forcing someone to continue in such a scenario could be beneficial to anyone.</p>
