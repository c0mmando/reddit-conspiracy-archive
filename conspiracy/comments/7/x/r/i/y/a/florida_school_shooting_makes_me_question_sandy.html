    <div class="md"><p>A survey done in 2012 listed kids between 8-10 years old that were provided a phone by their parents at 32% <a href="http://www.nclnet.org/survey_majority_of_tweeners_now_have_cell_phones_with_many_parents_concerned_about_cost">Source</a></p>

<p>It stands to reason younger kids had even less availability. And still it is much less likely for a 6-8 year old to record a mass shooting instead of cowering under their tables and fearing for their lives.</p>

<p>In addition to that the internet streaming platforms weren&#39;t an as massive thing as today yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fuck off, no security footage, a ban on anyone entering the building after or documenting anything, no fisa on the investigation, building gets demolished afterwards and not a single shred of evidence presented to the public. I&#39;m sorry but I for one like to question things not just accept what I&#39;m told as blind fact.

    <div class="md"><p>There is enough weird shit about sandy hook, that is why people have questions. The only ignorant fuck here is the one one bashing people asking questions on a conspiracy sub... fuck off. If my child was at sandy hook I would be asking a shit ton more questions than I am now and I&#39;d expect parents to be doing the same, not holding interviews where they are laughing and joking and then 2 seconds putting on their for camera crying face not realising the cameras caught the whole thing</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I found more interesting were the hundreds of kids being evacuated from the building where in Sandy Hook, it was the same dozen or so families circulating around the firehouse and no mass evacuation from the school.</p>

<p>The only pictures of the evacuation are the two that were taken a few days prior during a “drill” taken by the newspaper reporter.</p>
