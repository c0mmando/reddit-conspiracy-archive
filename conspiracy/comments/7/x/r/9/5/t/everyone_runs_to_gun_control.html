       But why isn’t the #1 thing to be brought up how easy it is to just walk into a school!? So many schools don’t even have locks on the doors during school hours you can just walk on in. To me this is the security that needs to happen ASAP. I don’t think every school should be filled with metal detectors and armed staff but geez a little reinforcement on actually getting into the school could go a long way I feel like. To my knowledge most of these shootings happen from an outside person coming into the school rather than bringing the weapon with them.

       Everyone runs to gun control?  All I see is people deflecting away from gun control.  Not sure what you're looking at.  Plus we've had zero gun control the last decade.

       1) Not “everyone” is running to gun control — only the usual Hollywood elites and democrat big-statists who all have armed bodyguards protecting them.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) You’re right about the fact that school campuses are wide open and anyone can walk in any time and do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The liberal elitists all call for gun control, but why does no one FINALLY start calling for armed police presence in schools. It would be a lot easier to post an armed police officer or security professional at every school, but the gun-fear crowd doesn’t want little snookums to have to look at a scary gun on the scary policeman’s belt as they walk down the hallway because guns are scary ... meanwhile, psychos are free to walk onto campus with an AR-15 and enough ammo to fight a fucking war.

       I am not American so hold no valid views on your gun control argument outside of just common sense stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe "taking guns away" is the right move.
I believe there is a problem with gun crime in your country. 
I believe no one in power on either side will ever actually push for real gun control.
I believe your pro-gun (im sorry I know this isn't the right term) Lobby holds far to much influence and power, Like all special interest groups)
      </p>
      <p>
       So the fact that it is easy enough for some wacko to get hold of an ar-15 isn't a problem worth mentioning? And your best suggestion to fix this kind of a problem is just put armed police on site?

       You have a better solution? If taking guns away — which isn’t even feasible as AR-15’s are as common as motorcycles in this country (I own one myself) — isn’t the answer, then how do we stop this from happening? Why shouldn’t we put armed guards in schools? Give me even one valid reason.

       Did I say don't do that? I asked is that honestly the best solution? There doesn't seem to be any interest in the underlying problems outside of the gun debate. Sure if it keeps kids safe and doesn't lead to more problems then fine do it. There also needs to be real studies into why this is happening again and again and address the root problems. But again you don't think it is worth mentioning that it is a problem that this kid could get hold of a weapon such as this?

       Having to bring more security to public places only acknowledges that we created a problem that we can't fix. If it's deemed necessary for multiple tactical men to be at my child's school to keep them safe I'd rather not send them to school at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people aren't expecting someone to take an AR15 to a school and shoot everyone but at the same time it's such an easy thing to do we've seen it become a phenomenon, everything is broken. America's gun culture is pervasive and unfortunate, we need to remember guns only exist to kill things.

       So since bringing in armed guards only acknowledges that we’ve allowed a situation to get way out of control (I agree), and you apparently don’t want to see that happen, what’s your solution? What can we do that will keep your children and mine safe in their school?

       Fundamentally change gun laws in ways that prevents this shit instead of furthering into a society that fears other human beings. It can happen but there is such adamant push against anything changing.

       I don’t think admitting that there is a problem we can’t fix is a bad thing. Ignoring it is the bad thing. I’m not saying there should be tons of armed guards and turn schools into prison but you should not and never should be allowed to just walk into a school. Not just because of shooting but kidnapping and all of that. There is no reason or excuse (that I can think of) as to why anyone can just walk into a school.

       Agreed. I have long called for metal detectors, armed guards, etc. It doesn’t have to turn the school into a prison but quite frankly with some of the other shit that goes on in American high schools it wouldn’t be a bad thing to watch the kids a little more closely, provide more protection, etc. If that means they have to go through metal detectors to get onto campus and there is at least one armed guard highly visible on campus, that would not be worse than 10 or 30 dead kids. The idea that a deranged mental deficient can buy an AR-15 is a problem, but in my view the fact that anyone can walk into a school or even get near one with a rifle is a bigger problem. Most of these shootings happen at schools. Terrorists were mostly hijacking and blowing up planes and attacking airports, so now airports are crawling with armed cops and there are stringent security measures. Why is this not happening in schools? Why are schools still wide open?

       The really big question about gun control is how we can prevent psychos from getting these weapons without the state then twisting and using that edict to keep

       Funny how much has changed, we used to think schools were a safe place to now we are questioning why we dont have better security. All because we cant stop sucking the dick of the nra and second amendment.

       I think it’s funny that I said in the OP how a lot of people run to gun control and that is exactly what this turned into. A debate on gun control. I want to know the reasoning on why anyone thinks it is okay for school doors to not be locked. I’m not talking about metal detectors or anything like that. Simple locking of doors and a page in type system.

       3 seconds? I’m not talking about a regular house lock where in the movies they just shoot it open. I’m talking about some actual security locks you don’t just shoot open. And the windows thing I’m sure someone would notice someone walking to the window with an AR-15. The fact that you’re trying to argue that no one should be able to just walk into a school goes to show that you’re probably a nut that would do something like this.

       I'm not for gun control, but is this really surprising? A large portion of the country, even a lot of law-abiding gun owners, are for increased regulations on how easy it is to obtain guns in the country. One of their arguments is that easy access to guns makes these mass shootings possible and frequent, so why wouldn't they bring up gun control when something that supports that argument happens?

       Yes, I feel that armed guards are the best solution, one that can be implemented in a short time and will help keep kids safe NOW as opposed to after a bunch of worthless studies have been done. We don’t need studies to tell us that young people with sociopathic proclivities seeing other people like themselves achieving great notoriety and fame in the press for carrying out these despicable shootings is what keeps them happening. Yes, it’s a problem that this kid could get an AR-15, and it’s a problem that the fucker in Texas got one even though he was legally barred from owning any firearm, even a single shot bolt rifle.
      </p>

       But again I ask, what do you think is the solution to keeping people like these wastes of life from acquiring weapons? Let’s hear your solution.

       There is no “solution” from stopping people from obtaining weapons. You can make it a little more difficult of course but if the gun is out there then will there’s a way to get it. I feel like stopping those people from getting near things like schools with the weapons is what needs to happen.

       Introduce all metallic objects through airlock style acceptance terminal in school.  Ban metallic objects on kids entering.  Deploy giant MRI type devices at entrances and exits.  Guess you'll probably have to seal up windows, and put building sized barricades to keep someone with a killdozer out too.  Don't forget the SAM on top to keep the planes away.

       Better question is why don't we run to mental health and what to do about it. What medications was he on? Why didn't anyone act on all the previous reporting of his sadistic behavior? If so many people knew there was something wrong with him then how did he even get the gun.  That is the type of gun control that is important.  It isn't important to take away everyone's guns. Some people should not be eligible to obtain weapons if they are not in a healthy mental state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Securing up schools isn't going to help.  Want to make it feel more like a prison? I'm sure that will help mental health.

       Again. I never said make it a prison or denying mental health issues. My point is that even with those things aside the most basic thing should be done and IMO should be this way without shootings and it’s to make it so no one can just openly walk in. It’s obviously not a 100% answer to everything but it’s a simple and damn good start.

       Most schools have admin at front entrances that stops people and keeps other entrances locked. They should anyway. Schools have a lot of windows though and there is nothing that can fix that.  Certain areas probably have requirements to see so much of the outside or let light in for mental health purposes already.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are still a lot of questions to be answered on why this wasn't prevented considering the information his peers and teachers knew.

       Several people keep bringing up windows but yet none of these shooters shoot out a window and enter that way. They walk right in the front door or another open entrance... you say most schools have admin at the entrance and what I’m saying is EVERY SCHOOL needs it. Not just some. These schools they are happening at they’re able to just walk right in and that should never be an option.

       How the hell is having the doors locked so people can’t just walked in resemble prison? Did I say have giant cement wall as with barbed wire on top? Nope. Did I say have them locked in a cell while armed security guards pace the halls? Nope. Did I say have them stripped naked and searched every morning? Nope. All I said was have the doors locked while school is in session with a page in system for outside visitors. How does that effect the students at all except provide them with a bit of added security knowing that someone with a gun can’t just open the front door and walk in. People lock their door at night before bed. Are their homes a prison? No they’re protecting their family and possessions. It isn’t a 100% solution but it’s an easy and good start.

       Have you been to a school?  They all have multiple points of entry.  Multiple buildings. And kids move between those buildings once per hour.  That is a whole hell of a lot of Locking and Unlocking, and you are forgetting the athletic fields.  Even with a fence, hop that and stroll on in.  Walk across the basketball court and you have easy access to 30+ kids per period.

       Yes, the only way would be to erect a 15 foot fence with Barbed wire to keep people out.  That is locking a school.  Is that what you are saying?

       Schools are easy targets.

       No. I’m saying these kids were in class in (to my knowledge) a one building contained high school but yet this person was able to walk right in pull the fire alarm and begin killing people. As I said it isn’t a 100% fool proof plan and each school would have to have different ways to which their doors lock it could easily be an automated system. Athletic fields? How many of these shootings are happening on the basketball court of the school? They’re happening inside. Why? Why not they can walk right in.

       Too much like a prison for my tastes.

       Automation is not the key.  And the Shootings are not on the Basketball Courts (Even though it is usually a good point to aim toward classroom windows from - Clear field of fire, able to choose your targets), the basketball courts are an easy point of entry. Actually easier than the parking lots of most schools due to the lack of people at them. Some schools have the Courts next to the parking lots, because of space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, locked doors, would make it harder for Fire Rescue to get in in case of a fire, earthquake, anthrax attack or Nuclear detonation.

       Well I’m sure the parents that are losing their children in these situations wouldn’t say it is “too prison like” the fact that you’re arguing about this just shows you’re part of the problem instead of part of the solution. Talking about what are good points to aim from. You’re just as fucked in the head as the ones commuting these crimes.

       Yes, that is why they wanted to hire me to stop them.  Got too many nightmares thinking up these things when I was recruited for the FBI. 
Good thing I went into entertainment instead.

       3 seconds? I’m not talking about a regular house lock where in the movies they just shoot it open. I’m talking about some actual security locks you don’t just shoot open. And the windows thing I’m sure someone would notice someone walking to the window with an AR-15. The fact that you’re trying to argue that no one should be able to just walk into a school goes to show that you’re probably a nut that would do something like this.

       I wish there was actually a real discussion happening instead of just outlandish rhetoric from both sides. People just want to be right and humiliate the opposition these days.

       I’m not 100% sure I’ve been out of school for nearly 15 years but when I was in school there was no coming and going as you pleased until maybe 12th grade you could get out early with a work release if your credits were above where they needed to be

       My kid just graduated.  Took classes at college at the same time and came in went multiple times a day.  Sure a non-student came in started a fight last year, so that may have now changed.
