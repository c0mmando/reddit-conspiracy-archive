        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;If you think that part of insanity involves doing the same thing over and over in the face of failure, then you have to wonder why nobody in CDC seems willing to front up to the fact that a teacher, vaccinated against the flu in October, caught two of the strains of the flu covered in the vaccine, and is now on life support, and prospects look grim for months-- and that what follows has to be insanity. </p>

<p>And all Schuchat, (who lied point blank to the public about measles in 2015) does is spread more alarm to prevent there being any vaccines left on the shelves at the end of &quot;flu season&quot;. The solution to the worsening of a situation caused by the vaccines, is--- more vaccines to more people. </p>

<p>She and her &quot;colleagues&quot; are clearly hoping that people don’t realize the blindingly obvious---which is that the vaccine’s is fatally flawed because it programs the body the wrong way, resulting in increased illness in recipients, who then spread more virus over a longer time. Bangs head against wall because I&#39;ve said it with PubMed ID numbers from peer reviewed medical literature until I am blue in the face. Does Schuchat even notice or even care about the fact, that the more people take up this vaccine, the worse the situation gets? Has she read any of the medical articles we have? If she has, then we must doubt her and her &quot;colleagues&#39;&quot; integrity, which I do.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are 2 things to look at.</p>

<p>first:</p>

<p>A very noteworthy <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/11/20/1314688110">study</a> was published in 2013, looking at baboons, which are susceptible and manifest whooping cough like humans do. In the study by Warfel, baboons who were either vaccinated or not vaccinated were later exposed to pertussis bacteria, something that cannot be done experimentally in humans (due to ethical considerations), but which yields very important data. Expectedly, the baboons that had never been infected got the cough and remained colonized with bacteria for a maximum of 38 days. Baboons that were previously vaccinated and immune vaccine-style, became colonized upon later exposure for a longer time than the naïve baboons; 42 days. However unvaccinated baboons that recovered naturally and were later exposed to the bacteria did not become colonized at all – zero days.</p>

<p>And 2:</p>

<p>Vaccines shift your immune system to an immune suppression type of state called the &quot;TH2 shift.&quot; That&#39;s what most vaccines do. They shift your immune system to a weaker, antibody type immune system... If you&#39;re injecting people with so many vaccines that your keeping them in this constant state --that now your switching everyone to this TH2 immune suppression-- then everyone becomes more susceptible [to infectious diseases]... and no one is talking about that. Now, a lot of scientists know that, but they are afraid to speak out because their careers would be ruined.</p>

<p>A balance of Th1/Th2 cells in the body is defined as IMMUNOSTASIS (or immune balance) and is required for optimum health and wellness.
Vaccines promote a failure in immunostasis by making the Th2-type cells dominant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, you&#39;re getting yourself mixed up. Th1 vs Th2 cells don&#39;t impact a reaction from a vaccine. All antibodies are produced through b cells. Th1 vs th2 cells are in reaction to what is invading your body. Th1 react to viral and bacterial, th2 counter helminth and work infections, but are also the cell type that induces allergies. I don&#39;t know where you got these ideas for immunostasis, but your body rapidly modifies t cells in different types and concentration all the time based on what your bodies defense needs. But even still, the antibody reaction comes from mature t cells, so you&#39;ve been mislead somewhere. If you wanna know more, let me know, my thesis for my PhD I&#39;m working on is based on Th1 vs Th2 development by noncoding rnas</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Th1 vs Th2 cells don&#39;t impact a reaction from a vaccine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Im sorry but that is not correct. If vaccines trained the immune system correctly,we wouldnt see the perpetual boosters as opposed to the long lasting immunity from a naturally acquired infection. Vaccines train the immune system incorrectly. When it comes to the th1 cell-mediated and th-2 antibody-mediated immunity imbalance, read Dr. Zaghouani study that also looks at epigenetics.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19846341">study done on mice by Dr. Zaghouani and his group in 2010</a></p>

<p>For those who want an summary and/or a video as explained by Dr. Humphries, see below.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.whale.to/c/11052379_1652175638351276_2780863733012411381_o.jpg">reference slide</a> for paragraph below</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;What he did is he got newborn mice and he injected them with antigen, no aluminum at all, just antigen, and he injected them when they were very young obviously. Now these are dendritic cells here, and they are specifically immature dendritic cells, and normally as an adult if you get injected, you&#39;re going to make massive amounts of interleukin12 and something different will happen. But what happened to this 1 day old mouse, it only made little bits kind of sputtering through this interleukin 12. I mentioned before the baby&#39;s immune system is fully capable of responding. it can respond through Th1 and it can respond through Th2. The thing is, If it&#39;s stimulated early, you get this funny receptor on the Th1 cell. Antigen injection, Th1 cells coming about, and it has this funny receptor. Baby&#39;s vaccinated, everything looks fine, It makes antibody. Nobody knows there is a problem. This is really important. Because all reactions and problems don&#39;t occur and become obvious right away. Then they revaccinated this same mouse as an adult. What they found is that again, it mounted a Th1 and a Th2 response. But because of the way it had been programmed earlier, the Th2 cells basically killed off the Th1 cells. Homocide style.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.whale.to/c/10477352_1652176921684481_4475572747679192065_o.jpg">reference slide</a> for paragraph below</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;This is the second part of the experiment. What they did is they looked at different days, and they found that on day 6 something special happened. So we have the 1 day old mouse that we did not vaccinate. We waited until day 6 when there was much more variety of dendritic cells and they had different kinds of receptors. There was a much more mature array of dendritic cells. They vaccinated that 6 day old mouse. What they found was normal reaction. They had nice high levels of interleukin 12, Normal Th1 and Th2 development. And then later when they restimulated with the same injected anitgen. They had a normal Th1 and Th2 response. This is important because what he saw in these mice, is what we see in the outcome in humans. When the vaccine is done early, even with just an antigen, and no adjuvant, in one of those windows of opportunity, something interesting happens, as I just showed you. So now you can see, how the abnormal response in the adult occurred because as a young mouse it was vaccinated with just antigen, injected antigen, that&#39;s important. This involved an epigenetically hypomethylated area on the immune cells, which is part of that clamp system that we talked about. The mouse vaccinated too early had its immune system skewed toward Th2 and can do nothing about it for the rest of its life. You might say well let&#39;s leave it until kids get older if that&#39;s a problem. A 0-6 day old rodent is estimated to be around 0-8 months in human years.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so you are correct, but the problem is youre a little behind in the current research. Since 2010, our understanding of the development of the neonatal immune response has grown immensely thanks to our understanding of varied T cell types. Many people were looking into the dichotomy, but we have expanded to studying numerous other T cell groups in the last 8 years, specifically one of the largest impactful groups is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952791516300292">T follicular helper cells</a> with one of the best graphics describing the maturation of a memory B cell (which produces long term antibodies in figure 2.</p>

<p>Beyond this, we have much more effectively understood how development of varied immune cells occurs in different species over time. 8 years ago we knew that an initial IL12 response was ideal, but we didnt necessarily know where it was coming from because dendritic cells weren&#39;t particularly active in early development. Thanks to developments in flow cytometry (how we view what youre referring to as those different kinds of receptors), they can more accurately describe each of the small cell subsets. You can see in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471490614000799">figure 1 here</a> how the different subsets have been more refined in their timing of development in a fetus, specifically NK cell immaturity, and eventual maturity, along with the immediate impact of Tregs, which is still a pretty intensely studied field, and helped to lead to the development of some of the new T cell cancer therapies. There are more papers responding to the one you posted, and I&#39;m incredibly glad you are going digging through papers like this. If you cannot get to any of the papers, dm me and I can find a way to get them to you.</p>

<p>But in the mean time, know that a lot research, especially in immunology, made huge shifts around 2010 and 2012, thanks to developments in flow cytometry and our understanding of T cell development. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a question.  As a soon-to-be medical professional, how do I learn about this and stay somewhat on top of the research?  My school gave us material that was rather old, and I don&#39;t know how to stay on top of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, sorry to just get to this now! but it kind of depends on what part of the medical professional you are going in to. The only people that need to be up on the last 3 years of research are either medical researchers, or physicians. I cannot give you great advice for physicians, but as a research biologist, the best thing is to use your university&#39;s internet (they pay for subscriptions to major providers for publications), and go to ncbi.com. Search a topic, and in the upper left hand side of the page you can limit your search to reviews. </p>

<p>Primary research is great for finding very minute detail about a certain topic. Reviews are the best, because its a broader viewpoint of a certain topic, written by an expert related to those studies. So the difference is &quot;How do TH2 cells use IL5 to induce histamine production&quot; vs a review which is &quot;what do the different T cell groups do&quot;. I would advise starting at reviews, and if theres a top you really like, they have to cite most major topic points, and most reviews have ~100 to 200 citations. So once you find something you want to know more about, go to the citations in the review. 
Some people really prefer to go to certain journals, like cell, science, nature, but I find its better to also view some of the lesser publications, that you can easily find through reviews.</p>

<p>Also, if you go into research, get a good publication repository software. I love readcube, because they give you general recommendations on papers you may want based off of what you have saved. so I hope this helps, let me know if you have more questions!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks!  I&#39;m in school to be a doctor.  I have pretty open access to most journals and databases through my school, but I don&#39;t know how to keep up to date with current immunology research.  I&#39;m specifically interested in gut/immune/nervous system balance, and the delicate interplay between neurogenic inflammation and biome tolerance, but I am also greatly interested in the TH1/TH2 balance and how it interrelates with human development and eventual disease pathogenesis.</p>

<p>A somewhat-generalized periodic &quot;immunology update for the primary care doctor&quot; would be amazing, I just have no idea where to find such material.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>good luck dude, med schools a bitch, and you have asshole teaching assistants like me you have to put up with hahahahaha. But seriously, ncbi reviews based on &quot;microbiome, T cell development/polarization, innate immunity, adaptive immunity&quot; all good places to start. </p>

<p>And dont get me wrong, all the coolest and newest shit is great, but nothing beats the good old janeway textbook. That thing has so much knowledge you will get most professors that dont know all of whats in it. So dont be afraid to go back  to textbooks.

    <div class="md"><p>The flu shot screws up your immune system. You know how people get the flu shot, then they get sick? It&#39;s because according to this placebo controlled study, you are 5 times more likely to catch a non-flu respiratory illness if you&#39;ve had the flu shot. Your cell-mediated immunity takes a back seat for several weeks. </p>

<p>And according to this study that just came out a couple weeks ago, if you&#39;ve had the flu shot and you catch the flu anyway, you will have INCREASED viral aerosol generation. As in, airborne shedding of your flu on people when you breathe.</p>

<p>&quot;vaccination with both the current and previous year’s seasonal vaccines, however, was significantly associated with greater fine-aerosol shedding in unadjusted and adjusted models (P &lt; 0.01).&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m interested to know if there is a reason the vaccine is targeting the wrong strain, when Australia already targeted the wrong strain. Typically, the flu strain that hits Australia then strikes US the following winter. So if they know Australia targeted the wrong strain, and they had half a year to prepare, and knew the current strain, why did they STILL make vaccinations for the same strain? Has any excuse been publicised?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So two things: first we ar getting better, but much of the money the nih was pushing in vaccine development was to accrue techniques that allowed for massive production effectively, as well as making production of the vaccines cheaper. Nih will always send out requests for areas of research, and for a long time those have been the major focal points that got funded. It wasn&#39;t until the last few years the concept of quicker production had received higher funding. Second: the flu will never go away. Between it&#39;s ability to manifest in fowl, pigs, and humans, the antigenic drift possibilities make it wildly variable, as compared to many diseases. So they are getting better, but research takes time, and money</p>

<p>What viruses will the 2017-2018 flu vaccines protect against?</p>

<p>There are many different flu viruses and they are constantly changing. The composition of U.S. flu vaccines is reviewed annually and updated as needed to match circulating flu viruses. Flu vaccines protect against the three or four viruses (depending on vaccine) that research suggests will be most common. For 2017-2018, three-component vaccines are recommended to contain:</p>

<p><strong>an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (updated)</strong></p>

<p><strong>an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus</strong></p>

<p>a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus</p>

<p>Quadrivalent (four-component) vaccines, which protect against a second lineage of B viruses, are recommended to be produced using the same viruses recommended for the trivalent vaccines, as well as a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>80% of the dozens of children who have died so far this year were unvaccinated for the flu. The point of the shot is to <em>reduce your chances</em> of dying from the flu, as demonstrated by the numbers this year.  For already-sick children, their risk of death from contracted influenza is at least halved by the flu vaccine, for healthy children, the risk is reduced by 2/3rds <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2017/03/30/peds.2016-4244?sso=1&amp;amp;sso_redirect_count=1&amp;amp;nfstatus=401&amp;amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token">citation</a>. </p>

<p>The flu vaccine is never a perfect protector. It reduces <em>risk</em> of 1) getting the flu and 2) dying because of it. There&#39;s a nonzero chance of both of those whatever your vaccination state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a few things we need to make sense of this percentage. First, we don&#39;t know the percentage of children overall that have been immunized this year for an accurate comparison. Second, the doctor you cited noted that half the children had pre-existing health issues. What percentage of those were unvaccinated <em>due to their condition</em>? Third, it is important to note that children are classified as unvaccinated if they received the vax within two weeks of becoming ill. </p>

<p>These questions might sound nitpicky, but we are talking about fewer than 60 kids and knowing the answers could tell a drastically different story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good questions. There are public data available that though that get towards some answers. </p>

<p>For your first question, if you look at the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/coverage-1617estimates.htm">Flu Vaccination Coverage, United States, 2016-17 Influenza Season</a>, vaccination rates have been fairly steady over the past 7 seasons, and with no specific mention by the CDC news releases of precipitously lower vaccination rates this year, it&#39;s safe to assume that rates from  2017-2018 are comparable to last year. </p>

<p>For your second question, the same link table 3 shows that across adults with high risk conditions, there is a higher rate of vaccination than their peers. The CDC is also recommending the flu vaccine for all high risk groups, with the rare exception of specific life-threatening allergies, so ideally people won&#39;t be medically advise against vaccination due to their conditions. For people with CF, where an upper respiratory infection can be fatal, they are far more likely to have had the flu vaccine. </p>

<p>For third, until two weeks after a vaccine, you&#39;re functionally unvaccinated, ie antibody titers haven&#39;t increased yet. So the CDC counted them an unprotected. An enrichment in deaths from 0-2 weeks post vaccination would stick out in analysis, ideally the raw data would have been posted along with the study, but there could have been identifiability concerns re: the children. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s going to be a lot more than 60 kids by the end of the season. With confidence, most of them will be unvaccinated. Despite this, parents are going to continue to be told that the vaccine does nothing, even though an <em>overwhelming majority</em> of pediatric deaths are unvaccinated. </p>

<p>So did those kids die because they were unvaccinated?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I might be missing your point here because it&#39;s getting late. 3 Black non-Hispanic pediatric deaths were vaccinated, 36 Black non-Hispanic pediatric deaths were unvaccinated. This group&#39;s rate of vaccination is <a href="http://www.jiph.org/article/S1876-0341(13">50%</a>00003-8/fulltext) - <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/coverage-1516estimates.htm">60.9%</a>. If there was no protection from the vaccine, you&#39;d expect 50-60% of these deaths to be vaccinated,  not 8% like in this study.  </p>

<p>Any study&#39;s going to have caveats, but what the CDC does is accumulate the evidence and strength of claim from hundreds of these types of articles. One hospital study is one data point, your linked study is listed with the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/publications.htm">others</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your comment. I hope I&#39;m understanding you now, since it&#39;s early and I haven&#39;t quite woken up yet lol. </p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m saying is think of the difference between two types of nonvaxxer parents:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The college-educated, makes a good living parent, who made the conscious decision not to vaccinate after seeing vaccine injured kids and researching? </p></li>
<li><p>The parent struggling to get by, eating cheap food, dropping their kid at an overcrowded daycare, and just doesn&#39;t have the time off work or transportation to get their kid to the pediatrician appointment to vaccinate? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think those two kids would handle the flu quite differently despite the same vaccination status. </p>

<p>Your link about black people&#39;s rate of vaccination still doesn&#39;t tell us if those non vaxxers were parent #1 or parent #2. So that&#39;s why I think socioeconomic status is a more important factor than race. </p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Poverty and stress is correlated with sickness and immune function.

<p>This may be a reflection not only of vaccine effectiveness but also the population of children who are more likely to get the vaccine.</p>

<p>i.e. if parents of sickly kids (eg those with bad asthma) are more likely to vaccinate (which they are), then in those cases where the vaccine doesn&#39;t work those kids will have more issues.</p>

Here is one of my favorite studies that just testes the vaccines (no additives) on rats and find that over or heavy vaccination can cause auto-immune disorders in rats by over-stimulating the immune system. This begs for more research to be done.

    <div class="md"><p>Ive told thos story before I believe, but 4 or so years ago.. a year after the swine flu scare, a friend of mine who had gotten the swine flu jab months earlier died from swine flu. Age: 32 or 33.</p>

<p>I actually just watched a pro vax episode of SVU the other day. Straight propaganda. It has kids getting the measels because of a holisitic mom blogger and dr faking paper work and then it went after people who want to wait because the pro vax protagonists son was exposed the day after he was innoculated and she lamented waiting until he was 15 months instead of 12 or something. So it even went after people who want to wait and give their kid some time to develop and build immunity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry friend, a lot of immunity is in your gut, and antibiotics kill off that good gut bacteria. </p>

<p>BUT, viruses deplete your vitaminC and other antioxidants, which makes you susceptible to bacterial infections. So maybe you&#39;re getting secondary bacterial infections and the antibiotics are helping with that :)</p>

<p>Next time you&#39;re sick, if you want, I recommend high dose ascorbic acid all throughout the day and night. Only with lots of hydration of course. Here&#39;s a doctor who explains it <a href="https://youtu.be/VkkWDDSti_s">https://youtu.be/VkkWDDSti_s</a></p>

If you are coming down with flu symptoms (cough, post-nasal drip, etc.) and can catch it early and start Tamiflu, it supposedly halts the development of the virus. If you wait until you&#39;re already super sick though it doesn&#39;t really do much. This is second hand knowledge though and I might be wrong.</p>

How much money did the federal government spend on this shot that seems to be useless?</p>

<p>They do not even test for the actual strain of the flu either.  How do they even know which one is going around, just test for A or B.  Probably because they don&#39;t want it to be some obvious that the type they project is fucking useless against reality.</p>

<p>I am NOT AT ALL anti vax.  However, the flu shot is a fucking scam.</p>

<p>This teacher probably was prescribed tamiflu which is only effective if taken early on in the course of the flu, much like valtrex would would be most effective against a herpes outbreak early on in an outbreak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>heres the problem I have. While I agree with your sentiment towards the flu vaccine and I myself am also against it, you seem to use &quot;facts&quot; in your arguments that don&#39;t seem to be true. And that makes it hard to consider the argument. </p>

<p>First off, and I am only going off the article you posted, it says she contracted H1N1 and H3N2.  </p>

<p>According to the CDC&#39;s website, this years vaccine included:</p>

<p>an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus (updated)
an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus
a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus</p>

<p>Now I will admit, I am unsure if an H1N1 #like virus would be the same thing as an actual H1N1 infection. </p>

<p>If it would NOT be the exact same thing, than her being vaccinated with this years recommendation would not have covered the strains she got. </p>

<p>However maybe someone else knows better about this and whether those two should have been blocked by the vaccination. </p>

<p>The second thing that irks me is that you state this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which is that the vaccine’s is fatally flawed because it programs the body the wrong way, resulting in increased illness in recipients, who then spread more virus over a longer time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are you basing that off of? How does it program the body the wrong way? From what I understand of the flu vaccine, each year the CDC decides on the few strains of the flu virus that they expect to be prevalent that year. They are not always accurate. But that doesnt change how the vaccine itself works. </p>

<p>Are you stating that the Flu vaccine does not actually work like typical vaccines do, and if so, do you have some information that led you to this discovery?</p>

<p>There are many things I dont trust about the whole flu vaccine business ranging from whats actually in them, what sort of harm some of those components can do, why they are pushing it so hard and specifically stating that only the inject able kind is ok and the inhaled one should be avoided. To me it doesnt seem like the general publics health is the only thing they are &quot;concerned&quot; with.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure who downvoted you. Your questions are valid!</p>

<p>To be honest idk about the H1N1 thing. This is from Dr. Suzanne Humphries facebook. She responds to messages very quickly though, so if you ask her directly I would love to hear what she says!</p>

<p>Now for the programming of the immune system. What happens is, killed vaccines cause what&#39;s called a Th2 dominance. It creates antibodies (humoral immunity) but compromises your cellular immunity, particularly at the lung interface, and so when you do catch a different respiratory virus (as <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/54/12/1778/455098/Increased-Risk-of-Noninfluenza-Respiratory-Virus">this study</a> claims you&#39;re 5× more likely to catch if vaccinated) or the flu (because like you said it mutates so much), you spread it more than if you had not been vaccinated for it. Like <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/17/1716561115">this Jan 18th study</a>
 showed, those students shed the flu in their exhaled breath 6.3× more. 
When you get the flu, the real battle of immunity happens at the lung interface, not in the bloodstream. Humoral immunity doesn&#39;t usually kick in until later. So if the vaccine temporarily gives you a Th2 dominance, you are at risk for getting sicker than you usually would, and you&#39;re going to spread it more. </p>

<p>Does that make sense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was in the same boat.  I was a chronic mess for several years.  When I stopped eating meat (for unrelated, personal reasons), I accidentally became the healthiest person in the family.  The last year and a half has changed my life, healthwise, and I just sort of accidentally stumbled into it.</p>

<p>I&#39;d stopped taking flu shots 10+ years ago because of the constant &quot;get the shot -&gt; immediately get sick&quot; cycle, but I was still getting nasty respiratory/flu conditions in the following years.  It wasn&#39;t any <em>worse</em> than when I was getting vaccines, but it wasn&#39;t much better either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>good luck dude, med schools a bitch, and you have asshole teaching assistants like me you have to put up with hahahahaha. But seriously, ncbi reviews based on &quot;microbiome, T cell development/polarization, innate immunity, adaptive immunity&quot; all good places to start. </p>

<p>And dont get me wrong, all the coolest and newest shit is great, but nothing beats the good old janeway textbook. That thing has so much knowledge you will get most professors that dont know all of whats in it. So dont be afraid to go back  to textbooks. Also, in the future if you get very boned by something, keep my username, and i will help if I can </p>
