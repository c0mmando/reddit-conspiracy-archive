       These have to be high profile, black &amp; white, out in the open examples that highlight (not necessarily prove) there's something shady going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       My best one would be naming Obama the Nobel Peace Prize winner after being the most bomb-happy President in history. Now, obviously, Obama doesn't run the show but being that he's a figurehead or puppet for this Shadow Hand, the fact that during his term his cabinet authorised tens of thousands of bombs to be dropped whilst being hypocritically labeled as a Peace Prize winner is a direct slap in the face to us, the people. And really stands out as being an obvious corruptive move just to mock us and drive it home that we can't do much to stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have more examples but don't want to keep the spotlight on me so help me compile this list. Maybe it can be stickied if enough good information is presented here and can be used to actually convince some people who would've otherwise not seen or believed it.

       I can't find anything and may have been mistaken or gotten that impression for some reason but didn't verify the claim. So I've edited my original comment to admit that I may(most likely) was wrong.
 All that I found was  Julian Assange(wiki-leaks) claiming that Bernie was threatened

       Geeze, the sheer volume of evidence is immense -- have you even looked? The evidence from the DNC leaks was already quite compelling, showing ostensibly neutral DNC officials

       against Bernie Sanders. Multiple top DNC officials didn't

        resign
       </a>
       for nothing. But then it really got busted wide open when
       <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/11/02/clinton-brazile-hacks-2016-215774">
        Donna Brazile
       </a>
       came out and confirmed a lot of that and more, including the
       <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/memo-reveals-details-hillary-clinton-dnc-deal-n817411">
        agreement
       </a>
       between the Clinton campaign and DNC signed back in 2015 granting the campaign significant control over the party's operations. There has been a lot of DNC/media damage control to try and minimize the significance of all of these revelations -- unsurprisingly, since otherwise they'd have to actually admit they're cheating liars -- terrible PR.
       <a href="https://fair.org/home/with-dnc-leaks-former-conspiracy-theory-is-now-true-and-no-big-deal/">
        It's the same old tired pattern of desperate, dishonest PR spin:
       </a>
       first, dismiss the allegations as a wild, outlandish conspiracy theory. Then, once incontrovertible evidence of that conspiracy emerges, pivot to asserting that it's no big deal, totally unsurprising, already old news.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the facts really speak for themselves, no matter how much partisan hacks try and gaslight the people they actively misled and screwed over.

       You mean one that had nothing to do with the primaries? From your article "However, the memo also made clear that the arrangement pertained to only the general election, not the primary season, and it left open the possibility that it would sign similar agreements with other candidates."

       This seems like Hillary had her ducks in a row about running early on, not anything about rigging.

       The facts dont speak for themselves and really, you writing off any criticisms of your claims as "political hacks" shows a preemptive defensiveness around your ideas. This points to you being afraid to be questioned on suspect "proof"

       Well, you clearly weren't interested in a good-faith discussion, or you wouldn't be responding with the exact same misleading propaganda DNC officials and their media allies have been using to try and deflect attention away from their deception. My so-called "defensiveness" comes from the fact that this kind of gaslighting is
       <em>
        constantly
       </em>
       used against people who point out the obvious here and demand actual accountability. This pathetic dodging of accountability is systemic and fucking ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, although the claim was widely circulated in the media, it was
       <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/11/05/four-viral-claims-spread-by-journalists-on-twitter-in-the-last-week-alone-that-are-false/">
        completely false
       </a>
       that the agreement applied only to the general election.
      </p>
      <p>
       You of course also ignored the fact that the DNC leaks didn't just show "annoyance", but even brainstorming ideas for how to attack
       <em>
        one of their own candidates
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And seriously, no one who isn't a partisan hack cares one bit about the "he's not even a Democrat!" line. Bernie voters wanted to
       <em>
        change
       </em>
       the Democratic Party because the Democratic Party is hopelessly out-of-touch and shamelessly corrupted by corporate interests. That was kind of the whole point. If the Democratic Party was more like Bernie Sanders, maybe they wouldn't have been hemorrhaging seats and support since 2009.

       You've already given yourself away as totally uninterested in good-faith discussion, instead blatantly misrepresenting facts to protect the guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       People know. You can keep on denying it to try to gaslight people into falling in line with the same old tired lies, but the jig is up. The sooner you and your ilk reconcile yourselves with that -- the sooner the DNC starts trying to
       <em>
        earn
       </em>
       trust back instead of trying to manipulate people into thinking they were never betrayed -- the better. Just some friendly advice.

       100million people as of which year? Current? Cause there are 350 mil in my city alone, and tracing my lineage, I'm only related to 7. We don't all have the same job.

       So. You've got a singular bloodline, and you've got fraternities that every president has taken part in, with deep occult ritual initiation.

       Are you arguing that grooming of presidents in America doesn't exist?
Are you arguing that we're all blood related? Do the work and update me. Im happy to be proven wrong, love to see things in a better light.

       Did your family grow up in that area? Because if so you’re related to far more than 7 people. You and I are related. Every human on this planet has a common ancestor, likely around 3000 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude only like 20 or so presidents have been in fraternities. And of those a lot were honorary members, so yes I’m going to disagree with that based off the fact that it’s factually inaccurate. Do you think Ford was groomed? Because that’s a real weird way to groom the president, just kinda slipping in and serving half a term.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the presidents are related by blood in exactly the way I described: they are also related to 100m other people by blood.

       Sorry, I didn't mean to come off so hot headed. Seriously would like more information on all this. I understand we all have common ancestors, but I believe the degrees of separation between the presidents are all lesser than average.

       Historian Antony Sutton (of the Hoover Institute) wrote a great book called "Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution". He uses declassified documents, memos and cables to prove that the "monopoly capitalist" class in America (and Britain) bankrolled the 1911 Chinese revolution, the 1914 Mexican revolution, the 1903 Panamanian revolt against Colombia, and, yes, the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       These men were not themselves Bolsheviks. But they wanted people in power who were committed to "destroying the social order in Russia". As a result of the ensuing chaos, they could swoop in and sign monopolistic agreements with the new government, get access to Russia's natural resources and stripmine the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their real (long-term) goal was not Communism, but Technocracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things that they were doing in Russia were beta-testing for social experiments they would later roll out in the West.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sutton talks about the Hegelian dialectic (of thesis + antithesis equaling synthesis), and how these same interests funded both pro-capitalist organizations and pro-Communist organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       He ends the book with: "What is the purpose of these pincer tactics? Can they be related to the Marxian axiom: these versus antithesis yields synthesis? It is a puzzle why the Marxist movement would attack Capitalism head-on if its objective was a Communist world and if it truly accepted the dialectic. If the objective is a Communist world--that is, if Communism is the desired synthesis--and capitalism is the thesis, then something apart from capitalism or communism  has to be the antithesis. Could therefore capitalism be the thesis and communism the antithesis, with the objective of the revolutionary groups and their backers being a synthesizing of these two systems into some world system yet undescribed?"
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is: It
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       been described. It's called Technocracy. And we're seeing one erected now in China, with internet censorship. With "social approval" ratings created by algorithms tied into your social media usage and remarks. Chinese people who fall afoul of the government suddenly find that they don't "qualify" to purchase airplane tickets to desired destinations. They have a separate ring-tone on their phones, so that others know that they're "untouchables," etc. China is the new Technocratic model that's being rolled out, prior to a wider implementation of this system in the West. Ultimately it will be the template for the coming One World Government that these people have been working on for a century, with crypto-currencies as the new money.

       The Scarlett Letter was put on a fornicator by the church, though. Not the State.
      </p>
      <p>
       Securlar governments in the modern era don't based their authority on a claim that God gave them power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Technocracy is taking over roles traditionally occupied by the church. And that's chilling. Because the implication is that the State is now [effectively] God.

       I think you're mis-remembering. The Scarlett Letter was of course fiction, but based on real New England government punishments. Also included in that time were punishments like the stockade.  But the letter was applied in the Boston Customs house by the metropolitan government.

       Ah, as I remembered it, the government at the time was out of London, England, and that the Puritans had fled to the colonies precisely because they wanted to impose their religion on others and were working outside of the secular system (back in Great Britain).

        Footnote: "Amongst these documents we shall notice, as especially characteristic, the code of laws promulgated by the little State of Connecticut in 1650. *p The legislators of Connecticut *q begin with the penal laws, and, strange to say, they borrow their provisions from the text of Holy Writ. "Whosoever shall worship any other God than the Lord," says the preamble of the Code, "shall surely be put to death." This is followed by ten or twelve enactments of the same kind, copied verbatim from the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy. Blasphemy, sorcery, adultery, *r and rape were punished with death; an outrage offered by a son to his parents was to be expiated by the same penalty. The legislation of a rude and half-civilized people was thus applied to an enlightened and moral community. The consequence was that the punishment of death was never more frequently prescribed by the statute, and never more rarely enforced towards the guilty." --De Tocqueville, "Democracy in America," 1835

       Precisely. We not only set aside a black budget that's immune from audits, but we jump through hoops to hide tons of other money flow. That's a literal conspiracy in and of itself, but it's also an indicator of the depth of back channel dealings going on.

       I never knew you could get a Nobel prize for actions not yet taken but assumed will be taken in the near future. Thanks Obama! Perhaps they felt that he needed something to fill the walls with next to his Harvard diploma.

       My best one would be naming Obama the Nobel Peace Prize winner after being the most bomb-happy President in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama got the award within the first year of his election. Still odd that he got the award for just being elected president but this was way before the drone strikes.
