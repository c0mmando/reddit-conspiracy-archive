<p>Not outside the realm of possibility, so people that are going to agree with that move will likely take it as true, upvote, and move on. But this is a blatant lie created by &quot;Baxter Demitry&quot; whom I&#39;m convinced is likely a collective on YNW.</p>

<p>Using this logic, this is precisely why NYT and WaPo should be allowed. If they&#39;re CIA-targeted propaganda, our community should be greatly interested in analyzing them and breaking them down.</p>

<p>Whereas YNW is a &quot;tabloid&quot; (if not downright trash), and analyzing it yields no meaningful discourse or intellectual gains. It brings nothing to this community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No; there is a stark difference between bias and falsehood.  If every time a newspaper published an untruth, they got banned, we might as well pull the copper from our walls.  </p>

<p>The NYT article where they exaggerate whether Trump lies a lot, is the truth that Trump doesn&#39;t lie a lot?  No.</p>

<p>The WaPo article where they conclude that Russia hacked the power grid was corrected.  It&#39;s obvious that most people will read the uncorrected story, and few will see the correction, but this isn&#39;t a systemic issue with WaPo writing bullshit and then correcting it.</p>

<p>YNW maintains their truth that Sarah Silverman is eating dead fetuses, and has a Nostradamus prediction page.  It&#39;s a tabloid.</p>

<p>My position is not that YNW should be banned, but this sub banned direct links to CNN because pro-Trump elements have mirrored Trump&#39;s call that they&#39;re fake news.  If we&#39;re going to start banning (read: forcing links to be through an archive to prevent ad revenue) news sources, why not ban the ones suggesting Beyonce blew a random in a toilet to suck the demons out through his dick.</p>

<p>I never suggested otherwise, but bias can be far more insidious.  Falsehoods tend to be easily dismissed, but bias can be hidden.</p>

<p>Yes, the corporate media leans heavily to the left.  Yes, they jumped the shark this past election season, first by giving Trump a billion dollars worth of free advertising during the primaries (due to team Hillary&#39;s epic miscalculation that Trump would be her easiest foil), then grossly underestimating the general push back against the PC armies of North America.  </p>

<p>I always find this so strange, as it&#39;s rarely true.

<p>Are these small town channels &quot;corporate media&quot;?  I don&#39;t believe so, not even a little bit, but Trump supporters shit on NPR every chance they get.</p>

<p>Nothing is de-funded yet, but let&#39;s look at the cable line up (I may be missing a few since i cut the cord years ago)....the left has CNN, MSNBC, CBS, ABC, NBC, NPR.  The &#39;right&#39; has FOX News.  The aforementioned outlets are where the vast majority of this country consumes its infotainment.</p>

<p>Disagree.  NPR lambasted Obama frequently.  They bring on white house staffers constantly to introduce Trump policy in such a partisan way, and the host will rarely if ever challenge.

    <div class="md"><p>I have extreme issues with the Washington Post and New York Times, and absolutely agree that they publish stories meant to propagandize on behalf of the US government, and on behalf of corporate interests. Some stories are downright false. </p>

<p>That being said, both of those outlets also publish a <em>great</em> deal of real news, and have histories of doing revelatory, thorough, and substantive journalism. Just two examples: in 2005, the New York Times published a piece by James Risen <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/bush-lets-us-spy-on-callers-without-courts.html?mtrref=undefined&amp;amp;gwh=C245DC3C22A32729F2A194D6A340027C&amp;amp;gwt=pay">exposing the Bush Administration&#39;s warrantless wiretapping under the NSA</a>; the piece got Risen prosecuted under both the Bush and Obama presidencies.</p>

<p>In 2013, The Guardian and the Washington Post jointly published revelations about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html">Project PRISM</a>.</p>

<p>Both of these were huge stories, and were of particular import to the conspiracy-minded among us.</p>

<p>On the other hand, YourNewsWire is a factory of endless, abject trash that is often completely fictional. Nearly no real journalism of any merit comes from this website; anyone can write, and it&#39;s used as a clickbait farm.</p>

<p>Comparing it to the New York Times and Washington Post is intellectually dishonest, at best.</p>

<p>I have tremendous issues with the NYT and WaPo. Most of the time, I&#39;m criticizing people for accepting poorly written articles (that rely on anonymous sources with no documentary evidence) as fact. I&#39;m with you on being vigorously skeptical of those outlets; but neither one is an inane bullshit factory that churns out 100% false stories almost constantly. YourNewsWire is.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing that you should trust them. Every article I read, I critically assess and constantly question, and I interrogate what their sources are, what their cited data is, and what facts they employ to make their point. We shouldn&#39;t blindly &quot;trust&quot; <em>any</em> news outlet.</p>

<p>YourNewsWire isn&#39;t a news outlet. It&#39;s a bullshit farm with <em>completely false</em>, utterly absurd news stories like <a href="http://yournewswire.com/katy-perry-cannibalism/">Katy Perry lauding cannibalism</a> and <a href="http://yournewswire.com/beyonce-shapeshifting-serena-williams/">Beyonce shapeshifting</a>. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not arguing on behalf of the NYT and WaPo. I&#39;m saying that YourNewsWire contributes literally nothing to the discussion around here, is filled with fantastical (if not downright insane) bullshit, and has <em>zero</em> history of reporting real news. You can&#39;t conflate it with actual newspapers, even if the latter are propagandized or manipulated.</p>

<p>&quot;David Brock’s Media Matters for America appears to be granting hundreds of thousands of dollars in charitable funds to political groups that are trying to impeach the president and unseat Republicans across the nation.</p>

<p>Brock’s Media Matters for America is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization that has tax-exempt status. That tax-exempt status comes with an important caveat: the non-profit is barred from participating in political activity–funding or otherwise–that is in support or opposition to a candidate for office.&quot;</p>
