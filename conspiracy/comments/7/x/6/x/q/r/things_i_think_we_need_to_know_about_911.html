       So the government fucked up and was unable to intercept known hijacked aircrafts headed towards New York, the Pentagon, and another close to the White House. The military was running war games during the attacks. There are plot holes all over the place.
      </p>
      <p>
       • If
       <em>
        jet fuel can't melt steel beams
       </em>
       isn't taken seriously, how did molten iron exist in pools for weeks after the buildings collapsed? At a higher temperature than jet fuel can burn?
      </p>
      <p>
       • Many witnesses reported explosions heard in the basements of the towers. If a bomb went off, why does the public need to be sheltered from that information?
      </p>
      <p>
       • Two WTC buildings were hit by planes and three buildings collapsed at freefall speed. If WTC7 contained floors for government organizations, it'd make sense to destroy it in the event the area was compromised by hostile terrorists. Why not just say that?
      </p>
      <p>
       • Can we see any footage of the Pentagon getting hit? There's no reason why just a few frames from a terrible camera are the only evidence we can get. Why is it so classified?
      </p>
      <p>
       • Did anyone own up to the fact some of the claimed hijackers were alive and well? And a hijacker's passport was found undamaged?
      </p>
      <p>
       • The 9/11 Commission was a joke. Why couldn't the president and VP testify separately?
      </p>
      <p>
       • How were plane crash victims identified by fingerprints if everything was vaporized?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot more. I don't know what happened but I know I've been lied to. And for what?

       It has put us into a solid war footing.

      <p>
       Watching the gulf war in the 90's, it felt like a trial mission,  to gauge the Americans public reaction.

      <p>
       Now we have something better than the war on drugs,  the war on terror.

       The site was cleaned almost immediately. What kind of PR is letting the public believe one of the most heavily-protected buildings can be hit by a hijacked airplane? At least missiles are designed to hit those types of targets.

       Same deal with the plane that apparently was brough down by the passengers that was en route to the Whitehouse.

       Everything apparently vaporised, no trace of body parts or luggage.

       Do note the rocket explodes "near" the plane to increase chance of hit and cause maximum damage, it's doesn't "explode" it, but mainly uses particles from explosion to penetrate the airplane.

       True, however my point was more that two passenger planes crashed - the one that was actually shot out of the sky still had bodies and luggage.

       You know the official story for what happened at the Pentagon is bogus purely because of the lack of photos and videos from all the cameras on and around the building. There was a camera mounted on the edge of the roof almost directly over where whatever it was hit the building, what did that show?
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the only footage we've been shown are a few blurry frames that could show anything at all is the smoking gun; if the official story is true, why haven't they released all the footage and say "look, it's just like we told you, why are you doubting us?"

       My father took us to the Pentagon site a day or two after 9/11--you could see it and walk onto a patch of grass off of the Beltway if I remember correctly. There were already some people there looking at it. I thought he had taken us there in a display of older-person patriotism or something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was nothing there. It looked exactly like the pictures. The hole was impossibly narrow for the wingspan of a commercial jet to have gone through it. Feelings of what the fuckery stormed through my head as my eyes darted around, looking for any fragment of a wing, let alone an entire airplane. My brother and I were standing there in uncomfortable silence for a couple of minutes, obediently waiting for my Dad to give us a uniform extension of the same confusing rhetoric regarding terrorism and the Middle East that we'd been instantaneously (as a result, suspiciously) deluged with in the news. Then finally, my Dad blurts out what we were thinking--"Where the hell's the plane?" I remember a strange sense of relief overcoming me right then. It was this feeling that I didn't have to compromise my own logic and senses--this particular sense being my sight on something right in front of me--for passive acceptance of the utterly bizarre and warped.

       My friend's dad worked in the building so she went to visit him the day after. We were so young that none of it made sense, we thought a guy named "Ben Lawdin" hurt some people and her dad was going to catch him. That's incredible you got to see the site.

       I miss that innocence--there's this swift jump to logic that you often have as a child which isn't obfuscated by, well, further societal introduction.
      </p>
      <p>
       First thought when they announced who was responsible hours later, replete with details: "Well if they know so much about him and they know he did it, why weren't they able to stop him?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Bin Laden: I didn't do it. News: He said he did it. Bin Laden video: No, I said I didn't do it. News: He's lying he did it and wants everyone to know.

       Mossad and its American associates are the obvious culprits. Who benefits from the crime? The attacks against the twin towers started at 8:45 a.m. and four flights are diverted from their assigned air space and no air traffic controller sounds the alarm. And no Air Force jets scramble until 10 a.m. That also smacks of a small scale Air Force rebellion, a coup against the Pentagon perhaps? Radars are jammed, transponders fail. No IFF -- friend or foe identification -- challenge. In Pakistan, if there is no response to IFF, jets are instantly scrambled and the aircraft is shot down with no further questions asked. This was clearly an inside job. Bush was afraid and rushed to the shelter of a nuclear bunker. He clearly feared a nuclear situation. Who could that have been? Will that also be hushed up in the investigation, like the Warren report after the Kennedy assassination?
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole world already knows this. This is a simple restatement of what everybody already knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everywhere except in America, where Jewish dominated media envelops everyone in a poisoned darkness, everybody knows that Jewish kingpins pulled off 9/11 as an excuse for making war on every obstacle to their world financial hegemony, and killing as many non-Jews as possible in the process to further consolidate their domination of the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
       This widening war on the Islamic world, already responsible for millions of unnecessary deaths, is a direct result of the 9/11 hoax, everything based on false spin concocted by Jewish strategists not for U.S. best interests, but for the demonic master plan of the Jewish Sanhedrin, which rules the Jewish moneymen who buy the presidents and the generals, to kill or enslave the rest of the world. They control you, whether you want to admit or not. They control your bank account. And they make you support their insane war program by all this wall-to-wall patriotic spin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The totally Jewish-controlled U.S. media have long ago suspended their journalistic capabilities in favor of blatant cheerleading about their favorite subject - Muslim terrorists. Every day they urge you to kill them. If there ever was a systemic hate crime, this is it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, as the infamous list of the 19 hijackers was released by the FBI two days after the infamous event, and except for two feeble-minded patsies, no other perpetrator has ever been arrested for the greatest crime in American history, what kind of conclusions are we to draw from the fact that all of the people who were in charge of America when this dark day happened, instead of being fired for incompetence, were promoted and allowed to continue their criminal activity?
      </p>
      <p>
       What does all this say about the American mind?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not functioning, thanks to the poisoned blanket of U.S. media, and a deliberately twisted educational system that has produced killer Jewish robots instead of fully invested philosophically clean humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every cop in the world should be brought up on charges of willful obstruction of justice for not blowing the whistle on President George Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and all their Jewish handlers - in the White House, in the Congress, in the media, and most especially in the banks) for their stunningly criminal behavior in both lying about the events and implementing a totally illegal coverup of the crime scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Jewish judges atop the U.S. legal system said it was all OK, and the media, led by the New York Times and CNN, never mentioned all those Jewish fingerprints visible in the pyroclastic dust covering the disintegrated corpses in the rubble of the Twin Towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       In an interview only a mere weeks after 9/11, Hamid Gul - former head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) from 1987-1989 - told Arnaud de Borchgrave, United Press International, of who he thinks was behind the attacks. Here are a few exceprts from the transcript:
      </p>
      <p>
       De Borchgrave: So who did Black Sept. 11?
      </p>
      <p>
       Gul: Mossad and its accomplices. The U.S. spends $40 billion a year on its 11 intelligence agencies. That's $400 billion in 10 years. Yet the Bush Administration says it was taken by surprise. I don't believe it. Within 10 minutes of the second twin tower being hit in the World Trade Center CNN said Osama bin Laden had done it. That was a planned piece of disinformation by the real perpetrators. It created an instant mindset and put public opinion into a trance, which prevented even intelligent people from thinking for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/">
        https://www.upi.com/UPI-interview-with-Hamid-Gul/60031280349846/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately after the attacks Bin Laden was interviewed by Pakistani newspaper Ummat. When asked if he was involved in the attacks he stated:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States. As a Muslim, I try my best to avoid telling a lie. I had no knowledge of these attacks, nor do I consider the killing of innocent women, children and other humans as an appreciable act. Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women, children and other people. Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle."
      </p>
      <p>
       He went on to say:
      </p>
      <p>
       "In the same way, whether it is President Bush or any other U.S. President, they cannot bring Israel to justice for its human rights abuses or to hold it accountable for such crimes. What is this? Is it not that there exists a government within the government in the United States? That secret government must be asked as to who carried out the attacks."
      </p>
      <p>
       He further goes on to state:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I have already said that we are not hostile to the United States. We are against the [U.S. Government] system, which makes other nations slaves of the United States, or forces them to mortgage their political and economic freedom. This system is totally in the control of the American Jews, whose first priority is Israel, not the United States. It is clear that the American people are themselves the slaves of the Jews and are forced to live according to the principles and laws laid down by them. So the punishment should reach Israel. In fact, it is Israel, which is giving a blood bath to innocent Muslims and the U.S. is not uttering a single word."
      </p>
      <p>
       You know all this is true. You know you are living a lie every day, by accepting what the TV robots tell you is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you wring your hands and kvetch that you don't know what to do, when in fact you do. You just don't have the courage to do it, because you're a robotized American dreckdroid, who goes out and kills other people for reasons simply because you have been ordered to by those who control you. Despicable. You are despicable, because you don't have the courage to say what you clearly know, even though you about to lose everything you ever loved because of your failure to say what you know and confront the beast. And now it's too big to stop.

       Great Answer!

      <p>
       I think that one of the major motivations for the Jews was to use 9/11 as a means to goad the US into using its military power to attack and weaken the Muslim states around Israel. $9T and 4 wars later, you can see that while not everything went according to plan, the line between the Christians and the Muslims has been drawn in the sand and the two are fighting each other, just as the Jews desire.

       It is very complex and I do not claim to fully understand it, but the Jews have had a strong level of control over the US for a long time. One of the big things in the recent past has been Kissinger and his control over the Government. But, more generally has been the monetary control over the nation by the Fed and its owners, and their ability to put the nation into debt and pull the plug on that debt at any time that they choose, gives them control over everything.

      <p>
       Whether accurate or not, I can guarantee that not everywhere outside of America believes "Jewish kingpins" were responsible. In the UK, I've met very few people who doubt any aspect of the official story, much less have an alternative culprit in mind.

       I've been looking seriously into 9/11 since 2002 and it didn't take much to convince me of an inside job. And yeah, I've seen the debunker/counter arguments as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wear this "inside job" belief on my sleeve, not afraid to mention my position whenever the subject may crop up. What I find amazing is that every ordinary everyday person I speak to seems to agree in some form or another. Former military friends are the most staunch, the most woke. 
So yeah, despite the internet shills trying to tell us it's a dead cause, everyone else seems to instinctively know the truth of that day.

       Of those, I think this is the biggest one - the rest

       be explained, but it stretches the limits of belief that the only images that exist of the hub of the US military are such low-quality and only from one angle. Even if there was a reason not to release them at the time (e.g. they reveal the [lack of] defences and other infrastructure that protect the Pentagon), it's difficult to see how that information would still be relevant 16 years later.

      <p>
       Does any one know if other passports were found? The fact that a passport could be blown clear and be undamaged seems possible, but it being one of the hijackers and then being found in the chaos seems like a remarkable coincidence.

       There are plenty of reasons to consider the possibility that 9/11 was an inside job:
      </p>
      <p>
       The knowledge that under Kennedy the joint chiefs of staff planned to commit acts of terrorism against the people of the United States and blame them on Cuba in order to gain public support for an invasion on Cuba - Operation Northwood.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that it was a false flag event that lead the United States into the war in Vietnam - the Gulf of Tonkin incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       A neo conservative think tank called the PNAC in which Cheney was a member, released a publication in the year before 9/11 in which it was stated that 'Creating Tomorrow’s Dominant Force - the process of transformation is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new Pearl Harbor'. This quote suggests such an event as 9/11 might actually have been desirable to some.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are numerous accounts of professionals working at ground zero encountering molten steel:
      </p>
      <p>
       "In some pockets now being uncovered, they are finding molten steel." -Alison Geyh, PhD.
      </p>
      <p>
       "You'd get down below and you'd see molten steel -- molten steel -- running down the channel rails. Like you're in a foundry... like lava... from a volcano." -FDNY Captain Ruvolo
      </p>
      <p>
       "I saw melting of girders in World Trade Center." -Structural Engineer Abolhassan Astaneh
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly there was a quote made during negotiations for oil pipeline rights in Afghanistan in August 2001 in which the U.S. told the Taliban: "Accept our offer of a carpet of gold or you'll get a carpet of bombs before the next snows fall." Was it purely by chance that they were able to make good on this promise with the full support of the American people?
      </p>
      <p>
       The collapses themselves, in particular that of building 7. Seen here against three known controlled demolitions.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As I understand it, until 9/11 there was no historical precedence for a steel framed building collapsing as a result of fire, yet it is fire that is stated as the cause of collapse in all three instances. 1 and 2 were unusual cases though, but 7 falls in classic controlled demolition type descent, even down to the crimp in the near centre of the roof initiating collapse in order to cause the building to fall in on itself, perfectly into its own footprint. The first hundred feet of its descent occurred at perfect freefall. Even a layman can comprehend the enormous improbability of each and every supporting beam failing instantaneously in such a way as creates this perfect symmetry. To achieve such a collapse professionally takes a great deal of knowledge and expertise, and of course a great deal of well placed, correctly discharged explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also worth mentioning that, unless there has been some new development in recent years, the official explanation for the collapse of 7 is not fully available to the public 'for reasons of public safety'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, the NIST have said on a couple of occasions that I know of that they cannot fully explain the collapse of towers 1 and 2, which leaves the door of speculation open further still, unless one considers the possibility of controlled demolition, in which case each building collapse occurred naturally, without anomaly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The put options made in the weeks leading up to 9/11 predicting the airline stock would fall. A spokesman for Bloomberg was quoted as saying, "This would be the biggest coincidence in the history of the world, if it were a coincidence."
      </p>
      <p>
       The organizations like ae9/11 Truth or Firefighters for 9/11 Truth. I'm sure there are a number of professionals in the relevant fields who are willing to put their names and reputations behind the official story but I've not come across them to such a great extent as those who support the demolition theory. I've heard far more assumption made to the effect that 99% of the scientific community support the official story. It seems to me that the real truth of the matter is that the scientific community on the whole have mostly remained silent on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an MIT engineer called Jeff King who gives a convincing talk on the pyroclastic clouds produced by each collapse, stating them as proof of controlled demolition.
      </p>
      <p>
       The documentary 'Explosive Evidence' shows a mixture of scientists, architects, engineers and demolition experts, one of which, Danny Jowenko was later quoted on July 13th 2011 in a Press TV interview by Dr. Alan Sabrosky, Veterans Today board member and editor, who specifically drew attention to Jowenko's statements on the nature of the collapse of building seven. Three days later Danny Jowenko crashed into a tree on a straight road and died. In view of the fact that so much else points to a possible conspiracy, I find this fact suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Video footage of squibs is in keeping with the demolition theory, though I am also aware of the counter argument so this point is open to interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise the number of firemen and people who were there who claim to have heard explosions. Some say they were mistaken and it was the collapsing floors striking together they heard. I believe those who were there before I do those who were not.
      </p>

       The changing of long held flight protocol earlier that year restricting the power to give the shoot down order to Cheney, Rumsfeld and a small handful of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheney's new position, taken only a few months before the event, giving himself full control over war games and hijack situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The numerous drills and war games taking place at the same time as the attacks, some simulating hijacked aircraft, might arguably have acted as a smoke screen, which allowed events to unfold with greater ease. One air traffic controller commented that he "did not know what was real world and what was exercise."
      </p>
      <p>
       As Captain Eric H. May, a former US Army military intelligence officer, stated: “The easiest way to carry out a false flag attack is by setting up a military exercise that simulates the very attack you want to carry out.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The privatization of the WTC complex just months before the event, after it had been owned by the port authority its past thirty years. The insurance payout to its new owner, Larry Silverstein was huge.
      </p>
      <p>
       The testimony of Norman Minetta in which he described a young soldier reporting to Cheney on the progress of an approaching aircraft that was heading for the Pentagon. "The young man came in at intervals, saying, the plane is thirty miles out. The plane is twenty miles out. The plane is ten miles out. The soldier then asked, do the orders still stand, at which point Cheney whipped his head round and said, have I told you anything to the contrary?" The man holding the hearing asked Minetta, "Was he talking about the plane that struck the Pentagon?" and Minetta confirmed that "Yes, he was." So Cheney was fully aware of the incoming strike and did nothing.
      </p>

       The magic passport of one of the hijackers that survived the fireball, only to be found in one piece on the streets below.

       The video of the man they said was Bin Laden confessing. Besides his clothes he looked nothing like him.

       Ted Gunderson, a man who served as the head of the FBI in Los Angeles, Memphis, and Dallas, consecutively over a period of thirty years, eventually turned whistleblower and was quoted as saying that most terrorist attacks in the USA are perpetrated by the CIA.

       The buildings weren't compromised by terrorists. None of them were alive to gain secret info. The government could have easily secured the scene and demolished the buildings later after they were deemed unsaveable if this were the motivation.

       Even if 911Commish is 100% accurate the post-attack behavior by the west is ridiculous - I believe the general trutherism around specific events day-of is a total smokescreen.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        A hyper-wealthy Saudi convinced a few people to crash airplanes
       </li>
       <li>
        US/UN forces demolish AFG and attempt to remake IRQ

       <li>

       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I mean, that's enough for me right there.  I don't have to believe that the world is run by some specific number of SecretIsraelis who want to race towards Armageddon to realize that the US response to PlaneAttacks was insanely stupid and hurt everyone.  Even the specific accounts of how OBL was tracked showed such poor judgment (pose as international doctors helping children to run DNA tests in other sovereign nations). The same guy or group, 'allegedly', had bombed WTC and USS Cole previously - because they came up with a new plan we need to burn the entire center of the earth?  Turn of the Century western politics got caught in a chinese-finger-trap, by their own accounts.

        Pentagon footage from

         two
        </strong>
        parking security cameras.
       </a>
       Until recently, I had previously only seen the first video.  Cross-analysis in the video link I posted indicates the videos do not match where they should show the "plane",
       <strong>
        and that the second video was altered.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone have an original source for the second video?
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems to confirm the Pentagon impact was not from an airplane, even just looking at the first video alone it's easy to tell that due to the scale and definition, and that the actual object is being obscured.

       Thermite is just aluminium and iron oxide (rusted iron). Having traces of it doesn't necessarily prove it was put there intentionally, or just a byproduct of the building burning down.

        If jet fuel can't melt steel beams isn't taken seriously, how did molten iron exist in pools for weeks after the buildings collapsed? At a higher temperature than jet fuel can burn?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       First of all, jet fuel wasn't the primary source of fuel for the fire, just what ignited it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steel can lose around 50% of its structural integrity at around 1100°F &amp; the fire was recorded at 1800°F in some spots. It doesn't need to melt all the steel in the building, just weaken and warp it until it can no longer withstand the massive weight of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's some fishy stuff around 9/11 and I doubt our government is  telling the full story, but saying it'd be impossible for a plane to take down a building because jet fuel doesn't burn hot enough to totally melt steel isn't really a solid argument.

       That's why I didn't make that argument. I asked about the pools of molten iron that burned hotter than steel for six weeks after the attack. It wasn't discussed.

       Elevators falling, possible generator explosions,and the jet fuel can explain this. We did have an idea of how the lobby looked, and eyewitnesses who saw burned people exit elevators

        Two WTC buildings were hit by planes and three buildings collapsed at freefall speed. If WTC7 contained floors for government organizations, it'd make sense to destroy it in the event the area was compromised by hostile terrorists. Why not just say that?

       Only WTC7 experienced freefall for a short period of time; the twins fell substantially slower.
