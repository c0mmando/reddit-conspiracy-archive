        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been having a discussion with someone regarding rocket launches and the flat earth theory. Actually, I don&#39;t know if discussion would be the right word. More like an exchange of YouTube links.</p>

<p>It got me thinking, and I&#39;m pretty sure any flat earther I&#39;ve ever had a conversation with here has tended to communicate primarily via an exchange of YouTube links.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, videos are generally a poor means of communication when discussing concepts like astrophysics and rocket science. I&#39;ve noticed, however, that they are great at stifling communication and eating up someone&#39;s time.</p>

<p>This would lead me to believe flat earthers are all psyop shills coming here to derail real conspiracy discussions and waste everyone&#39;s time, but I also find it hard to believe that any organization or government would care enough to go to this much trouble.</p>

<p>I guess it&#39;s possible they could be using bots, as this type of communication would be much easier for a bot than a regular discussion, but I think it&#39;s more likely that these are real people and are not shills or bots.</p>

<p>That being said, I&#39;m a bit confused about the apparent preference for communicating via links to YouTube videos by these believers. Why is this the case? I&#39;m hoping a flat earther here can clear this up for me, because it seems like every time I get into a discussion with one, things quickly devolve into little more than a series of videos.</p>

<p>To me, it makes perfect sense to communicate in this way if you are in fact a shill or bot or whatever, but I&#39;m having trouble understanding why a real person would choose to communicate in this way. Clearly I&#39;m missing something, what is it?</p>

<p><strong>edit This is kinda what it feels like to try to have a discussion with a flat earther, and yes I see the irony:</strong> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a FE&#39;r (I&#39;m a Hollow Eather :) ), but, I&#39;ll give my two cents.</p>

<p>You are succumbing to the fallacy of Authority. Meaning, you need to read it in an &quot;established&quot; published paper, or &quot;peer reviewed&quot; journal. </p>

<p>Currently, no one in the academic community would ever publish such works, so, the people &quot;researching&quot; the topic have no other option, really, other than a YT video or video via some other medium (hence why they give you a YT link instead of an academic paper). </p>

<p>Furthermore, people learn things differently. Some are visual/audio, and some learn better via reading. The former doesn&#39;t mean they are dumber than the latter, it&#39;s just all personal traits. I know many people who &quot;learn from books&quot;, but are dumber than a box of rocks.</p>

<p>Anyways,  yea... Just because someone gives you a YT vid, doesn&#39;t mean they are a shill or dumb, it just means that is the only source really they can relay to you, considering the academic environment.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s not what OP is saying. He&#39;s asking why they don&#39;t link too written sources, period. Written sources are much easier to discuss while copying passages, etc. Much easier to soon over fluff, and much easier to read quietly at work, for instance.</p>

<p>That&#39;s like... kind of your own opinion, no? What&#39;s the difference between me linking to an article and paragraph 3 sentence 2, and @1:59 of video, via the sentence in the audio? Nothing, really. Like I said, some are more visual/audio, while others rather read. </p>

<p>Many YT videos have transcripts, so, maybe the middle grown would be linking both? Although, that does seem a bit redundant, to me... at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks this makes sense. I can get behind hollow earth theory. I know how caves work, and they can get to be pretty big. I guess flat earth theory just flies directly in the face of what I seem to be able to directly observe. I actually wouldn’t be surprised if flat earth theory was in part an effort to discredit hollow earth theory.</p>

<p>I’m not necessarily looking for peer reviewed flat earth science, as I know that would be hard to come by. Just something other than YouTube videos produced in a way that seems to be to maximize entertainment (almost like an action movie) or books to buy on Amazon.</p>

<p>Hell, I wouldn’t be surprised if the whole thing was a conspiracy by small independent media producers to drive views to their videos and purchases to their books, because that is the ultimate outcome of flat earth theory.</p>

<p>I agree with you. One of the problems is that the majority of people today are terrible at reading, because it requires concentration. This is compounded when reading online, because an infinite array of distractions are never more than one click away.</p>

<p>If you are genuinely interested to learn why some of us have let go of our faith in heliocentrism, <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/key-topics/cavendish-experiment/">this page</a> is a terrific place to start. If you read it closely it will only take about five minutes, and a lot of supporting evidence is also provided.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so I actually just took the time to read this whole page, and it isn&#39;t really saying much? I see that there are two videos and a podcast included, the videos with a total running time of <strong>47 minutes</strong>, and the podcast clocking in at <strong>2 hours and 51 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p>So far, it&#39;s not looking good. In fact, it seems to confirm what I thought. This is designed to waste time and distract.</p>

<p>I digress, from what I can see on the text here, the bulk of this page is in reference to the Cavendish experiment. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t actually say what&#39;s wrong with it. Any chance you could copy the relevant passages to this thread for me to see?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went ahead and split my comment into two parts because I’d really like your thoughts on the meat of it, and not to nitpick this one thing, which coincidentally is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about in my OP.</p>

<p>I was under the impression that a strawman is intentionally misrepresenting a claim because it’s “easier to defeat than an opponents real argument” (definition from Google). I’m pretty sure this fits the bill. The claim was made that Cavendish weighed mars from a shed with two heavy balls.</p>

<p>That isn’t what he did though. He used his experiment to determine the mass (weight as he knew it) of earth. In fact, cavendish didn’t determine the mass of mars. According to the Wikipedia page referenced in your link:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cyprianus Annius van den Bosch made a determination of the mass of Mars based upon the motions of the Martian moons, with an accuracy of 0.2%</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This appears to be the first determination, and it was based on the motions of the Martian moons.</p>

<p>Do you see how this is a strawman? The claim is being made that Cavendish weighed mars from a shed with two heavy balls, and this strawman is made because it’s only natural to question a claim such as this. It’s outlandish, after all, as I’m sure you’d agree.</p>

<p>If the article instead said that Cavendish merely determined the mass of earth, and later experiments determined the mass of mars via other means, then it wouldn’t sound so outlandish and easily discredited.</p>

<p>That is because you are engaging in post facto argumentation i.e. rather than reconsider your belief, you are cherrypicking google links to support your preconceived notions.</p>

<p>Yup I think it&#39;s all leading to the big climax which will have something to do with faking aliens.  Probably a duality of  good and evil aliens.  In the future we will have trans-human cyborgs and new age astral projecting neo-sorcerers battling some made up alien threat in their mind&#39;s eye or in some VR construct until the Antichrist comes to &quot;save&quot; them all.</p>

<p>Please take another look at the King James Bible.  Everything in it is the truth!</p>

<p>Dan_2:41  And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters&#39; clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</p>

<p>Clay is used as &quot;potter&#39;s clay&quot; as in humans creation.</p>

<p>Rev 13:16  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 
Rev 13:17  And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. </p>

<p>This mark is probably going be some future version of this using a one world crypto currency:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTBJ6OIGkzc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTBJ6OIGkzc</a></p>

<p>You can get saved by repenting and beliveing the gospel of Jesus Christ at any time:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>He already paid for our sins with his blood.  All the conspiracies in the world (real and fake) are there to distract you from this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First let me just say I didn&#39;t believe in God or the Bible or anything really until after I found the whole &quot;outer space is fake&quot; conspiracy to be true as well as the spinning ball is a lie.  So that stuff came first.  I also started seeking God as soon as I realized there must be one.  I was led spiritually to Jesus Christ as well as the King James Bible.  There is plenty of evidence for why it is the pure word of God but it&#39;s mostly spiritually discerned after salvation.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I think the &quot;awakening&quot; is being led by the light side of Lucifer&#39;s dialectic.  He controls both the yin and the yang, the light and the dark magic.  Both sides are in rebellion against God but we view the light side as good.  This is pushed to us by Hollywood in the various movies like Star Wars, Harry Potter, anything with the light/dark duality concept.  He is very slowly waking people up to his dark side so that it can be crushed by the Antichrist leading the &quot;light side&quot; rebellion against a false Antichrist.  The real Antichrist will be riding a white horse, wearing a crown, and have supernatural power.  He will likely look like the Catholic depiction of Jesus and loved by &quot;the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Rev 6:1  And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. 
Rev 6:2  And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Are you talking about when Joshua took down Jericho following the word of the Lord?  I believe it was simply the supernatural ability of God.  Since I got saved after discovering flat earth and fake outer space it removes any ancient Alien tech conspiracies for me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have any Idea what is missing from your KJV? Which year was your book Published? </p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li> I know we are told by the mainstream conspiracy world that there were book removed.  I however believe most conspiracy theories are actually disinfo.  Take the dead sea scrolls for instance.  They were supposedly dug up and it was plastered all over the Main stream media.  Anything pushed by the MSM is deception.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Holocaust is in it zero times.  Enoch and Jasher are not inspired books.  I think they are like any good disinfo.  They have 80% truth and 20% deception.  Jasher I believe is more of a historian anyway so it&#39;s not claimed to be inspired.  I think those books are interesting to glean some ideas but anything that contradicts the KJV needs to be thrown out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why do the Pastors, Priests and religious folk skip over Enoch? That dude was so incredibly important to G_D that he was the very first one to be taken but to where? He didn&#39;t go up into Heaven did he?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not believed to be inspired as I mentioned above.  It is Gnostic text that was written after the OT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t really say where he went.  It said he was translated and that &quot;God took him.&quot;  He could have placed him in Eden awaiting the atonement of Jesus Christ.  It&#39;s impossible to know.  He could have gone to the 3rd Heaven if God made a major exception as Enoch is a picture of the Church/Body of Christ being translated (caught away aka Rapture) before the time of Jacob&#39;s trouble where God saves the remnant of Israel (Noah and the ark).  Perhaps he went to Eden.  It just doesn&#39;t tell us.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How about Moses? Do you know where he got his staff from? Why didn&#39;t Moses get to go into the Promise Land after all he had been thru?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We don&#39;t know where he got the staff from based on the KJV.  It appears it was his before the Lord commissioned him and then the Lord started using it for signs.</p>

<p>As for why he didn&#39;t enter the promise land:</p>

<p>Num 27:14  For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.</p>

<p>Deu 32:51  Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel. </p>

<p>This seems to be because Moses did not obey the Lord.  He was told to speak to the rock in from of the Israel and it would bring forth water:</p>

<p>Num 20:8  Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink. </p>

<p>But Moses gave the rock a smack down instead:</p>

<p>Num 20:10  And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock? 
Num 20:11  And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also. 
Num 20:12  And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. </p>

<p>Basically when the lord tells you to do something, one needs to think like a lawyer and do exactly as he says.  I recall a verse about a prophet who doesn&#39;t obey and gets killed by a lion for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus was pretty squared up with Conspiracies I&#39;m 100% certain!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus is God and literally the truth so yeah he&#39;s the end of the rabbit hole!</p>

<p>Joh_14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</p>

<p>Joh_10:30  I and my Father are one.</p>

<p>If you believe in God and pray to him asking to the shown the truth and earnestly seek him you will find it&#39;s Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Jer_29:13  And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having not been raised in or around a Christian or religious home, my few experiences with manmade religion were unsettling. Suffice to say, I’ve always had a <em>spiritual nag</em> and I’m sure I do not need to pin down where it takes me... In the long run I always end up where I’m supposed to be in the exact moment that I’m supposed to be there.</p>

<p>Starting out, I’m not easily persuaded by so called learned speakers, voices of <em>Authority</em> nor by whimsy or <em>fantasy</em>.At the same time I’ll listen and discern and yes, I’ll listen to correction! I’m stubborn and very much a <em>contrarian</em> - always digging, exploring, turning things every which way until I’m satisfied or momentarily content. Seeking, always learning, looking up!</p>

<p>It upset me that the Christians that really didn’t want to defend G_D over Jericho also didn’t want to learn more about what was within the very walls of Jericho. Atheists eat that stuff up because all they have to do is say ‘this god is a maniacal, genocidal, murderous god’ without <em>feelings</em>. When I said <strong>Super Natural</strong> I did and do <em>mean</em> G_D but more so that the Walls were torn down by the <strong>faith</strong> of the <em>faithful</em> with an extra big <em>charge</em> from *G_D! The faithful were very obedient in executing the instructions and G_D throws in with some extra reinforcement!</p>

<p>So, I have been working (for about 8 years…) on Tesla Vibration/HAARP Theories, Tunguska as well as Rods of GOD and many more scattered  World Cataclysmic events when I thought I should explore more closely some of the <em>stronger</em> religious texts.  This took me to the Bible which took me to Jericho. Those walls were huge and they were wide and given the massive stone architecture of the surrounding areas, we’re not talking about a shoddy cobble stone structure – right? Well I really had to dig and dig. Found it in the Book of Jasher.</p>

<p>The New Testament isn’t enough for a Christian to lean on, IMHO when faced with the arguments of this very angry G_D verses Jesus. The OT doesn’t clearly explain what was going on with the Flood, Jericho etc. Okay. Just trust me right? Does it matter much that the KJV first sentence is a singular Heaven? Does it much matter that few Milk Toast Pastors will ever preach about the Fallen Ones coming down and not only having sex with the women but with all manner of animals? The Men of Old? Meh.</p>

<p>So, Enoch was Seventh from Adam and his son Methusala flipped out when Noah was born – do you know what grandpa told that father? Do you know what Noah looked like? You’ll have to research that on your own because it is cool! So we have three very unique men right out the gate. Enoch is running around telling the baddies to straighten up – he’s preaching to these <strong>creatures</strong>! Noah is building an Ark and the people are laughing but Noah was an Odd one right from birth!</p>

<p>Enoch is out and about** walking with G_D*<em>! He’s getting Round Trip Air Fare to go back and forth between the Heavens, the Earth and Hell! He gets very busy and he writes over 360 some books – where did those books go? Some say they were buried in a rock pillar? Think Pyramid? But we might also suppose that they were sealed up and put on the Ark…Do you know how one of the Fallen Angels was punished for *teaching</em> writing to the others? </p>

<p>Now as far as modern Christianity is concerned they don’t want there to be Super Titan type Giants – nope the tallest any Giant ever could have been was Goliath, right? That isn’t what your Bible really says and it certainly isn’t what Enoch said. Enoch said he was writing his book for a FUTURE time for when things are as bad as they were for Noah? What? Yep! It was going to be that bad again but only worse because the Giants didn’t have Jesus but we do…yep Enoch wrote about Jesus and that is why he’s not preached much. Why would that be? Satan is pretty tricky, yes? Enoch was taken but to where? I speculate he’s in charge of the vast Antarctica but you’ll have to read Enoch to find out why!</p>

<p>Now Jasher, Jasher also saw some stuff. His name is in the Bible too! He wrote about a <em>messenger</em> that ran so fast and so light of foot <strong>across the tops of the corn stalks but not a single ear was bent</strong> as soon as I read/saw that I thought of <em>Crop Circles</em>! Why? Because we’re talking about Creation and G_D should get the credit for these Miracles – right? Now Jasher best explains Jericho and the creatures that were inside those walls. They were literally crushed up inside the walls. Worse than that? There were some un-godly creatures inside those walls! But wait! Weren’t they destroyed in the flood? Did you know…That Sword in the Stone Fairy Tale comes from Moses when he was a grown man? Gotta read Jasher to find out more about Moses! </p>

<p>So there’s one very strong group of People that never let go of their Bible. They beat the Vatican back? Yes, they did! The only way that happens is G_D! Yet, we’re told that these books that came out of the Dead Sea Scrolls are no good? Only problem is this cluster of People have ALWAYS had the Books of Enoch in their Bible! So why shouldn’t we be reading them? </p>

<p>Enoch ++ and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church? They pretty much told the Vatican to take a hike!</p>

<p>I fully believe there is a gap between Gen 1:1 and Gen 1:2.  These things can be found by studying scripture and comparing it with other scripture.  God created Heaven which is everything above the earth (terra firma, not planet which s just a wandering star).  Between Gen 1:1 and Gen 1:2 Lucifer was the anointed over all of God&#39;s creation.  </p>

<p>Isa_14:13  For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:</p>

<p>Notice he already had a throne on earth when pride was first found in him.  There are a ton of other proofs for this.</p>

<p>Whatever happened caused God to flood everything.  It was a flood that even flooded all of heaven.  Gen 1:2 is after this flood when he rebuilt everything and create two areas of heaven below him.</p>

<p>Gen_1:20  And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</p>

<p>This shows that where the birds fly is also &quot;heaven&quot; but it&#39;s in the open expanse between the Earth (terra firma) and the hard firmament we can&#39;t pass.</p>

<p>Job_37:18  Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?</p>

<p>Gen 1:6  And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. </p>

<p>Above that is the 2nd heaven where Lucifer (Leviathan) now swims around in the deep and spiritually rules over Earth due to Adam&#39;s fall.</p>

<p>I agree most Christians don&#39;t know how to properly defend things in the OT because most Churches deny it or say &quot;that was for then&quot; which that is not true at all.  They have no idea how WICKED those giants were.  They were doing things that people can&#39;t even imagine like burning children inside of idols and God knows what else.</p>

<p>The other problem with modern &quot;churches&quot; (the Church is actually just the body of Christ aka the saints/born again believers) is that they have been fully deceived by science falsely so called.</p>

<p>1Ti_6:20  O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:</p>

<p>Because of this they cannot defend the Bible properly.  They have to debate within the confines of a false reality that Lucifer has spun all around them.  It makes their arguments seem foolish to atheists and agnostics who are also stuck in that false reality.  For them, that needs to be torn down first as it was for me.</p>

<p>There is a lot to glean from the apocryphal books but I personally choose to keep my mind clear of them.  I stick to the inspired text that deals with salvation and instructs us on how to get other people saved.  We are trying to get people on the ark if you will which is inside Christ Jesus.  There will be plenty of time to learn the truth about absolutely everything once we are free of this cursed flesh.</p>

<p>1Co_13:12  For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.</p>

<p>It sounds like you have done a ton of research.  I hope that you will pray to God asking him to show you the truth.  If you know he&#39;s there and seek him, he will reveal himself to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Isa_14: </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here Lucifer and the Physical King of Babylon are being mocked in a Prophecy of Isaiah. Lucifer has dominion but no throne. The human King of Babylon actually sat on a Throne but is thrown away with no grave or ceremony...</p>

<p>f. I will: The pride, the grasping selfish ambition, the self-will of the king of Babylon is powerfully expressed in five I will statements. This is the essence of the self-focused and self-obsessed life.</p>

<p>i. I will ascend into heaven: &quot;Heaven will be my home and my place of honor.&quot;</p>

<p>ii. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: &quot;I will be enthroned, and will be exalted above all other angelic beings.&quot;</p>

<p>iii. I will also sit on the mount of the congregation: &quot;I will sit in the place of glory and honor and attention.&quot;</p>

<p>iv. I will ascend above the heights: &quot;I will continue to rise, even in heaven, until all see me in my bright shining glory.&quot;</p>

<p>v. I will be like the Most High: &quot;I will be glorious, and be set equal to God, far above all other created beings.&quot;</p>

<p>vi. We see in these statements not so much a desire to exalt one&#39;s self above God, but the desire to exalt one&#39;s self above one&#39;s peers. From this passage, it seems that Satan&#39;s desire was not so much to be above God, but to be honored and regarded as the highest angel, above the [other] stars of God, receiving the glory and attention one would receive being next to God, equal with God, like the Most High. We don&#39;t have to want to be exalted higher than God to be like Satan. It is enough to want to be exalted above other people!</p>

<p>vii. Lucifer was certainly a glorious angel (day star, son of the morning, and also called the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty … the anointed cherub who covers in Ezekiel 28:12 and 14). Yet, there came a time when despite all his beauty and glory, he departed from the heart of God by wanting to exalt himself above his peers. Instead, the heart of Jesus says, &quot;The status of equality with God is not something to hang on to. I will let it go. I will give up My reputation, be a servant, live humbly among men, and even die an excruciating and humiliating death.&quot; (Philippians 2:5-8) When Lucifer departed from this heart, he fell from glory.</p>

<p>viii. &quot;It is a strange paradox that nothing makes a being less like God than the urge to be his equal, for he who was God stepped down from the throne of his glory to display to the wondering eyes of men the humility of God.&quot; (Grogan)</p>

<p>g. What prompted Satan&#39;s desire to exalt himself above all other creatures? What prompted the five I will statements?</p>

<p>i. Why did Lucifer rebel? Perhaps because he rejected God&#39;s plan to create an order of being made in His image (Genesis 1:26), who would be beneath the angels in dignity (Hebrews 2:6-7a; 2 Peter 2:11), yet would be served by angels in the present (Hebrews 1:14; 2:7-8; Psalm 91:11-12) and would one day be lifted in honor and status above the angels (1 Corinthians 6:3; 1 John 3:2). Satan wanted to be the highest among all creatures, equal to God in glory and honor, and the plan to create man would eventually put men above angels. He was apparently able to persuade one-third of the angelic beings to join him in his rebellion (Revelation 12:3-4, 7, and 9).</p>

<p>ii. If this is the case, it explains well Satan&#39;s present strategy against man: to obscure the image of God in man through encouraging sin and rebellion, to cause man to serve him, and to prevent the ultimate glorification of man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dr. Kim seems rather hyper militant but I ask in all sincerity, why he and others will declare Literal Words of God and then dismiss the specific words that the Hebrew supports? Some of these words rather make the case for FE stronger and then out the other side of the translation <em>picking and choosing</em>. He&#39;s kinda doing the same thing. Flip flopping a bit.</p>

<p>He also dismisses Enoch etc too quickly for my comfort as I had said and many others much more learned have stated that the Ethiopian Bible has never been tampered with or altered. There are some Conspiracy Theories that they have the Ark hidden away in that same township!</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to put <em>stock</em> in the translations of the extra books that are available but rather use them as supportive tools. I wouldn&#39;t be this far along without FE, Dr. Judy Wood and Enoch - especially if I acted like a fool that knows and swears by everything I trip across or by tripping other people up on my path!</p>

<p>Conspiracies of Rothschild, Mandela, FE etc. at about 35 min. mark…he explains his position on FE rather vaguely. He also seems to kinda half imply that it&#39;s okay for him to look at conspiracies but suggests his flock shouldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Watched all of the above and several other Pastors. Gave some attention to the FE Pastor and his Three Earths Gap Theory. I really kinda like this guy!</p>

<p>Charles Lawson:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3J6YE5gZrk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3J6YE5gZrk</a></p>

<p>and also Robert Breaker (not a FE&#39;r as far as I know...) but on <strong>A</strong> Gap Theory:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4bZ5bVt660">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4bZ5bVt660</a></p>

<p>So...as regards the Gap that is very compelling theory. I didn&#39;t understand how he explains Noahs flood and I went looking and couldn&#39;t find his teaching on that. I had heard others skip over the <em>REPLENISH</em> part enough times that I&#39;ve almost torn my hair out but a Gap makes it work! Even so...left me with many more questions too! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gene Kim simply believes the KJV is the final authority so there isn&#39;t much need to go to the Greek or Hebrew though he seems very educated on that.  There is so much in the KJV down to the capitalization of certain words.  In the end is comes down to spiritual discernment for me.  I&#39;ve had the KJV confirmed in my heart.  Not sure how else to explain it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what Gene Kim thinks about FE.  I know he&#39;s looked at it and basically won&#39;t tell anyone what he thinks.  He probably doesn&#39;t want to it get in the way since it&#39;s so controversial.  I get the idea that he finds it compelling personally.  He does not have a problem teaching controversial things though.  You might like this one:</p>

<p>I like Charles Lawson as well.  He&#39;s not Flat Earth though.  He has specifically preached against it.  Someone kept putting videos of him up calling him &quot;flat earth pastor&quot;.  Not sure what&#39;s up with that.  I used to watch Breaker but something was nagging me about him and I stopped.  Can&#39;t put my finger on it but when that happens I just abandon ship.  He teaches a lot of Ruckman&#39;s stuff so I liked him.  Peter Ruckman&#39;s preaching is what really opened my eyes right after I got saved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seek and ye shall find!</p>

<p>This is the Lawson vid I had seen recently.  Not sure if he changed his mind or what:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ2J3maDXXg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ2J3maDXXg</a></p>

<p>Just in case I want to copy here a salvation message I wrote to someone recently in case it helps you or anyone else.  This is really the most important thing to come to understand in our life:</p>

<p>Every single one of us are sinners and all good we do is nothing to God: </p>

<p>Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; </p>

<p>Isa_64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. </p>

<p>Repenting is just changing your mind about what you think of yourself, what you think of sin, what you think about God.</p>

<p>2Co_7:10  For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</p>

<p>The law existed to expose what sin was and to show us that none of us can keep it. </p>

<p>Rom 3:20  Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.  </p>

<p>Jas 2:10  For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.  </p>

<p>Jesus Christ is the Word of God who is God who came in the flesh:</p>

<p>Joh 1:1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br/>
Joh 1:2  The same was in the beginning with God.<br/>
Joh 1:3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.<br/>
Joh 1:14  And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.  </p>

<p>Jesus Christ had the fulness of the Godhead bodily (Godhead is the real word, not the Catholic trinity) </p>

<p>Col 2:8  Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.  </p>

<p>Col 2:9  For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.  Jesus Christ the man is the son of God but his deity side is God the Father. </p>

<p>He was both man and God. </p>

<p>Joh_10:30  I and my Father are one. </p>

<p>This is hard for us to understand but it is a GREAT MYSTERY. Nobody understands how God works or how he can be Jesus and the Father and the Holy Ghost and all that. Don&#39;t get caught up in it. He is God and he is the only God. Anyone claiming to understand exactly how it works is deceived or lying. </p>

<p>1Ti_3:16  And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. </p>

<p>All you need to do to be saved is repent and believe the Gospel which is: </p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;<br/>
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.<br/>
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;<br/>
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  </p>

<p>The wages for sin is death but Jesus died for us and was resurrected to pay the price we owe: </p>

<p>Rom_6:23  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Jesus Christ died the most horrible death you can imagine. </p>

<p>He did is for YOU personally. He did all the work for you. His blood washes you clean. There is nothing you can do to save yourself. You can only be saved by believing the above gospel. Once you are saved you have Jesus Christ&#39;s perfect righteousness: </p>

<p>Rom 3:22  Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: </p>

<p>Simply cry out to the Lord in the best way you know how telling him you understand all of this and you know what he did for you. Then he will send you the Holy Spirit!!!!</p>

<p>Rom_10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</p>

<p>Once you are saved, you cannot lose your salvation in this dispensation. Don&#39;t let anyone tell you otherwise:</p>

<p>Eph_4:30  And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. </p>

<p>God spiritually circumcises your soul from your flesh so when your flesh sins, it no longer pollutes your soul:</p>

<p>Col 2:10  And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power: 
Col 2:11  In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the problem with going back and trying to understand it in Hebrew.  The KJV says &quot;Heaven&quot; so that&#39;s what it is.  Simple for me.  </p>

<p>He created a singular heaven.  Then after Lucifer&#39;s rebellion and 1/3 of the angels falling he reset everything with a massive flood that went all the way up to his throne.  After a massive flood (pre-Adam) he created a couple firmaments and split heaven into 3 parts.  The expanse that separates the water&#39;s above from the waters below (atmosphere) with some kind of unknown barrier between, the waters above (the deep) and at the top of that is the crystal sea.  Above the frozen crystal sea is his throne where he sits in the 3rd heaven.  He also created Hell at some point (prepared for the Devil and his angels)</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I make of it so far at least.  I view where we are (earth and 1st heaven) as the last stop right before hell.  We are where the worst misfits are like Escape from New York.  And Lucifer is the guy ruling Manhattan.  Of course in that movie they make a guy named &quot;snake&quot; come in and try to free people which is the whole Luciferin lie.  He tries to make God out to be the evil prison warden and he&#39;s the one who is going to free us.  That&#39;s all over entertainment with shows like Westworld and the like.</p>

<p>I imagine when it was just a singular heaven Lucifer and the sons of God were able to fly up and down as they pleased.  Lucifer had the role of covering the throne of God during worship.  It was probably a world like the movie Avatar with massive trees and whatnot.  Who knows really?  They love showing us bits of truth in fiction though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the &quot;us&quot; is the Godhead (God, his Word, his Spirit).  That&#39;s still part of the great mystery of godliness.</p>

<p>Yes I believe Isaiah 53 is the best text to try to show Jewish people to try to wake them up but many are blind:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGz9BVJ_k6s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGz9BVJ_k6s</a></p>

<p>I believe the Hebrew was still in the process of being purified:</p>

<p>Psa_12:6  The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.</p>

<p>After much refinement came out the KJV.  I believe there are many red herrings around it to try to turn truth seekers away from it.  I think God can be found in many different versions and people can get saved in all sorts of different ways.  I got saved without owning a Bible.  I just think if you want the deepest understanding then it&#39;s about studying every word of the KJV.  That&#39;s where the meat is at.</p>

<p>Here is a good example and I have idea idea how the hebrew works out with this.  But the KJV talks about the Mark of the best being &quot;in&quot; the right hand or forhead.  It&#39;s the only one that does as far as I know.  400 years ago that made no sense yet they still used &quot;in.&quot;  Modern versions change it to &quot;on&quot;.</p>

<p>Rev 13:16  And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 
Rev 13:17  And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. </p>

<p>So this mark goes in the hand or forehead and has to do with buying and selling.</p>

<p>Just look at the modern world and the rise of cryptocurrencies and combine that with this:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTBJ6OIGkzc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTBJ6OIGkzc</a></p>

<p>All of a sudden it starts to look like the KJV was right all along about it being &quot;in.&quot;</p>

<p>As far as the forehead I think about the &quot;neural lace&quot; stuff and all the eye tech that is being sold to us in sci-fi movies.</p>

<p>&quot;Forehead&quot; can also be talking about the frontal lobe of the brain that effects our morality and decision making:</p>

<p>Jer_3:3  Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore&#39;s forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think because of your previous post about FE that you are really interested in the discussion. Well, you should start with the Apollo missions and NASA fakery to see how people begin to question the location and shape of Earth. </p>

<p>But to answer your question, I believe there are indeed writings about FE. Books, even. But many of these arguments are based on visual concepts, like perspective. It makes sense that there will be many videos.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean the arguments are founded on Youtube videos. Just that the arguments are founded on concepts that are often relayed in Youtube videos.</p>

You can make a write up on the Michelson-Morely experiment, the Jesuit  spreading of round earth in history that those unintelligent Chinese didn&#39;t get word of until the 1700s, Auguste Picard reaching the stratosphere and proclaiming th earth appeared flat with upturned edges, trace the debate through the 1800s and early 1900s through Rowbotham and Zetetic Astronomy. You could point out that gravity is 1/1000 the strength of electromagnetism on the surface of earth and buoyancy and density are the only actual relevant factors on terra firma. But who actually has the wherewithal to research diligently into something that questions the foundations of culture and scientism? Barely anyone, so crappy videos are made and are very effective in presenting the essential alternative perspective.

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the best reaction. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re right, and many if not most FE advocates are behaving in a shill-like manner. That in and of itself shouldn&#39;t have any bearing on the truth of FE. It could be true <em>and</em> people could be communicating it very poorly, either out of incompetence or malice. But I don&#39;t think it follows that the theory is wrong because of that. </p>

<p>I have noticed the same thing as you with the videos, though. I won&#39;t preclude outright shilling/psyop, though I would suspect in genuine FE&#39;ers, they came to their beliefs through youtube, and therefore likely don&#39;t have textual or mathematical sources to back it up, and probably wouldn&#39;t understand them even if they had them. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t give FE much stock, though I did spend a bit of time a year or so ago trying to see if there were any good textual explanations, and didn&#39;t really find any. I never found any model of FE that would explain all the phenomena I can witness with my own eyes or with instruments I can hold in my hand. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps you could answer this for me. It’s out of context but hopefully it will do:</p>

<p>Cavendish&#39;s experiment seems to have yielded accurate measurements that agree with modern experiments using more sensitive instruments and more sophisticated methods.</p>

<p>And if all of this is really a lie, then how do engineers design the devices we use every day like cars, boats, and airplanes, all of which require an accurate gravitational constant to properly design and more importantly, to accurately simulate.</p>

<p>Because we are indeed able to simulate cars, planes, and boats as well as bridges, buildings, and just about every other industrially designed device in use today, and those simulations have to be, and are, in agreement with what we see when we perform real world experiments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can easily research critiques on the Cavendish experiment, to put it simply it&#39;s bunk. One may just as easily look up the force of gravity on earth and the force of electro-magnetism, you may be surprised to learn gravity is only relevant in space, where oddly electromagnetism plays zero role. The invention and engineering of machines does not require gravity, in fact gravity remains rather undefined and is a mysterious magical force with infinite range and no known medium of transfer. It&#39;s a Newtonian force, but Einstein describes it as a bend of space time, but the WMAP measured the universe to be flat, so ultimately it&#39;s irrelevant unless your in fantasy space land.

    <div class="md"><p>Op, there is a post like yours that appears just like clockwork almost every week without fail accusing the Flat Earthers of being part of some psy-op to discredit more legitimate conspiracies and to ridicule those who are attempting to investigate them.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;ve been a contributing member of this forum for almost two years and I have yet to see any Flat-Earthers derail or distract attention away from any conversations about any other conspiracies being dealt with here or make any direct posts about their research into the possibility that the Earth is flat and that the notion it&#39;s a ball flying through space at an unbelievable speed is part of a centuries long conspiracy. </p>

<p>I have, however, seen some of them respond, and quite rightly so to the accusations that people like you continually disparage and attempt to ridicule them with. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not a true believer in either side, but more of a collector of unusual and conflicting facts that challenge any scientific, historic, or social status-quos we are quite simply inculcated to believe as small children and never dare to question <em>if we know what&#39;s good for us</em>. </p>

<p>So the kind of direct experimentation done just as scientifically as possible by the Flat Earth researchers is in fact worth paying attention to and they deserve credit for pursuing and re-evaluating all the facts concerning that original status-quo. </p>

<p>They are doing exactly what the rest of us are attempting to do with any other number of conspiracies that we happen to suspect are genuine.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m more interested in flat earth. I can understand skepticism of the moon landing, as I am skeptical of the details we’ve been given too. Flat earth though I just can’t get behind.  I’ve seen the evidence for myself, and I suspect most flat earthers simply haven’t either.</p>

<p>And I don’t mean YouTube video evidence. I’ll concede that it’s not “proof” in that I haven’t flown to space and looked out a window, but I just don’t see how what I’ve seen could have been faked.</p>

<p>On top of that, experiments I’ve both studied and performed support the science behind the “globe earth”.</p>

<p>Finally, the notion of flat earth seems to preclude the physical laws that go hand in hand with nearly all of modern technology that seems to behave exactly the way science predicts it will, and the way we all expect and rely on it to.</p>

<p>We literally live in a world where most (first world, at least) individuals can prove for themselves that it’s a globe, and yet there still exist those who for whatever reason refuse to put the work in to do what’s necessary to discover the truth. Instead they study videos other people make and theorize as to why they “look fake”.</p>

<p>And that’s not even the worst of it, others don’t actually think for themselves at all, preferring to let strangers tell them what to believe because they sound convincing on a podcast.</p>

The Apollo missions are huge if you ever want to understand FE. You can&#39;t brush them off and still make an honest delve into FE. The key word here being &quot;honest.&quot; Is this an honest post? I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>The US came out of WWII vastly behind German and Tussian scientists, despite the Atom Bomb. The rush to space and claiming we made it to the moon first has more to do with winning the Cold War than Flat Earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This kind of post is repeated every week.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll do my best to give you some food for thought. </p>

<p>Sure flat earth is all over YouTube, bit the globe earth theorist videos are all over YouTube as well. So that is not a talking point.</p>

<p>The flat earth is growing quickly because a lot of people are skeptics and skeptics will go out of there way to test and prove something if that means not having to trust someone&#39;s word. This is exactly what thousands and thousands (dare I say millions) of people have done confirming that the belief that Greeks have proved the globe by watching boats disappear in the distance. Every single time it can be brought back into view magically through the curvature of water that was initially obscuring it. </p>

<p>If you were an honest conspiracy theorist, you would take the time to do this observation yourself, or at least spend a fair amount of time going through a ton of nobody&#39;s (a large amount of individual normal citizens is way more trustworthy than a couple corrupt authority figures) to confirm that this is a legitimate observation. </p>

<p>Once you see the phenomenon yourself, you can no longer be decieved by perceived curvature. </p>

<p>And just to be clear,my goal is to develop an experiment that can be done cheaply and repeated to measure the change in angle of gravity or lack of.  Basically we need a test where the results will have to favor one model over the other.</p>

<p>The experiments that aim to measure angles of the sun are useless in determining the shape of what is under us. They may seem like proof if you keep your thought process inside the preverbial box.</p>

<p>I drove far away enough from the Rocky mountains that they disappeared from view entirely from the bottom up and I couldn&#39;t see them even through binoculars or a telescope. Not possible on a flat plane. Flat Earth busted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same way. The thing is, with just about any other theory here, you are actually able to have a discussion about it and come to your own conclusions about whether it&#39;s true or not. People post evidence, that evidence is examined. It&#39;s a conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Not flat earth though, once you try to learn more about flat earth theory, you&#39;d better be prepared to shut up and believe, because you can&#39;t discuss it like every other theory. Here&#39;s an example of what I mean:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x39fw/been_watching_a_lot_of_space_xs_star_man_live/du5a18s/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x39fw/been_watching_a_lot_of_space_xs_star_man_live/du5a18s/</a></p>

<p>Note that over the course of at least 20 comments, I still haven&#39;t figured out why they couldn&#39;t just fake a star scape. I&#39;ve learned that flat earth is real because &quot;the rockets never leave earth&#39;s orbit&quot;.</p>

<p>How do I know that? A YouTube video stitched together consisting of 3-5 second clips of miscellaneous rocket launches, of course.</p>

<p>Oh but that video is legit, don&#39;t you know what it&#39;s about? Neither do I, I tried to ask, but I also never figured out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x39fw/been_watching_a_lot_of_space_xs_star_man_live/du5flgr/">which launches are depicted in the video and why they&#39;re fishy</a>. There&#39;s an obvious reason for this, it&#39;s because by asking that question I was clearly denying that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x39fw/been_watching_a_lot_of_space_xs_star_man_live/du5fpjy/">rockets fly in an arc</a>.</p>

<p>But hey, you can&#39;t blame someone for completely ignoring most of your post and cherry picking one small part of it (you can), which is why I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x39fw/been_watching_a_lot_of_space_xs_star_man_live/du5tnxe/">repeated the question</a> (excuse my incivility, this comment is from much later in the discussion when my patience has run out).</p>

<p>That&#39;s okay though, once I asked again I learned that... Well actually, I still haven&#39;t learned why a star scape couldn&#39;t just be faked. However, I have now learned that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x39fw/been_watching_a_lot_of_space_xs_star_man_live/du5twen/">NASA are proven liars and that rocket&#39;s don&#39;t ever actually leave Earth&#39;s orbit</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, but that&#39;s okay. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x39fw/been_watching_a_lot_of_space_xs_star_man_live/du5u1nr/">I understand why rockets don&#39;t fly straight up and why it appears that they turn and come back towards earth, so I share this</a>. However, clearly this too is untrue. Why, you ask? Because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x39fw/been_watching_a_lot_of_space_xs_star_man_live/du5v6st/">Youtube Videos</a>.</p>

<p>Well alright, I have a few YouTube videos of my own. Oh but what&#39;s that? Well of course <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x39fw/been_watching_a_lot_of_space_xs_star_man_live/du5wpdk/">none of the videos I&#39;ve posted can be trusted</a>. In fact, only flat earth videos can be trusted.</p>

<p>Well, this is a hell of a conspiracy I&#39;m learning about! Why is it that flat earthers only trust YouTube videos, and why only some? That&#39;s obvious, it&#39;s because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du6qgby/?context=3">there is a lesson to the flat earth theory and I need to keep an open mind</a>. Or maybe the reason flat earthers prefer YouTube videos is because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du5woxm/">I am succumbing to the fallacy of Authority</a>. Or maybe it&#39;s because I havent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du5z6q7/">bought</a> the right <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du6o1hc/">book</a>. If you&#39;re interested, all of the best flat earth books fall under the Religion &amp; Spirituality category.</p>

<p>Fret not though! There are some flat earthers who are wiling to discuss the theory with you and who have some written literature to share! Here&#39;s a great <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du5x058/">blog post</a>. It&#39;s a solid 10 paragraphs even. Unfortunately, you&#39;ll need to watch 47 minutes of YouTube and listen to 2 hours and 51 minutes of a podcast to understand the blog post.</p>

<p>Since I was asking for literature and got what amounts to another set of media to watch, is it wrong of me to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du5xg03/">point this out</a>?</p>

<p>Well, theoretically, but forget about that for a second because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du5xtny/">the Cavendish experiment</a>. What&#39;s the Cavendish experiment, you ask? Obviously it&#39;s about a guy who managed to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du5xtny/">weigh Mars with heavy balls in a shed</a>.</p>

<p>The cavendish experiment isn&#39;t about weighing Mars with heavy balls in a shed? Forget about that for a second, because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du5yngs/">how do you think the mass of Mars was officially determined</a>?But wow, I know how the mass of Mars was determined and it wasn&#39;t done by Cavendish in a shed with two heavy balls (this is starting to sound like a board game advertisement now, I know).</p>

<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du5yv3g/">here&#39;s how the mass of Mars was determined. And anyways, if all of this is true then how do modern electronics, vehicles, and everything else we use in the world work?</a> </p>

<p>The answer to that is both clear and obvious, and it&#39;s because <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du5zekh/">I am being disingenuous and I need to be civil and reasonable</a> (there&#39;s that cherry picking again).</p>

<p>Again though, I can&#39;t blame someone for skipping over that part of my comment, so I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du5zgcv/">ask again</a>. This time, I helpfully learn that the reason modern technology works even though the science behind it is bunk is that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du60p47/">this is the line which believers are trained to parrot. And anyways, have you ever seen these &#39;modern experiments&#39; in action for yourself?</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, but I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du616kg/">have seen the experiments for myself</a>? Performed them even?</p>

<p>Well in that case, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du65y7m/">let&#39;s</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du66cf6/">discuss</a> [<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du66imy/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du66imy/</a>) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du67m6q/">Cavendish experiment</a> some more.</p>

<p>Actually, forget about everything I said, because clearly I&#39;m just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x6lvb/flat_earthers_why_are_your_arguments_always/du69tlw/">making outlandish claims</a>.</p>
