        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This story from <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> is currently at the top of reddit:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7wzrzw/trump_sold_a_40_million_estate_to_a_russian/">Trump Sold a $40 Million Estate to a Russian Oligarch for $100 Million—and a Democratic Senator Wants to Know Why</a></p>

<p>Notice that OP <em>deliberately</em> left out the word &quot;Democratic&quot; to editorialize the title. That&#39;s something I would expect on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, not <a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, sorting by /new offers some refreshing sanity:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to make too big a point of it, but this submission&#39;s headline is leaving out an important word: &quot;TRUMP SOLD A $40 MILLION ESTATE TO A RUSSIAN OLIGARCH FOR $100 MILLION—AND A <em>DEMOCRATIC</em> SENATOR WANTS TO KNOW WHY</p>

<p>Did Newsweek change their headline or did <a href="/u/pheexx--">/u/pheexx--</a> and if so why? It seems to me rather important that submissions not change the headlines in ways that could be misleading. As submitted, it suggests some large-scale congressional interest rather than a single democratic senator who no doubt has reasons both valid and politics-driven for pursuing this.</p>

<p>How did this get to top again with same click bait title?</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s his estate, and he can do whatever the hell he wants with it?</p>

<p>Because he deals in real estate? </p>

<p>Wasn’t Trump a real-estate mogul? This is a business deal. </p>

<p>This is what the last year and half has finally led up to!!! A real estate tycoon sold real estate to a Russian!! Holy shit!</p>

<p>I mean why does it matter. Everyone buys and sells houses/property every day for profit, especially holding the property for 4 years after selling, he made a good deal.</p>

<p>Trump bought the estate during the &#39;08 financial crisis, after the market had crashed. Anyone buying property during this time would experience wild returns if they sold it now.</p>

<p>To make money of course. Has this world lost all common sense?</p>

<p><a href="/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a> certainly has for pushing this stuff to the top of reddit.</p>

<p>The 3-letter agencies/military industrial complex that has hijacked the US is perfectly content to let the manufactured anti-Trump hysteria consume the imagination of the population, while their literal crimes against humanity continue unimpeded. </p>

<p>The most shocking aspect about this debacle is that so many well-meaning and intelligent folks have been swept up by this propaganda. It&#39;s a similar (but opposite) approach as during the Obama era, as they manufactured &quot;hope&quot; instead of outrage to distract the masses from the fact that <em>nothing</em> significant was changing.</p>

<p>As Clinton, Bush and Obama before him, Trump&#39;s administration continues the exact same destructive foreign policy, while the MSM successfully distracts the people with toothless conspiracies.</p>

<p>And yet you do so every day, so much so that I knew this was going to be a <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a> thread before I even read the username. Heck, I even have you tagged as &quot;modding for Trump&quot;. I suppose the weasel word is &quot;unequivocally*- maybe there&#39;s something about Trump you won&#39;t support, but I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any red line he&#39;s crossed yet that you won&#39;t cheerfully upvote.</p>

<p>Why does the fact that the Senator is a Democrat matter <em>at all</em>? Hell, if anything, it shows that, by not asking this very question themselves, Republicans are marching in lockstep to support Trump. Of course, I guess it really <em>would</em> be news if it were a Republican looking into it...</p>

<p>I thought this was a subreddit devoted to finding the hidden truths... or, at the very least, discussing them. But now you&#39;re going out of your way to dismiss any concerns about Trump&#39;s actions <em>before they&#39;re even brought up in this sub</em>. That&#39;s not just supporting Trump, that&#39;s actively, preemptively defending him.</p>

<p>I recognize that this post will likely just get me banned around here, but I figured someone had to call you out for your blatant, ethically-challenged Trump cheerleading.</p>

<p>I would also question the reasoning behind someone purchasing a home for 2.5X it&#39;s value. My parents live in a neighborhood where houses sell for about $300k. If one went for $750k, that sale would be incredibly suspicious. </p>

<p>This article clears evverything up quite nicely. </p>

<p>It was bought at auction, fixed up a little, and then listed at $125mil for several years. Trump dropped the price, dude offered $75Mil, they ended up at $95mil. </p>

<p>&quot;Rybolovlev is well known for buying homes as if he’s spending Monopoly money. His 24-year-old daughter Ekaterina bought Skorpios, the 74-acre Greek island where Aristotle Onassis married Jackie Kennedy, for a price estimated at $150 million or more. Then there’s the family’s $88 million apartment overlooking Central Park West, the $20 million home in Hawaii acquired from actor Will Smith and the $135 million residence in the Swiss resort of Gstaad. (To be perfectly fair, that one consists of two houses.)&quot;</p>

<p>So it&#39;s not like this transaction raised any red flags. </p>

<p>After buying it, he never lived there due to a mold problem being discovered. Dude went through a divorce in 2015, tore down the house, and is selling off the land in 3 chunks. One lot already sold for $34.34 mil so the guy is even looking at breaking even.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how you can read this article and still think this is some sort of evidence of &quot;russian collusion&quot; especially since this was almost a decade before Trump even got into politics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not that this points to Russian collusion, so much as it&#39;s showing that Trump has relationships with shady Russians.

<p>Pointing out other expensive properties the guy bought doesn&#39;t address the fact that he paid 2.5X what this property was worth. That could certainly be explained by the lack of other available property, though I&#39;m not sure why the guy didn&#39;t just tear the place down immediately if it had a mold problem. Also, was there nothing in the contract addressing mold? Did the guy not hire anyone to inspect the place first?</p>

<p>Trump reduced the price to $100 million before the real estate crash. If you look at the <a href="https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Tools/Pages/HPI-Calculator.aspx">housing price index in Florida</a> from mid 2004 to mid 2008, you will see that a house purchased at $40 million in 2004 would be worth around $40 million in mid 2008.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The house isn&#39;t where the value was. </p>

<p>Rybolovlev gave up on the mansion, successfully seeking permission to tear it down and divide the land under it into three parcels.</p>

<p>By November, the first of them had already sold, drawing $34.34 million for 2.35 acres.</p>

<p>“I thought the Russian was crazy to buy the place at that price, but now it looks like he’ll at least break even,” mused gossip columnist Lambiet.</p>

<p>Probably not, countered real-estate agent Pohrer: Although Rybolovlev may make back his purchase price, he’s been paying about $1.4 million a year in taxes since 2008, as well as the considerable upkeep on the huge house. “Overall, he’s going to wind up losing a pretty penny on this, maybe around $20 million,” Pohrer said.</p>

<p>“I actually thought the price was a little low,” he added. “There’s really no other vacant coastal land in Palm Beach for sale — everything else is going to come with a house on it. And this was the biggest of the three parcels, so the others will go for less.”</p>

<p>Regardless of where you find the value of the mansion/land, <a href="https://datatoolkits.lincolninst.edu/subcenters/land-values/land-prices-by-state.asp">land prices in Florida crashed as well during the housing crisis</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t buy it during the financial crisis, he sold it. You know, in the middle of a real estate crash. And he sure was a &quot;real estate mogul once&quot;, but as the article notes this happened months after that business of his filed for bankruptcy. </p>

<p>So you have the real estate market being in bad shape, one guy needing to sell a house fast to secure cash flow. And he then sells to an Oligarch, the guys famous for always seeking ways to launder their money outside of Russia, way above market value.</p>

<p>But nothing to see here, right? Clearly the real conspiracy everyone should focus on is the dude leaving out &quot;democratic&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was actually going to reply to your post but ended up deleting my comment because I knew you would say something like this. You call out anyone who disagrees with you before they even get a chance to say anything, but I guess since you do it in generic statements like this it doesn&#39;t qualify as a Rule 10 violation. So congrats, you&#39;ve managed to silence one dissenting opinion. Keep making posts like this and you might even get to these other ones eventually.</p>

I just don&#39;t get how you can possibly pretend to act surprised by downvotes when you post incredibly devisive stuff like this? The whole point of this post is to basically say &quot;Only biased democrats would question Trump&#39;s amazing business deals, and the real conspiracy is hiding that it&#39;s a democrat questioning it&quot; and then immediately following that up by saying &quot;I&#39;m not a Trump supporter and anyone who says otherwise is a troll&quot;. You know exactly what to say to get downvoted, just so you can then complain about downvotes.</p>

<p>If it makes you think any better of me, I even upvoted <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7we7da/rand_paul_the_right_cries_out_our_military_is">one of your posts</a> recently (along with a lot of other people apparently). I didn&#39;t downvote this post because you posted it, I downvoted it because it is divisive political crap that isn&#39;t even really a conspiracy.

<p>Yeah, we are.</p>

<p>We are the ones to question why the President sold a $40 million mansion in the middle of a real estate crash to a Russian oligarch with ties to Igor Sechin for 2.5x it&#39;s worth. We are also skeptical of the bankruptcies and the immiediate debt payments that the President was ordered to pay to Deutsche Bank within months of receiving that cash injection.</p>

<p>But hey, someone in r/worldnews left out a word about a senator on the finance committee doing their job by investigating the President&#39;s finances and how there was a lot of Russian involvement over an extended period of time into the Trump Org.</p>

But oh wait, it&#39;s about Daddy Trump so of course that&#39;s a &quot;good&quot; comment. Business men never do shady shit as we all know, especially here in r/conspiracy</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It didn&#39;t appreciate value, that&#39;s the point. It looks an awful lot like money laundering. This isn&#39;t new information. Anyone who&#39;s looked at his business dealings knows about this transaction as well as others that reek of money laundering. The US banking system stopped lending to him because of this, which is why he had to get lending from foreign banks (like Deutsche Bank, who he waived criminal charges and fines for last month, which to me sounds like a real conspiracy).</p>

<p>It&#39;s not anti-Trump hysteria to have questions about all of this. </p>
