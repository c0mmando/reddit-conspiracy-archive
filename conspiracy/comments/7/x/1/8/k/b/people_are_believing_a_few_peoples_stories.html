       It worries me. I've been thinking more about North Korea lately - about how they have managed to become an international scape goat and how a vast majority of this world believes the whole country to be held hostage, with a ruthless violent dictator at the helm.
      </p>
      <p>
       How did this belief come to be? Well, every now and then, the literal #1 enemy of NK will release/produce some kind of video interview, a documentary or whatever, of NK 'defectors'. These defectors will cry, break down and claim that their whole country is being starved - that inter-generational punishment and executions are happening. They claim that the dictatorship is so powerful, that no one dares to ever try and do anything about it. They claim that they are so happy to be in SK, in the free world, and that essentially - NK is hell, that it treats its citizens like shit etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The military complex/US govt/western world propaganda outlets will have you believe that NK is a major threat. That we must be scared of their ever growing power. That 'we must act soon, or it will be too late'. They will have you believe that there are huge camps full of slaves - that they the citizens are being used to the most extreme degree and not only is it a military/war crisis, but a humanitarian one too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there anything
       <em>
        wrong
       </em>
       with this picture? Is there something.. out of place?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's ask ourselves some questions. And lets try and answer them to make sense of all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where is the evidence to back
       <strong>
        a single claim made by any 'defector'
       </strong>
       .. In any shape of form that can be verified, seen with our own eyes etc.  Despite the power and technology of almost every superpower and their friends at disposal, the NK are
       <em>
        so advanced
       </em>
       in their secrecy and ability to hide any wrong doings that not even the US, Russia, UK/EU etc can manage to get footage or pictures that would give at least some kind of credibility to these accusations made by 'defectors'. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. ZERO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where are the spies? 25 million people, all living under 'harsh dictatorship rule' - having their families murdered and themselves thrown in and out of labour camps. How is it that not one brave man or woman has become a spy and smuggled/sent out some kind of evidence of how bad NK truly is? 25 million people, apparently without a single one having the courage to try and do something to change this apparently awful world they live in.
       <strong>
        25 million people that are being held hostage, unwilling or unable to do anything to bring to light all of the disgusting things going on
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the fact that 'our' own spies haven't managed to get anything either, is equally amazing. Apparently, with all the powers combined of the bully-bloc, they can't scrape together a single spy to get some evidence of 'All that bad stuff happening in NK, all the time, to basically everyone'. Despite the fact that every tyrannical dictator has had spies working behind their back in our history -
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       dictator manages to do what no one else could - stop
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       spies infiltrating his country and people. Truly an almost magical feat, if you ask me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the defectors. Whom I believe is either(or a mixture) SK actors who are trained well enough to be convincing of their fake NK story - something that wouldn't be hard to pull of whatsoever(acting, we have a whole industry set up around it, remember). Especially when 'your people' pretty much genetically line right up with 'their people'. Bit of linguistic training and you've got yourself a 'genuine North Korean defector'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on about what I believe to be inconsistincies in the 'official NK story'. But what really made me write this post is the footage you see in documentaries filmed in NK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something interesting you will notice about EVERY North Korean documentary - pretty much everyone is smiling. No one appears to be injured, shackled, hurt in any way. I've never seen any scars, any kind of damage to anyone in these docos. I just see people. Happy. Healthy looking. Working, playing, whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't
       <em>
        look
       </em>
       like a scary place. In fact if you compare it to the majority of the western world, they appear to be far more happier than we are. I've watched probably every major NK based documentary, and its the same every time. A whole bunch of happy healthy looking NK people all across the country, where ever they go. One of my personal favorites is Gareth Morgan's motorcycle tour across the whole country - it shows a lot of footage you don't see in other strictly city based docos. Gareth Morgan is a politician in my country(NZ) and is a really honest, good dude(probably why he didn't manage to get a seat in the last election).
      </p>
      <p>
       And then that line comes. That line that comes up in
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       single documentary. 'We aren't allowed to go anywhere we want and we have guides(WHO ARE ACTUALLY SPIES!) watching our every move'. Every fucking time.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let me explain now, what I think is actually going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say you are running a country, lets call it.. North Korea. Lets say that you have had a few issues with your neighbors over the years, and you kinda ended up pissing them and their big brother(superpowers) right off. Lets be real though, it wasn't the small shit - it was the refusal to accept the world bank into your borders. You wanted to retrain control of
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       country because.. fuck, its
       <em>
        yours
       </em>
       not
       <em>
        theirs
       </em>
       . To this day you remain as one of less than a literal handful of countries(Iran is another) that has denied any and all world bank interference.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the worlds powers then focused on painting you as the worst possible place on earth. They want you to comply with their orders. You are now presented as a living breathing concentration camp, on the scale of millions of people suffering every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world stage is rallied - 'we must stop this nation' they say. Rooms are being filled with diplomats representing all of the world(except you) where they discuss how important it is 'something is done'. And you know they aren't talking about raking the leaves off your yard. By 'something' they mean
       <em>
        'blow you and your people, your family, into tiny bits'
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       You as the leader of this nation are not having any of it. Fuck these bankers. Fuck these world powers, totally bending the knee to the masters that pull their strings. None of them have any real control of
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       countries anymore, and you are disgusted by what you see in these cultures anyway. A bunch of selfish, consumerist, anti-social, hate filled, unhealthy and fat, technology riddled and mentally ill populous that barely resembles even a generation prior..
      </p>
      <p>
       You see what has happened to the world around you, you see that anywhere the bankers go, the 'family values' and sense of community disappear. The social divides begin. The harmony of society is torn, and what is left? A bunch of confused, scared, weak people that don't even know who their neighbors are. That don't know how to work hard, or even provide some kind of useful beneficial skill to their community and country.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so, you begin the defense. You realize its too late, you aren't going to convince the class room of kids that are all throwing crap at you and treating you like a piece of shit - that you aren't the bad guy you were painted out to be. No, the popular guy with heavy influence over his peers has convinced the majority that anything you say is a lie. You literally cannot get out of this hole, they are convinced entirely that you are bad, and they are part of the good.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you go into defense mode. You decide that hell, if my country cannot simply 'exist' without constant threat of war due to your unwillingness to bend the knee to the bankers - that you will simply make them scared. You will retreat, you will get together your people and make a stand that you, your country, your people, do not want to be a part of this new world order. You will build the same bombs that you are under the very threat of. You will en devour to build the same missile capabilities. You will increase your military size, military implacements, and focus on not only running the country, but stopping 'them' from coming in and taking it from you, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how are you treated for protecting your country? How are you treated for coming up with a strategy, and executing it, to ensure the continued safety of your country?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are treated like the Hitler reincarnate. You are the worlds #1 enemy. Everyone is talking about how evil you are, that there must be evil things going on because.. the 'unknown' simply MUST equal something negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you figure hey maybe if I let people into my great country, they will see how amazing it really is. But I must be carful, for I do not want these NWO types to simply run free across my lands. They may infect my culture with the negativity that they are trying to escape themselves. They may be trying to sabotage your country, they may be spies. They may be anything - as far as you are concerned? The rest of the world is Nazi germany, and you are the free world - and you are letting a few Nazis into your country each year in a futile effort to prove that the country is a great one. That you have huge buildings, bridges, and cities. That the people are smiling, they are healthy. That there is food, and luxuries. That it is clean and free of litter and filth. That the people have a purpose, and everyone does their bit to keep that country ticking along. That the familes are whole, not divided.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to no avail. For every 'Nazi' that enters your country, that you rightfully treat with great suspicion, claims;
      </p>
      <p>
       'Its all a show'.
      </p>
      <p>
       'We aren't allowed to walk freely where ever we want because you are
       <em>
        hiding
       </em>
       the evil, bad stuff'.
      </p>
      <p>
       'The people are only smiling because they will be tortured if they don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       'What we see isn't available for regular citizens, we are being treated and its at the expense of the peoples livelihoods'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people that visit your country - they don't even believe their own eyes. Their ears. Their own senses are a LIE because they were TOLD that what you see is not real, and so what they see, is simply not real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite overwhelming evidence pointing to EVERYTHING being wrong that they were taught in the 'Nazi school', they will deny every last bit of it. Every smile is fake. Every single interaction is planned and artificial. Every soldier wants to escape.
      </p>
      <p>
       This. This is the world we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Obviously I don't know for certain anything. However I do know that the entire planet is teaming up to shit on one country, a country that thus far, in every piece of actual evidence I've seen, seems to be a relatively regular country and the only thing to the contrary are a bunch of people, who could very well be actors - saying otherwise).

       That North Korean 'documentary' about the West is a great calibrating watch; "B-movie actor Arnold Schwarzenegger" and "this Capitalist slave..."
      </p>

       Propaganda though it is, it is not irrational. And, ultimately, if China has a problem with NK, or if they are simply unwilling to absorb refugees if "something happens", what does anyone in the West have to say?

       As for China? I think it'd be better for them in every way to help reestablish a NK leadership if that did happen. It seems to me any alternative would be far more costly.

       Thanks! And yeah I do use a bit of profanity but only where I feel it is within reasonable context to add an emotional lining. I'm no 'professional' writer by any means(cause that would mean I'd get paid right? Hah) so.. I mean if people are gonna downvote and ignore a post that quite clearly has some effort put into it then.. Well, fuck them.

       I'd like to point out that many people are completely unwilling to accept that North Korea could be a far better off place than they have been led to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are the embodiment of the 'nazi visitor'. No amount of reality can disrupt the image they have of NK.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want people to start asking more questions. I want people to actually open up discussion to the concept I have outlined in my(quite fucking long, sorry) OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's hard to fathom. Everything you know, or thought you knew, could be a lie. You've potentially been fooled completely into hating a leader and its govt with nothing but anecdotal stories from people propped up by the govt(SK) who has every reason to lie and continue this fabrication.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me personally, it is simply the lack of dirt. The lack of dirt that the whole world can't seem to find to completely solidify the official narrative. We are led to believe that NK is simultaneously so incompetent and useless that they can't feed themselves despite the huge amount of land to citizen ratio, but at the same time can thwart any and all efforts from the rest of the world to secure any kind of evidence that things are so truly bad for the NK people.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's a hard fuckin pill to swallow. Way harder than swallowing the pill that NK is simply under a huge propoganda attack, to rally support for a war to finally insert the world banks power structure to NK soil. It happened to Iraq. It happened to Libya. It happened to Afghanistan. These countries all had refused the world banks 'offer' and so paid the price - the one that I believe NK is about to be forced to pay.

       I think NK is a CIA project, a psyop. But I think it is also a shithole. I really don't know what to believe.

       Well do you believe that NK, or any nation, can actually stop any and all spies from getting dirt on their 'brutal tyrannical dictatorship'? One of my favorite quotes which I can't actually really remember properly is something like 'What ever you havnt ruled out, no matter how unlikely, can be the only answer'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like, considering that a single image of a labour camp full of starving skeleton NK citizens would be all it takes to get almost near-full public support for military intervention, a literal 'OK GUYS LET'S DO IT, LIBERATION TIME!' from the western war machine... That this obviously isn't the case, because they somehow havnt gotten anything like that, ever.. Tells me that.. NK obviously
       <em>

       be so bad. If it was, we'd have some kind of evidence beyond anecdotal.

       I agree with you. I want to see some pictures of the misery. I do actually think the living conditions in NK are fucked, for the record, but why don't we have any visual record of all the bad shit? We don't even got any bullshit photoshops to argue about.

       Exactly, and honestly I do accept it's a possibility that it's all as bad as we've been told and maybe even worse. It's possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its just to me so far on the edge of 'possible' that I feel it'd be offensive to my own brain to try and rationalize all these things that make no sense at all regarding the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the weirdest parts about this conspiracy? I've never seen anyone bring up the lack of actual evidence regarding NK and the situation we are fed. It's like it's just.. Flown over everyones heads. Like, they've pulled this massive con on the population and damn have they done a good job.. Because they did it with basically nothing! Few actors having a cry and bam, whole world is supporting the war-mongering banksters next 'op'. It's scary as hell that so many people are being manipulated... If that is indeed the case.

       And honestly, I wouldn't even be surprised if when(WHEN) they get invaded, we still won't have seen any reliable evidence. They'll wage this war with nothing but the word of some fake north Korean defectors.. 100% I believe this will be the case.

       I mean hell, they already managed to convince the world 'something needs to be done' with a few tears. Which is kind of what I'm realizing is the true sickness to this story - the ability for powers to manipulate a whole freaking planet of people with a handful of actors

       The Korean border is not completely secure, despite what we are led to believe by media. I don't think that's particularly good evidence for or against NK being highly oppressed as if it's a really awesome place to live.. Not many would leave.. So it would appear everyone is a prisoner.. Couple that with the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that NK probably has a very 'but we're family' vibe going on regarding getting up and leaving. Kinda like.. 'Hey where you going kid, I just spent 20 years raising you.. You gotta help
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       now.'
      </p>
      <p>
       This kind of 'you owe me, and leaving the family home this young is shitting on all of us you ungrateful..' kind of guilt trip is quite common across various Asian cultures. Some western rural cultures would do this far more than the average suburban western family, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it may not be fear of death by shooting that is actually an issue. We could just be looking at a
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       tightly knit, community driven, family sticks together kinda buzz going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kinda like an amped up version of what might happen to a kid wanting to leave his rural town family farm before he's rely ever contributed. Just magnify that by including the whole town haha.

       Very good post! I honestly had not thought of that specific situation in that way, I'm almost disappointed in myself for not thinking of it already because generally I do tend to disbelieve the official narrative, especially the more accepted it is. Thanks for putting in the time on this!

       Thanks dude. When I started critical thinking of the NK situation, it just became more and more obvious to me that things didn't add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be too gutted though about not picking up on this. Seems the whole world got hypnotized or something because it's really becoming clearer the more that I talk to people and discuss this that.. No ones been taking this devils advocate position, putting themselves in the shows of those they point the finger at.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like.. No one. No one has questioned the lack of any evidence and the lack of any reasonable explanation for lack of evidence. It's just like.. Everyone heard this story of a crazy horrible dictator holding 25mil people hostage, believed it.. And carried on with their day(only, now being far more inclined to agreeing with bombing North Korea than when they woke up earlier that day).

       Probably one of the most effective 'psyops' I've ever seen. Almost got me too! Aaaalmost. Hah.

       Hmm, I have a theory on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       People aren't stupid. I mean, they
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       , but they are quite capable of free thought. It doesn't take a child long for him to figure out you can't
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       read his mind because when he tried calling you a smelly pants in his mind, and you didn't even look at him, he realized it was false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, the divine powers or idea that the NK worship Un like a God and gear his magical wrath, to me personally, is probably a myth created by SK.
      </p>
      <p>
       There isn't really anything to back it up. The NK people seem to just have a great respect for what they probably perceive to be a strong and capable leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paying respects to a leader is something most westerners can't even imagine doing much beyond a handshake or a polite letter. The idea of looking at a picture of your president and bowing to it, chanting a thoughtful message - yes, it sounds a bit wacky. But it really isn't that weird when you think that to them, he is responsible for their relatively decent lifestyles and this just.. Isn't weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you lived in a big village and you had this dude holding shit down real good - way better than the last guy who got your dad killed in a senseless war, you are probably gonna pay mad respect especially if his leadership afforded you a nice(r) home, better food and more stability just in life itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       What has he done that we can, with almost certainty, prove him to be atleast competent or worthy of respect from his people as a leader?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well.. He's stayed out of war. The Koreans are much more connected to their history than most westerners I'd be willing to wager - they've seen and felt how devastating war can be to families, villages, cities and the country as a whole. They hear the news that Un has launched yet another rocket, keeping them safe and reassured that he is working on keeping the country capable of defending itself - while also showing strength and avoiding conflict entirely. The people will be appreciative of this, especially the very significant part of the population that has lost family to war.
      </p>
      <p>
       His more relaxed attitude towards certain traditional rule(especially for women) would have certainly helped garner female support.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has also shown he isn't scared and is not going to become scared, despite being under constant threat of assassination. He hasn't really backed down on any of the bombs/rockets has he now.. He will of course, I assume anyway, be making it very clear to the population that he spits in the face of this 'nazi NWO' that is a very real threat, every time he launchs a bomb or rocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt anyone actually thinks he's a God. I think that's a ploy to get people to sympathize with overthrowing him 'Even if his people don't want that at all!' because they 'just don't realize how damn brain washed they are!'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine for a moment you have a leader in your town and as far as you are concerned, he's the MAN! He saved the towns drinking water from pollution and lowered everyone's taxes. He hooks every up with a killer BBQ every 2nd Sunday afternoon too. The whole town including you only have positive things to say. Infact you could say that the town appears to be worshipping this mayor of sorts. So someone comes and removed him - stating that you are all brainwashed and that this is good for you, you simply don't know it yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fuckin genius.

       If you honestly think no internet = no freedom then you I'd highly suggest going on a weekend hike and leaving the phone at home. It'll do you good.

       Listen, I'm ALL about unplugging and getting out in nature.  There's nothing I love more than spending weeks out in the woods without another person in sight.  I've recommended it to 2 people in the last 10 minutes on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I also grew up in a small community and the internet saved me.  It saved me from their backwards thinking, it confirmed many things I thought to be true but was told otherwise, it opened up an entire WORLD for me.  So you can take the internet out of my cold, dead hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the thing with dictatorships - what's good for you, may not be good for others.  That's why freedom for ALL is so damn important.

       I understand where you are coming from, but it sounds like living in a toxic community was the problem, not the lack of internet. The internet probably didn't solve as much stuff as much as it allowed you to simply zone out and have a new, less backwards and fucked up world. Could be wrong but thats my experience with people in those situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And fair enough on your last point. I completely disagree and think this 'muh freedom, I do what I want when I want' attitude people have is so poisonous.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everyone had real freedom, the world would be chaos. You would not have internet. You happily enjoy many restrictions in your life because you've grown up with them and it's normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police? They impede on your freedom to do heaps of shit. Burnouts in the McDonald's carpark? Well no one's here so what's the problem officer, do you hate.. FREEDOM??
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the worlds had too
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       freedom and not enough community involved accountability. The 'Well.. I'll just leave' mentality to solving problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all for a bit more restriction. Shits way too loose right now, and the average person has proven they can't handle it!

       Wow, I respectfully and strongly disagree and would most definitely NOT want to live in your country.
      </p>
      <p>
       My upbringing wasn't about a toxic community, it was about an ignorant community.  I'm not sure how old you are, but when the internet came out and you could chat with someone in a different country?  It was mind blowing.  You had a question and could immediately find an answer?  Mind blowing.  You could compare religions instead of having one force-fed to you?  Mind blowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       And your stance on freedom demonstrates a ridiculous amount of privileged thinking on your part.  I want to be able to believe what I want, say what I want and do what I want.  I'm not an anarchist and believe restrictions are necessary (because we can't have people yelling "FIRE" in a movie theater).  But a society's goal should always be to maintain as much freedom for the people as safely possible.  Because just because YOU can't handle your freedom, doesn't mean I should have to give mine up.  I'd argue that's what is wrong with society - putting you and I on very opposite sides of the philosophical spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       (This is a good conversation, though and I respect the amount of effort you've put into explaining your position.)

       That's cool. I only want people in my theoretical country that want to be there. It's not a prison ;) You can't come and go though. Once you gone, you gone - which I think is fair. But hey, I'm the dictator here. Of course I think its fair.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say it was an ignorant community. I would say that is toxic. I mean, being surrounded by ignorant people who can't even fathom the concept of playing devils advocate for
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       are some of the worst people around - super fucking toxic, in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, I grew up when the internet was just becoming a thing in the 90's. I fondly remember talking to americans and brits and all sorts of people on pogo.com while we played shitty 2d java games with each other. MSN.. oh man. Good times.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to me a community that is well built, has a rounded body of various characters and professions, backgrounds etc is what I would call 'my kind' of community. It's not about everyone getting along. I'm a firm believer in everyone NOT getting along, in fact. Thats not to so no one gets along with anyone, but that people should be more comfortable with accepting that we don't all 'gel'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, maybe I am experiencing 'privileged thinking'. Do you think the father who dictates the rules of their childrens life is experiencing 'privileged thinking' or are they simply in the better position to be telling the other what they can and can't do?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't like to pretend that everyone is capable of thinking for themselves, or fixing what they break, or building what they need. Thats why working as a team, a community - through all problems, both diplomatic and physical, is the better way of doing things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think society has the brains to collectively make a good decision on picking the leader. Infact, I think democracy has proven in pretty much.. every single election, everywhere, that humans fucking
       <em>
        suck
       </em>
       at collectively choosing a leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real leaders are not chosen. Real leaders take control, and lead.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to be able to believe, say, and do what you want. Yet, you then say in the very next sentence that you are actually OK with not being able to believe, say, or do what you want. So despite what you 'want', it is made completely moot by the rules of this 'free' society you live in. You don't have a choice, the decision was made for you - you can't do 'this' and you can do 'that'. And if you disobey, and 'we' the police catch you, your screwed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your societal goal is to me, what is destroying culture everywhere. 'Safety'. Everything comes back to 'but... how safe is that?'. It isn't about whether its a good thing to do, it isn't about whether its 'morally' or 'ethically' right to do.. its simply, is it safe?
      </p>
      <p>
       You know whats 'safe'? Me going out and waving my dick around at a school playground. I mean, it's just a dick, right? Whats so 'dangerous' about that? But yet, you probably think, as do I, that this is not something that should be done and neither of us would appreciate to hear a minor whom is our family or a friend or whatever come and tell us some man was waving his dick around at the playground. We wouldn't ask 'but did he hurt you?' and then when they respond 'no', go 'oh well thats fine then, don't worry about it'.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are
       <em>
        so many things
       </em>
       that should not be done, that are 'safe', that I just cannot agree on any level that this should be the factor that you balance freedom with.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not about what I can handle. It's not about what you can handle. It's about what society can
       <em>
        bare
       </em>
       . This 'everyone is responsible for themselves' nonsense, where no one wants to look at the bigger picture and see that if you help each other, we all get where we are going faster. This 'Yeah but.. I mean, I could just
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       talk to you again, because I don't need you.. so fuck resolving this minor dispute'
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all a byproduct of the 'I do what I want, when I want, where I want' mentality. And it is poisonous. Do I 'want' to help that person? Well.. na, I don't 'want' to. Should I? Oh fuck yes, its an old lady, she fell over. But I don't... 'want' to, so I won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can handle freedom. A lot of us can. But most of us, cannot. There are wolves and there are sheep. You cannot let the sheep believe they are wolves, otherwise they'll die.
      </p>
      <p>
       (I too, enjoy conversating with you on the internet about dictatorship and peoples right to freedom, haha) - I really don't like that 'conversate' gets the squiggly red line by default. I like it so much more than converse.

       You make several good points and I don't entirely disagree.  It reminds me of what my grandpa always says (we are on opposite sides of the political spectrum, but truly enjoy debating political philosophies) - he says the best kind of leader is a benevolent dictator.  Because his stance is similar to yours - the people don't always know what's good for them.  Ironically enough, however, he hated Obama.  Who, according to him, was a benevolent dictator.  BUT he didn't like the policies Obama imposed - so he hated him.  Which proved
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       point - that a democratic leader is still the best philosophy, even if the majority of people are too dumb to vote for their best interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this creates a societal conundrum.  However, the American forefathers thought of this as well by creating a Republic, areas being ran by local government.  Because what works in California sure as hell doesn't work in Texas.  The people are different, the culture is different, the geography is different - so it's myopic to think they should abide by the same rules and structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politically speaking - this is also why America works so well in theory.  The Democrats come in and create more regulations and look out for people's special interests.  But then government grows too much.  So then the Republicans come in and reverse some regulations and look out for the people's financial interests.  In theory, it creates a perfect balance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until it turns out everyone is in someone else's pockets and everyone is only looking out for themselves.  That's when a dictator comes in and pisses EVERYONE off and we have to blow up the system and start over.

       Dude. I keep thinking I'm just gonna get a flip phone once this thing dies. Go back to paying bills via western union, but find more freedom of thought. I know it's nice having all the answers to any questions at your fingertips, but do you ever miss the days of endlessly wondering about things and feeling satisfied when you figured it out on your own?

       Ive got food and water. I'm honestly not stressed. I'd just loosely shoot at anyone found around my property. Pretty sure after the first month, most of the idiots would have culled themselves off so it'd be relatively safe after that.. I think anyway.

       Don't eat ducks from suburban/city areas. They are often pretty filthy/full of bad bugs m/parasites because of the water often being run off from filthy sidewalks with shit on them, storm pipes leading to creeks etc.

       At the very least get a bunch of water purification tablets as they take up no room and a box of them for a couple bucks can be the difference between having water for weeks and dying of a horrible dehydrated death with your kids. You can get them on Amazon or any hunting/outdoors store.

       I see where you are comming from and i like your theory, but i see NK like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Nk is in the hands of a very capable dictator who has complete controll over everything in his country. If you already have complete controll over your banking and financial systems and you also want to play with the "big boys" and support their goals, there might be something else usefull you can offer them.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me NK feels like a very controlled "Jack in the box", one that suddenly jumps out on command if any distraction is needed. There is also the matter that NKs technical evolution is very "jumpy" and is suddenly very advanced and while i don't have evidence there are a few people that suggest Space x tech is used now in NK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ofcourse i have no evidence, it is also just a hunch i have regarding NK.

       In saying that, as dictator of my land, I provide no internet. Sorry but I just don't think it really helps society as much as it severely hurts it. Most people like to stay blissfully ignorant of how destructive the internet has been to modern culture.

       An intranet would be fine. The world doesn't need to be connected the way that it is, in my opinion.

       Wow, I respectfully and strongly disagree and would most definitely NOT want to live in your country.

       My upbringing wasn't about a toxic community, it was about an ignorant community.  I'm not sure how old you are, but when the internet came out and you could chat with someone in a different country?  It was mind blowing.  You had a question and could immediately find an answer?  Mind blowing.  You could compare religions instead of having one force-fed to you?  Mind blowing.

       And your stance on freedom demonstrates a ridiculous amount of privileged thinking on your part.  I want to be able to believe what I want, say what I want and do what I want.  I'm not an anarchist and believe restrictions are necessary (because we can't have people yelling "FIRE" in a movie theater).  But a society's goal should always be to maintain as much freedom for the people as safely possible.  Because just because YOU can't handle your freedom, doesn't mean I should have to give mine up.  I'd argue that's what is wrong with society - putting you and I on very opposite sides of the philosophical spectrum.

       (This is a good conversation, though and I respect the amount of effort you've put into explaining your position.)
