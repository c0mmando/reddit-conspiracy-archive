        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I should&#39;ve screen cap, but was so intrigued. They went something like this, &quot;Hey i&#39;m a flat earther, ama.&quot; Of course one or two ppl trolled the person, and slow clap for braving the overwatch match chat, LOL, but can we just take a moment to realize that this belief isn&#39;t going anywhere. We need to stop trashing flat-earthers, and really invite them into conversations, so we can undo the spell that&#39;s been cast on them. I mean that metaphorically, which magically speaking, is the same as literally. 
It&#39;s not funny anymore, as this movement is embedding itself into the larger conspiracy umbrella, by design I&#39;d argue, and trolling or shaming these individuals is not, never was, the answer. How do you contend with people who refuse to believe anything set with institutional authority, such as NASA? Point to these areas and if your flat earther is a real person(not a bot), should reply with interest: 
The map of the sky is divided into north and south hemispheres, because the sphere we live on rotates counter clockwise, and the stars enveloping our view, spin clockwise. Some constellations are only visible at certain points at certain times depending on where you are. 
Ancient Greek Eratosthenes ,mathematician, measured shadows in two different locales, same longitude, and calculated with great accuracy, the circumference of the earth.
Going up really high and saying, well it looks flat, so empirically, the world is flat, is not a valid point. We are tiny specks, we are smaller than ants compared to our globe earth, and if the world was truly flat, then you&#39;d really see the other side of the world, and wouldn&#39;t look straight/flat at all. It&#39;d be hell really. For instance, our human eyes are capable to see beyond the horizon, and because we don&#39;t see huge continents across the oceans, we can safely agree, the world is round. 
I know ppl think this shouldn&#39;t even be a thing, discussing with ease why the world IS NOT FLAT, but you do these people a great disservice by shaming them. The dangers of our time really, that our minds are capable of being literally flattened out, but in a digital age where ppl can consume loads of media, is the real danger. What kind of media do you consume, because the same effect is happening to you. Be kind, we&#39;re all fighting some battle. Flat Earthers, the real ones, the people not in on the scam, will only resist shame and fight trolls, rather than understanding actual facts.</p>

<p>We got talking and her core beliefs are that NASA has lied to us. When I pointed out that we have known the earth is round for the better part of two thousand years she basically called me brain washed.</p>

<p>She had zero factual evidence that the round was flat other than the usual &quot;NASA lied to us&quot; and a level is leveled in an airplane bullshit. </p>

<p>I laughed at her and walked away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Late 20s to mid 30s. It was a restaurant party, so the youngest person there was the hostess who was probably 20.</p>

<p>This girl was 24, self proclaimed feminist and anti vaxxer (who has no kids, thank god).</p>

<p>I was the outsider to this, being the boyfriend. There were a few other people like me, but I was the more interested one since I also believe in listening to both sides of the argument. But when one side is &quot;we have facts try to prove them wrong&quot; and the other side is &quot;well those facts bullshit and we have zero proof as to how&quot; then it&#39;s kinda hard to not laugh in their face. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whenever I bring up these specific points, the FE always avoids, ignores, or circumvents around it, effectively dodging them. Please answer these points of contention: Can you debunk two separate shadows in two different points, separated by hundreds or more miles, along the same longitude, and having different shadow lengths, AS one would expect on a sphere Earth. Can you debunk the fact, that people in the north hemisphere experience the night sky differently than the south?

    <div class="md"><p>So angry. Probably the root of your belief system. I watched your video, it&#39;s garbage. Same old FE tactics, you basically shit on everything that was ever taught and provide no alternative, except that the world is flat. You think I&#39;m blue pilled? lol, posting on r/conspiracy? You should meditate, or if you truly believe our world is special, constituting a unique plane(flat object) unobserved anywhere else in the universe, than you&#39;d be open to magical systems and operations? Learn how to break this spell that confines your mind...IMO, you&#39;re probably raging against the machine and this somehow appeals to you. Or, another likely story, you&#39;re just a bot, programmed to reinforce the Flat Earth fallacy, strengthen it, regurgitate it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat earth isn&#39;t going anywhere because it&#39;s the truth.  Yes the entire world is brainwashed by Luciferian elites who want you to be agnostic or atheist so they created this lie 500 years ago.  Nobody can be convinced of it, you have to be willing to consider it could be true and do your experiments.  Good luck breaking free of their illusion!</p>

I mean I figure most flat earth YouTubers are in it for the adsense revenue and it might be the main reason why its propagated by Google so much, it generates clicks. All you have to do to make your own content is to upload picture from space and comment how fake it looks and you get almost 100,000 views for whatever reason. Flat earth content making people money is the main reason it isn&#39;t going to go away.</p>
