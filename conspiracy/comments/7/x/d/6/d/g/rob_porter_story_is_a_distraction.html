</blockquote>

<p>This has just been directly refuted by Mike Pompeo today, check this clip:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/rgoodlaw/status/963454568884588544">https://twitter.com/rgoodlaw/status/963454568884588544</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a summary from Seth Abramson</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/963443592441319424">https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/963443592441319424</a></p>

<p>Link to a thread he did a couple days ago about the NYT story and why it seemed bogus from the get go:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/962560744029028352">https://twitter.com/SethAbramson/status/962560744029028352</a></p>

<p>If the CIA Director  told this to Congress on national television, you know he told the president this privately BEFORE the president tweeted out that the NYT story was true. This is a WAY bigger deal than the rob porter story, nothing will come from that Trump is a master at shaking off DV and sexual assault crimes. The media needs to shift the focus back to Russia, sanctions and the presidents lack of action against Russia</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump tweeted what he did at 10AM February 10.</p>

<p>The earliest it was refuted was Saturday afternoon (Feb 10) by Pompeo.</p>

<p>So Trump tweeted about 4-5 hours before anyone had refuted it.</p>

<p>Pompeo went on TV 3 days after Trump’s tweet, that is completely meaningless in terms of knowing about whether he briefed Trump pre tweet.</p>

<p>So what’s the evidence Trump intentionally lied given outside a random twitter opinion of a guy who wouldn’t have any way of knowing? There is no evidence for what you’ve claimed.</p>

<p>So it seems you are actually the one smearing unfairly.</p>

Any time you find your self committing wrongthink stop and remember that all that matters is Trump/Russia.  Don&#39;t let your friends forget.  Action against Russia for crimes we have seen no evidence or example of must not go on unpunished.  This MUST be at the forefront of every American&#39;s minds.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh so it&#39;s a lie based on the assumption that Trump had foreknowledge of the article, from what some would call a reputable source, being false?  Why hasn&#39;t NYT issued a retraction if it is false?  How do we know Mike is telling the truth when he claimed NYT article to be false?  Sure seems like a lot of assumptions led you to the conclusion Trump is lying when he&#39;s not actually lying.

<p>The story broke Friday night February 9th.</p>

<p>Trump tweeted this Saturday morning February 10th.</p>

<p>Pompeo called the story a falsehood Saturday afternoon, the 10th.</p>

<p>Who cares what he testified today, he already responded to the story Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>But Trump tweeted what he did at 10AM Saturday morning...</p>

<p>We’re going off Seth Abramson’s personal opinion that he was “likely” briefed before the hearing because he went on tv and denied it 3 days after the Trump Tweet?</p>

<p>Did Pompeo testify he briefed Trump before?</p>

<p>Trump seized on the story pretty quickly. It really isn’t hard to believe he tweeted before anyone briefed him.</p>

<p>So what’s the other evidence cuz right now this is just something Trump tweeted out several hours before it was later denied by Pompeo to a reporter.</p>

<p>How is this different than anyone else seizing on a report that’s later debunked?</p>

<p>Right there in the post Trump tweets about a story of the IC buying dirt on him. The CIA director today just said that never happened. Why is Trump smearing his IC, what does he have to hide, why is he so scared of this investigation. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve said nothing in regards to the post</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lmao imagine believing this still. Oct 28th 2016, GOP member Jason Chaffetz leaked the Comey letter about a new Hillary investigation, there was nothing there and they dropped it after searching the laptop. Causing a notable swing in the election </p>

<p>Giuliani was behind this stunt with the FBI NY office aka Trumplandia (their words). Why is Trump pretending that they didn&#39;t favour him in the election. Why is he. spreading blatant lies about his FBI and CIA. What will it take for you people to realise this guy is a fraud and does not deserved to hold office</p>
