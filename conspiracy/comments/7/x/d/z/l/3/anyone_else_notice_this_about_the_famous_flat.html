        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>B.o.B. was born on November 15, 1988
Shadow the Hedgehog was released on November 15, 2005</p>

<p>Sonic The Hedgehog was released on June 23, 1991
Kyrie Irving was selected #1 overall in the 2011 NBA draft, which was on June 23.</p>

<p>In the 2001 NBA playoffs, the Los Angeles Lakers started the playoffs 11-0. They only lost one game, to the Philadelphia 76ers, and the signature moment was Allen Iverson stepping over TyRann Lue.
In the 2017 NBA playoffs, the Golden State Warriors started 15-0. They only lost one game, to the TyRann Lue coached Cavaliers, and Kyrie Irving was a player on that team.</p>

<p>11/15 is B.o.B., Shadow the Hedgehog, and those NBA records.</p>

<p>11 x 15 = 165. Donald Trump was born on the 165th day of the year, June 14</p>

<p>Now I know what some of you are going to say. &quot;Kyrie Irving&#39;s birthday is March 23, 1992, you&#39;re just pointing to his draft date and ignoring his B-Day.&quot;</p>

<p>3 x 23 = 69
6 x 23 = 138</p>

<p>Donald Trump&#39;s assassins will be born on March 10, 1999, the 69th day of the year. But there will be two, so 69 x 2 = 138</p>

<p>Btw, a story about the Sun and Moon racing around Earth is called &quot;The Hare and the Tortoise&quot;, but it was actually called the &quot;Hare and the Hedgehog&quot;, Sonic and Shadow are Hedgehogs.</p>

<p>The 911 attacks were on September 11, 2001, or 9/11/01, or 91101.
The Las Vegas attacks were on October 1, 2017, Route 91 Festival on 10/1 is 91101</p>

<p>EDIT: important stuff:</p>

<p>Shadow the Hedehog has predicted a couple of things:</p>

<p>The Carson Wentz injury on December 10, 2017. Carson Wentz was injured on his 33rd TD pass. In the level Prison Island, Charmy asks shadow for a ‚Äútop secret disk‚Äù, with a misspelling of ‚Äúdisc‚Äù. Disk = 43, Disc = 35. The score of the eagles rams game was 43-35. December 10, 2017 is 12 years, 25 days after November 15, 2005. 12/25 = Christmas. It was also 4,408 days later. 44-8 = 36. 44 + 8 = 52. SB36 was Patriots-Rams and SB52 was Patriots Eagles.</p>

<p>The Level 4-2 has a boss that follows it called ‚ÄúHeavy Dog‚Äù. In Superbowl 42, the undefeated Patriots lost to the 5 seed Giants, a hevy underdog. In Level 5-1, the boss is called ‚ÄúBlue Falcon. In Superbowl 51, the patriots played the Atlanta Falcons. Now the Atlanta Falcons are Red, not Blue, but there‚Äôs a reason for that.</p>

<p>Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Red/Blue Rescue Team. In that game, you get Absol, who is Pok√©mon #359. Kevin Durant won the NBA Finals MVP as #35, Nick Foles won the Super Bowl MVP as #9. The 359th day of the year is Christmas, fyi. Nick Foles was referred to as St. Nick on the Christmas game the Eagles played against the Raiders. </p>

<p>The last two dungeons in the story mode each have two parts. Magama Cavern is 23 Floors, then Magma Cavern Pit has 3 Floors. 23 and 3 = 233, the solar eclipse was on the 233rd day. Sky Tower has 25 Floors, then Sky Tower Summit has 9 Floors. The Patriots beat the Raiders 33-8, which is the Solar Eclipse from Oregon (33rd state) to South Carolina (8th state). Also a 25 point margin of Victory. The Eagles beat the Raiders 19-10, a 9 point margin of victory. However, it is important to note the score was 13-10 (23 points overall), but the Eagles scored a TD off a Fumble recovery to make it 19-10, so you have 23 and 6 in that game, like June 23rd.</p>

<p>The Last two Bosses are Groudon and Rayquaza. Groudon is Red and Rayquaza is Green, like Christmas. Groudon = 94, Nick Foles = 94. Rayquaza = 110, Christmas = 110, and Dion Lewis is 110. Dion Lewis is important because he is #33 and his first rush in SB52 was 8 yards.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs quickly get back to the Eagles/Pats/Raiders games. 33 + 8 = 41, and 19 + 10 = 29. Nick Foles won the Super Bowl at age 29, and Brady will win the Super Bowl next year at 41. Also, the game features an Asteroid strike that needs to be stopped, and on Super Bowl 52, an asteroid flew by the Earth. The Asteroid Apophis comes by the earth on April 13, 2029 and potentially again on April 13, 2036. April 13th = 4-13, 4 x 13 = 52.</p>

<p>Flat = 39, Earth = 52. The Eagles and Patriots played Each other in Super Bowls 39 and 52. Flat Earth = 91 Asteroid = 91, The Las Vegas attacks were at Route 91 on October 1st, meaning there are 91 days left in the year. Flat earth Conspiracy = F.E.C. = 653. Michael Jordan is 6-0 in the Finals and Tom Brady is currently 5-3. Michael Jordan‚Äôs game 6 vs the Utah Jazz to win his 6th ring was on June 14, 1998, Trump‚Äôs 52nd birthday.</p>

<p>The Last two Bosses are Groudon and Rayquaza. Groudon is Red and Rayquaza is Green, like Christmas. Groudon = 94, Nick Foles = 94. Rayquaza = 110, Christmas = 110, and Dion Lewis is 110. Dion Lewis is important because he is #33 and his first rush in SB52 was 8 yards.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs quickly get back to the Eagles/Pats/Raiders games. 33 + 8 = 41, and 19 + 10 = 29. Nick Foles won the Super Bowl at age 29, and Brady will win the Super Bowl next year at 41.

    <div class="md"><p>I may have to wait to express my opinion until after next year&#39;s superbowl. If you wish to give me something more in the immediate future, perhaps we can push that up a bit. Obviously, I&#39;m not aware of a lot of what you said, so it would take me some time to acquire the information. But if I believed what you posted at fault e value. I&#39;d say it&#39;s jnteresting, but it jumps around so much that it&#39;s hard to find the actual correlation because what the fuck does shadow the hedgehog and poker on have to do with other non video game events?  </p>
