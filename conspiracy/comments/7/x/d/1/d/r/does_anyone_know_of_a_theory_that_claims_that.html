<p>I&#39;d be sceptical of any such alternative timelines. They tend to be based on political or otherwise human-historical timekeeping (e.g. those Russian monarchs). I imagine most would fall apart if you used something more concrete and objective like eclipses or comet appearances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve actually read Fomenko&#39;s book. And he <em>does</em> make valid points.</p>

<p>We really <em>are</em> a bit trusting when it comes to the original chronology  of the world when we consider the fact that neither scientists nor historians created the chronology--barely literate priests did. And priests who statistically lived and died within five miles of their home village.</p>

<p>It&#39;s stunning to me that (in the modern era) if I said, &quot;Trust it. A priest told me so,&quot; I&#39;d get laughed out of the room by educated secular humanists.</p>

<p>Yet (oddly) a sort of cognitive dissonance kicks in when tradition shapes our prejudices and we don&#39;t root back to the original founding narrative and hold it up to scrutiny.</p>

<p>Remember: Fomenko wasn&#39;t the first one noticing grossly inaccurate dating As far back as Sir Isaac Newton, people were using math to prove that the astronomical events described <em>couldn&#39;t</em> have happened at the dates the illiterate village priest told us. </p>

<p>Fomenko also produced carbon dating of buildings that prove they were built in 1300 AD (as an example). Yet we&#39;re TOLD [by tradition] that they were built in 56 BC. So we throw out the carbon dating and go with the tradition. (That doesn&#39;t sound scientific to me.) Yet he documents this being done over and over and over again. As well as showing that buildings from 56 BC were identical to those from the early Renaissance. So architectural innovation just . . .  stopped? Changing styles and fads just ceased?</p>

<p>And then resumed again once modern history started?</p>

<p>That&#39;s why we call them the &quot;Dark Ages,&quot; because all of history suddenly stops for this period (and <em>only</em> this period). </p>

<p>Yet if you remove the priest-created Middle Ages, suddenly history makes sense and the flow of science and innovation resume a coherent pattern.</p>

<p>The Dark Ages should be called &quot;The Big Anomaly,&quot; where all history and innovation stopped mysteriously. </p>

<p>And it wasn&#39;t just architecture that paused. You have people in 56 BC with names like Plutarch, and people in 1400 AD with names like Petrarch. (In other words, they were still Romanizing their names, as if the Empire had never fallen.) Does no one find it strange that Roman-sounding names were used by Dutchman [like Erasmus] or Poles [like Copernicus]?</p>

<p>Everything was still as Romanized as it had been at the end of the Roman empire.</p>

<p>Once again--as if the Middle Ages never actually existed. </p>

<p>Chronology is like an accordion. Collapse it and put the two ends back together and you get a coherent flow. Break open the accordion, expand it, and you suddenly get a disjointed narrative.</p>

<p>Of course, the book adduces a lot of astronomical and mathematical evidence for a grossly flawed timeline . . . but one that we&#39;re married to now more our of tradition than logic.</p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: I&#39;ve written articles on the Phoenicians for publications, and historians have always been struck about how they were so perfectly wiped from the pages of history. Not a single Phoenician book exists. We have books from ancient Sumeria, thousands of years earlier. But not a single chapter from the Phoenicians (who were said to have all these great libraries). They just vanished, with little evidence that they ever existed at all. According to Fomenko, the priests would often copy the same event two or three times in their chronologies, describing the same events (but attributing them to different sources). And it WAS fascinating to see that the Phoenicians and Venetians were both maritime powers, and had almost exactly the same colonies. We have tons of documentary evidence for the Venetians, but nothing forensically conclusive about the Phoenicians. Could the village priests have been writing about Venetians and backdating them a millennium? (It&#39;s an interesting theory.)<br/></li>

    <div class="md"><p>To add to this I&#39;m currently in a history course at a major US public university which is covering the history of Great Britain during the Middle Ages. Practically all of the source material is from one priest named Bede which everyone cites.</p>

<p>We haven&#39;t examined any primary sources but all of the secondary sources cite Bede. Every book we are reading in class speaks to how much we owe to Bede. It&#39;s all very suspicious. </p>

<p>Also, I just read tonight, that Bede&#39;s records are the only reliable source of information about Great Britain in the 7th century. Apparently there isn&#39;t anything written or catalogued about Great Britain again until the 12th century, yet another mysterious gap in the records perhaps?</p>

<p>Council of Nicaea</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a world where the masses can&#39;t read and aren&#39;t even aware of what the year is, in a world where all of the intellectuals are priest who are completely controlled by a small group of people, changing the year would be simple. There would be people who would be confused by it, businessmen or whatever, but within a couple of generations any complaints by them about history or date changing would be gone.</p>

<p>All of history is really just people citing writing by ancient people, who were themselves citing the same thing, in a huge chain. We have absolutely no idea what&#39;s true. Hundreds of years summed up in a paper by a random person who himself was basing what was true on something he read.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a huge opportunity for someone who wants power. Change the entire framework by which people view the world and you fundamentally own and control them. We likely will never know exactly what happened, unless the rich who&#39;ve bought up all important historical documents decide to show everyone (unlikely), or unless other methods of finding what happened in the past are discovered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the phantom time hypothesis. Whenever I find someone really into it they always get into the &quot;What&#39;s the oldest book you&#39;ve ever seen&quot; ... and I talk about my time studying illuminated manuscripts and how many Universities and Libraries have rare book rooms with very old books. In addition, there are plenty of metal/stone/clay writings much older. Then they basically call bullshit that anyone has ever held in their hands anything older than a post-WW2 paperback.</p>

<p>I view it fairly similarly to the way I view flat earth, except I know flat earth was literally started as an intellectual exercise about false evidence.</p>

<p>I bought a book years ago about dentistry written about 1840. Is absolutely amazing to read through. I&#39;ll have to dig around and find it again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Studying illuminated manuscripts, I&#39;ve seen ~12th century.</p>

<p>Primarily I was studying ancient Mesopotamia, so the clay tablets I&#39;ve seen are much much older.</p>

<p>Most Universities and larger Museums and Libraries will have these things. You might need specific credentials, and you probably need to know how to handle them, but they are open to the public for research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Chinese have had their entire recorded history destroyed several times over the course of their known history. I&#39;d have to track the references down specifically but I remember once they had to find a monk up in the mountains who, from memory, recited everything he could remember from history after one such destruction of records. Shit, after the cultural revolution not a century ago the only historical records that weren&#39;t destroyed were ones that had been moved to Taiwan. Chinese history is probably the least reliable out of all the major regions on the planet. </p>

<p>It&#39;s interesting that you mention Charlemagne though because when I&#39;ve seen others talk about missing time (<em>or whatever you&#39;d like to call it</em>) I&#39;ve seen a lot of people claim Charlemagne never existed at all. </p>
