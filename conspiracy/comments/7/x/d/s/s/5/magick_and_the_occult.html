        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is an updated version of a post I have submitted before. Instead of just links and descriptions, which I will also post an updated version of, I want to share some thoughts on things I have come across as well. Magick and the Occult are intimately connected to conspiracy theory, and it is my belief that this is the driving force behind the Elites and the child abuse they practice, among so many other things. </p>

<p><strong>Magick</strong></p>

<p>Magick is the manifestation of ones Will into Reality. Crowley was the first in modern times to denote Magic(k) from Magic, so as to differentiate between stage tricks and the actual practice of imposing ones Will into Reality. This post is <em>not</em> a defense of Crowley, but in talking about the modern Occult his presence, in part, is inescapable. </p>

<p>With this definition of Magick, it becomes possible to interpret many different things as magickal acts, things most would consider somewhat mundane. A song, a book, a poem- a movie. All of these things are magick, because all of them are conscious acts to manipulate reality. How do they do this? Any one of these things can create thoughts, emotions, and therefore actions in the minds of others that may otherwise never have been. </p>

<p>Those who understand these principles and effectively deploy them are thus able to control a large amount of people- most of the underlying “reinforcement” of society, and its norms, are magickal acts, intended to sway the masses with their messages- both overt and subliminal. </p>

<p>Because of this, intent is an important aspect of any magickal act, which for the sake of this post qualifies as any of the examples listed above, or again as any Willful intent to alter Reality. The reasons behind a song being made, a book being written, or a movie being produced, are utterly important not only to their meanings but also to their reception by the audience. Intent determines subconscious elements of these creations that even the authors don’t understand they are placing within, elements of the subconscious that slip past the conscious mind in the act of creation.</p>

<p>The subconscious is an integral part of any magickal act. Conscious intent evokes subconscious results- and one can even view an evoked element of the subconscious as a spirit, or even a demon. </p>

<p><strong>Memetic Magick</strong></p>

<p>Memetic Magick- this is a loaded term by today’s internet standards, but it denotes something that is very real. In essence, memetic magick is the use of symbolism, either as a sigil, book, poem, or any other conscious creation, that serves to channel the intended message into the minds of another. The term Meme was coined by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, but it has since gained far broader significance. In essence, a meme is the smallest transmissible unit of culture. </p>

<p>Your entire conscious being, your entire life, is determined by the dominant cultural memes you are raised within. This determines your actions as well as your thoughts- what is and is not perceived as impossible.  The entire human mind is comprised of highly complex memetic structures built on top of each other.</p>

<p>What this means is that, as many of you know, a mind is “programmable”.  Replace one set of memetic structures with another and you have changed who that person is. The brain actively fights against this, which some may experience as cognitive dissonance, but a successful memetic attack finds holes in the current dominant memetic structure of the subjects mind and pierces them, merging with the structure and, if successful, slowly changing it. This is an example of the frog in boiling water- one step at a time, people and entire societies can be altered this way without their knowledge.  More complex memetic structures, which can be considered a sort of “thought virus”, will achieve multiple goals within the targeted mind, causing cascading effects on the memetic structures within. </p>

<p>What I just described is another way to understand propaganda- psychology, evolution, and general scientific theory itself has far more overlap with the Occult than many realize. Modern science was, after all, <em>born</em> from the Occult.  An example of a memetic sigil is a corporate logo, or even a religious symbol such as the cross- a simple image that conjures within the mind a highly specific set of thoughts, emotions, and memories. All successful religions also utilize this powerful form of memetic magick. </p>

<p>Understanding this definition of magick is essential to understanding the mass programming the Elites have been practicing for millennia. It gives a theory of mind which can be worked forward from, and a framework for how ideas are transferred and fought against from person to person and culture to culture. Not everyone will agree with what I have written but I hope that you at least take some time to consider it and to read some of the links.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, nice, the problem is that an author/artist cannot always, or even usually, control the reality of his work post-completion, its realized effect upon the greater reality, or, indeed, even upon himself. The fallacy of the effectiveness of authorial intent is old one, to be sure, but psychoanalysis, Wittgenstein&#39;s philosophy of logic, contemporary empirical psychology/psychiatry, and, ultimately, Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle, all convincingly suggest that uncertainty rules the roost of human action and thought and that intentionality itself is but a quite literally retarded afterthought to human cognition and psychological motivation. What we reflectively understand about ourselves and about the world is and will always be but the poorest of reflections of the knowledge the world holds about us, our motivations, our limits, our total possibilities, fullest capacities, and final destinies. The world is the original internet, the internet in its greatest omnipresent, omniscient Big Brother-intent fully invisibly, and indivisibly, realized. There is no escaping the world&#39;s knowledge of ourselves, of all ourselves, of all our individually and dimensionally separate selves respectively as well. Before the world, the invisible and indivisible, omniscient and omnipresent reality of it, human intentionality is but an illusion behind yet another and yet another ad infinitum perspectival. Humility is rather in order then; yes the concept of human intentional will and the implementation of that will as intentional power is important, essentially so, but behind all intentional willing lies the unseen factority and totality of the world itself, which is inescapable, unknowable, uncontrollable, and undefiable, whatever outcome arises out of the application of &#39;free will&#39; and &#39;free power&#39; is actually neither free, nor will, nor power, but rather different manifestations of human powerlessness, unwillingness, dependency, and attachment/enchainment. The magician is himself but the wand of the greater sorcerer behind him ad infinitum ad perpetuum. When you become the World then you will be free, before then you are but a mote of dust alighting then lifted then alighting again, but always on the opaquest currents of genetic and sensorial sufferance, on the self-lit fire of human vulnerability and necessity, &quot;outside&quot; of which the closest man has come to escape is the addiction of plutocratic differentiation and dominion over the rest of humanity. </p>

<p>Conscious thought is only necessary to begin the process. The true power of memetic magick is the subconscious elements evoked in the process, in my opinion. Intent just starts the process off...and helps to determine what unexpected elements of the subconscious might come out within the work.</p>

<p>I agree. A term Packwood discusses in his book I linked but which I did not go into in this post describes this concept well- the Root Social Matrix. It contains everything that is and isn&#39;t, all possibilities and impossibilities in varying degrees based on human actions. It is at once an ephemeral and a very real place. But I believe that with enough understanding of just a part of the RSM one can facilitate concrete change within their Reality, unpredictable as such attempts may be. </p>

Language is so powerful because what a language is able to express is what our minds are able to express...words and concepts in a language are essential to understanding, and without proper words for certain concepts, the mind will never even consider them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is Will manifested into Reality. I gave several examples in the post- a song, for instance, can be magickal. It can create thoughts and opinions in millions of People, producing real change in the fabric of Reality. The intent behind the song helps to determine the subconscious elements imbued within it, elements people may consciously or subconsciously pick up on. That&#39;s why these creations are so powerful.</p>

<p>Crowley is important just because of how much the modern Occult is influenced by him. You can&#39;t escape that influence when doing the research on it- and these groups haven&#39;t escaped his influence because they have been so captivated by it.</p>

<p>All the abused children in incidents like the Franklin Scandal, the McMartin preschool trial, and more always involve testimony about the Occult nature. It is used both as a ritual and as a turn off to outsiders looking in. </p>

<p>In Dzogchen&#39;s central practice, called Thogal, you squint at a refraction of sunlight for a period of time everyday for a couple of decades.</p>

<p>With your physical eyes, you see the &quot;floaters&quot; in the sunlight evolve into classic seated Buddhas over the course of years.</p>

<p>You see the heads of the Buddhas develop first, followed by the bodies. This further evolves into yab-yum imagery.</p>

<p>This leads to rainbow body. A body made of light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This stupid bullshit is especially ironic because the Why of gravity far from being “just because,” in fact, has been worked out. In 1915 by a dude named Albert Einstein in his general theory of relativity as the curvature of spacetime, and was confirmed in 1919 by eddington during a solar eclipse. Compared to your cultish, simplistic, and insanely idiotic “denser objects fall to earth.” Why do denser objects fall to earth? By what mechanism? Oh. Right. “Just because.” Seriously mind boggling, guys. You being too lazy or too stupid to investigate and understand a phenomenon does not make it a conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the risk of you actually being willing to hear me out, I’d be glad to explain further. Obviously, though, if you aren’t willing to consider that the sun, earth, or other celestial bodies even exist, then it’s quite easy to just plug your ears and eyes and scream “fake.” Even if that is true, I am more than willing to waste my time if there is any non-zero chance of getting through to you or anyone, and sparking a productive discussion, as I see scores of people who seem to be extremely intellectually curious and smart wasting their god given talent on a bunch of nonsense, when there exists an actual whole world of subtle and beautiful knowledge that is powerful beyond imagination. It is a knowledge that is esoteric, arcane, and at times inaccessible. Its incredible power has been used to build all of the most powerful organizations in the history of mankind, Google, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, the NSA, CIA, the FED etc etc etc. What is this magickal force, whose high priests and practitioners are at the very heart of all these shadowy organizations? It’s math. And it’s the same thing that makes Einstein’s (and all other truly great scientific discoveries) so compelling. So, while I haven’t personally performed Aurthor Eddington’s eclipse experiment, I have seen, studied, and performed his math. Math that, standing on the shoulders of Reimann, made real a new non-Euclidean geometry, the geometry of spacetime itself. So powerful and far-reaching was this discovery that it not only explained how gravity works, but just what it is in the first place. It postulated that mass and energy bend the very fabric of spacetime and that an object, like say the earth, travels in a straight line, but the path itself is warped by the mass of the sun. Sounds like science fiction, you say? I don’t disagree, but alas, the truth is often stranger than fiction. Many contemporaries thought the same thing, and after realizing that his insanely precise math dared to quantify the exact amount of “warping” an object with the mass of the sun would have on, say the starlight of a distance star, they realized with that according to his insane math, if the sun’s bright light could be blocked for a minute, it should be possible to actually observe stars whose true position is exactly behind the sun when looking at it from the earth, and they very much looked forward to proving him wrong during an upcoming total eclipse in 1919. To everyone’s astonishment, the stars that according to newton shouldn’t be able to be seen, as they reside behind the sun, sure enough showed up on the photographic plates, exactly where Einstein said they should be. 
        I seriously doubt this will convince you or anything, that is not really my hope, but my point is that I don’t trust Einstein the man, or my professors, or people, but I trust the math, and I have followed it and it’s logic step-by-step and compared and seen the results of this and many other experiments. His math also made other crazy predictions. It said, for example, that these things called black holes can exist and are possible and that in fact if we search hard enough we should be able to find them. Of course, we did. Though I will definitely agree about those sounding science fiction-y, haha. My real hope is just to extol the beauty and magic(k) of math. 
       Also, if denser objects fall to earth then why, when you drop two bowling balls that are the same size, but one weighing 10 kg and one weighing 2 kg do they hit the ground at the same time? Also, if the earth were truly flat, and I took a powerful telescope up to the roof of a tall building, why on earth can’t I see the top of mt Everest? If the earth is flat, then surely, the mountain and I would be in the same flat plane and the only thing hindering me from being able to see it Is pure distance, right. Telescope should solve that problem, no? I suppose mountains are fake and part of the cover up? Anyway, sorry for the book, these posts have just been bothering me lately. If anyone actually read this whole thing, I appreciated it, haha have a good weekend. </p>

<p>He things gravity does not exist, nor do planets, the sun, space, atoms, dinosaurs, missiles, nukes, a round earth, evolution, all of history etc.</p>

<p>Most of it is because he does not understand basic science or history. And he has decided that since he is really clever, if he is ignorant of something or does not understand it must be fake.</p>

<p>Since he can’t undrstand basic Newtonian physics I doubt he can tackle relativity theory... so he won’t understand experimental confirmation of relativity theory so I wouldn’t waste your time arguing with him.</p>

<p>He won&#39;t tell you anything he actually believes in... probably because he wants to sell you a subscription to his $20+/mo website or send you to his YouTube channel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad you mentioned John Dee(007). Michael Tsarion has a wild story about the purpose of John Dee&#39;s channelling/summoning. </p>

<p>The story says that the earth has an ethereal force field (for lack of a better term) around it that was put there by one alien race to keep another alien race from leaving. I believe it&#39;s somehow DNA based where certain beings can come and go freely.</p>

<p>Dee summoned an entity to learn how to break through the barrier. He was told it would be a multi stage process of creating energy from matter, which is why the nuclear bomb was created, then creating matter from energy. Once the second phase is complete the technology used would break through the barrier. I always wondered why they nuked the sky and used  HAARP to destroy the ionosphere. </p>

<p>In exchange for this information the entity wanted human blood to be spilled and Dee had agreed to the deal. Tsarion want on to explain that this is why military uniforms around the world wear the same symbols and why wars are declared at certain specific times. It&#39;s all ritual sacrifice to hold up that part of the deal.</p>

<p>Pretty wild story. <a href="https://youtu.be/MXA2PAK6_sU">Here&#39;s</a> the link to the story. It&#39;s almost 2 hours long.</p>

<p>Because if you read my post carefully you would see how it intersects with a lot of modern science and psychology. Science was born out of the Occult...Chemistry from Alchemy, hell Newton wrote more about Alchemy than he did about Calculus, but I digress.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to focus on because this is how the Elites operate. This is how they think., and this is the driving force behind their actions and especially the abuse. </p>

<p>My definition of Magick as outlined above fits right along with the Empirical world view- it&#39;s really about minds, Will, and manifesting ones Will into reality. You don&#39;t need to think about Magick in a spiritual sense...in my post I even indicate how one can consider a spirit or a demon a manifestation of ones subconscious...actions brought about by a person from their deeper mind. Everything I wrote about is grounded in Reality, none of it requires anything other than what exists and the Will to change it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not at all what my post was about, and that&#39;s now how real practitioners of modern magick think about things. Read through it again, read through the links, with an open mind. You will see that there is nothing inherently spiritual about it. It is about concrete Reality and enacting ones Will within it. Magick has a far broader definition than the one you currently have. </p>

<p>Medeival alchemists drew inspiration and knowledge from Khemet (Egypt), both of which which gave us the name Chemistry. So yes, ancient knowledge has direct roots in our modern conception and application of the sciences. It&#39;s not absurd or ironic, it is a progression that has happened over a very long time.

    <div class="md"><p>Fantastic write up. I&#39;m more inclined to agree in the power of magick than in nihilistic randomness (or whatever its inverse may be). I also wish every conspiracy theorist recognized its value, because much to this community&#39;s detriment, we are far too content to sit around and believe that &quot;they&quot; are all-knowing, all-seeing, and all-powerful. That we are doomed, either by Agenda 21, getting chipped, having our arms and privacy eroded, etc. Almost every conspiracy invokes that helplessness and does quite a number in giving even <em>more</em> power to the elite. </p>

<p>Magick helps reclaim one&#39;s innate sovereignty. Every individual is far more powerful than s/he knows, and it really does originate with disciplined control of the mind as a way to manifest heaven on earth. It&#39;s a power we all possess. I also like magick for its ability to highlight creation rather than consumption. One is active; other passive. We need to be far, far more active. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Manipulating Reality means bringing about change to your Universe. By creating something, such as a song for example, when others listen you can evoke feelings and thoughts within them that otherwise would never have been. This causes a butterfly effect which ripples outward from them and <em>does</em> change reality, because without that song things would be different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I saw that in your text and I get what you are saying.  Respectfully, I disagree.  Songs conjure memories of one’s own feelings when they are good, similar, but never exactly the same as those of the writer.</p>

<p>But, along those lines and more profound (even if obvious) is that your actual thoughts affect the world around you.  (I love telling this to people who think I am about to get spiritual btw).  Can we make an image by measuring electrical activity in the brain?  Yes, thus the electrical pulses in our brain exerts a reaction in the outside world by the laws of physics.  Like I said, obvious, but given the butterfly effect, interesting to ponder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By my own definition? Yes it could be considered magick. Though I wrote this post for the same reason I write all my other self-posts, because I felt like I said something to say. But if this post creates thoughts in others minds that changes their mental path from a course it would otherwise have taken without this post, then it could indeed be considered a form of magick. </p>

<p>Even more interesting when considering that when I typed this up, I hadn&#39;t even considered it like that, and as I highlight in the post, the conscious act triggers the subconscious elements, which are the real drivers. Interesting indeed...thank you for posing that question. </p>

<p>Mecca, The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, Nazi Swastika, Nike Swoosh, every cult leader&#39;s logo or emblem, Christian Cross, Star of David, Crescent Moon and Star, Hammer and Sickle, virtually every brand out there in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ritual magic is different from magick. Crowley added the &quot;k&quot; for his own system when he left the Golden Dawn. Chaos magic (or magick) is a post-modernist interpretation of both of those systems, the sigil element of that system is mainly attributed to Austin Osman Spare. Those three systems, classical western Hermetic ritual magic, Crowley&#39;s magick, and chaos magic, are loosely connected, but distinct from one another.</p>

<p>In your second parahraph you list many symbols, these have a certain undeniable level of influence on the subconscious, but come from vastly divergent sources; you can&#39;t really lump them all into a single esoteric system without considering the context of their origin and intent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey OP. You may be interested in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hbp23/staged_alien_invasion_date_revealed_the_next/c1u5cf0/">this 6 year old post,</a> and also some of the posts linked from within it, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/g5w86/revealed_us_spy_operation_that_manipulates_social/c1l53bj/?context=1">like this one for example.</a> The general idea is that we&#39;re being shown evidence of the corrupt system on purpose so that we will awaken to an understanding of the magic and manipulation tactics that are being used against us, with the ultimate outcome being that this knowledge of magic and this awakened state will reveal data and inform a worldview to us that appears to confirm that Lucifer is actually God. I know it sounds bugged out but with your understanding of magick and the occult you will probably appreciate it a lot. These posts are old, they precede a lot of the things that are happening and a lot of the subjects that are commonplace now, but they have predictive power, you can tell when you read them that they&#39;re talking about things that have since come to pass. They were written with the goal of not helping anyone understand the occult any more, since this understanding apparently leads directly to the outcome. But you can tell, there&#39;s definitely something there. Worth reading for sure</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For everyone interested in the occult, you should read:
&quot;The secret Teachings of all Ages&quot; by Manly P Hall. 
And you should give Crowley&#39;s &quot;Book of Thoth&quot; a read. It should be easily obtainable via Google as pdf.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have looked into sigils and I really do think there is some power to them. I started out with magic squares, similar to sodoku where all the lines add up to same number, and when you connect the numbers in lines they make a symbol. They have various squares for the different planets, which are symbols found all over hermeticism, alchemy, or masonic imagery. </p>

<p>After making one of these squares and the sigil, I forgot about it and was browsing internet when I noticed a funny smell and felt very hot... got freaked out and left my room and it went away. I thought the sigil might have been why so I scratched it out and tore up the paper and the feeling went away. It was super weird... the link between numbers and images made me think it could prob be used in electornic media like tv or computers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The dark powers don&#39;t want you to study this stuff because it is related to initiation mystery schools and that is the stuff that they use against us in a black magic way. </p>

<p>I highly recommend, if you are interested in the so called &quot;occult&quot;, to read and study Anthroposophy and the works of Rudolf Steiner. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.rsarchive.org/Lectures/">http://www.rsarchive.org/Lectures/</a></p>

<p>I have read lots of books on magick and found Steiner&#39;s stuff to be legit. Crowley practiced black magick and you do not want to dabble with it Steiner&#39;s &quot;indications&quot; are certainly &quot;white magic&quot; and imostly up to date. Eastern stuff is old and out of date (Tibetan, Indian, Hindu etc.) meaning it&#39;s weak. </p>

<p>Steiner updated the occult info with his own investigations and the short and thick of it is that we have to develop ourselves morally and ethically before we can even begin to &quot;practice magic&quot;. So most people disregard his work and move on to easier and more &quot;direct&quot; books on magick instead of doing the necessary work that we need to do as human beings so that our development will serve the forces of light and not be harnessed by the forces of darkness.</p>
