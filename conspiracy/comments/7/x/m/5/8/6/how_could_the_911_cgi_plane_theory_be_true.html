<p>Yeah, you&#39;re missing quite a bit. They wouldn&#39;t have to pay off everyone. Just control the source of the video(s), and plant &quot;witnesses&quot;, <a href="https://youtu.be/07hJhmiWZSY?t=59">like this guy</a>. Once it gets into the mind of people that a plane hit, they need not to have actually seen it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure you get the no planes theory. They&#39;re not saying it was a holographic blue-beam-esque scenario, they&#39;re saying that all of the MSM outlets showed CGI footage of a fake plane hitting the towers. What do you mean CGI was not good enough in 2001? What year did Star Wars come out?</p>

<p>Not saying I subscribe to this particular theory, but to sum it up, they&#39;re saying that there was no plane IRL, only on TV, everyone else was a paid actor to say that they saw a plane.</p>

<p>Of course you have Youtube videos of the plane hitting the towers so that&#39;s where the theory starts to fall apart, along with the other reasons you mentioned. </p>

<p>Funny that this is obvious fakery yet right on the Pentagon thread people say the circular hole is too small; where are the wings?</p>

<p>People also retort &quot;were you there? I <em>live</em> in NY&quot;... Well the vast bulk of people who live in NY saw it on tv only. And the smoke. That&#39;s it </p>

<p>I think the twin towers collapses are more telling than the odd looking plane footage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, we are all dumber having read about it.  This kind of stuff is why most conspiracy theorists aren&#39;t taken seriously.  I can&#39;t believe that anyone truly believes that the planes didn&#39;t exist.  There are literally tens of thousands of first hand eyewitnesses, and millions of people who saw it live on TV.  There were thousands of pieces of debris.  If you claim that the most famous and photographed terrorist attack on Earth was not actually carried out by planes then you instantly lose all credibility.  What would it take to convince you?  What about the actual conspiracies out there that deserve to be questioned and investigated?  This is either a trolling attempt or OP is a paranoid schizo.  </p>
