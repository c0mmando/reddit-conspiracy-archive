    <div class="md"><p>Honest question as someone who was involved in looking into Elsagate way back when it first came around the Chans and the extend of related content was being discovered daily:  do you think that you would have the same extreme reaction to the video alone without context?  Like if you weren’t involved in conspiracies at all, never really heard much of MKULTRA and didn’t go into it knowing it was linked to some weird and possibly sexual deviancy involving kids?</p>

<p>I ask because from the first few videos I watched they definitely made me say wtf, but it was more about the sexual thumbnails and insane amount of nearly identical content with strange comments.  The videos just seemed random and odd, almost as if the video itself wasn’t even the point, rather just to put something on YouTube to lead to networks or create a place for the comments.  Sort of like how bad affiliate marketing pages have nearly unintelligible jumbles of text about random subjects because the point isn’t the content but to get google results and ad clicks.</p>

<p>Now the waters have been muddied a lot by channers or shills (my money is on channers) adding in “coded” messages to ARG stuff I the content and late comers thinking they are finding something.  (If the comment is newer than 2 years and has any sort of comprehensible code, it is ARG stuff, not the actual coded communication.)</p>

<p>Btw:  the <em>real</em> coded communication went like this:</p>

<p>Video about some subject</p>

<p>First commenter in chain says something like “I love bloop!  Good vid!” (With smily emoticons)
Then a chain of replies with “bloops to [original commenter]” and each one following that to the one they reply to.  These are the accounts that upon investigation seem like humans not bots by their activity.  The boys usually posted garbled numbers and letters and only had one or two replies to each other.</p>

<p>This method I termed “call and retort”</p>

<p><strong>Here is the important part</strong>
When I was about 13 and had AOL around 96ish my friend and I discovered AOL chat room “lists”.  To those younger or those who never heard of this, you would go to chat rooms (usually the rpg ones, sometimes the singles ones) and wait for someone to make a “call out” to which many people would reply <em>”list me”</em>.  (I never did figure out what the call out was, we wold just hunt around chat rooms until we saw people saying “list me”.). What happened was that everyone who said “list me” would be put into an email list and someone would then send you porn.  It was <strong>very often</strong> kiddie porn.  Being that we were about 13, it seemed cool and we just assumed that it really was people our age sending naked pics of themselves.  It sucked because we didn’t know all the codes and sometimes ended up on lists of gay child porn, like two 8-14 year old boys going down on each other and shit.  It was only a passing interest for me because I soon found the blossoming free porn sites (anyone remember ALSscans? So many afternoons rushing home from school for that 30 minutes before my brother got home) and to me adult, fully developed women were <em>far</em> more intriguing to see naked than girls my own age.  </p>

<p>(An extra tidbit, my friend that showed me this became really weird by high school, he used to be one of the kids that was really popular and good at every little league sport to the point that I was “cool” for being friends with him, by high school he was a weirdo loner and a <em>furry</em> who covered his room in printed pictures of anime wolfs and starfox themed porno drawings.  Furry wasn’t to my knowledge even a term back then, it was later that I was like “holy shit that’s what he was!”  He also got sent to boot camp for doing some sort of sexual thing like exposing himself or trying show each other’s junk or something with a middle schooler when he was in high school at the YMCA bathroom... I don’t think he ever lost interest in that shit.)</p>

<p>Anyway, <em>that</em> is what I think the videos were about and why I think that it operated that way.  I think the childish call and retort setup was either for those “in the know” to exchange illegal media or to try and see if any children responded there (due to silly words and a bunch of smiley and heart emojis) and then try to coach them into getting naked on webcam.  I don’t really think the videos have any subliminal messages, but who knows?  I never had any reaction to them other than finding them bizarre and eventually not bothering to watch them and thinking they were a waste of time, and finding the real action by tracking people through comment chains.  I wish I had thought ahead to document it as I did it because <strong>several times after long tracks through a bunch of these kinds of comment threads and checking people’s uploads, I would find short clips of children being covertly filmed on busses or trains or in public streets, but in a way that seemed like they were being offered either for sale or to be kidnapped.  It looked like mostly Eastern Europe but I am not any expert, definitely not the USA.  The kids would almost always be with a single woman alone but in public.  I don’t know whether the parent was unaware or possibly offering the kid and acting unaware for plausible deniability.  I would copy and paste the urls into a spreadsheet but the videos would be gone within 30 minutes and I would only manage to get to one of these videos when I managed to find a “call and retort” thread active within the last 5-10 minutes</strong></p>

<p>Finally, I just stopped delving into it because it seemed like digging a hole in dry sand, there were so many videos and comments and links     and weirdness and all of seemed important but just indecipherable.  Some of the accounts posted videos that were sales videos of industrial equipment in Russia or somewhere similar, maybe they were using their personal accounts?  The whole thing was just too big and most of the investigators were too obsessed with picking apart the videos for symbolism that I was always ignored or lost in the noise when I tried to show people this stuff and get more of them onto it.  I made an account as tried to join a few “call and retort” threads. Twice I got messages with links to shady loving urls, but didn’t click through more because it looked like malware ones, and the possibility that it would be to some legit child porn that would get me in trouble.  I saved the email addresses but they would be invalid after a day or so.  (I sent one a message pretending to be an contractor with a child porn investigation team of Interpol but didn’t get any response or reaction).  Maybe those kind of comment threads are still there?  Dunno.  If any of you guys is still into investigating these and are interested in <em>this</em> aspect, feel free to ask me any questions about what I looked for to find these if the above isn’t detailed enough, I would love it if someone felt like digging into it.</p>

<p>Well, here&#39;s the thing: I&#39;ve seen a handful of videos talking about ElsaGate that showed example clips, and I never once freaked out. I was bothered but stayed calm. In the video I linked, the video author had a still image of the first clip (baby w/ spiderman heads) while he was talking about it, and I was fine, just expecting more weirdness. Once the animation started is when I suddenly started screaming.</p>

<p>The 2nd example clip he used, apparently was a video released by some band as a marketing campaign for their album, and blatantly used mk ultra as a video tag. There are many possibilities here; the video could&#39;ve been legit and intentionally harmful and released as &quot;promotional material&quot; as a guise to muddy the waters, it could&#39;ve been made by an art student by day/conspiracy nerd by night ;) who just wanted to make something creepy and troll a lot people. It&#39;s possible the 2nd clip alone wouldn&#39;t have triggered an extreme reaction for me, and that I was just still shaken up from the 1st clip.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t shake the feeling that there is something sinister about these ElsaGate videos. I very much believe they serve <em>multiple</em> purposes, and providing a network for pedos is just one of them.</p>

<p>This guy talks about how he looked into some of the profiles of people commenting on these videos, and how they&#39;d often have playlists of softcore child porn. It seems in line with what you&#39;re saying.

<p>That&#39;s fascinating. It&#39;s interesting how people find ways to do illegal stuff in &quot;public&quot; and keep it obscure.</p>

<p>Wow scary. If you have the time that would be worthwhile to document, especially if you can include screenshots and video clips. If you got it organized into a YouTube video maybe it could be a way to bring awareness and protect people (but then again maybe they&#39;d just adapt their techniques).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the interest.  I can’t explain reactions to the videos, that is sort of too personal to necessarily compare; different people have wildly different reactions to things.  Maybe some are more susceptible?  I can watch horror gore movies or even liveleaks and <em>very rarely</em> get any reaction (the Dubrovoskiesk or whatever Maniacs video I couldn’t watch, however) so maybe my reactions are more muted than some.</p>

<p>Also, if you are talking about that “Magestic Ape” band video, I am 99% certain that is more the hipster/artist trying to get a reaction by using stuff the creator <em>knows</em> looks like MKU stuff.  Despite their “ties” to pizzagate, as someone who spent a bit of my college time in the hipster underground music scene, that band is super generic and uses “shock value” stuff to make up for crappy music (like most of the bands in that scene).</p>

<p>As for the research and documentation, I wish I had the time to download all the stuff to film the screen and shit, but I did that in spare time out of interest.  I am not computer illiterate but mostly social media illiterate, I don’t know how to upload to YouTube or download videos (though I have no doubt I could easily learn).  Like I said it was so vast that I just sort of gave up other than trying to point people who took interest and had the time/skills to do it better than me in the direction.</p>

<p>The videos are messed up, and I am not saying there isn’t something to them (but there are also plenty that are in this group that seem totally innocuous in their content, not intent).  I just hate that so many of the people who <strong>do</strong> have time and desire to really get into it are so easily mislead either by intent or accident.  </p>

<p>The videos may have brainwashing or whatever material, but I don’t think there is much to be learned by watching more of them or comparing them.  I think the <em>real</em> work is in finding more keywords and networks of these videos (toy freaks, toy_____, <strong>learn colors</strong> and such) and then attempting to document <em>not the uploaders but those who frequent the comments</em> to find the criminals. </p>

<p>I don’t know that any outside investigation of YouTube will ever get the full answers, it will require someone to actually go undercover <em>into</em> the network by learning the code words and such, and <em>that</em> is best done by law enforcement or at least someone with private investigator license, due to the nature of it and not being mistaken as one of the perverts.  And if it really is child prostitution/trafficking, the stakes are <em>real</em> and someone could end up murdered.  It isn’t a thing to do as an amateur.</p>

<p>My hope at the time, and in trying to bring awareness to the <em>real</em> part to look at is that if enough of a network is identified and some sense made of it, then maybe an investigator would be inclined to look into it.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible these videos weren&#39;t the &quot;real deal&quot; and on some level worked myself up a bit, but I&#39;m starting to wonder now if I got <em>accidentally</em> triggered, because I know for certain there&#39;s some fucked up stuff buried deep in my brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>MK Ultra isnt just watching a video that disturbs you. (Unless you have already been broken and that is your programmed trigger). First you have to be mentally and physically broken down and felt like there is no one in the world who cares about you and then your handler will be the only one who shows they care, but they would also be the one to break you. </p>

<p>Its funny how similar Iceberg Slims Pimp book about how to make and break a ho is eerily similar to MK Ultra. Check it out. Just know that you are stronger than you believe and you can break any programming with your own positive reinforcement. Stop thinking negative things. Tell yourself in the mirror 100 times a day that you are awesome and a good person. Dont fall into the programming. The world needs you, me and everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I get you now. I was thinking you meant the methods of abuse <em>hinted</em> at in the videos are different than the actual methods used. I understand MK Ultra isn&#39;t just watching videos, that it&#39;s a thorough process of destroying a person psychologically.</p>

<p>I feel like the 1st clip in the video I linked triggered memories of being tortured, but where those memories come from I have no idea. And thanks for the support. I do have some issues and went through some traumatic stuff in my teens/20s, but I&#39;ve been working through them and healing (have come a long way) and I know that I <em>will</em> eventually reach full health and wholeness. :)</p>
