I just want to say keep up the good work keep uncovering the truth its an honorable thing to do theres so many forces working against the truths coming out that its an incredibly difficult and up hill battle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It gets posted a lot because it doesn&#39;t really make much sense. In addition, there is quite a strong pushback against OP whenever it gets posted, as the threads quickly fill up with people outright dismissing the observation as inconsequential. </p>

<p>Why does a community of 16,000 people (<a href="/r/finlandconspiracy">/r/finlandconspiracy</a>) consistently get beat out by a community of 500,000 people <em>on the same website with a much more accurate name?</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I grant that perhaps the search results are different user to user for whatever reason, but when I see a thread title that says “off the front page” and I search and as usual it’s in the top three, of course I’m going to dismiss it.</p>

<p>If there was a thread that said “Trump resigned today” and that wasn’t the case, I’d do the same. (Yes I know that’s an exaggeration but the point is that the thread topic is an exaggeration.)</p>

<p>If the point of the thread is that the Finland sub shouldn’t rate above this one, make that the title rather than say it’s off the front page.</p>

<p>And just speaking for me (of course), I tire of seeing the same topic every single day with the same answers (those answers being: ummm, no, actually when I google it, this sub is one of the top links).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just want to point out the people are the ones with the true power. example what if every American in the country stopped working, stopped paying taxes, stopped serving in the police, military, ext, uh oh there goes the governments lap dogs, there goes there mighty military power. Its the people who hold the true power, there a reason that united we stand divided we fall.
