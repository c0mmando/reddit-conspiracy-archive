I live outside of America and can&#39;t really even imagine the idea of someone shooting up a school. Is it simply because guns are to easy to get? Is America so gun entrenched that it would be almost impossible to change now? I love so many things American but struggle to understand the super hardcore gun love. I&#39;m a chef and understand hunting for my food etc. In America just walking down the street I&#39;d think I would be afraid that anyone could have a gun on them? Poor kids. </p>

Our constitution leaves us a choice,  in a bad situation you can be on the news tomorrow with a positive or negative spin.  &quot; man killed in burglary gone wrong&quot; or &quot;man kills robber after breaking into his home&quot; Which do you prefer?

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry bro I&#39;m not a cop.. My trigger finger isn&#39;t that itchy. While accidents can always happen I&#39;ve put a lot of time and energy into learning proper handling of firearms under stress. </p>

<p>Competition shooting and guns in general are a favorite hobby of mine so I&#39;ve spent many years practicing. Home security is also something I take seriously. I have faith in my abilities, I don&#39;t have faith in humanity,  so I take the risks. </p>

<p>In my state a couple years back a wife and daughter were raped and murdered while the dad was unconscious on the floor. They later burned down the house and the dad survived. I wish there weren&#39;t so many evil fucking people out there but there are, so I&#39;ll stay armed. </p>

<p>If you have a problem with that fine,  don&#39;t own a gun,  but our constitution gives me the right to own one.  So bust someone else&#39;s balls with your anti gun BS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Schools are depressing institutions of social control. Nobody ever mentions that school sucks when these shootings happen in them. </p>

<p>Lack of autonomy always results in depression. When you can&#39;t even pee without permission, and you&#39;ve got years left of oppressive dayprison before you graduate to a life as a taxpaying wage slave, what incentive is there to not go on a suicidal rampage of the children and adults who make your life a living hell.</p>

<p>From DC vs. Heller</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Pp. 2–53.
(a) The Amendment’s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause’s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2–22.
(b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court’s interpretation of the operative clause. The “militia” comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. <strong>The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens’ militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule</strong>. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens’ militia would be preserved. Pp. 22–28.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems to me that you are incorrect, the purpose was not just for State administrated militias.</p>

<p>Time and time again that idea has been shown to be false, go look at modern day insurgencies in the middle east, or the Vietnam war. People with small arms can cause large militaries all kinds of problems, and that&#39;s without considering that factions inside the military can defect, or that foreign governments can help to arm rebels. </p>

<p>If you are trying to compare the might of a military to rebels on an open battlefield, sure the military will win. But that is not how modern wars are fought, modern wars are all about asymmetrical warfar. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guns are pretty easy to obtain, depending on where you live. I live in Indiana, I have purchased 4 handguns in my lifetime, 20 minute transactions each time, tops. The law in Indiana is that you can purchase a handgun, but without a concealed carry license, you can only have it for home protection. You buy it, go straight home with it unloaded in your vehicle, and the gun forever stays in your dwelling. If you have a CC license, you can carry anywhere that allows you to. Obtaining a license isn&#39;t that difficult, about $125 and you get your fingerprints taken by the police. Indiana politicians are trying to remove the license requirement, which is insanely stupid, IMO.</p>
