       It occurred to me that money is a language that conveys value and our taxes should be a donation and we should have the say of where in the government each penny goes and anything less than this is a violation of our inalienable right to free speech. And while we're on it the government's ability to borrow money should be abolished as it also does just this. This is why I'm loading up on crypto.

       Money isn't a language, the words you use convey the value. Money is simply the medium of exchange.

       We don’t vote at the polls, we vote with our dollars. While I agree some taxes should be enforced to maintain a police department, a fire department and a few other services, I think we could do away with an income tax because the USA never needed an income tax prior to 1913, but we were still seeing GDP growths of 10% a year compared to about 3% now and we were in much less debt. The idea of living in a world free from taxes is a pipe dream unless there is a violent takeover of the US government

       Both of you are letting some petty bullshit dominate the conversation. "Piles of bodies" was a colorful description, sure. That being said, if you truly believe that pre-WWI America was better for the average citizen than after a federal income tax was implemented, you're either full of shit or delusional.

       As an employer, this is just stupid. People can quit their jobs but can’t quit paying income tax. An employer can try to hire someone new until they quit and so it goes until the employer is forced to raise his rate of pay. The government doesn’t have to worry about us quitting.

       A maximum wage would be great or I guess a maximum percentage a person can personally pay themselves from profit. Idk. Seems just as overreaching as income tax but it would do society better.

       If everyone done that, there would be no public schools, no roads, no running water, no police, no fire response, no this and no that, and a tough quality of life on a lot of fronts.

       Choosing/voted where your taxes dollars went could be beneficial, though how would you know the proper results, but, if there was a sensible system in place, I could see how this would be beneficial.

       Obviously yes. A smart contract would be perfect for this and it would be transparent. I also believe police forces should have competitors and the people decide which force gets their money keeping police accountable, polite and honest

If everybody decides to stop paying taxes, there go the schools, roads, military, FDA, CDC, etc.

       Plus everything could easily be funded through other means and apparently they don't even need taxes cuz they can borrow indefinitely without ever paying off their debt. Either way I'd feel better about all of it with now transparency and say in where my money goes. I don't like when most of my money feeds the war machine.

       Local and State government budgets are well documented and often spread quite thin. This is why many states apply for federal grants and whatnot. The Federal government really doesn't have to account for what they are spending, continuously building upon the debt. While I can agree with you that tax allocation is not as transparent as far as dollar-value in service provision, the private sector alone cannot provide these social programs to those less fortunate than you and I. You can help by "gifting" your servers in cash and writing "taxation is theft" on the receipt. 
I'm ranting, but were 21 trillion dollars in debt. Like what the fuck? How is nobody even talking about this?

       I disagree that we should have never borrowed money. Critical infrastructure was built, and without borrowing, we would have no vital services. Anarchy is cute until roads, power stations and water sanitization stations fail and people are too ignorant to repair them. You actually believe that there is no validity for any reason to borrowing money in government?

       That never started out as a problem, but yeah man, the military-industrial complex is a money pit by design. Think about the popular first-person shooter games and popular movies, glorifying military combat. War is as much a part of the American landscape as apple pie and baseball. It's fucked, but our economy is reliant on perpetual military engagement. Perhaps tax allocation is the heart of your problems and with that, I can agree with. It absolutely sucks, but we have to play the game to improve it. Young people need to stay informed and engaged politically, or else the spending will remain unchecked.
