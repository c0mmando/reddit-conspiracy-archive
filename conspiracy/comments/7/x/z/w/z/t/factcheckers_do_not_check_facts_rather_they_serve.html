<p>The problem is that their two primary funders, Facebook and the Annenberg Foundation, are not unbiased in the slightest. Quite the opposite in fact. Facebook is blatantly pro-corporatism and anti-privacy. </p>

<p>The Annenberg Foundation primarily functions as legal way for billionaires to funnel donations into other NGOs and PACs anonymously. It&#39;s part of the global money laundering scheme, connected to the Panama Papers, the Clinton Foundation, USAID, ISIS, the House of Saud, MI6, etc. They are the deep state, in essence; and they are accordingly biased towards the establishment. </p>

<p>Actually the one I used as an example is the least compromised of the major three, the other two being Politifact and Snopes. Snopes election reporting and editing was done by a girl in her early 20s who studied fashion at tech school. And Politifact is basically managed by Bloomberg and his buddies. The Gold medal though probably goes to WaPo&#39;s fact checker which is run by...</p>

<p>That bothers me a little, but isn&#39;t that part of what fact checkers are for? Organizations like the NYT can go as small as citing &quot;anonymous sources&quot;, whereas something like Politifact is usually directly citing public record or direct sources for someone&#39;s claim.</p>

<p>My point still stands about the validity of these fact-checking sites. You can directly check to see what the sources say. There&#39;s a select few articles I&#39;ve seen people dispute, but even those disputes are in question. And like I said, Factcheck might be owned by Facebook, but Politifact isn&#39;t. And Politifact might be owned by Bloomberg, but Factcheck isn&#39;t. It&#39;s good to have multiple sites for that. </p>

<p>They kind of used to be that way, like more than 6 years ago, but even then there was enough bias to warrant suspicion. Not so much in the claims made, but rather the kind of bias towards which claims they chose to analyze and which they did not. I think we can agree that a one-sided report can be just as misleading as a completely fabricated one; perhaps even moreso because the one-sided reports uses elements of the truth to mask the deception. <a href="https://www.salon.com/2011/12/05/politifact_and_the_scam_of_neutral_expertise/">https://www.salon.com/2011/12/05/politifact_and_the_scam_of_neutral_expertise/</a></p>

<p>Except that we can definitively say that fact-checkers actually server no purpose because they require the one thing that actual fact-checking prohibits: taking something on faith alone. That&#39;s what you are doing when you use a fact-checking website: accepting something as true merely because someone says it is. Since that&#39;s the case, you&#39;re actually worse off than you would have been had you not gone to the fact-checking site. and instead did your own actual research. By not doing that, you are becoming a part of a potentially false or misleading echo chamber. By doing the research yourself, you could actually add something to the discussion on the other hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree there&#39;s potential bias in what&#39;s analyzed vs what isn&#39;t. There&#39;s way more political talking points in a day than what Politifact puts on its website in one day. But at the same time, I don&#39;t see what&#39;s wrong with taking a few of them and showing what&#39;s true or not, especially major points in speeches by the President, speaker, opposition leaders, etc. </p>

<p>My whole point is that you&#39;re not taking things on faith alone when using these sites. They directly cite multiple sources in their articles, which you can verify yourself by clicking the links. These sources, in the case of fact checking websites, are generally pieces of public record (like bills, voting records, government statistics, etc). From my experience I haven&#39;t found notable cases where I thought their analysis was inaccurate based on the sources cited. You&#39;re only taking things on faith when you look at &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; and don&#39;t read any further. </p>

<p>I also think that many people are really bad at doing research, which makes fact check websites necessary lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then use the actual sources cited, not the &quot;fact-checker&quot; web site. At best, it looks sophmoric and lazy to post something 3 degrees away from the primary source, at worst, it makes you look gullible. If the article actually does have source material, which I&#39;ve not really seen happen in years, then post that. It&#39;s always going to be far more convincing than something that reeks of propaganda. To me, when I see someone post a fact checker, I just kind of cringe in the same way I would if they posted Alex Jones or CNN as a source. Just understand that when you use the tools of the state and the establishment class against others, you relinquish the higher ground and thus become the oppressor. </p>

<p>If we don&#39;t fight back against the &quot;fact-checker&quot; push, most people will lose the ability to and the understanding of why you must actually check the facts yourself. </p>

<p>Also, ironically, using a fact-checker as a source is the opposite of fact-checking, and actually further muddies the water on any claims regarding the issue in question, because it simply defers the assumptions onto the fact-checking article&#39;s author instead of the original speaker/writer.  This is what needs people need to hear. The fact-checking sites serve absolutely no positive function towards understanding the truth or falsehood of a claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It might be. It is definitely a common response people have towards the fear of doing something outside of their comfort zone. </p>

<p>Some of us though, view leaving our comfort zones as the whole point of living. Without such pursuits, all that&#39;s left is routine. </p>

<p>This of course leads to the paradox, that to live meaningfully we must first reject our inclinations towards human nature; and it is only by doing so, that we are truly able to transcend from the unthinking cog, or beast of burden, they&#39;ve conditioned, into a truly human being.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not enough that we rebel against the powers that conspire to keep us in the dark; we must also rebel against ourselves: against our own tendencies, assumptions, and prejudices. </p>

<p>What&#39;s wrong with them? </p>

<p>I see the Facebook funding is disclosed here. What&#39;s the problem? You can see their sources and how they debunk every claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something like citing the sources you used to come to that conclusion, like most fact checking sites and he&#39;ll Wikipedia even. How else do you propose people make the process open?</p>
