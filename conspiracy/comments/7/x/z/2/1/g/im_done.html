<p>My vote won&#39;t change anything. The world will turn. My opinions won&#39;t be heard. And I honestly am jealous of those who go about thier day in this happy little bubble the vast majority all live in. </p>

<p>This is hands down the most frustrating part of being &#39;awake&#39;, there is <em>so much</em> disinfo out there, and it is so hard to verify what is true and disprove what is false.  I have come to believe that I might never find the &#39;truth&#39;, but the best that I can do is identify where we definitely don&#39;t know what the real story is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>holy shit dude, well said
I often feel the same way, I want to know, but I cant change anything, and sometimes I find myself just thinking about the shit thats been dug up while I see others with their head in the sand actually enjoying life as it is oblivious to everything around them.  And even if good does prevail, nobody is going to jail....Obama, HRC, Soros...their pockets are so deep that shit will stay covered till long after they are dead and gone.  Its an uphill battle and its a struggle to keep going sometimes knowing that you cant do anything about it, you just feel deflated.  I often take breaks from reading anything about it, but I always find myself coming back and the process starts all over.
good luck to you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understandable.  Nobody faults you for this. It’s exhausting trying to keep up with the awful things hiding in the world. And maybe it’s not enough to just talk about, but it’s something. </p>

<p>I don’t just come here to keep up to date with the latest horrible news, I mostly come here to remind myself that I’m not alone in feeling that there is something very wrong with the way the world operates. </p>

<p>Honestly, knowing that all you guys are here peeling back corners and trying to make sense of the world, it keeps me from being crushed under it all. Ignorance is bliss, but I believe there is more hope in the pursuit of truth. Like the others are saying, take your time and I hope you can find some sense of peace. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all feel helpless at times. It’s hard out there and, yes, it’s getting harder. Our leaders, the people who are supposed to protect and look out for us, the people who should be guiding us towards a better future are the one’s most responsible for plunging us down this dark and dismal abyss that ever prods us to viciously tear and claw each other over scraps and berate those unfit, unable or unwilling to comply. </p>

<p>Yeah. It’s bad. Our children are depressed and violently lashing out at this world we’re presenting them. What do they have to look forward to but more pushing and shoving in order to get to the front of a line that just may deem them lucky enough to live a life of servitude, probably for one of the very same corporations that feeds and encourages the despotic conditions we now find ourselves in. </p>

<p>Yeah, it sucks. It’s disgusting that this is our world. We are ruled over by literal criminals who only care about what’s in it for them right now. As if all the wonders of the world belong to them alone by right. </p>

<p>It’s seriously hard not to be completely torn down by the weight of it all. And I have been. Yeah, I’ve definitely been there.  And I know it’s not worth it. </p>

<p>I don’t know how to change the world. All I really know is myself. And maybe the best I can do is make myself as good in this world as I can be. And I’m not talking about eating right and working out and studying to get a great job, I’m talking about finding something, anything, to feel right and good about in those world. It might start small, maybe just a song or a book or the way the breeze feels on your face but eventually it can grow to include everything, even the other people out there struggling just to make it through another day. </p>

<p>It’s a form of hope, believing in something more than this darkness and corruption and disease. And it can go a long way in making things better even in just a small way. You may eventually notice the people you interact with smiling more and opening up. Even strangers might start talking to you as if you’re friends. And it may feel completely natural, so long as you believe it is. </p>

<p>It’s just as the old wise man once said, “be the change you wish to see in the world.” I used to think that meant I had a responsibility to go out there and protest in front of the White House or to study law in order to pass legislation to help make the world more peaceful, but now I see it is even more personal. To me, it means I need to be that person living in that world in which I dream of living. I need to see the world as I wish it to be and be a citizen of such a place. </p>

<p>I think it is a world view that we all deep down share on some hidden level. A dream that isn’t about how much money or stuff we have, but how content we feel with each breath we draw in.  I think that by living this way, and by being seen as such outside in this dark world we can make a change for the better. We show the world another way. It’s not much. It’s minuscule in the face of these problems. But it’s what I got. And it beats feeling crushed and helpless. Even the journey of ten thousand miles begins with a single step. </p>

<p>I hope this helps. I also understand if it doesn’t. I wouldn’t believe myself now either back when was at my darkest. Please. Just don’t give up, because it isn’t over and you are not alone. We truly are all around you and we all want the same very basic things that you want. And there really are many, many more of us than there are of them. They are small in the face of what they are trying to prevent from happening. </p>

<p>It’s such a paradigm shift when you realize what is really happening in plain sight. You’ll be going about your day and things will just ping off your red pilled sensor, whether you are looking for it or not.  You cannot unsee, unknow things (except by lobotomy, maybe.)</p>

<p>But it’s true, feeling without control is harmful.  So we must take time to be thankful, to make deliberate and meaningful choices that bring us joy, and to show those we love how much they mean to us. Being happy and successful is the best ‘revenge’ against our ruthless destroyers.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Periodically stepping away from the theatrical drama that takes place daily is necessary to maintain balance. If you’ve not been having fun in your life because of this stuff, it’s definitely time to step away for a while. </p>

<p>If you’ve not looked into the esoteric topics, there might be something of interest for you when/if you’re nudged to get back into the fray. Those topics have a different vibe and eventually connect to the theatre we see play out daily. The current round table post already has some interesting links/ideas being shared, so maybe save the post in the event you want to take a look whenever. </p>

<p>Just do what’s best for you and know you’re making the right decision. Now go out and find your fun again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is understandable. But know that you aren&#39;t helpless. There is alot you can do to help the world. Simply helping yourself, being kind and compassionate to others, being aware of what you consume and who you support with your money, as well as, if you feel inclined to do so, spreading awareness about the issues you now know to be different than what you thought was true - all those things help. Simply by helping yourself, making your life more conscius, your choices wiser, your demeanor more compassionate - you can become a become of hope and light for the world.</p>

<p>But if you are ready to hear it, know this - the deepest conspiracy is the conspiracy that you are a helpless being that cannot be free. </p>

<p>This is not the case. You are powerful beyond measure and your natural state is one of freedom. </p>

<p>If I go even deeper, I think the deepest conspiracy is spiritual in its nature. Not religious, as religion is a perversion of the true spiritual nature and freedom you can find by engaging in honest introspective and meditative practices. But spiritual. Spiritual im the sense that you <em>are</em> spirit and thus ultimately beyond the body and mind. Knowing this through direct experience is your deepest purpose and the key to total freedom and peace, unimpeded by external circumstances.  It is also the portal to know what action to take in order to make this planet a better place for all of us.</p>

<p>There is freedom behind the veil, peace, love and joy behind the fog. That is the final rabbit hole and it begins and ends with you.</p>

<p>Best wishes and much love on your future journeys. </p>

<p>To each their own but I feel the exact opposite. Empowered and unfuckwithable. Being informed changes everything. Maybe not on a worldwide scale as you suggest, but on a personal level it absolutely will...and I&#39;ve found that is the best way to leave your mark on a larger scale. Fix yourself up. For example, someone who is &quot;woke&quot; knows how important exercise is, understands that your doctor is more or less a drug pusher, the food pyramid is inverted, they surely avoid poisons like sugar, soda and fluoride water. </p>

<p>You&#39;re a node in a network and leading by example inspires others. It&#39;s infectious. I&#39;ve seen it firsthand. Nearly every single friend or family member of mine has started eating healthy and working out, and most of them have thanked/credited me for giving them that push or inspiration to take back control of their lives. I don&#39;t mean to toot my own horn but yeah, people follow suit if you&#39;re informed and lead by example. </p>
