       I don't really know much about guns and i see alot of information circling. Question does the AR15 have the same rate of fire as a handgun or another rifle?. Is it one shot per pull of the trigger? . or is there something that makes them more dangerous? I see alot of talk about commen sense laws and banning military grade weapons , but i dont know enough about guns to form an opinion i guess.

       Relativity same rate of fire as any other semi-automatic firearm. One shot per trigger pull. They are just more “scary looking” than other guns, so people want them banned.

       Thank you for answering. So it's just the shape that makes them scary hm. So theoretically if a mass shooter wanted to kill more people he should double up on handguns? Or does that only make sense in movies? I'm just trying to make sense of the fears surrounding guns.

       Yea pretty much. Handguns are much less accurate and harder to use efficiently (without training). One or two handguns with extended clips are just as potentially dangerous when in the hands of a school shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is the biggest problem with the argument used by people that want to ban “just assault riffles”. It’s only going to start with them, and then mentally unstable people will move onto using handguns, at which time the same anti-gun crowd will have to start advocating the ban of hand guns too. It’s a slippery slope that won’t actually solve anything, because criminals will always be able to get guns, and could give a shit less about your “laws” (hence why they’re criminals).

       Well the rate of fire is going to be faster than a typical rifle(non-semi automatic) that you need to load each time. For my bolt action, you fire, pull the bolt action back to release the casing, then push it forward to load a new bullet. Then you can fire.

       Semi-automatic means it fires once every time you pull the trigger, and for a short period of time you could get three rounds a second I would have thought. It's basically a semi-auto version of the M-16 assault rifle the armed forces use.

       As others have answered, there's nothing extraordinary about the AR-15 rate of fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       A factor that might make them more common than other rifles is that you can get AR-15s chambered in many different calibers, .22LR, 7.6mm, 9mm, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another way of putting this is that AR-15 is the name for several different rifles.  It's a type of design made by several manufacturers.  The main thing they all have in common is a gas tube that brings gasses from the rifle to the breech, and a corresponding common fire control group.  Other than that design feature, AR-15s can have various design specifics.

       Yes, it's 1 shot per pull of the trigger. I can fire my 1911s at the same rate of fire as all my AR platform rifles. You can get a 30 round mag for a Glock and put the same amount of rounds down range in the same amount of time as an AR. The media doesn't know the definition of assault rifle, which is a select fire rifle. Meaning you can select between single shot and either 3 round burst or full auto. They just call any black rifle with a detachable magazine an assault rifle because that term sounds scary and they are pushing an agenda.

       For a semi auto AR you go through the same background check as any other firearm. Have you been convicted of a drug charge or violent crime? Does anyone have a restraining order against you? Do you abuse alcohol or use illegal drugs? Have you ever been declared unfit to care for yourself and your finances by a mental health professional (don't remember how that one is worded but something like that).

       should have just been the standard done with most guns. buying an ar-15 is no different than buying a remington bolt action rifle in terms of background checks.
      </p>
      <p>
       as far as I know, pistols you just have to be 21 to buy, where shotguns/rifles you can buy at 18. At least last time I was looking in to it that was the case, but the background checks were all the same.

       The same checks as anyone else in the state (it varies from state to state), and may vary between private and dealer sales (I don't know if that's even the case there, and I don't care enough to google it).
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually requires valid ID and a criminal background check.

       It's not much more in depth in what they look for, just what you have to do. 2 sets of fingerprints from your local sheriff, 2 passport photos and an application get sent in. FBI do their checks and you're good to go. The biggest issue is, as you mentioned, cost of full auto. A Vietnam era M16 goes for around $20k. $10k is just for the full auto lower, you still need an upper assembly.

       Interesting, thanks for adding some specifics in. Do you know if the FBI doing the check would go through more than the standard background check in terms of your history and such?

      <p>
       Dont think ill ever own a full auto due to those prices, but I hope to shoot some one day. Pretty crazy how well theyve held value and probably increased at times too?

       AFAIK they look up the same information that a NICS check would look at, but their database is more updated. NICS only catches about 60% of disqualifications, but the government won't spend the time or money to make it all one system. You can have convictions or disqualifications that don't show up in the NICS check, and walk out with a gun when you legally shouldn't be able to. This is why more laws won't do a fucking thing, existing ones aren't even enforced. People want to make a big deal about the ability to buy a gun from a private party with cash and no background check, while ignoring the fact that the system the government has setup and mandated for background checks doesn't work 40% of the time.

       Full autos have greatly appreciated in value. My dad's best friend is a licensed dealer and has 7 or 8 M16s alone in his collection, along with way too much other stuff to list. We've gone to the machine gun shoot in Kentucky a few times and it was a blast. Anyway, my dad had a chance to buy one of his M16s in the late 80s for around $2,000. He turned it down and it would be worth at least 10x that right now.

       Thats pretty crazy, but somehwat not surprising how inefficient the system is. I agree adding more laws in wont really limit much at all, just gonna piss more people off and the same system will stay in place most likely.

       Ive seen vids from that shoot before, def need some good ear protection. Thats pretty nuts though, I didnt know they used to be so cheap back then.

       The one thing to keep in mind is that rate of trigger pull isn't
       <em>
        entirely
       </em>
       the same.  With a rifle it's more easy to brace and control the firearm between shots, so in a way it could be argued that someone with equal skill could fire more
       <em>
        accurate
       </em>
       shots in a certain period compared to a pistol (where the test is to fire as many shots in, say, ten seconds).
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, AR rifles are just a relatively cheap, standardized and modular platform.  They're common because they're good bang for the buck (rimshot), and people like to demonize them because they
       <em>
        look
       </em>
       scarier.

       Thanks for the answers everyone. It's hard to make sense of all the rhetoric around guns and gun control.

       While there are handguns that shoot the same rounds they are rare.
      </p>
      <p>
       It comes down to the round being deployed rather than the tool to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.56%C3%9745mm_NATO">
        .556 NATO round
       </a>
       is your typical AR-15 bullet although it can be chambered in other sizes. It has three times the energy of a handgun.
      </p>
      <p>
       A .38 handgun round will stop when it hits bone. An.223 will shatter bones.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's bigger!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       It comes down to physics. A smaller round going faster is far more lethal than a larger slower round.
