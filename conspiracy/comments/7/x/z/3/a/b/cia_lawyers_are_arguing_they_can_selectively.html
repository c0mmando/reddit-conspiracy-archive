<p>SS: This lawsuit is incredibly important. I get absolutely furious over the idea the government can give information that belongs to the public to their favorite pet reporters as a quid pro quo for flattering coverage while denying access to the average person who wants to read the information directly for themselves. </p>

<p>Basically this system means the government is aiding the media in it&#39;s ability to enslave the public by forcing us to rely on the press exclusively for information about the mechanics of our own government. This is fucking infuriating. </p>

<p>You can see this same &quot;you scratch my back, I&#39;ll scratch yours&quot; in the Wikileaks Clinton emails. In exchange to access to Clinton the media agreed to ask soft ball questions, write flattering pieces and basically act as her cheerleaders. The difference is the campaign had every right to use access to Clinton as a bargaining chip for positive coverage. In what world does the fucking federal bureaucracy have the right to use information about <strong>OUR GOVERNMENT</strong> in order to bargain for good coverage? That information doesn&#39;t belong to the CIA, or to the fucking permanent bureaucrat class, it belong to CITIZENS. It&#39;s our fucking information about our fucking government. Just the audacity of these little pukes, their distaste for the rights of the average citizen. It makes me incensed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is worse than the bullshit embargoes the FDA places on drug studies.  In the case of the FDA there is a veneer of plausibility, they claim they don&#39;t want to set off havoc among researchers.  The CIA controlling the news flow is beyond belief.  In essence it is manufacturing propaganda. I think every one of these &quot;favored&quot; journalists should be identified, as well as their network or media  conglomerate affiliate, so we know who is full of shit and acting as a public relations mouthpiece for the CIA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>he seems to always take the republican side when its a partisan issue, also I don&#39;t understand how you can support trump since he is continuing many terrible policies and making things worse in some ways. Maybe Styx doesnt support trump, but he sure never goes after him or very rarely, I&#39;m guessing he wants to keep that sweet right wing patreon money flowing and going after trump too much would lose him fans which I can understand. I still like his vids on world events just not on politics as much, he was better during the election</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We may as well just consider these selective news outlets to be the propaganda arm of the CIA because this is all this is.  They say RT is the propaganda arm of Russia but we also need to be wary of our own homegrown bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spot on. It&#39;s probably worth mentioning that the propaganda our government feeds us is completely untruthful but I&#39;ve noticed that, with RT at least, they simply tell the truth about our country and our government. In the past they&#39;ve said that we&#39;re a police state, a security state, and that we constantly commit human rights violations and take liberties away from the American people. </p>

<p>Which is completely true, obviously. So I&#39;m willing to bet that&#39;s the main reason why the US government gives RT a lot of heat. Many countries spew propaganda about the US but I&#39;ve yet to see many others receive backlash of this level for it. I mean, I&#39;m not hailing Russia as some sort of saint by any means. Much of what could be said about our country could also be said about theirs, as well as many others. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s pretty sad and pathetic when you come to realize that a foreign enemy speaks more truth about your country than your own government ever will about itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, Noam Chomsky wrote a book about this in the eighties.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent">Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media</a>. From the Wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the authors propose that the mass communication media of the U.S. &quot;are effective and powerful ideological institutions that carry out a system-supportive propaganda function, by reliance on market forces, internalized assumptions, and self-censorship, and without overt coercion&quot;, by means of the propaganda model of communication</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Predictably he was called a commie, a conspiracy nut, disrespectful to those most noble of journalists, etc. There&#39;s a pretty good documentary you can watch on youtube.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I was going to tell you how full of shit you were and how it couldn&#39;t be released, but I actually went and pulled some regulations. YES, in some cases, classified information can be released for research purposes, however, the published information based on that classification has to be reviewed for release.  There are many classification authorities, but here is one example:</p>

<p>Title 29 → Subtitle A → Part 14 → Subpart C</p>

<p>§14.20   Dissemination to individuals and firms outside the executive branch.
Request for classified information received from sources outside the executive branch of the Federal Government, provided the information has been originated by the DOL, will be honored in accordance with the following guidelines:</p>

<p>(a) Top Secret information. All requests for Top Secret information by an individual or firm outside the executive branch must be referred promptly to the OASAM for consideration on an individual basis.</p>

<p>(b) Secret and Confidential information. Subject to the restrictions below, Secret or Confidential information may be furnished to an individual or firm outside the executive branch if the action furthers the official program of the organization unit in which the information originated. The official furnishing such information must ensure that the individuals to whom the information is to be furnished have the appropriate DOL clearance, or at least clearance for the same or higher classification for another Federal department, or outside agency whose security clearances are acceptable to the DOL. The official must also ensure that the person to whom the classified information is being furnished possess the proper facilities for safeguarding such information. No Secret or Confidential information may be furnished to an individual or firm outside the executive branch without written concurrence from the primary organizational unit head or the Security Officer of that unit.</p>

<p>(c) Unauthorized knowledge of classified information. Upon receipt of a request for classified information which raised a suspicion that an individual or organization outside the executive branch has unauthorized knowledge of the existence of Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret information, a report providing all available details must be immediately submitted to the DOL Document Security Officer for appropriate action and disposition.</p>

<p>(d) Requests from outside the United States. All requests from outside the United States for Top Secret, Secret or Confidential information, except those received from foreign offices of the primary organizational unit or from U.S. embassies or similar missions, will be referred to the Deputy Under Secretary for International Labor Affairs.</p>

<p>(e) Access by historical researchers. Individuals outside the executive branch engaged in historical research may be authorized access to classified information over which the DOL has jurisdiction provided:</p>

<p>(1) The research and need for access conform to the requirements of section 4-3 of Executive Order 12356.</p>

<p>(2) The information requested is reasonably accessible and can be located and compiled with a reasonable amount of effort.</p>

<p>(3) The researcher agrees to safeguard the information in a manner consistent with E.O. 12356 and directives thereunder.</p>

<p>(4) The researcher agrees to a review of the notes and manuscript to determine that no classified information is contained therein.</p>

<p>Authorization for access is valid for the period required but no longer than two years from the date of issuance unless it is renewed under the conditions and regulations governing its original authorization.</p>

<p>(f) Access by former presidential appointees. Individuals who have previously occupied policymaking positions to which they were appointed by the President may be authorized access to classified information which they originated, reviewed, signed, or received while in public office. Upon request, information identified by such individuals will be reviewed for declassification in accordance with the provisions of these regulations.</p>
