       Why is it that everyone thinks that somehow taking away guns is the answer, when that is literally impossible.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/BTojV_NqWCA">
        This video
       </a>
       shows how easy it is to assemble perfectly legal gun parts that require no background checks, with a manufactured lower receiver, which
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       require a legal process to acquire(but it was manufactured by the gunsmith, so there was no legal process). So like any prohibition that America has ever undergone, will result in backlash, a bigger black market in illegal weapon trade, AND more crime. Plus, like I read on another post about gun control, they can really only take away
       <em>
        legal
       </em>
       ,
       <em>
        registered
       </em>
       guns, because those are the only guns that which they know exist. So why does everyone think that taking the
       <strong>
        legal
       </strong>
       guns away will solve everything? And why is the only solution I see everywhere else other than this sub, anti-gun related?

       Not exactly. Ironically enough, I didn’t include the shooting in the title
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       of how blown up it is. Which isn’t bad because I mean it’s a shooting. But it’s because of the fact that it is filled, and I mean fucking filled to the rim of just anti gun bullshit. And I remember seeing a video of his guy who would secretly record interviews with twitter employees and former ones, saying they ‘ghost ban’ people where they post stuff but nobody sees it, and also filter out republican pro-trump posts and obviously alter the trending hashtags and posts and so forth. So it’s very possible that they filter out tweets to push anti-gun and gun control content.

       This always happens. The school reps are saying it because they bear most of the responsibility to keep students safe. They failed. Even law enforcement is saying gun control is needed because all the warning signs were there for this guy. He was on watch lists. Cops visited his home many times. They failed. Everyone wants to divert attention away from their own failures.

         If you believe they were false flag attacks, with the motive being to take away guns (which in your scenario was successful) then what was the end game? Most brits and australians don't own guns (though plenty do) so what next? They haven't become a dictatorship because the people are helpless or anything like that (well no more than americans anway)

       We have an amendment in our constitution that states we have a right to bear arms. They don’t (at least in their constitution-equivalent). So whether or not you are pro or anti gun, there will always be people who will feel obligated to exercise that right. It’s a principle so engraved in the country’s history that if you took it away, there would quite literally be a civil war. I think that since it has been a part of the country since it was established, that it simply is too late to try and take away guns or regulate them to where people are satisfied with the result; which they won’t. It’s either all or none in my opinion. But none is basically impossible without more shootings imo.

       We agree on this. I don't really even consider banning guns in the US simply because it was unfeasible, despite the fact that it would likely work to reduce crime (based on what we've seen in the rest of the first world)

      <p>
       This is where I don't agree. I believe we as a country are fully capable of regulation on things like weapon types (the actual definition of an assault rifle needs to be changed) background checks, exclusions on who can buy (mental health issues, violent offenders), and also how guns are required to be carried and stored (gun accidents never get the attention they deserve when this topic comes up)

       Switzerland is safe because its a white country. There is no other factor that has the greatest effect on crime than race and culture.

       A bit racist to say "because it's white", but yes I agree that a homogenized population is generally safer and has way less tension than a diverse one.
      </p>
      <p>
       But surely you can see how different Switzerlands laws are than ours and how much they can impact crime. Australia and the UK both have fairly diverse populations

       It's because of whites that it's safe. In Africa/middle east, they have tribes/ cities that are 99%+ black/middle eastern, yet are one of the most dangerous. Crime is dangerously under reported.

       What African and middle eastern countries have both high gun crime and strict gun laws? Countries like Korea, Japan, China do not have many gun crimes, so it obviously isn't a "white" thing. And like I said Australia and the UK are fairly diverse.

       I feel like you took a valid point which is that homogenous populations are safer with less tensions and then just twisted it with a racist perspective

       They actually have a lot of refugees there now. The difference is their police do not tolerate gun violence and will kick them out. They’ll let them push drugs and prostitution to some extent, but gun violence doesn’t fly there and the refugees know this.

       No I don't, I think that is a faulty line of reasoning that you could apply to any crime. "Bad guys will always steal/murder/drive drunk etc., legal or not. No law can fix this." I think laws with proper enforcement are almost always more successful in ending crime

       The same ones that do in the UK and Australia. Like I said, we have real-life examples of it working in real life. Some criminals will still have guns, yes, but it makes it unquestionably harder to acquire, and much more serious when they do

       The “they’re going to take our guns” claim is just disinfo and completely not true.  As you said, it’s literally impossible.  Everyone knows and acknowledges this.  No one is coming to take your guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       What some are advocating for is common sense gun regulations to prevent stupid shit like this from happening.  Should the shooter have been allowed to purchase this weapon?  Clearly not.   How could we have prevented it?   Should mentally ill individuals be allowed to purchase firearms?  Probably not.  Should background checks have a waiting period to catch these things?  Probably.  Should there be some sort of limit to the types of weapons high school students can purchase?  Probably.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this is common sense and all of this has some degree of bipartisan support.  Why we never see progress is because morons will start screaming about gun confiscations.

       I haven’t seen these posts.   Let’s take the responses of four liberals (my first thoughts were Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton).
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We are grieving with Parkland. But we are not powerless. Caring for our kids is our first job. And until we can honestly say that we're doing enough to keep them safe from harm, including long overdue, common-sense gun safety laws that most Americans want, then we have to change.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is exactly what I argued above.  Common-sense “no shit” laws that can save lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Maybe, just maybe, after 18 school shootings in America in just 43 days of 2018 the Congress might want to consider common-sense gun safety legislation and save innocent lives.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The “18 school shootings” isn’t true, he got that stat from a website that includes suicides on campus and after hour shootings as “school shootings,” but the number is at least 5 and can be argued as high as low teens.   However, again, common sense gun control laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary Clinton linked Gabby Gifford’s statement:
       <a href="https://giffords.org/2018/02/floridaschool/">
        here
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “My heart is with the victims and survivors, and my gratitude is with Broward County’s courageous first responders. The question now is if we will find the courage to pass the laws we need to protect our children, to stop dangerous people from accessing guns. And if Congress won’t act, American voters must.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Stopping dangerous people from accessing guns is common sense.   No where does she say, “take away guns from dangerous people” or “confiscate guns.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Elizabeth Warren:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        My heart goes out to everyone at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. No student should have to fear going to school. No parent should have to hear their child won’t be coming home. And tragedies like this should never happen.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       She doesn’t even call for any gun laws!  Let alone confiscating guns.

       Already a thing. 92% of background checks come back while the gun store owner is still on the phone. If the background check system needs more time, they have 72-hours to research it. If the gun store does not hear back in that time, they can proceed with the sale. This is done on purpose to stop anyone from de-funding the background check system. If the default was to not sell, a blanket gun ban could be made just by eliminating the background check system. The 72-hours is a short time, and many reasonable gun owners have proposed increasing that time to a week. The Background check system can come back with a "no" anytime after the sale. If that happens, local law enforcement and the ATF go to the home of the purchaser and seize all guns.

       Federal law says that no one under 18 can purchase a handgun. That's been a law since 1968. 18 years of age is an adult for nearly all purposes in the US. This crime was done with a rifle, but rifles are in the vast minority of guns used in crimes. The only major right that a person gains after 18 is the ability to drink alcohol. Every year about 350 people are killed by rifles. Compare that to about 1500 people killed by underage drunk drivers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling for "common sense" gun control is a dirty tactic. It presupposes that anyone who disagrees with you lacks common sense. The partisanship is a real factor though.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years ago there were 4 bills in congress at the same time about gun control. 2 written by Republicans and 2 written by Democrats. They had to do with the "No Fly" list and prohibiting people from buying guns if they are on that list. The Democrat laws said, if you are on the list, you cannot purchase a gun. The Republican one said, if you are on the list, a judge has to review if you try to buy a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither version passed. The Republicans, obviously would not vote for the Democrat version that took away the right to buy a gun without due process. The Democrats not voting for the Republican version is odd though. Why would they want to have no restrictions rather than having some restriction? The only answer is partisanship. They would rather people on the no fly list be able to buy guns than vote for a bill written by the other team.

       TBF, there's more than one lot of screaming morons making it harder. Some are advocating for common sense regulations, sure - and some are wringing every last drop of political advantage out of what happened with no apparent regard at all for a shared future.
      </p>
      <p>
       If common sense is to win out, the anti-gun lot will have to move at least as far as the pro-gun lot. If the argument was 'we understand your 2a rights and we admit there's more to these shootings than just gun availability, but come on let's be sensible and keep assault rifles out of the hands of mental people', there might be some traction. Instead it's closer to 'we understand you're all paranoid facist lunatics and there's zero middle ground anywhere at all so we'll just scream whatever talkpoints are making the rounds and refuse to engage honestly on anything', and it doesn't really work. Makes things worse, even.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's just an obsolete methodology, myself. You get a bunch of good people with a noble goal and they're trying to get the word out, and marketing best practice says they should scrub any hint of doubt or ambiguity, make it as simple and pointed as possible, maximize the impact and so on. Makes sense, you'd think - except now we're all drowning in data, nobody can avoid the objections and counterpoints. All that's required to put holes in the noble message is for somebody to point out all the ways in which the issue has been simplified and pointified and scrubbed of all doubt and ambiguity.

       Too many people succumbing to fear mongering.   Exponetially more people die from eating shit food and it's also ruining the planet,  but no one will argue for any limiting on fast food.   Outs not like the US gained independence via burger eating contest.

       There is a strong anti-2nd sentiment on corporate social media platforms because while Americans still have access to guns, there is no proceeding with their corporate NWO.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, they won't be able to successfully subdue an armed population. Second, if the citizens are disarmed, it gives a great excuse to have a large militarized police force under the NWOs control.

       Simple anwser, bc people are scared of guns due to lack of education about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This irrational mentality towards guns that is rampid on social media and the MSM can be fixed by simply having firearms training in our school systems.  The firearms instructors would be there in the roll as a teacher, but for firearm safety/training/education BUT WOULD ALSO double as on campus security and 1st responders.  There are a lot of Veterans that would love this job, and could continue to serve their country. We could simultaneously educate are you two not be scared of guns and protect them. 80k a year and benefits -  every school district waste money and can clean up a few administrators to pay for this.

       No so much anti gun, just anti dead kids all the time. The rest of the world are sick of seeing you mass killing each other. Whether you like it or not one of the factors in all of these shootings is a gun. The world is telling you to try help yourselves. Have some real compassion. Pull together a make a positive change. Man you guys have to try something. Those poor kids were at school. Start with making kids safer maybe? I love America. Please do something.

         If you believe they were false flag attacks, with the motive being to take away guns (which in your scenario was successful) then what was the end game? Most brits and australians don't own guns (though plenty do) so what next? They haven't become a dictatorship because the people are helpless or anything like that (well no more than americans anway)
