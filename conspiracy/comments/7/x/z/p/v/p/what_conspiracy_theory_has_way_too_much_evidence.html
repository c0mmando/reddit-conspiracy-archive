Dont you understand they are all on the same side, paid to push this fucking narrative.  is Trump a piece of shit? yes. Did he have shady business dealings all over the world? yes. Did the Russians hack the DNC and release the emails? Absolutely not, there&#39;s no evidence.  And THIS is what the DNC were claiming before they realized that they couldnt prove it which is when the narrative switched to the &quot;collusion&quot; thing.  Oh and by the way when the collusion narrative fell apart is when we learned of the Clinton foundation&#39;s deals with Russia. </p>

<p>The full thread — <strong>posted by Trump Jr. himself in two tweets in an effort to preempt a story by the New York Times’ Jo Becker, Adam Goldman, and Matt Apuzzo</strong> — makes indisputably clear that Trump Jr. was trying to collude with the Russian government.</p>

<p>In the thread, Goldstone goes on to schedule a meeting between Trump Jr. and a “Russian government attorney” who he said would convey the information. Trump Jr. also forwards on the thread to Jared Kushner and then-Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort, confirming the time of the meeting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>come on dude, this is straight off that page :</p>

<p>There remains a great deal we still don’t know about the Russia scandal. For instance, what, if anything, Trump’s team actually ended up doing with the Russians is still unclear. Did any collaborative effort or private understanding materialize in the end? Was the Trump campaign tipped off about the Russian hacking and planned leaks of prominent Democrats’ emails? What, exactly, did Donald Trump know?</p>

I would tell people something was off about the events and would get laughed at, ignored or told I was crazy. Then in 2007 whilst reading a copy of Empire magazine, there was a tiny little article about a film called Loose Change, about people questioning the narrative and up until that point, I had no idea other people thought the events of that day were odd. I had already had similar thoughts about Lady Diana&#39;s death prior to 9/11 happening so I guess I was already questioning things and I had questions about the events of 7/7 too. Those are the 3 big ones for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes it doesn’t make any sense. And what about being people who get caught reporting the lie that the earth is round What the hell.</p>

<p>I thought maybe this whole thing was a philosophical exercise. For example it looks pretty flat on the way to school. My yard is flat. My room is flat. I guess that means my “world quote is flat. Philosophically speaking of course. Scientifically speaking it’s a whole different thing. And these people aren’t doing a philosophical exercise. They believe the earth is flat. I just don’t understand</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the earth is round like a basketball.. what happens when you pour water on a basketball? The water falls off the basketball and onto the ground.</p>

<p>But you take a flat plate and pour water on to it… And the water stays on the plate. Obviously the earth is flat like a plate not round like a basketball.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the real problem is that flat or round, it is easily provable and verifiable. And a lie on that scale would early discredit all governments and sciences. And why? Why on earth would they maintain such an easily verifiable falsehood?</p>

<p>Blame it on me. I have colluded with everybody that matters… NASA, the map makers, geologists. And I have made them agree that the earth is flat. And everybody supports flat earth doctrine.</p>

<p>What is my motivation for this lie? why? Why say the earth is flat or round when it is not?</p>

<p>I would look into this theory if somebody would tell me why anybody would Maintain Such a lie in the first place.</p>

<p>such a hoax</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I have heard is to make us feel like an insignificant little blip in a vast universe of other worlds just like ours instead of the powerful, special, and significant beings we really are. By making us believe we are not special as told by God, it combats the Bible and instills doubts in the minds of the masses. It&#39;s all deception aimed at winning a spiritual war.</p>

<p>And before you accuse me of being a Bible thumper, I am agnostic and not overly religious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve heard that about ancient archaeology. We humans are pretty damn innovative. We could’ve built the pyramids. And we had a lot of cool shit that’s been forgotten. We do not need aliens to solve our problems. But, if we think that we can’t create agriculture on our own or build a pile of rock on our own without the help of the space God… It makes everybody a little more complacent with the situation at hand. So yeah I agree with you</p>

    <div class="md"><p>CocaCola&#39;s genius switch from Coke to New Coke back to &quot;original coke&quot; was just a ploy to cleanse the palate of the people as they really switched to high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar. Yes, Coke switched to high fructose corn syrup at EXACTLY the same time as they switched back to the &quot;old formula&quot;. Coke Classic was just a marketing scheme, it was actually a new formula using the much cheaper and less healthy HFCS. </p>
