    <div class="md"><p>Ah but that&#39;s a whole different type of argument of real vs manufactured experiences. 
Think about this:</p>

<p>How many people who have actually been in combat go on killing sprees, then compare that to people who have done such things as mass shootings who ha e never been in combat or lived in war zones. 
Chances are you will find that the numbers are vastly different.<br/>
Now I&#39;m not saying there hasn&#39;t been a mass shooting or something like that commited by combat veterans but the numbers are higher for people who have never been in those situations.
Im not saying that I blame video games..im a gamer my self ( currently battlefield 1) AS well as a combat vet, quite the opposite. It is my belief that most of the time people that commit these heinous crimes are someone with mental instabilities that show themselves way in advance and (at times) the fake or glorified violence that is portrayed in the media  ( games, movies etc..) can be the slighted nudge that gives them the thinking that they too can do it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re spot on with the shooters. And most of the shootings have been at schools where the kids have no chance of being a combat vet. But every single one has been mentally unstable and has had a history with violent or weird behavior. How many times have we heard the FBI knew about them before hand? How many times do the shooters claim if they survive the incident that voices were telling them to do it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all likelihood you&#39;re probably right, simply judging by the relative lack of other attention grabbing violent actions attributed to such a cause. </p>

<p>Like, there&#39;s no reason for such hallucinations to point the sufferer <em>specifically</em> toward indiscriminately firing their gun in a crowded area, right? </p>

<p>The &quot;voices&quot; would be just as likely to direct them to act like that one guy who had a now confirmed schizophrenic breakdown on that Greyhound bus back in 2008, where he killed a specific stranger who he had never so much as spoken to before with a kitchen knife and then began calmly dismembering the body while ignoring everything else around him.</p>

<p>If schizo-like hallucinations and delusions were really all that common a trigger, I&#39;d imagine we&#39;d see significantly more attacks which drastically deviate from the standard &quot;disgruntled individual obtains gun, goes to their school, office, or local mall, and then opens fire&quot; pattern. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As an American I do at times wrestle with the idea of banning guns. On one hand it would prevent alot of violence, but, we, As a country do have the right to own and posses firearms. I think it is a good thing that our constitution guarantees this. I do understand why you  would have a hard time with this and it&#39;s mainly because as Americans we have always valued and prized our freedom to do such. We like to hunt, protect ourselves and (in alot of cases) just be gun hobbiests. Where the line is crossed between healthy enthusiasm and outright paranoia is the idea that some day..someone will take those freedoms away and there is little argument to say that an armed citizenry would be able to stop the government were such an order to be implemented.</p>

<p>One thread that ties a lot of mass shootings together is that many of these shooters complain of hearing voices, having visions, being attacked by directed energy weapons, being mind controlled, and even one who claimed that a phone app &quot;takes control over your whole body.&quot; Link compilation of the media reporting on these here: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7fqfzi/one_thread_that_ties_a_lot_of_mass_shootings/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7fqfzi/one_thread_that_ties_a_lot_of_mass_shootings/</a></p>

<p>I wish there were some news articles or something that say &quot;All of these mass shooters appear to have the same psychiatric illness.&quot; They need to give us this information in one article, not scattered reports that make you think it happened once or twice. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>“…How is it possible to produce a voice without a resonating sound box and expect it to be received and understood without a physical audio receiver (and a memory bank) as the source of intelligence for understanding? Even more important, I reasoned; if the cortex in which our memories are stored are lost at the time of the loss of our bodies at death, how can we establish communication after we have slipped out of our mortal coil, and transmit messages to those we have left behind us in this vale of tears with no memory from which to draw upon? The answer to my questions had to be simply that it is not possible to communicate with the non- physical realities into which we pass at the time of our death, unless we employ some type of scanning process with which to tap the memory banks of those with whom we would communicate in the physical reality, and this would transcend the use of either voice or language, since it consisted only of stimulating and rearranging mind patterns. With this process, it would not even be necessary to make use of a language, or even to utilize any spoken or written language common to both transmitter and receiver, because the transmission would be that of thought patterns, and memory impulses, which the receiver would have to translate into words, and/or voice patterns for understanding, and recording. The voice you would hear then, when you received messages from the spirit world, would have to be either your own or taken from your memory bank to put the telepathic communication into words, and sounds for your own convenience in understanding, and recording. There was no reason why radio could not be used for this purpose, I concluded, because it was entirely possible to scan the memory banks of the living by radio waves, and it was also within the realm of possibility to transmit thought patterns, suggestive impulses, and stimulate the ego to translate, and interpret telepathic communications into memorized sounds, and words for recording, and understanding. The voice you hear in your head, then, although it may not be your own, would have to be supplied by you from your memory bank, and what you thought you were hearing would not be sounds, but a matter of perception, and although quite real, nevertheless, only real to you, and only after you had created it out of your imagination…”</p>

<p>The tech does exist and it has for a long time, so don&#39;t think you&#39;re totally nuts to think so. Just remember it ain&#39;t real and don&#39;t act on those thoughts. Easier said than done though...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree.. it&#39;s all lies... evil lies from Satan filled people...who I see it are total cowards. They seek control because they have fear in them . </p>

<p>And yes I&#39;ve given a lot of thought to the possibility that it&#39;s a massive frequency. </p>

<p>For one, I&#39;ll hear a very strange phrase and many times now, someone in my location has then mindlessly said that phrase. </p>

<p>(And I mean really random stuff you&#39;d never say just because... like answering a yes or no question with the word &quot;amish&#39; after the word had been v2kd in my head 10 times)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I have severe voice to skull and all the crop that goes along with it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t completely have the answers as to who or why thought I have my theories.  I also realize disinformation is the name of the game and that these theories generally discredit the victim </p>

<p>I&#39;m much more into the provable aspects of the tech.  I.e if there are frequencies in the air are they recordable/identifiable, etc.</p>

<p>Instead of focusing on my personal conspiracy theories <em>tho I do have some</em>. ..i pray A LOT for vindication and freedom and have faith God will lead me to the answer.</p>

<p>If I didn&#39;t have faith I&#39;d have absolutely no hope in the hell I live.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How about americans inherent violent nature? You guys came from violence and we even sent our most violent and mentally ill people to the US during the great migration period of the US as a form of punishment for their bad and violent behaviour. So did the UK, Ireland, Denmark, Netherland etc etc..</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even kidding. America&#39;s violent history is all a part of your collective mental heritage. Mind control, perhaps yes, but violence defines american history when you look at it with an open mind to what i&#39;m saying</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe you are on to something.</p>

<p>We are all connected and I am not talking about the metaphysical either. Nicolas Cruz seemed to have multiple online accounts. He is young, male,  impressionable, has a lack of impulse control and an unhealthy need of attention. How hard would it be for someone &quot;not pointing fingers&quot; some group to find a person like this and influence them in some way? What if there are people searching the Internet for just that? </p>
