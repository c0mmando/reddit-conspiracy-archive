       This thread was gold, glad to see there are some of us that still care enough to be outraged. I’ve had conversations where we were discussing the the corrupt elite and there’s always this answer that drives me mad “yeah so what, not like we can do anything about it” accompanied by a ¯_(ツ)_/¯. It’s exhausting.

       It’s human nature to horde and be greedy for self preservation reasons. It’s as hard to fight this innate reaction as it is to convince yourself that sweet fatty salty things taste worse than bitter greens.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, one mechanism (although of a heavily flowed system) I can see that can help alter the innate greed is religion. To introduce a thought that there is existence and consequences after death (whether it be true or not) provides somewhat of a foil to the impulse of greed now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know plenty of bad, evil religious people that use their religion for selfish justifications. But on the other hand, the most kind, generous, and altruistic (debatable if true altruism even exists however) people I know are deeply religious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing I believe in, as corny as it sounds, is the only way to trump a lot of maladies in today’s society is through love and compassion, wherever the motive or source comes from.

        Parochial altruism
       </a>
       is certainly a thing.  Some of our ancient ancestors would help each other without an immediate expectation of reciprocity.  In the long run, the people that helped each other selflessly received more help in turn than those that demanded repayment or didn't help at all, and thus were more able to survive and pass on their genes and memes.  The groups with more selfless helpers tended to outcompete the groups with fewer, and they were able to build larger communities, which led to civilizations, which led to empires.  Parochialism has ruled for tens of thousands of years.  True altruism, if it exists, doesn't stand a chance against the in-group mentality.

       Has that lady stopped using oil &amp; gas to drive &amp; keep herself warm through the WV winters.  Maybe she should convince citizens to stop paying these companies.  That would be the better route.  Because many if these lawmakers are just trying to do what the citizens want.  The majority of the US population including many ppl in this thread i'm sure usually loose their shit if they have to go without electricity for a few days.  This is typical sensationalism from the left &amp; the NYT wrote an article about it.

       Don’t know where your off to with that one, availing in products and services has nothing to do with company’s donating to people who are in a position to potentially return the favor. It’s legal bribes and it’s about time it stopped, this woman was hauled out for just talking about something that was public information but very few actually look into because they believe that they have their interests in line when in fact it’s all about them donations and private dinners

       While US seems to take the cake during discussions. The so called world's biggest democracy(India) isn't doing any good either with the rise of politically backed goons and nationalism rhetorics. Media has been bought to the extent that their is a dedicated new network just to push the current government propoganda and serving fodder to easily manipulated masses who treat the leader as physical incarnation of God. Only difference, freedom of speech is still guarded to an extent whereas here it's scary to talk anything bad about government in public. And fear has been instilled among the one's whose voices could do something with assassinations and murders of journalists and others.

       Democracy was deemed by our founders to be a bad form of government which always leads to corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why they created a Constitutional Democratic Republic. A lot of analysis went into the decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost immediately corrupt politicians started working on making it a Democracy and giving themselves more power.
      </p>
      <p>
       As soon as those people gained control over the money and taxation, they were able to control everything else and the average person is now too stupid to know the difference.

       As I understand it, it's actually worse on the local level. The scale per person may be higher the higher one goes, but I've read in the past  (trying to find something to back this up) that on a local level, it is far more pervasive.

       Yup. You might think that since the potential rewards aren't as large, municipal governments wouldn't be as corrupt. It's actually the opposite since the people in office at those levels have zero spotlight on them. People barely even vote in local elections and many don't even know the candidates names. Plus, even a relatively small town can have a budget in the millions, so there are plenty opportunities to award construction contracts to your friends or companies that you totally don't secretly have a stake in.

       Atlanta is totally corrupt.  The last mayor went to the 2016/17 (?) buildiburg summit.  And there was magically a huge infrastructure collapse the same year and only certain companies got to work on all those huge projects.  Flagrant corruption.

       Not the first time they had a corporatist run against a lineup or other terrible choices, with a campaign full of lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he in a way, did drain the swamp by appointing even more industry representetives into positions of regulatory bodies. Like obama before him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally r drain the swamp was always the scapegoat. Eithee he won or he lost to Hillary the gov would still do the same thing. Cut taxes, increase military budgets and war efforts, keepngutting social services. Its a never ending battle. Unless the system takes money out of politics, to the extent it is now, representation of the poeple is continue to diminish in the cenate.

       Currently embroiled in pointless lies about banging a pornstar. Lied about releasing his taxes is a substantive one. Unemployment stats, economic gains, trade deals, Paris accords, all things he's lied about. He lied about knowing Putin despite clear recorded evidence of him bragging about a relationship with Putin.

       His self serving interests were made obvious in his suggestions for the tax bill. He wanted to repeal the alternative minimum tax, the only noteworthy tax he has paid in years past.

       He was a billionaire ceo. Chances are, he came close to fucking models, maybe not pornstars. I’m gonna need a source for that. Even if you meant models, so what. Name any guy that hasn’t lied about banging someone. And this was before he was president.

       And you know this because you have his tax returns? Or are you relying on the “lie” trump said about it. You’re most likely pulling that out of your ass considering the tax return that was leaks and read on live tv showed that he paid more than his fair share.

       I’m waiting for any shred of evidence. So far all you’ve done is call me delusional, naive while sharing a wild theory. Conspiracies stem from evidence and coverups. Not stupid one liners like “trump is obviously being blackmailed”. If it’s obvious you’d be able to plant the seed the leads down a rabbit hole. You appear crazy to me as I do to you.

       I would and I employee you to share it. It seems you would rather insult me by claiming I won’t read It. This leads me to believe you have nothing noteworthy and trying to back out of defending whatever it is you’re defending.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have information share it and let it speak for itself. Saying “I have all this information” and then not posting it doesn’t help you push your agenda.

       If you consider that praising, then that’s in you. He was describing the people he had deals with. And I watched your video. No where does he say he’s met Putin. If you got a time stamp, prove me wrong.

       No, it doesn’t bother me that he had deals with Russian citizens when he was a citizen. You’re making it sound like it’s with the Russian government.
      </p>
      <p>
       I rewatched it and heard him say he met him once. He also goes on to say Putin stole one of the guys something. I don’t know enough about David letterman or if that was meant to be a joke, but this is what I was talking about when I said plant your seed. It’s up to me to jump down that rabbit hole (and I will).

       He has never denied Russian deals with Russian citizens, only denying Russian
       <em>
        government

       deals. It’s more likely you’re taking this “lie” out of context. Unless of course, you can prove me wrong again.

       Here's him saying he never met Putin on Jul 27, 2016. I can provide links to transcripts if you care.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        TRUMP: I never met Putin, I don't know who Putin is. He said one nice thing about me. He said I'm a genius. I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it. I never met Putin.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here's him saying he never worked with any Russians same day, in reference to his businesses and taxes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And I'll release them when the audits completed. Nobody would release when it's under -- I've had audits for 15 or 16 years. Every year I have a routine audit. I'm under audit, when the audits complete I'll release them. But zero, I mean I will tell you right now, zero, I have nothing to do with Russia, yes?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Please also note that audits don't prevent him from releasing his taxes, nor do audits last for years and years and years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here he vociferously denies ANY dealings with Russia
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) Russia has no business in you -- that you don't have any...
       </p>
       <p>
        TRUMP: No, I have nothing to do with Russia, John (ph). How many times do I have say that? Are you a smart man? I have nothing to with Russia, I have nothing to do with Russia.

       I kinda find the title to be misleading here. "Politicians" is a much broader term than what the data is actually representing: Presidents. I'm sure if they cast a wider net and included US Congressman we'd see vastly different numbers that probably closer align to the pollee's of that Rasmussen study. Also, what constitutes a "good faith" to keep their campaign promises? It's also odd that they then use the back half of the article to bitch about Trump, seems kinda like a non-sequitor to me.

       This may be off topic, but if Bernie had the election stolen from him by the DNC, the same applies to Trump and Russia.

       How did Bernie lose the election?  Even ignoring super-delegates, he did not win.  The DNC colluded to give Hillary an advantage, but each vote was still counted.

       Anybody living in California who didn't absolutely love Clinton or Trump wasted their vote. The State was going Democrat with or without their one vote. They could have voted for Stein and let their vote be counted.

       bernie sold the fuck out! i was forhim to in 2016 this was before it became very apparent that he was a puppet too. he knew the democrats squashed democratic principles in hopes of getting their girl on. he knew the fix was in and didnt do shit about. i really wished he was the change that was needed but obviously he wasn't. just another bull shit politician that was only worried about his best interests. bernie was a fucking wash out dissappointing ass old man could have actually done something instead of swallowing hillarys load.
the answer for this is not voting its not canvassing and getting the word out the fucking answer is to knock it all down and start over. this shit isn't broken our government/society/america is not broken it is a fucking mess so there is no fix. no bandaid or quick solution the only way to get us on a better track is a revolt. bloody, viloent, destructive revolution. then lock the doors to the outside and rebuild. the american dream has been long dead there is no longer the ability to start from nothing and become everything. The idea that any child in america can grow up to one day become president is a total and bull shit lie. no one can be president unless those rich mother fuckers at the top allow it.

       That's much more important.  You'll never stop the flow of money.  But if the turnover is high, and politicians know they'll only be serving 4 or 8 years, I believe we'll get less people running who want to do it for the power/kickbacks.

       Get the money out of politics and we've taken a big step toward fixing everything.  No more campaign donations, gifts, or corporate lobbying.

       That being said, it is a fucking pipedream because the only ones that can change the system will be affected negatively by the change and they won't cut off their Sugar Daddies to benefit the population as a whole.

       Honestly, campaign finance reform is the biggest joke I've ever heard.  Even if you got everything on your wishlist, if individual contributions were severely limited, if corporate donations were banned, if super PACs were banned, they'd still funnel money to their candidates of choice in two very simple steps.  They'd either hire the candidate to give a private speech, and pay them millions of dollars, or they'd donate money to a charity in which the candidate was a high paid executive of.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's next then?  They'll ban charities?  They'll ban speeches?  There is no way to stop the flow of money.

       Corporations and the rich will still pay candidates via paid speeches, so what does it matter how much they officially donate to the campaign?

       Please vote for the Green Party.  Doctor Jill Stein has the foresight and the determination to cut the extraordinarily wasteful "Defense" budget
       <strong>
        IN HALF
       </strong>
       if she becomes President, despite the countless assassination attempts from the CIA that she would likely encounter for bravely trying to halve the "Defense" budget.
      </p>
      <p>
       Halving the "Defense" budget is in her platform; she campaigned on it in 2012 and 2016.  The wildly wasteful and excessive "Defense" budget is America's Number One Problem.   We would have money for everything (infrastructure, education, health, new industry innovations) if we cut the "War-making" Budget in half.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mendacious, larcenous Democrats and Republicans are actually increasing the "Defense" budget every year!  They don't care about the American People, only for "Defense" giants Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Northrup Grumman, the 3 Kings of America, our war-happy rulers who see their profits skyrocket with each new war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some may ask why I never include Boeing in the list.  Well, 80 percent of Boeing's annual revenues come from civilian sector sales of airplanes like the 747, 767, etc., whereas it's just the opposite for the 3 Kings:  Upwards of 80 percent of their annual revenues come from military weapons manufacturing --  way excessive, wasteful, and unnecessary weapons production at that.

       Trump's Defense Budget:$716 billion aproximately 13% increase from 2017
      </p>
      <p>
       $617 billion: Base budget for the Defense Department
      </p>
      <p>
       $69 billion: Overseas Contingency Operations (extra funding for wars that Congress can’t limit, known as OCO)
$30 billion: “Other” national defense spending, which includes money for the Energy Department to oversee America’s nuclear weapons
      </p>
      <p>
       150 billion was used in 2013 for current and retired military personnel, and their benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
       90 billion were used for basic pay, food, housing, allowances, bonuses  and any type of special pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       16 billion were used for their pensions.
      </p>
      <p>
       40 billion aproximately were used for their health benefits. [This keeps increasing each year btw]
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        out of aproximately 10 million people eligible for their benefits only 1.4 million serve in active duty.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Trump's budget aims to recruit 26,000 new troops, and build 355 ship quote -which experts say it will take decades to complete-
      </p>
      <p>
       If it takes 150 billion on 1.4 million personnel. and she wants to cut it in half then 75 billion would only fund about 700k personnel. That's a big jump [BTW this was just a simple division, obviously it would be more balanced. Yet considering that Jill Stein hasn't actually released her plans, and I can't find any of her numbers, nor how she actually wants to reinvest that money on renewable jobs that those who lose the jobs will "get" plus the fact that she wants to make the National Guard the primary group for our defense. Makes me very skeptical of the reality of her plans.

       America's brave soldiers are getting very little of the 1.2 Trillion dollars in "Defense" we spend each year.  Totalling all soldiers' annual pay amounts to only  about 35 or 40 billion dollars, which is just 3 percent of the true annual "Defense" budget calculated last year by Doctor Paul Craigs Roberts, who was Reagan's Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you want to use your figure of 150 Billion for total pay
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       benefits of current and retired military personnel, that amount to only 12 percent of the 1.2 Trillion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast amount of the annual "Defense" budget goes to the "Defense" companies for weapons manufacturing to make too, too many aircraft carriers, destroyer ships, long-range bombers, fighter jets, tanks, missiles, ICBMs, hydrogen bombs, etc., etc., and crazy Star Wars/"S.D.I." schemes if they attempt to resurrect that program.

       Where do you get the 1.3 trillion of annual defense budget? I can't find a source that even comes close to that. Specially when in 2015 the annual U.S. budget was totalled in 3.3 Trillion yet the military only had  609.3 Billion (16% of all the budget) without counting Veteran's benefits and they don't even come close to the 1.3 trillion you mentioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       And actually Trump increased the military pay raise by 2.4% on the monthly pay. If the average active  military sergeant salary is about 99,000 including all the benefits. When we only take actual salary that is about $29,380, divide this by 12 months and that equals around $2,448.33 per month, multiply this by the 2.4% it equals to around $58.75.  So that would mean they would earn around $2,507.08 which annually  would mean they would earn around $30,084.96 . It's not a lot but it is something.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you mention the 40 million in terms of the 1.4 trillion (again I can't find any source that equates that defense budget in annual basis) You only mention actual salary, not the benefits that they get as I explained in my first response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, obviously most of the budget goes to operations, the military by ideology does not have time to personally develop new guns and tech. They pay companies and arm dealers for both the manufacturing and the distribution of them obviously they are going to spend more. In fact the average soldier needs around 17k to equip. That includes training and equipment. Most of the arms and technology the military uses comes from U.S. located arm dealers. So even if you disagree with this you cannot ignore the fact that it is also possible that many of these companies and therefore their works will also lose their jobs when you plan to slash the entire budge by half.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again we can continue debating around individual program fundings but unless you give actual numbers with sources we cannot have a discussion of this topic.

       I do take into account benefits and salary in the 150 Billion figure you mentioned.  I'm fine with the 150 figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last year's "Defense" budget was about 600 Billion plus 200 Billion in "contingency" expenditures.  That's 800 billion.  So total pay and benefits for active duty and retired personal is still just 18 percent of the total budget by your numbers of 150.  But google Doctor Paul Craig Roberts, who was Ronald Reagan's Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.  Doctor Roberts and others calculate last year's actual spending on "Defense" to be about 1.2 Trillion.

       So you are basing the 1.3 trillion because someone who does not support it said it was and that it was obscured. I mean this is the conspiracy sub and all but can you cite the source in which he says that or how he calculated it?

       You've never heard of Doctor Paul Craig Roberts?  He's respected within conservative circles, and liberal ones.  I once posted a link to a YouTube video of Dr. Roberts in which he (and others) have listed 1.2 Trillion.  But even using your figure (which is our always honest government's figure) of 800 Billion last year, the 150 billion is still just 18 percent of 800 :-)

       I know who he is. But it is up to you to prove that 1.3 trillion is actually true or that he said it. This is the equivalent of just "Google it" as a good debate point. It falls to provide evidence to the person who said there was evidence.

       Okay buddy, this may be the link where Roberts mentions 1.2 Trillion for last year (1.3 Trillion this year), but I've watched lots of Paul Craig Roberts videos, so if it's not the specific video, you will have to search for yourself.  You say you've heard of Paul Craig Roberts, but anyone who is familiar with his serious, scholarly work, knows he has calculated the total to be 1.2 trillion.

       The country was set up by people who fully understood that government is a necessary evil which should never be trusted. The American people allowed a few key changes that fucked everything up. The Federal Reserve Act, Limiting the size of Congress instead of keeping it tied to the size of the population, creation of the federal income tax.
      </p>
      <p>
       These 3 things fucked us all. It allowed distant people who are always corrupt to take control of our local education, health, business, and money. They don't give a fuck about us and yet they control everything we do.

       It’s a vicious cycle. Everyone wants to be a part of something, a team, and a political party has the potential to get almost everyone in that line of reasoning. Sadly we only have a two party system, but I digress.

      <p>
       Shock and Awe news appeals to the older demographic while shock and awe cartoons appeals to the younger. This creates a fight-or-flight response in the psyche resulting in anxiety and fear. Simple as that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve been seeing the George Carlin quote a lot lately and that’s because it is true... the truth hurts and makes as sad and angry but that’s better than anxiety and fear.

       We have the power to overcome all of this BS, and it starts by realizing that we’re all in this together.

       Well, we just need a true implementation! Those other implementation were totally not true implementation!
       <br/>
       The implementation will be a true implementation when we have unlimited money coming from outside of the system, supporting our system!

       When it'll work, that'll be the true implementation.

       We still need to try, no matter the cost in human life.

       It's like, you're setting up this whole system, promising people "oh, we don't need anyone, we can totes just own the production, and then do everything!" and take over the welfare of everyone, and then fail, and then blame others for not giving you what you needed?
      </p>

       It's like they really really want to make the point that Communism and Socialism only work as long as you don't run out of other people's money.

       Capitalism doesn't fail even with communists around. Communists and socialists are killing Venezuela right now while claiming "not true communism" and "it's the fault of the capitalists". Reeeee

       It's our fucking fault, we let this happen, we did not demand truth or accountability of the people in powerful positions. 
George Carlin told us in no uncertain terms they do not care about us at all. What are we to expect in a system that rewards greed.

It's is not exceptional for nestle to steal water from Californians and then sell it back to them at inflated prices, that is simply greed. Nothing exceptional about it.

       You're right, but the only options aren't 100% capitalism or full communism. We don't have to limit ourselves to the extremes of those two economic systems; likewise, every criticism of capitalism doesn't have to be taken as a push to reinstate the gulags.

       If you're going to see the best doctor in the world, do you care if he does it for virtue, or he does it because he is greedy and wants the best pay? It doesn't matter. His "greed" is not a negative, it makes him better at what he does. That's how capitalism works. You will never find the best doctors or anything in a system that doesn't reward exceptionalism, whether they are motivated by greed or not is irrelevant and unimportant.

       Doctor is a cherry-picked example. This doesn't apply to positions like mortgage brokers who hike unfair interest rates and push for defaults, oil companies who damage the environment for financial gain, lawyers who represent criminals for the right price, the list goes on. Greed is constantly rewarded in our society, which is why so many corporations remain profitable despite being harmful to the public. Greed constantly pushes people to cut corners and hurt others for financial gain

       Nobody is saying that. However, you're out of your mind if you think the wealth is distributed fairly. I don't mean evenly, I mean fairly. As in, people  making the amount of money they deserve, for the jobs they've done or do in life for the betterment of society or by contributing their community. People work their asses off their entire lives to just get by, while those born into wealth hoard money and kick shit downhill.  Yes, you can still occasionally work your way up, but for most people, the logistics of it just don't allow for that.

       ... thats exactly how it gets distributed? if you are working 60 hours a week at a cash register, great you provided a service (i guess), but the job is valueless. if you are doing something harder (in terms of who can do the job, not how many hrs you stand there), you get paid more

       people are mostly idiots and stay stuck in this trap because they are either too stupid or lazy (or both) to get out of it. there are more opportunities now than ever before to improve your life... hell you can make a million $ a year playing video games online from your house. my best friend went to a public state university but spent the summers doing internships and getting top grades and 4 years after graduating makes 200k+/yr even though he works 60-70 hrs a week. and the fact being in the military pays for your college...
      </p>
      <p>
       if youre poor, or stuck living month to month, its almost always because the choices you made. maybe now theres less ways to escape that, but thats because you have to live with the choices you make

       I understand your frustration, but it's hardly our fault. If you research the history of America the rich have been holding the hand of our government since it's inception hundreds of years ago.
       <br/>
       I didn't choose when to be born, neither did you. And I for sure wouldn't have chosen to be born into this system that was already fucked and put in place.
       <br/>
       Yes I know that we can change it. But unless we have revolts greater than what happened in the 1800's and early 1900's nothing will change (and lots of people were killed by the government for them).
Any child born in the U.S. today adopts over 20 trillion of debts, the majority of the money that created that debt was used to push our imperialism across the globe, and at the same time make a few families filthy rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the internet can be used as a catalyst for change. Imagine if enough people online put their heads together to try to come up with a new system that benefits everyone. What would be the culmination of such power? Instead of a few people in a room out of everyone's sight coming up with how to be in charge and run everything. People could rally together to try to come up with a new way things should be run, and other people could point out flaws brought up. I don't feel qualified for this myself, but if Think Tank companies exist, then the internet itself is the closest thing we have to a global consciousness (or a brain).
       <br/>
       How do we create a system that benefits everyone without creating poverty and despair?
       <br/>
       Maybe the good old Problem, Reaction, Solution method that the elite are so keen on using can be used upon them as well.
       <br/>
       And the first step is coming up with a Solution. Then we point out the Problem, and use the Reaction to introduce the change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, I went on a rant. It's not our fault personally, it's the inherent greed of mankind.

       The solution is simple actually 
Feed the masses, decentralized free produce that supermarkets, distributors and producers are required to provide for free, vegetables, rice, corn, milk, ect. 
Secondly a new law, no one can be evicted from their primary residence. 
And clean free transportation for all and move away from cars and put gardens where the parking lots were. 
I know your asking how will we pay for this? Simple, decrease military spending and all the money necessary will be available. 
Once people are less easily exploitable then society will balance itself out. Inequality is the result of the masses being easily exploited. Since all of us need food, shelter and transportation and we are easily exploitable if the threat of these things are taken away a society where these basic needs are provided the masses will be less exploitable and in turn the inequality we experience will be reduced.

       Well, it's helpful when two wars don't decimate your countryside.  It's also helpful when the gold standard expires and the entire world chooses your currency as their reserve currency.  It's also helpful to have absurd amounts of resources within your geography and neighboring countries that are stable and friendly.

       Name one European, North or South American country that still had slavery in the 1860s if you want to validate your point. The industrial revolution, universal grade school education, and all that stuff started in Europe. You still don't have universal health care.

       Let’s do that. Let’s discuss how being allies and sharing a border with the worlds largest superpower affords you to luxury of having a virtually nonexistent military which you can then use the tax dollar savings to buy sup par healthcare.
      </p>

       Furthermore let’s discuss how Canadian price controls in the medical sector have no market basis and are subsidized by rate hikes to US citizens.

       Sharing a border with the largest superpower is precisely why we need our small but efficient military. It may not be that large but there is a militia unit in every town and we have a high rate of gun ownership. Since you couldn't beat Vietnamese peasants or Afghan mountain men. It's enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quality of healthcare is measured by outcomes. Ours are better than yours, and US citizens permanently residing in Canada have equal access to it.  Even North Korea which spends almost as much per capita on their military as Americans have universal health care. It has nothing to do with American subsidies.

       I didn't call you a liar yet. I gave you  chance to go to wikipedia or use a search engine and admit that your boast was wrong. Now you should be embarrassed because if you made a boast based on a lie and can't admit it so you make up more lies and stupid boasts.

       we got meritocratic system proposed here in romania proposed by laurentiu primo.it s basically about instead of letting polliticians run our country we choose the highest intelectual persons and not at least patriotic having also a high annual salary coosed by the vast majority of romanian people.and that s how the level of prosperity could go to roof and ofc cut the middleman(politician)who just sucks out of people s money.too bad we don t seem to have anymore a patriotic conciousness as a nation.but faith always remains.

       If by fault you mean not fighting back, think just what fighting back means in this day and age, it means you're a terrorist. And by the new laws, terrorist don't have the same rights as "law abiding citizens", always remember that.

       Voting with your money could work if;
1. You really have options (beyond duopolies that suspiciously share board members) and 2. You have enough resources to be able to choose those options. (It doesn't help that people who are getting paid progressively less have to pick between say indie at $10 or corporate at $5.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree that this might at least bring some balance. I wish I could share your optimism, hope you/your generation manage to bring some good changes.

       Capitalism is owning the products of your own labor as opposed to having it stolen and given to someone else. If anything we need to be geared more towards capitalism as opposed to the more socialist nonsense we currently participate in.

       You realize that the last time we had a democratic socialist in office, he was elected 4 times and is the reason term limits were implemented. Products of labor shouldn't be "stolen," but a minor redistribution to those in need also shouldn't be considered the end of the world.

       We're not nazis, survived the cold war right? Segregation, ...i mean the list goes on and on. The fact that you can drive a car without being blown up by a terrorist is proof. But the fact is nothing is perfect and always will have room for improvement or be destroyed time and time again but se will be here. Life a bitch but we all can male.it work somehow.

       Thank you man. I kindly dissagree though with us and Germany. Actually the US is like Germany in the 30s&amp;40  minus the holocaust ,ww2. But during the 30s and 40s Germany was a country ripe with a bright economical future after they bounced back from a horrible depression. Hell our own President had a picture of Hitler on his desk in the White House. Now, to differentiate us from Nazi global domination is that we fear global extinction. No one is fooled by proxy wars etc. Its all a game to be the most Dominant. Its in our nature.

       Well we all are doomed to die one day so yes you're correct on our demise. A genuine person is just hard to name off since we all are going on different paths. Like a genuine cop has to act and do things you might not categorize as genuine of a person. Get my drift?

       The real truth is none of us would really be any different if we were in similar positions of power.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very easy to sit as an outsider and say "Not me". However, in my country after the austerity imposed by the EU, we elected a large number of political outsiders. All of them went in on the "we'll break corruption", "we won't accept bribes". In the last 5 years all of them have been caught accepting bribes, meeting with lobbyists then backing their motions in the houses of parliament. They've all been caught paying their families to work for them, lying on their expense claims and generally being like every other politician who's ever lived.
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll never have a fair government as long as people are in control of politics. In fact, the only way I can ever see it happening is if we create an artificial intelligence who's only goal is to create monetary equality for all citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       So get used to it. It's never going to change.

       The only way I see it working is if we can take enough power away from government that it seriously limits the amount of power they have. An AI to become a benevolent dictator would be amazing if we could guarantee that it would always operate in our favor.

       Then you need to go back to classical American Republicanism and start demanding republicans adhere to the original values of the party or GTFO. The democrats aren't going to help you here as their mandate is more government spending and more government power to provide social benefits and their enforcement (welfare etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Old Republican mandates were both limited government spending and power, specifically to combat the kind of abuse we see today.

       We see it plain as day. Yet we squabble about who was bright and who was wrong in the last election. This election should have woken people up about our Democracy process, instead it emboldened idiots and drove those wanting real change politically just a little farther away. Unless something fundamentally changes, This is the downward slide folks....hang on, it's going to get bumpy.

       It all started in the reconstruction Era. Mega industry leaders like Vanderbilt, Morgan, Carnegie, etc basically bought their way into complete control of industry and legislation. They eventually got pruned out around the time of the first major stock market crash but that was just a practice run. After world War 2, the defense industry was booming, they had the perfect villain to roll out, and they had people's buy in on their purpose. Thus started a 70 year plus control on legislation. In the 70s and 80s, the oil companies and big banks and pharmaceutical companies found their little slices thanks to Reaganomics. Since then, there's been an almost uninhibited run on corporate control of congress and media.

       imo it's a good way to get a feel of the general publics vibe just from the comments in the
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       subs, since reddit is so widely used by so many people, mostly in the US. I've been seeing a lot more within the last year, a slow and gradual realization of what's really going on behind the scenes, the true ugly underbelly of this country in the comments, and I don't even have to filter by controversial to see them, they're typically the highest rated comments in the threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       so it's interesting to see that, it's going to take so many years still, but it's beginning to happen, a change.

       That's not true. They can and they are doing it in secret. They work tirelessly to ensure their plans come to fruition. The problem is you can't do it by brute force. This is what they have learned over the last two millennia. You need to do it over time. Erode people. Every step they take is designed to slowly degrade the quality of the humans in the general public with the purpose of reaching a divide so great there is only the Nobility and the Workers. They want the workers so completely oblivious to the fact this is happening that they won't even need to try and hide what they are doing. The Workers will just accept "that's how it is".
      </p>
      <p>
       Another protip: we've already just about reached that point.

       The problem with all of it is that they lobbyists and major corporations have made it impossible to live without them. Without their money or influence, they will never win an election. When you hear former politicians who tried to go without their money, they all tell the same story, you go in to politics hellbent on changing things, then you get to Washington and the lobbyist wheels grind you down until you cave. Once that happens, you realize that you sold out and give up your cause or get caught up in the craziness of the life.

       It's frustrating when you know how bad things really are, and yet everyone is acting like things are great,and worse yet, defending the status quo. You understand how fucked the status quo is, so it says a lot about the person who defends it.

Black water at the gates of heaven.

       The elite and their bought and paid for politicians want a  return to Roman Times where the wealthy were the only "free" men and the rest were slaves to used as they wish.  Couple this with Advanced AI and agile robotics, they will want to eliminate most of us so they can have the Earth return to a green and blue paradise with only a few(500 million to a billion or so) of the them getting to enjoy it.  They will want to keep a small % of us for their amusements and are actively working towards this end.
      </p>
      <p>
       The degradation of the environment will be the window of chance for the masses to strike a fatal blow to the elite.  When they have to retreat to their underground cities to ride out the enirvonmental calalmity on the surface is when the masses who are left to the horrors will need to find those underground cities and destroy them.  It won't save us but it will make sure the elite go down/our with the rest of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       The USA was special but we got complacent and I fear it is not fixable due to the Citizens' United ruling.  It will make it impossible to fix our system as the amount of money flowing in is too much.

       I agree with your sentiments, and expect the same dark future awaiting us, given our chosen path as a nation. We are witnessing power consolidation, instead of additional checks and balances to protect the average citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of the environment being destroyed, causing a Punisher-esque scenario in infiltrating the bunkers and cleaning house (enjoyable as that would be), I expect the US will see the continued rise of a covert neurofeedback network, that is being harnessed to cause widespread confusion among political dissidents, by manufacturing precisely targeted auditory illusions. They are turning neighbors/citizens and otherwise likely allies against each other with vile illusions that impersonate the other, leading to rifts in society where none should reasonably be.
       <br/>
       The average citizen predictably reacts with assuptions of mental illness toward their neighbors, and are extremely resistant to consider any other source, due to dismissive portrayals in entertainment creating a stigma -- most people cannot differentiate between "Saul's brother getting psychosomatic relief with mylar" and the hard science of industry-proven electromagnetic shielded enclosures and rooms -- they are recklessly assumed to be the same.
       <br/>
       There needs to be a culture shift towards accepting the efficacy of electromagnetic shielding, instead of casting it off as a hallmark of mental illness. I've created subreddits with information intended to aid and protect those that are being targeted with such technologies, and have mustered the courage to walk past the 'lol tinfoil' imbeciles towards a real solution that's proven to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       I caucused for Bernie in 2016, and ended up shredding my ballot because I would not vote for a red/blue-flavored oligarch. I only respect Trump for one reason -- he defeated the Clinton foundation political machine. All the clothespins in the world couldn't get me to vote for Hillary, and the DNC denying Bernie and throwing the election to Trump should never be forgiven or forgotten.

       By your defintion of roman times we are already there, but instead of being the so called "amusements" we are the robots of now, slaving away to provide those with the original ideas or the sociopathic traits to take those ideas for themselves. The only difference now is perspective, limited not by law of the people but of the law of cold hard cash...

       True words. And these things happening not just in the US, most likely in most of the western capitalism hemisphere. Not necessarily means it not happens in the rest of the world. Just differently. Since a century the center of the evil is clearly in the US corporation who strongly defends its layer of treasures (literally).

       Yes. In my view, we reached a point in history where there is a light for humanity... We have the possibility to change something, and non spiritually I think there is a change going on. Not just because of Trump or something, but behind the curtains some of the puppet masters are in fear. Short while ago, a huge asset of the Rothschild in Austria was sold. They need liquidity. Seems like the money printing out of thin air is over, they touched the hard assets and this means something. So, in 10 years retrospective we'll shake our heads and tell these storys our children and spook them with this fairytals of the evil people who created wars for wealth, created decease to treat them halfway, plant poison in food and so on and on...

       While I am kind of serious, I did not intend to slander the OP. Its just the same rhetoric that the trump voters spouted before electing him, so I targeted them with it.

       Yea, except trump wasn’t a politician. That’s why I voted for him. I voted for someone to stir shit up. At the time I didn’t care if it was good change or bad, ANY change was better than electing another politician.

       ive lived with this shit all my life. I knew what trump would be and that russia would control him the moment i heard of him being a candidate. when you are familliar with russian schemes 1st hand, its SO OBVIOUS.Even my prime minister is also an "anti-regime" "successful businessman" "white male" "family man", who also happens to have "shady ties to russia" and his laws have nothing to do with the well-being of the people of my country. Rings a bell?

       Anyway, I never expected any deep thinking from a trump voter anyway, else they wouldnt be trump voters, right? But seriously, no offence, im sure you are quick to call conspiracy theory on the dems but have the guts to admit that youve been played by the russian propoganda and cyberwar espionage machine and learn from mistakes.

       And of course I wouldn’t be arguing with a liberal until I was insulted for being a trump supporter. Guess what, I hate the republicans equally. Both sides of the same coin, but you refuse to see the corruption going on on the left side (based on leaked emails), while clearly brainwashed to the propaganda their spewing.

       Do I think Russians meddled in our election? Yes, it’s very possible. And we have clear evidence of that with uranium one. I’m willing to bet uranium one is just fake news to you right? Yet you sit there peddling trump Russia with not much to go on. How’s the mueller investigation going?

       I've been actually up to date with almost everything, and I am sure that in due time trump will get what is coming to him. The leaked emails corruption scale is like a toothpick to an elephant when you compare it to trump. Like, you should read up yourself on how he got his casinos running, American mob, about his trips to USSR, and many many more, Someoen is writing a book on it if I'm not mistaken.

       Despite being humanly incapable of proofing it, I am still 99% sure that is the case. As I said, I have lived my entire life in an eastern post-soviet country, with a clear, but officially hidden, just like in the US now, Russian presence in our government. Trump is a classic Russian patsy, as I said, just like our current prime minister, we had a president like this, and many more high profile polititians. Once you've seen it so many times, you can't mistake it.

       I believe there’s a Russian presence too, just not where you think. Why aren’t people talking about uranium one deal? How one of the presidential candidates received money via a foundation the sale of us uranium. Where are the investigations regarding that?

       I'm not denying that russian presence could reach as far as the clintons, though. There were intelligence statements about the russians having "intel on clintons", that was unrelated with emails and not otherwise released into the world. So i guess that must be it, and russians are holding it to blackmail the clintons too, if they ever come to power, like the ycan blackmail trump. you'd be seriously naiive if you think that the russians cant ruin trumps whole empire with one phone call.

       I’m sure anyone that was looking had access to information on Clinton considering she used an unsecured private server. Wasn’t Pakistan getting information from her IT aide? How much shit was found on Anthony wieners laptop. There’s information everywhere.

       You’re arguing that Russians having intel on Clinton equates to Russia can blackmail trump. You do realize how silly that sounds right.

       Thats not what im saying at all. Russians being able to blackmail trump (trump loundering money and colluding woth russia, some alleged mass ogry trump sextape and many more lol), and russians having extra secret info on clintons are 2 separate cases.
 What im saying is that russian reach is simply greater than just trump or just clintons, its both of them at once.

       Uranium one covers Clinton. Yet you can’t provide anything that covers trump. Mass orgies?! Bringing up the democratic opposition research known as the dossier where money exchanged many hands, including Russians, to prove trump can be blackmailed shows the level of brainwashing you’ve gone through. You’re far gone my friend.

      <p>
       In the US there are people who profit off of war. Cold War 2 might not have been started by Russians, but more likely the deep state. Hell, their candidate wanted a no fly zone in Syria, a Russian allied territory. I don’t need to remind you of Putin’s response do I?

       Youre getting me convinced of one thing, thatcyou are on the russias side of all this. Which means one of these two: 1. Youre delusional and have no idea what youre talking about. 2. It is your job, paid for by russians, to intentionally spread misinformation.
Like, either way im done replying to you. Anyone with a sane mind will have read the comments and decided their poaition for themselves. And no, the USA does NOT do these things mentioned in the nato list.

       And your so brainwashed dude. It was fun talking to you. It only confirms that all you people have are talking points. Russia bad Russia do this Russia do that. Yet when I ask for proof, I get these bullshit links that claim it’s possible and that’s it’s likely and that if it’s true we’re fucked, but always fails to share anything that would be considered evidence. I’m don’t deal with feelings I deal with data. Data is consistent. people like to lie.

       The only way for us to change this would be to spill the blood of these politicians and elites that believe themselves to be above the laws and reverence of the common man. 'Bloodletting' will subdue their advances and might even enact change. It must be strategic in conceptualization and tactical in execution. The most heinous of offenders must be brought forth in front of the people and judged.

       There is a systemic, institutional solution to a world ravaged by greed - limit what can be gained by being a psychopathic fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's at least as stupid and as much of a crime against humanity for human society to recognize, let alone protect, the extreme hoarding of socially protected property rights beyond $100 million as it was for humanity to recognize and protect the ownership of slaves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism + limits on extreme resource hoarding is a better system, in the same way that capitalism minus slavery was an improvement.

       Yeah, they're both evil. One's a bit lesser evil. Pretty sure if a Democrat had won we'd still have net neutrality, there wouldn't be fucking tax breaks specifically for people who own golf resorts, we'd still be viewed as the leaders of NATO and the free world, the president wouldn't be tweeting about his bigger nuclear button to another nuclear power, etc, etc.

       Jp Morgan and the bankers in 1912 made it this way,  easier to pay off politicians when there is only a few hundred.
      </p>
      <p>
       1910 was the last time the census moderated the seats in the house of representatives
      </p>
      <p>
       We should have 5 or 6 digits worth of representatives... but the corporate elite stopped that.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can corporations pay off 50,000 politicians?  How would we vote like that? Back then you couldn't... and that was the excuse
      </p>
      <p>
       With the digital age we should have this.  But the corporations and politicians like their arrangement.

Business man will drive his friend into the ground and say nothing personal just business the friend will have to fight bach and drive the buisness man into the ground to make it. UNSUSTAINABLE!!!

       It's natural for this to happen with a monopolized governance system. Jefferson suggested a need for a revolution every generation. Capitalist markets have proven to be the best checks and balance to fight corruption, we need to find a way to provide governance options in a competitive market fashion. In this way, such revolutions we be as natural as boycotting corporations we disagree with.

       Look, politics is a game. A game that has been being played before America was founded, and will continue when America is gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you understand this it’s very easy to just stop paying attention. The politicians are never gonna let the game end, this is key in allowing yourself to not give a fuck about politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       People say if you stop paying attention the politicians will go crazy with power and ultimately fuck the average American but aren’t we basically already at that point? Politicians are being held to such low standards that morals and values are a thing of the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       The politicians are only gonna allow the spectrum to swing so far before they switch the direction of the pendulum, they’re never going to allow the pendulum to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, once we understand the ultimate goal of a politician is to make sure politics don’t die, we realize that the issues the politicians are spewing aren’t going to be the end of the world. Even tho they have the power of law, they will not let that power destroy their game, and as long as the game is played they get paid.  Which is why you see certain politicians being outted, not because they’re harassing interns/any woman they please, because they’re a determent to the game they’re playing.
      </p>

       Once I realized this it was very easy for me to not give a fuck about what they say or do cause it’s all going to stay within the parameters of the game. And this game is cooperation v government. 
Imo it’s easiest to just not focus on politics but be aware of bills and laws being passed, hit the local parties so at least you have a strong bond with your local community, but wording yourself about politics as a whole is a waste of time imo.

       I don't think we can peacefully recover from this. I've debated back and forth with a conspiratorial minded friend of mine for a while. I thought we could recover from this for a while now, however, I think we're past the point of no return.
      </p>
      <p>
       Facts don't matter anymore. Truth is based on how you feel about an issue. No one respects data, or science, or reality. Its my team vs your team. There still people who believe Obama was a godsend and fixed everything, and still people who believe Trump is honest and not a completely self-absorbed narcissist f****** this country for his own benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Journalism was a tool of the people who don't have time to investigate every issue. The Common working man does not have time to analyze all the data necessary to find the truth about our elected representatives. With faith and journalism at all-time lows, I don't see how we can ever recover from this. The elites will continue robbing us until we reach the point of bloody revolt

       that was the smartest thing you said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, it is the tip of the iceberg.
      </p>
      <p>
       when it comes to politics, you have to realize all media has a bias. People are just starting to realize the CNNs of the world arent news, they are mind control machines, leftist propaganda, no different than PRAVDA or TASS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comment about Trump is a perfect example.  WHY do you think he is f*ing the country for his own benefit? WHAT benefit? He was already a 70 year old billionaire and TV show star. Taking on the thankless job of having media attack him with daily smears was a step DOWN in so many ways...but the media wont tell you that...so people like you dont realize that you subsconsciously have been trained to hate him. Wont argue the narcissism though, any person with his history is likely to have an exaggerated sense of self-importance, and it is historically his hallmark trait - but notice how you have been conditioned to apply that as confirmation bias to your disdain for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to the OP post - I think we can recover if:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         everyone realizes that ALL media is propaganda on some level, and a lazy and effortless view of "news", or even entertainment in general, and you will be silently programmed whether you like it or not. Be AWARE in consumption of all media, assess underlying motives, facts, and evidences with an open mind and a true sense of the bias of the publisher/broadcaster.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         agree with some comments about taking the money out of politics. Not sure the best route to achieve it, but essential. The profit motives corrupt everything hopelessly.  There are some situations where a profit motive cannot be attached to the process. Like the criminal justice system. Like the military and national defense. And like politics in general.

       I dont know, and Im not sure that is an accurate statistic. Do you have a statistical reference for that which can confirm his 100%? If not, is there a % that you feel it is up to you, your highness, to allow him?  Because clearly it is your job to decide on that.

      <p>
       No idea, and why does it matter in any sane universe?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know Trump hate is irrational, and the media has literally created an army of you blind haters with its 24/7 drip feed, but get ahold of yourself. You are literally turning the most mundane issues into attack points.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was an Obama supporter.  I can tell you with zero hesitation that if he OWNED any golf properties, if as an attack talking point someone asked me why he spent 75% of his at his own, I would immediately assume that person to be insane.  It just isnt even a rational question.  This is how delusional you people have become.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the saddest part is you cant bring yourself to wake up.  You just keep swallowing each new confirmation bias hate article out of the media.

      <p>
       Quite sad.

       whats horrifying is that you even ask that question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would that question have been asked of an Obama supporter?  A Bill Clinton supporter?  A Jimmy Carter supporter? Why or why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       The question shouldnt be one of "turning against" him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is human. He has made mistakes, even in the presidency, he will make more, undoubtedly. He has made decisions I didnt agree with, Im sure he will again.  Is that what you are asking?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please define "turn against"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Will I blindly swallow the media propaganda about him being somehow the root of all evil? A nazi, a racist, a sexual predator, a clown, mentally unfit, a con man, a xenophobe, heartless, a dictator...the list is nearly endless.  The media makes up new ones daily - and publishes them gleefully in massive headlines.

       Trump is the greatest president in modern history, one of the greats of all time, and that includes the founding fathers.

      <p>
       Anyone who hasnt yet realized is either on the payroll of the leftist media and democrat/entrenched swamp machine or remains asleep in the matrix they have created, the alternate reality where Trump really is all those vile things, even though in 30 years in the public eye as a billionaire and TV star he was well liked and never accused of any of that.

       Can you answer the question? Let me give you some launch points.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if Trump admitted to using his position to personally profit?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if he plead guilty to campaign finance fraud?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you still think he was the greatest president ever if he confessed to beating Melania in the White House?
      </p>
      <p>
       If a Republican controlled congress impeaches him for appointing his friends in exchange for money?
      </p>
      <p>
       Come on. Put down the koolaid and really think. He's a year into his presidency and you're calling him the greatest ever. That's fucking insane.

       you list of the fever dreams of a liberal puppet who has been indoctrinated without realizing it by the Trump hate media's 24/7 drip feed, and yet you tell me to put down the kool aid?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, would you have any of these fantasies about Obama? About Bill Clinton? About Bush?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only one of these that is remotely possible is the congressional impeachment.  The reality is not what most people think. The presidents TRUE allies in the congress are a tiny minority (call them Trump Republicans).
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of congress are establishment dirtbags, and R or D dont matter. They hate Trump, and they look out for themselves and their donors and special interests.  Trump has managed to drag them along with him (barely) on a few things, like tax cuts, where his agenda matches their own, but the
       <strong>
        REALITY
       </strong>
       is that for the most part the congres HATES HIM for exposing their actual business model, and if Mueller delivered what he is supposed to, which is ANY impeachment excuse that would give them cover with the American people, I think they WOULD impeach him.  And it could be ANY excuse from Mueller.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I have written for months now that Trump will undergo all these leftist narrative land mines up until the 2018 elections, and at that point the establishment left's time is up. If the American people do not give the establishment a majority, they cant impeach/remove, so that game will be over.  But it isnt a matter of R or D. Its a matter of establishment or unknown vs vocally and demonstrably Trump ally. Again, so far, his side, which is the american peoples side, has a tiny minority. Will the public change it in the midterms?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats up to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, keep having your libporn fantasies.

       Can it be fixed, repaired, rehabilitated?
I don't mean to sound un-American, but if something similar to what happened to Japan and Germany after losing WW2 happened to us.... Well it would be horrible and probably lots of lost lives...  But maybe America could be reborn.

       So why do so few of you vote for a third ticket like Stein-Baraka and say it would waste your vote? That's the vote that will be noticed and maybe move you away from a two-party duopoly.

       The smartest thing conservatives ever did was convince a large portion of society that liberals are equally as bad as them.
      </p>

       None of us have experienced an adminstration as fucking pathetic as Trump and yet we STILL have people playing the "both sides suck! can't blame me for picking Trump! Bernie 2020!" bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I caution everyone who joins in with their disinformation bullshit to be aware that these are the same tactics used to get Trump elected the first time and they will do it again.

       But honestly, this country is in a problem. It is not living up to its ideals and I think it is only going to get worse. I am seriously considering moving to a South American country.

       There were dozens of options besides Trump and Hillary and neither of the other options got even 5% of the vote. I was thoroughly disappointed and surprised. So it is really the voters wish. It is not like it was a secret that there were more options.

       It's a nice short read and uses simple language to detail a framework called selectorate theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory describes politicians as a function of the "winning coalition" or minimum number of people needed to get and keep power and subsequently describes all their actions in terms of how they can accomplish that singular goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example it describes most idealistic politics (e.g. abortions, religion, guns, voter ID laws, immigration) as boiling down to being a means of creating a winning coalition from a given slice of the population so they can get elected.

       The biggest cause of this situation are people being in love with ideologies that harm them.
      </p>
      <p>
       What has conservatism really done for the average rural farmer in the last 40 years?
      </p>
      <p>
       What has liberalism really done for the average city dweller in the last 40 years?
      </p>
      <p>
       People are voting for fantasies pushed by politicians that do the bare minimum necessary to maintain the fantasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why some of us celebrate conservative tax cuts for corporations that actually harm or don't help individuals or provide jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why some of us celebrate mostly-marketing social programs like Obama Care which really didn't do much for many. Those who couldn't afford it got fined. Those who needed critical care were still bankrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too many people listen to what these politicians say and don't watch what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are in a cycle of Democrats standing up a bunch of straw men and Republicans tearing them down in dramatic fashion. Meanwhile, the military budget climbs, consumer protection falls, the financial and infrastructure health of the masses declines, and very little progress is made for the majority of citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR
       </strong>
       People are ignorant and stupid on both the left and the right, sometimes willfully so. Doesn't matter if it's a conspiracy to keep the population dumb or down. The population
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       dumb and down. Now what?

       I agree, the whole system needs a purge. But, short of a purge, DJT is the closest thing we have to a guy who really wants to make things better in America. We came close to the brink of absolute destruction of the USA from the inside with terrorist Obama. Had Hillary won, we would be annihilated by now, or very soon.

       In this non-perfect world, we all have to support Trump to help him drain the swamp. The Trump hammer is the closest thing the People have to swinging our own fists in that swamp.

       Agree and I think this is true for all democracies, oligarchies etc. Politicians tend to be the worst among us in general. I think it reflects upon the psyche of the masses that we think that humans with sociopathic tendencies are better than us. I think it’s because the majority of us are inherently insecure, greedy, lustful, jealous etc. In our Indian philosophy these are all tamasik tendencies. My opinion is that our food, lifestyle, and alienation from a higher awareness, god, whatever causes these tendencies. What we need is a mass awareness and willingness to seek yoga (joining) with a greater consciousness. When society is satvik, or at least rajasik, we will elect better politicians to govern for us. Currently our social idols are pornstars, violent athletes, and immoral celebrities. Any outsider looking at us will not find it very hard to grasp why we have such shitty leaders.

       The problem is that wages and earnings are so low or moderate that many people have to work 2 jobs or side jobs just to make it. Therefore people don't have the time to discuss and deal with important topics confronting us. People are also distracted by sports and culture television just like was used by the emporer in Rome with the Roman circus.  On tops of all that the education system is used to produce worker bees and get us all in a fine tuned box instead if promoting individuality and creativity. Then the 2 political parties divide us further by highlighted issues that really don't matter as much, we need systematic change not to refuse to join or dint even talk to each other due to things like immigration,  abortion,  2nd amendment,  etc etc etc..... we need to realize we must join together to fight against the elite power elements in this world, we have the numbers and joining to together is our best chance and their worst fear that's why they do everything to prevent it,  don't let them!!!!!! Stand together and wake the f*** up!!

       I'll post what I commented in the thread about the lady being dragged out of that hearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't people mad enough yet to hold these people accountable? This isn't the first article I've read about someone being dragged out of a hearing because what they are saying uncovers just how shitty our system is. How can the people be heard if politicians can just gag and remove whoever dare speak against them? It's greed, pure and simple.

       And who's fucking fault is it ? It's your own damn fucking fault, you can't expect politicans to solve all your problems. Throughout history the only time when things actually Get done is when the people get organized and do something about it. Kids would still be working long hours in factories if it wasn't for a couple of people who said this isn't right, let's give them a Chance at life

       It's got a name. That name is neoliberalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have all been told it hundreds, if not thousands of times.
      </p>
      <p>
       But half of you have equated it to "socialism", or "liberals" or some other corrupted term.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the world is not equitable. Yes, there are winners and losers in everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the "American dream" that everyone can make themselves what they want through hard work is an illusion pushed by those who do have the initial capital to make themselves richer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regulation is a MUST. In it's simplest form, unchecked capitalism breeds oligopolies and monopolies in every industry. It is trading the European royalty we escaped from, to serfdom under a new royalty: the capitalist elite. It leads to boom and bust cycle, due to the over accumulation of capital by a very small population.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a "red", but the third way, the fine balance between capitalist freedom and social democratic regulation is the world we knew for only a brief time between WW2 and to just after Vietnam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keynesian economics, with a healthy dose of free market principles is the way forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       Globalisation only makes rich richer, poor slightly better off, and the middle class destitute. Protectionist economics protects us, the middle. Therefore, regulation is vital.
      </p>
      <p>
       To end my rant: prove me wrong by naming a single economic collapse since 1946 which wasn't helped (or exacerbated) by lack of government intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
       And economics is 100% at the heart of all politics.

       You know, as a european I've always wondered about this:
      </p>
      <p>
       With your government system being so bad and everyone (I hope) being aware of it, why does everyone just suck up and take it? Is it really that hard to rally people to petition for a reform to how the elections are done? I don't mean rioting (if it's not necessary), just petition or putting your activism where it counts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many societal problems in the US to me seem to be the direct result of the people completely unable to voice their discontent. No politician truly represents them as the choice is marginal at best, there are no labour unions, nobody to change education or healthcare costs. Frankly, your quality of life has been decreasing for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it going to continue until the majority of the people are literally starving or are you actually going to do anything about it now?

       This thread was gold, glad to see there are some of us that still care enough to be outraged. I’ve had conversations where we were discussing the the corrupt elite and there’s always this answer that drives me mad “yeah so what, not like we can do anything about it” accompanied by a ¯_(ツ)_/¯. It’s exhausting.

       Well, we just need a true implementation! Those other implementation were totally not true implementation!
       <br/>
       The implementation will be a true implementation when we have unlimited money coming from outside of the system, supporting our system!
       <br/>
       When it'll work, that'll be the true implementation.
       <br/>
       We still need to try, no matter the cost in human life.
       <br/>
       Sure, the previous not our implementation might have killed more than 100 million people, but those wheren't true implementations!

       Let's say we have a typical GOP candidate, Greg Gregson, vs. a typical DNC candidate...  Don Donson.  Greg is for 2nd amendment protection, traditional beliefs, anti-abortion, smaller government and lower taxes.  Don is for gun control, gay rights, pro-choice, better societal structures and safety nets, and higher taxes to pay for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex is a gun loving gay man who thinks school should be free but welfare is out of control.  Who the fuck does he vote for?

       I see you live in Canada and want to talk about socialized medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s do that. Let’s discuss how being allies and sharing a border with the worlds largest superpower affords you to luxury of having a virtually nonexistent military which you can then use the tax dollar savings to buy sup par healthcare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore let’s discuss how Canadian price controls in the medical sector have no market basis and are subsidized by rate hikes to US citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s discuss how there are months long waiting lists for fundamental and sometime life saving procedures.

       Next time you try and hold your head up high do yourself a favor and salute those who actually provide for you.

       ive lived with this shit all my life. I knew what trump would be and that russia would control him the moment i heard of him being a candidate. when you are familliar with russian schemes 1st hand, its SO OBVIOUS.Even my prime minister is also an "anti-regime" "successful businessman" "white male" "family man", who also happens to have "shady ties to russia" and his laws have nothing to do with the well-being of the people of my country. Rings a bell?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I never expected any deep thinking from a trump voter anyway, else they wouldnt be trump voters, right? But seriously, no offence, im sure you are quick to call conspiracy theory on the dems but have the guts to admit that youve been played by the russian propoganda and cyberwar espionage machine and learn from mistakes.

       I'm not denying that russian presence could reach as far as the clintons, though. There were intelligence statements about the russians having "intel on clintons", that was unrelated with emails and not otherwise released into the world. So i guess that must be it, and russians are holding it to blackmail the clintons too, if they ever come to power, like the ycan blackmail trump. you'd be seriously naiive if you think that the russians cant ruin trumps whole empire with one phone call.

       He has never denied Russian deals with Russian citizens, only denying Russian

       deals. It’s more likely you’re taking this “lie” out of context. Unless of course, you can prove me wrong again.
