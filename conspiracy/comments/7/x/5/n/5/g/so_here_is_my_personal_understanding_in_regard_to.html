        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My website is <a href="http://www.normalizeascension.com">http://www.normalizeascension.com</a></p>

<p>I wrote this blog series in January. It is a summary of information that I have gathered over the last three years during my own quest for certain truths regarding Spirit and Reality (both quite connected). I am to share this information. I guess you could say it is my &#39;calling&#39;. 
This website will be under construction for a few more weeks but I felt it was time to share the information in the blog series with anyone willing to take time to read it. 
I will be traveling to Peru in March to study and receive initiations with Andean Shamans from the Q&#39;ero community to begin my journey as a shaman practitioner here in the states. Energy medicine and holistic methods are making their way into our culture and their benefits are numerous.<br/>
Humanity is on the verge of The Great Awakening. 
This blog series and website were created to share and aid anyone who may be curious about spirituality and/or having their own type of awakening experiences. 
There is quite a lot going on in the world now, especially in our country. There is an incredible amount of dishonesty being peddled to the American public because certain hidden truths are being brought to light. 
This time we are in may seem chaotic and even frightening to some, but great change is necessary in the bigger scheme of human evolution. 
If you are in my generation, I assure you that you will witness events beyond words. If you are in the baby boomer generation or thereabouts, I&#39;m quite certain that your retirement years will be more than remarkable. 
I predict that certain changes will become undeniable this year, and within five years the planetary situation will be drastically different than it is now. Different in a POSITIVE and UNIFYING way.
There are people on this planet who have purposely kept Humanity physically, mentally, and spiritually enslaved for millennia (think royal bloodlines, perpetual cults, dark religions). Our enslavement was the key ingredient to their survival. Our modern-day slavery is both in the shadows (human trafficking) and in the open (the current monetary system).
Their time is drawing to a close and a New Age is beginning as I write this. 
I hope these blogs help someone somewhere.<br/>
It is VERY important to note that this is not a religion or a cult or anything of the like. I have come to the realization, through various personal experiences, that the information in the contents of this blog series is relevant to each and every human being on the planet and that it is also quite important material regarding our future as a species. 
In order to create anything in this reality, we must first IMAGINE it.<br/>
If we cannot Imagine World Peace, Unity, Cooperation among all races, TRUTH as the norm, an end to poverty, hunger, and the greed of man, then how can we possibly MANIFEST a positive future together? 
What are we waiting for?<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t know what you’re talking about, what is my practice. I just sit down in a chair or lay on my bed and either listen to a guided meditation or just do nothing for 10-15 minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you&#39;ve got a good practice!</p>

<p>There are a few different methods of meditation. If you really break it down to its roots, there&#39;s mindfulness and mindlessness. </p>

<p>Neither one is better necessarily, and those are actually broken down into subsets. </p>

<p>There are moving meditative practices,like juggling, drumming, dancing, or tai chi as well. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all a matter of preference. If you&#39;d like to experience a kundalini awakening, there are kundalini yoga and meditation forms. </p>

<p>Supplemental activities which can increase the chances; are fasting, sensory deprivation, separating yourself from time and schedules,  and holotropic breathing (as well as other breathing techniques). </p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely not for everyone, and can be both a joyous and sorrowful and terrifying and liberating experience, all at once. 
Use caution if you choose to pursue. And be aware. </p>

<p>It’s good that you are striving for spiritual awakening and liberty from the institutions that want to control us. I’m just not on that level.</p>

<p>Also I’m really glad you mentioned dark religion. There is a certain (((dark religion))) that really stands out when it comes to the manipulation of world events. Lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was a little kid I was so happy and joyous but in 7th grade my idiot dad had the brilliant idea of moving away from where all my good friends lived and I honestly haven’t made any good friends since. Also my life is trash right now more than its ever been by far. That’s just me though. I don’t really think my personal life is affecting my view of the world, but perhaps it is </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m 45, and if I&#39;ve learned anything, it&#39;s that life is a series of ups and downs. It&#39;s just that, shit happens, then something good happens. Sometimes you can affect it , sometimes it&#39;s beyond your control.
But it deffinitely affects your worldview.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve lost father, a job and marriage in a span of year and a half. Life sure looked like I had tunnel vision. But now i can at least smile thinking of it. Not that those things never happened to anyone before.</p>

<p>Try not to be chained by circumstances. Express yourself, find joyful things to do. Make your way, but don&#39;t be too hard on yourself. That&#39;s all I have on this matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see a bleek world because that has been the narrative for almost 70 years. Movies and doomsday exaggerations plant the idea in peoples consciousness. Why? </p>

<p>Because evil doesnt have its own power source, it has to hijack our spirt to make it manifest. Its like cancer or the flu that is a living organism but its Life Source is us. </p>

<p>They fear one thing.</p>

<p>HOPE. Hope is where in the back of your mind, you  think there is possibility turning it around. We have the power to change reality by our thoughts and they can&#39;t stop it. Thats another reason why they want to depopulate the Earth.</p>

<p>If they do enough TV shows about The Walking Dead Or FEMA camps or Doom and Gloom, the consciousness of society accepts it and believes it, thus consenting and actually providing it power.</p>

<p>If we all believe that is the future, it will help open a door that allows it to become reality. I used to think that the NWO has won, now I see that even with all the AI and power, they can be stopped. Just believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t act like I haven’t heard the talking points that you espouse. I have heard them. Maybe you just have false hope.</p>

<p>Just look at recent history. 80 million dead in World War 2. Probably 70 million dead from Stalin’s regime. 100 million dead from Mao’s regime. 20 million killed by just the USA since World War 2. Massive civil war in Syria. Total chaos in Libya. Obviously still dealing with Iraq and Afghanistan. The powers that be are totally preparing us for an invasion of Iran. The largest humanitarian crisis since WW2 is happening in Yemen. North Koreas in the shadows but I don’t even trust that North Korea even exists. The people in charge don’t give a shit about your life or mines or anyone else’s. They’ll do anything for money. </p>

<p>Also we are on the verge of global economic collapse. I can’t think of a single nation that isn’t billions or trillions of dollars in debt. There will come a day when the straw breaks the camels back and this debt based economy that was invented by the people that want to control us comes to a tipping point and there will be a massive depression. They already have the robots in place to take all of our jobs it’s just a matter of time before they are fully functioning.</p>

<p>Think about it. 41 million Americans are below the poverty line. 41 million and that number gets bigger every single year. It’s so fucking sad. And they try to tell us oh the stock market is doing so great, oh look at the GDP, wow unemployment is really low. All of those statistics are complete bullshit. They are innacurate measures of the true health of an economy. The amount of disposable income for people in the bottom 90% gets lower and lower every single year. </p>

<p>I don’t care what you say about oh the media wants you to think like this and then that sets off a chain reaction yada yada yada bullshit. I have viewed the facts and i have come to an unbiased conclusion. </p>

<p>You can either do your best to avoid the apocalyptic like events that are about to happen by buying a bunker, paying off all your debts, learning how to grow for yourself and getting solar powered energy for your home that’s not close to a big city.</p>

<p>You can fight the powers that be for a better world, but you will likely die in the process.</p>

<p>Or you can just accept it and just wait for the collapse and embrace it when it happens like I am sort of doing.</p>

<p>Just don’t pretend there’s good things down the road in terms of world events cause you’re just brainwashing yourself </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You speak of 41 million people living below poverty? By who&#39;s definition? That 41 million lives better then a king 200 years ago. </p>

<p>Abundance of food and fresh fruit available in all seasons. Air conditioning and basic comfort you take for granted are all luxuries by any measurement. </p>

<p>How about any book, art or literature all accessible within seconds at your fingertips?</p>

<p>Think about how many hard world events are behind us? What did our forefathers do when faced with darkness? They stood up and did something instead of feeling powerless and rolling over to get slaughtered. </p>

<p>This is nothing compared to what our great great grandparents went through. </p>

<p>If your TV is your window to the world, then you are looking through a broken lense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the whole ‘woke’ thing deters from the entire picture of what this awakening movement is about.

    <div class="md"><p>&quot; In order to create anything in this reality, we must first IMAGINE it.&quot;</p>

<p>Fact. I heard Sam Harris say recently that IDEAS are the MOST POWERFUL thing we have. I believe this to be true.</p>

<p>It makes you wonder why there is so much fear when you watch or read the &quot;news&quot; ? Who is pushing this fear into mainstream media and why? I think the fact that you see so much fear in the media is very telling as to the state of human evolution. The powers that control behind the scenes are losing their control of the enslavement of beings and they are resorting to fear mongering, war, threat of world annihilation, utter despair of the current state of the world. Unaware people see this, feel the fear, and act out the fear further perpetuating the cycle.</p>

<p>The facts are abundant that we currently live in the most PEACEFUL time in the history of the WORLD. We have access to so many resources, so much information, so many good acts, deeds, things are happening all around us all the time. Stop for 10 seconds and think about that. Focus on the positive stuff. </p>

<p>Soon enough more and more people will become &quot;woke&quot; to the principle that ideas are immensely POWERFUL. They just need to break out of the wheel of fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point, I hear you point, and I feel your point.</p>

<p>One thing, though. How can you be sure that it&#39;s all going to turn out well ? That the whole path/transition will not be wrecked right before our eyes? </p>

<p>I mean, my logic is telling me we are on a good path, but my memmory reminds me that we&#39;ve fucked this up so many times before. How is now going to be different?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess that’s where faith comes into play. And the concept that we are all creating our realities moment to moment with our thoughts and actions.  So the more we work on making ourselves better humans (more loving, less judging, tolerant) this type of inner work affects the entire species as we are all connected via consciousness. Hope my friend! Let hope reign </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is mostly an inner knowing, an intuition, but there is also quite a large number of folks in the planet who are aware of all of these types of events and changes that will be occurring. I’m Aware that it may sound quite outlandish to most but from my own personal experience it is something to consider, and I can only share my experiences with others in hopes of piquing interest. I don’t wish to make anyone believe anything, just to consider the possibilities. Peace</p>
