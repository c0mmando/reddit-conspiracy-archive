        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>30 years ago, the CIA won the cold war. Putin sold out to them in order to become powerful, and rose to power.  He is still controlled by the CIA and is just their pawn.</p>

<p>At that point 30 years ago, there were no threats remaining against the CIA, expect American nationalist zealots. Powerful free Americans became the new threat, and had to be subdued. The FBI was their greatest asset. Soon, an unseen civil war erupted between the CIA and the FBI.</p>

<p>We are witnessing the end of this unseen war and watching CIA cronies quite literally take over the democratic system in USA. Any acts necessary for the CIA to win the civil war that were too &quot;too un-American&quot; were knowingly and willfully attributed to outside forces like Putin and ISIS. In truth, it was a calculated attempt to &quot;game&quot; the American democracy in an attempt to take over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i am thinking about it this way: first,  arthur koestler introduced the khazarian story in his book called the 13th tribe.  he admitted this to his buddy, george orwell</p>

<p>the rothschilds are the guardians of the papal treasure.  they are hofjuden. they are protecting the church of rome.  they changed their name to &#39;red shield&#39; because the roman legions used red shields.  their original family name was bauer, hungarian jews. </p>

<p>the knight templars introduced international banking to the west and the knights of malta are their modern representatives.  they own wall st and the jews are merely management.  they did this with the funds from the italian state, in accordance with the lateran treaty (1929), which they can thank to mussolini.  they caused the american great depression, so they could buy all the stocks for cents on the dollar.  the great depression was artificially created, since the rothschilds and other agents of the vatican already established the fed in 1913 and had strong control over the american financial markets.</p>

<p>the cia was founded by a jesuit iirc and the fbi was founded by a catholic.  cecil rhodes was a jesuit.  georgetown, fordham and other jesuit universities are schooling americas leaders.  it is the same case in most other countries around the world. there are over 1200 jesuit universities worldwide producing our leaders.</p>

<p>switzerland, basically a papal state is full of private banks, where the elites keep their wealth.  on top of that, basel is home of the bis, the central bank of the central banks (including the federal reserve system).  the swiss guards are also guarding the vatican. they have the best weapons and the manpower is also the creme de la creme.  the sovereign military order of malta is a un observer, just as is the vatican.  the &#39;khazarians&#39; cannot say the same.  the league of the nations, the precursor to the un was established in switzerland.  the first zionist congress, another jesuit construct,  was held in switzerland.  israel is a crusader style military outpost, fighting and defending the papal holy land.   the bavarian illuminati was founded at ingolstadt, a jesuit university. the current pope is a jesuit.</p>

<p>okay, i could go on, sorry for the long post</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i have more if you are interested:<br/>
the bavarian illuminati spread through europe and is responsible for the french revolution.  robespierre was a jesuit (trained at college de clermont in paris), during his days of terror he killed over 300.000 frenchman.  they were called the jacobins. the jacobins used a phrygian cap, which is still used as a symbol in american state and other institutions worldwide.  the darwin family was a jacobin family, the theory of evolution is a jesuit construct (see the piltdown man hoax).</p>

<p>a jesuit astronomer came up with the big bang theory (still popularized in mainstream culture).  the jesuits own and exclusively operate the biggest binocular telescope in the world. its called lucifer and is built on indian holy ground in the us.</p>

<p>the new age movement originates from a jesuit (theillard). it is meant to be the religion in the nwo. the ecumenical movement promoted by the vatican is just a stepping stone tovards this religion, which is luciferian at its core. chanelling from &#39;entities&#39; are tha hallmark of luciferian doctrine as is the case with blavatskys theosophy, crowleys thelema, the law of one, scientology and so on.</p>

<p>the jesuits prototyped communism on their &#39;reductions&#39; in paraguay and later put it in practice after the bolshevik revolution which they financed through wall st and european bankers (the warburgs namely).  the bolsheviks killed about 60 million people in russia and ukraine.</p>

<p>the jesuits run the skull and bones at yale. mao was enabled by &#39;yale in china&#39;, and was responsible for the death of 70-100 million chinese.  the rockefellers and french politicians praised mao for his achievments.</p>

<p>the lucis trust, the publishing house of the united nations was originally called lucifer trust. its a theosophy org.</p>

<p>bergoglio the current pope is from argentina, the country the nazi leadership took refuge in after ww2 through vatican arranged &#39;ratlines&#39;.<br/>
here is bergoglio declaring lucifer as god:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHVXmT4weM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eHVXmT4weM</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>eric jon phelphs at <a href="http://vaticanassassins.org/">http://vaticanassassins.org/</a> goes into a lot of detail. i still remember his breakdown of the american civil war and the role of the vatican in it was good.</p>

<p>some videos from walter veith deal with secret societies, the reformation and counter reformation and the jesuits through the history.</p>

<p>i also like the know your enemy series, its made up of 77 parts :-) but they are short and easily digested: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDDGl79x4Pc&amp;amp;list=PLCED9C361662866BD">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDDGl79x4Pc&amp;amp;list=PLCED9C361662866BD</a></p>

<p>and of course what got me started was the mystery babylon series from william cooper (&#39;hour of the time&#39; radio broadcasts with 42 episodes) and you can find the transcipts, for better comprehension &quot;Transcripts of William Cooper&#39;s
Mystery Babylon Series
The history, the dogma, and the identity of Mystery Babylon&quot;</p>

<p>good reading!</p>
