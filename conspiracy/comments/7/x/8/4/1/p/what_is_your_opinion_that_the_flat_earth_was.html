       I would like to know if there are any youtube videos that discuss this topic or if you believe that NASA is faking things (yes even faking people being in the ISS) what exactly do you think NASA is faking what do you think they are not faking?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am only asking because I have been watching this
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOrcijUvrWY">

       I believe in a round earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: It is very interesting simply because if you look into NASA enough people start having doubts and then start believing that the earth is flat but on the flip side it also labels you a completely lunatic. It is almost like people have no choice but to believe the earth is flat if you want to believe that NASA lies because I cannot find ANYTHING (and maybe I have not looked hard enough) on youtube or even on reddit that talks about NASA conspiracy's that is not also talking about the Flat Earth.

       Lying about it all. It's a damn good scam started by the nazis partially after paperclip (yes, the worst group of people to have ever lived) . 50 million a day for some pictures and video, is a steep price to pay. People are too dumbed down and distracted to care. "There are more important things to worry about."

       I believe Nasa is faking everything, pictures, videos, information. We won't be able to confirm anything they say, we only "know" what they are telling us.
       <br/>
       It's hard to tell why was the flatard theory created. But it keeps people busy for sure. Once I joined a group on facebook, I thought it was a joke first. Then I realized they are actually talking about flat earth. Anyone who asked a legit question was brigaded and insulted. This is the mentality i see everywhere basically. Join a flatard group, sub, forum, whatever, you will see how weird people they are.

       Interesting. This is the kind of feedback I was hoping for. I really wasn't sure if there were people out there that believed in a round earth and also believe that NASA is faking everything. I have been discounting any NASA conspiracy's for years because I just assumed they were all flat earth garbage. Then I started seeing things here and there and it got me wondering if the Flat Earth was really created just to cover up NASA's lies like the term "conspiracy theory" was only created to cover up JFK lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you point me to any sources that are only about NASA along the while actually stating that they believe that flat earth is a psyop?

       Ever since I realized my whole life was a lie I question everything. I don't question that the grass is green but I do question outer space and everything "scientific". I accept what considered to be science, but I don't neccessarily believe it.
       <br/>
       I am a graphic artist, I have the skill to make space images myself. Especially with modern computer hardwares it's not hard to render super realistic stuff. Take a look at the software called "Grand Designer", you can generate planets, ground structures and other stuff. Nasa could easily have million times better softwares like that.
       <br/>
       What I want to say is I don't believe any image and video the Nasa is showing to us because it can be easily made by man. Also, the media, the government, everyone lies to us, why would Nasa be an exception?
       <br/>
       I believe the Earth is a globe, at least that's what I accept. Ancient Greeks already knew it's a globe.
       <br/>
       Unfortunately I can not give you links, but if you look for anti-Nasa articles, posts,  be careful because they are like 90% flatard garbage.
       <br/>
       They say Nasa means "deception" in hebrew. Is it true or not, I don't know, still interesting.

       Most disinformation will do exactly what you describe. "NASA is lying but it's to hide nibiru or aliens (but never flat earth)."
      </p>
      <p>
       If you find someone who won't even have the thought experiment of whether the earth could be flat, that is a red flag. If they quickly jump to ridicule and shouting down, that is a red flag.

       This is completely the opposite experience I've had.  And actually describes my experience when asking globe earth theorists basic questions about repeatable experimental evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had one that said he proved that the thermosphere (really hot) would not melt aluminum because he put a tray of water in an oven at 300 degrees in 5th grade and it didn't immediately get to 300 degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to answer op, you can absolutely think NASA is faking everything and still believe in space travel and a ball earth. It's just elementary conspiracy theory that you will move past in time if you keep asking questions and following the answers.

       I actually suspect that they are paying people to create flat earth videos and putting subconscious brainwashing technology on the videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earthers actually become strangely violent and angry when questioned or argued and are being trained to believe nothing can be proved since all the scientists could all be lieing.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are being trained that evidence doesn’t matter and you can just believe whatever you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a program to pick off the weak minded as they search for conspiracy theories and turn them into highly brainwashed slaves to the flat earth theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems to be the cabals last ditch effort is trying to splinter off people into fringe groups and brainwash them into radical adherence to ideas that don’t lead to unified rejection of
The globalist system.

       Yes I totally agree, my thoughts exactly. Also the amount of time and energy they spend on provig the flat earth to the masses is ridiculous. What if the Earth is a cube? So what? Nothing will change. It's so insignificant, there are much more important things they could spend energy and time on.

       A new Church opened up in the north of Scotland and Flat Earth leaflets were sent out around the town / city. To me, flat earth is religious propoganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens if and when people stop believing that the Earth is round and possible to get off of? Means extra terrerstrials probably don't exist and can't come to Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think it's been constructed so that people stop believing in life outside of Earth.

       Yes, it could be religious propaganda but it would not work on me, a christian, who actually reads the bible. The bible and science agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       It says in Isaiah 45:7 that he FORMED both light and darkness. He did not flatten the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Creation of the heavens, including the sun, moon, and stars (Gen. 1:1; Col. 1:15-18; Ps. 8:3; 90:2; 95:5; 102:25; Isa. 40:12, 26; 45:12; 48:13). The bible gives some correct scientific details about the universe before science discovered them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science explains The sun rotates on its axis, making a complete turn in about 25 days, and a circuit of the entire heavens once each year in conjunction with all other fixed stars or suns, which then move through space at a speed of 12 miles a second. The movement of these is at such a vast distance from us that they appear to be almost at rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psalm 19:1-7 says The sun goes fourth as a bridegroom and as a strong man to run a race from one part of heaven to the other. Science says the Earth and all the planets are round.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isaiah 40:21-22. 21 Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? God says from the beginning and then talks about the foundation of earth. Clarifying two separate events. 22 It is he that sitteth upon the
       <em>
        circle of the earth
       </em>
       , and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Circle - Hebrew - חוּג - Circuit, Sphere, circle, compass.
       </em>
       Same word use in Proverbs 8:27
I was there when he set the heavens in place, when he marked out the
       <em>
        compass
       </em>
       on the
       <em>
        face of the deep
       </em>
       ,
      </p>
      <p>
       The bible revealed the earth was round long before man. If you read the whole chapter in context God is saying that He is Literally sitting so far above the round earth that its inhabitants seems as mere grasshoppers or locusts. God is looking upon man from above, as a busy, agitated, moving, impatient and raging multitude spread over the earth like locusts in bands over the plains of the East. Showing the insignificance of man as viewed by God in the heavens. So Why some Christians believe in a flat earth I have no idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Verse 22 also talks about stretching the heavens as a curtain and a tent to dwell in. The Hebrew word is “doq” which is something crumbling; fine, as a thin cloth; curtain. Could this refer to the protective covering of the atmosphere which has just the right density to sustain like on earth? They tell us that the sun throws out various kinds of violet rays, some deadly, some life giving. We are shielded from at least 8 harmful rays by a layer of ozone about 1/8th in. thick. This seems to be the proper thickness to allow beneficial rays to come through as well as protect. If this were removed, life would come to an end. If it were thicker it would prevent needful rays.
      </p>
      <p>
       Psalm 19:1-7 
The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. 2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. 3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. 4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, 5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. 6 His going forth is from the end of the heaven,
       <em>
        and his circuit unto the ends of it
       </em>
       : and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. 7 The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sun has two movements of it’s own. It rotates on its axis just as the earth does every 25 days. It moves in a circuit through space among the stars at 12 miles a second. In reality both the earth and the sun as well as all heavenly bodies travel eternally in their own circuits and orbits through space in conjunction with one another. The sun movies through space in its own circuit. Its own planets revolve around it as thy all travel through space. How long it takes to make a complete circuit through the entire heaven is not known.
      </p>
      <p>
       Job 22:12-14 
12 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are! 13 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud? 14 Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven. Here it is talking about a circuit of heaven. Heaven must be a planet like earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Romans 1:20 says “For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made,even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:” And other places in the bible like 2 kings 19:15 says things like “thou has made heaven and earth” along with other places in the bible describing the location of the planet in Isaiah 14:13 says the planet heaven resides in the North part of the universe. Job 26:7 says He stretched out the universe from the North. Psalm 75:6 shows that the direction of Heaven is also in the North.
      </p>
      <p>
       Job 38:31 - "Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades, Or loose the cords of Orion? It is known now that the stars in the constellation Pleiades, anciently known as the “seven sisters” (although the telescope reveals many more stars in this group), are bound together gravitationally. The stars in the bright constellation Orion, on the other hand, are not so bound. 
Science (just now discovering this) says: The water within the Earth is hidden inside a blue ROCK called ringwoodite that lies 700 kilometres underground in the mantle, the layer of hot rock between Earth's surface and its core.

       Job 38:30 "the waters are hid as with a STONE, and the face of the deep is frozen" v8 "Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Genesis 7 "the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up" When talking about God flooding the Earth. I love looking at Job 38 as literal details as well. It gives the idea of a carpenter using a line to lay out his work. All constructed to specific specifications. He asks things like “whereupon are the foundations of Earth fastened? Explaining that the earth fastened to His own laws of the universe suspended and rotating in space fully governed by what we know now as the law of gravity. Job 26:7 says that God hangs the earth upon “nothing”.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you hide waters as with a STONE in a flat earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       The bible also says that the earth has a dateless past (before the Genesis 1:2 and that there was an ancient civilization before the ice age over 10,000 years ago.

       Don't think science agrees on people being able to walk on water and stuff. Believing in flat earth for me is on one level with believing in any given religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of stuff can be manufactured. This is true for stuff NASA shows us too. Does it necessarily have to be fake? No. If all science was fake we wouldn't even be able to have this conversation

       If there is a conspiracy, someone has to be profiting from it. Cannot see anyone profitting from telling the people earth was a globe, while it wasn't. So this flat earth argument is BS. There is no gain in it. On the other hand many people profit from telling the masses there was a god...

       The thing is, even without blaming NASA for "witholding the truth about the flat earth", all these flat earth arguments are nothing but nonsense every average joe can easily debunk himself without the "help" of NASA. So the earth is flat? So how does it come that buildings lie below the horizon when you look at them from far away when on large bodies of water? If earth was flat there would be no curvature on the sea and you should be able to see the lowest part of the building, but you don't.

       The religious component seems to be disinformation, or at least an unescessary addition to the motives of greed, wealth, and control.  You will see that most popular flat earthers relentlessly push this idea, that is a red flag. If you want to add religion to it you can but it is not a requirement as far as "why would anyone lie about the globe."

       You're so full of the ideas of others that it's no wonder you are lost. You're trying to prove NASA are liars but when you come to the question of what they are hiding, you refuse to believe the earth is a flat plane and you instead hold onto one of the biggest lies they are perpetrating. On top of that, you try to use Bible verses to corroborate a globe Earth? The same Bible that a majority of religious flat earthers are quoting to prove their side... It doesn't make any sense because you aren't allowing yourself to reach the truth, no matter the result.

       You only need a few seconds to figure out that this isn't a ball we live on. As you rise in elevation, the horizon line continues to rise with your eyesight level. Not possible on a ball with the Earth's circumference. Secondly, ships go over the horizon due to curvature of the Earth right? You can watch it happen. Except when you pick up a pair of binoculars you can still see the entire ship. It's not logical to say that it disappears due to the curvature but then not insist that the ship remain hidden when looking through binoculars.

       Without a frame of reference, your eyes won't be able to tell if it drops or not. You can use a theodolite to disprove such a claim.

       Nobody denies how magnification works. Keep watching the ship and see it disappear bottom first.

       However, if you're going to claim that zoom/magnification can bring back the

        bottom

       of objects that have already been hidden by the horizon then make sure to back it up.

       No, thats incorrect. I just gave you evidence that its not correct.

       They do not come back into view just because they are far away. Especially if you are using youtube videos, compression makes things harder to see.

       Nope. If the sun never goes below the horizon on a FE how does it cast shadows under the clouds or causes mountains to cast shadows.

       The video you've linked does support the flat earth theory. At the start, the boat is out of your sight, then it is brought entirely back into view. Does curvature change based on magnification in your world view?

       Ill refer back to my point about video compression and youtube. All youre doing by zooming in is making objects already visible larger.

      <p>
       Why cant I see indefinitely with the proper zoom?

       The boat was so small if it was a bit further back it would be invisible to your naked eye based on the distance. Can you show me a boat in focus that decends behind a curvature? That should be an easy one to find if the earth were a globe.

       Lets stay focused on this point because it is the nail in the coffin.

       You've s seemed to accidentally link the flat earth evidence again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully that was an accident. Boat is out of sight (or behind the curvature to a globie) then it is magically brought back into view when zooming in on it, exactly what we would expect on a flat plane. Thanks for the link this is a good example of this phenomenon.

       Again please refer to my position on youtube compression.

       Then refer back to my position that because an object is small and difficult to see doesnt mean its "Disappeared" its just enlarging what is already visible.

      <p>
       Thirdly note that the boat does disappear over the curvature

       With binoculars, sure. Doesnt mean the world is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same phenomena with ships at sea, they get smaller the further away and using binoculars to see them more easily doesnt mean the Earth is flat.

       The real trick is when you see the bottom of the ship go over the horizon as evidenced by the video I provided.

       I'll help you out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's assume this is a flat plane. We will use a hill to simulate something being behind curvature.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        You cannot see a fly with your naked eye from a mile away that exists and is in your line of sight (due to angular resolution and perspective.)
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If you use magnification, you can now see the fly because you've increased your angular resolution.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If you put the fly behind a hill (this will represent curvature in this thought experiment) you will not be able to see it, as it is behind another object (hill or curvature).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Even if you use magnification, you will still be unable to see the fly, because it is behind the curvature or hill.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       In number 1, when the fly is not visible, the Greeks assumed that was because of curvature. But we can clearly see that the fly never went behind any sort of curvature or terrain with use of our binoculars in 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to test how magnification works on things that are behind the curvature then we can use the hill in 3. This shows that no amount of magnification will bring the fly back into view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think the horizon is equal to curvature? This can be disproven by simply zooming in anywhere, you will be able to see the horizon move back as you increase the magnification.

       Because I literally gave you an example of a ship disappearing over curvature. Not because it got too far away...

       You keep saying it as though im not getting it. Small things become larger and easier to see with a telescope or binoculars. We get that, we agree.

       The problem is you've assigned anything not visible to you to curvature. I've already showed you how that can be incorrect. So there is clearly another explanation other than curvature, that has never been measured by anyone.

       No, pay attention. Ive assigned curvature to the Earth itself obscuring objects that would be in view if the Earth were flat.

       It doesn't matter if you show him a 100 foot high cargo ship or a 500 foot high office building his next argument is its now due to atmospheric refraction or fuck it "some phenomenon that hasn't been measured yet".

       Dude, the boat was not behind the curvature at the start the person was simply zooming in to see it. You don't even have to watch the whole 17 minutes of that video. Just simply skip through it and you can see the boat getting lower and lower. I'll make it easy for you. Go the the 15 minute mark and tell me what you see.

       If the Earth were flat then sunrise and sunset would occur at roughly the same moment across the entire disk. It would not matter whether the Earth were spinning like a coin or a tiny sun was orbiting the Earth. There would be no need for time zones, and if fact, time zones would be worse than useless. I personally have talked to ordinary people in other parts of the Earth when it was day for me and night for them and visa versa. I say that modern communications, therefore, proves the Earth is not flat. With a friend in another part of the Earth, you too can confirm this within 24 hours.

       If you are trying to debunk the flat earth you should start by finding curved surfaces of water.  You could just have a mile long pool and notice that the middle is not higher than the sides.

       I don't think you are thinking about this clearly. As I said, if the Earth were flat, sunrise occurs simultaneously across the entire surface of the Earth. You can model this with a flashlight and a flat object. Time zones were created so that celestial events occur at roughly the same time everywhere in the world. Morning occurs in the "morning" hours. Night occurs during the "night" hours, and so on. You can model this with a ball and a flashlight as well. It is easy to see that part of the Earth has "day" at the same time as part of the Earth has "night". So, clearly what I'm saying is not a logical fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have personally talked to people of the other side of the Earth (east to west) and confirmed that it was day for them when it was night for me and visa versa. I find it really hard to believe that you actually talked to people on the other side of the Earth (east to west) and they told you it was day for them when it was day for you. I notice that you carefully didn't say this in your response. Only that "people in different parts of the earth" confirmed your thoughts, which is
       <em>
        NOT
       </em>
       the same thing. Is there any reason you don't carry out this simple experiment which confirms the Earth is not flat?

       The main issue I have with this is you are using the heliocentric model of he universe to try and explain a geocentric model.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using this logic we can say the heliocentric model doesn't work with the geocentric sun, and it is debunked. So you see, this is not a valid argument.

       No, in my original reply, I explained that it doesn't matter whether the Earth orbits the Sun or the Sun orbits the Earth; the effect is the same. Just apply the model as I explained. Neither the geo-centric nor the helio-centric models support a flat Earth. It simply doesn't work. The beauty is that you can easily trial both models at home and see for yourself.

       I don't think it's a psy-op at all. There is a government-run controlled-opposition group known as the Flat Earth Society, which is to discredit the Flat Earth Movement. So why would a psy-op have another psy-op inside it?

       It might be an issue with your elevation or your equipment. But you should do this correctly at water level to really see just how absurd the idea of a curve is.

       So, are you claiming that zoom/magnification can bring back the
       <em>
        bottom
       </em>
       of objects that have been hidden by the horizon? If so, go ahead and prove it. The only thing that I've seen is a bunch of videos where the ship is clearly not over the horizon.

       There is far more evidence to the contrary.

       Let's assume this is a flat plane. We will use a hill to simulate something being behind curvature.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot see a fly with your naked eye from a mile away that exists and is in your line of sight (due to angular resolution and perspective.)
If you use magnification, you can now see the fly because you've increased your angular resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you put the fly behind a hill (this will represent curvature in this thought experiment) you will not be able to see it, as it is behind another object (hill or curvature).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you use magnification, you will still be unable to see the fly, because it is behind the curvature or hill.
      </p>
      <p>
       In number 1, when the fly is not visible, the Greeks assumed that was because of curvature. But we can clearly see that the fly never went behind any sort of curvature or terrain with use of our binoculars in 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to test how magnification works on things that are behind the curvature then we can use the hill in 3. This shows that no amount of magnification will bring the fly back into view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think the horizon is equal to curvature? This can be disproven by simply zooming in anywhere, you will be able to see the horizon move back as you increase the magnification.
      </p>

       I'm amazed by how difficult this simple idea is for people to understand.

       of objects that have been hidden by the horizon.

       Precisely, and this is what happens. No amount of zoom will bring back the hidden part of objects from the horizon, as proven by the videos that I've shown featuring the mountain and the lighthouse.

       <strong>
        show proof

       . Show a video in which someone uses the zoom of a camera to bring back the bottom of an object that's been hidden by the horizon.

       All videos of boats show this exactly. Magnification moves the horizon away from you. If your looking for the bottoms of things like mountains and Chicago, you need to remove the atmosphere first.... and I don't think that is possible.

       Great! I'll describe now. So the horizon is actually higher than it appears to be when looking out over water (I say water because I'm not positive it occurs with the same intensity over land).
      </p>
      <p>
       The shimmer effect that is seen over roads, also exists over the water surface, this reflects what is above the horizon by flipping it downward. The detail is very poor in here, thus you cannot tell when looking out into just water.  It just looks like the sky continuing downward to meet the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you kind of get where I'm going with this? I'll try and find an image for you in a bit.

       I don't really understand what that is supposed to mean. That's due to the fact that I don't really know what you mean by "horizon".
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's be specific. When I'm looking out over water, there seems to be a limit between the water and the sky, and I usually call that the horizon. But this is not exactly a physical object ? So what exactly is higher than it appears ? The water itself ? The points that are located three miles away from me on the water ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually flat earthers say that the horizon is always at eye-level. So are you saying that the horizon appears to be lower than eye-level ?

       I think I understand what you mean. I even agree that this is happening in real life, and is sometimes known as "superior mirage" or "fata morgana". This is usually explained by refraction. Is that also your explanation of the phenomenon ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this happen all the time, in all conditions ? Does it depend on certain parameters like temperature of the air, humidity, temperature of the water, etc .. ?

       I honestly have no idea where you are going with this. You seem to be describing a phenomenon that is well-known and that has a reasonable explanation using the physics that I know.

       I can accurately measure distances with a global model. The Theorema Egregium says it is impossible to do the same on a flat model. Many smarter men than I have tried to disprove that to no avail.

       I've seen a pendulum clock function which requires the rotation of the Earth. Even more interesting, I have seen one function on both hemispheres, meaning they rotated in different directions.

       Observe them over time. You can see features on the planet move over time showing they are rotating, aka seeing more than 50% of its surface. You can watch them rotate regularly showing formations disappear on one side and reappear on the other.

The British shots, therefore, fell at a distance from the targets equal to twice the Coriolis deflection." (Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems, Second Edition — by Jerry B.

       Pendulums prove the rotation of Earth. They would not change position if the Earth did not rotate. There is literally no other explanation for it. That alone doesn't prove a round earth, but pendulums rotating 2 different directions does as a flat disc would not be able to achieve that effect. Please explain how it could with some of your "repeatable experiments."

       I see the flaw in your logic. The pendulums movement cannot be attributed to the rotation when there is no rotation that has been measured. We do know that tides are effected by the position of he moon/sun so they likely would have the same effect on these pendulums. See how I used logic to show that it is indeed possible without any movement of the earth?

       Wat. There is no model that says the moon causes pendulums. That was about as far away from logic as you could get. Also, if you accept the moon affects tides then you accept gravitation theory which doesn't really work with a flat Earth. Nice try though?

       No, it's not based on a fallacy. I understand that you don't know what a predictive model is, but don't try and act superior about it. A global model can accurately predict distances between any 2 points on Earth. You have 2 options for a flat Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       1). Prove a distance inconsistency on a global model and provide a 2d model that
       <strong>
        can
       </strong>
       accurately predict the distance between any 2 points on Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       2). Disprove the Theorema Egregium.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, just bring up some psuedo-science which falls apart at several distinct points and does not have a model that can make predictions nearly as accurately as quantum mechanics and general relativity. That'll do it.

       Let's assume this is a flat plane. We will use a hill to simulate something being behind curvature.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot see a fly with your naked eye from a mile away that exists and is in your line of sight (due to angular resolution and perspective.)
If you use magnification, you can now see the fly because you've increased your angular resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you put the fly behind a hill (this will represent curvature in this thought experiment) you will not be able to see it, as it is behind another object (hill or curvature).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you use magnification, you will still be unable to see the fly, because it is behind the curvature or hill.
      </p>
      <p>
       In number 1, when the fly is not visible, the Greeks assumed that was because of curvature. But we can clearly see that the fly never went behind any sort of curvature or terrain with use of our binoculars in 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to test how magnification works on things that are behind the curvature then we can use the hill in 3. This shows that no amount of magnification will bring the fly back into view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think the horizon is equal to curvature? This can be disproven by simply zooming in anywhere, you will be able to see the horizon move back as you increase the magnification.
      </p>

       I'm amazed by how difficult this simple idea is for people to understand.

       Yes, this is why the bottoms of things disappear first, right? Wait, no, that's not how it works. In your theory I should be able to see Mt. Everest with a good enough telescope. I have a very good telescope yet I can never find Mount Everest. I can see the moon clearly even when it is on the horizon. Your "proofs" don't stand up to even the most basic scrutiny.

       Don't get lost in the sauce now. It's really simple concept that debunks the first globe claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are curious about mountains, I suggest you search long range photography, they universally beat the assumed curvature. After looking through enough of those, you'll start to see what I mean. The globe is not real man.

       You ever heard of atmospheric diffraction? Allows you to see further than if there were no atmosphere. While buildings, mountains, etc. can be seen further than normal, it is by no means consistent or repeatable. It depends on current atmospheric distortion. What
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       consistent is that the bottoms disappear first.

       Let's assume this is a flat plane. We will use a hill to simulate something being behind curvature.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot see a fly with your naked eye from a mile away that exists and is in your line of sight (due to angular resolution and perspective.)
If you use magnification, you can now see the fly because you've increased your angular resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you put the fly behind a hill (this will represent curvature in this thought experiment) you will not be able to see it, as it is behind another object (hill or curvature).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you use magnification, you will still be unable to see the fly, because it is behind the curvature or hill.
      </p>
      <p>
       In number 1, when the fly is not visible, the Greeks assumed that was because of curvature. But we can clearly see that the fly never went behind any sort of curvature or terrain with use of our binoculars in 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to test how magnification works on things that are behind the curvature then we can use the hill in 3. This shows that no amount of magnification will bring the fly back into view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think the horizon is equal to curvature? This can be disproven by simply zooming in anywhere, you will be able to see the horizon move back as you increase the magnification.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm amazed by how difficult this simple idea is for people to understand.

       If the Earth were flat then sunrise and sunset would occur at roughly the same moment across the entire disk. It would not matter whether the Earth were spinning like a coin or a tiny sun was orbiting the Earth. There would be no need for time zones, and if fact, time zones would be worse than useless. I personally have talked to ordinary people in other parts of the Earth when it was day for me and night for them and visa versa. I say that modern communications, therefore, proves the Earth is not flat.

       These statements you would probably agree with, and that is manufactured ignorance or stupidity. If you actually think about these yourself (without being contained by pre-approved ideas from authority) you will find each of these statements to be 100% false and non-applicable to this debate.

       I think you all did this to yourselves. There's a tiny, but loud minority here who will believe and spout just about anything as long as it doesn't come from "msm." Rampant confirmation bias is never a good thing, and fewer people are thinking for themselves today.

       Jesus christ, folks, please leave your beliefs aside for one day and familiarise yourself with physics. If you don't believe anything you are being shown from the outer space, study and try to understand the basics of science, it ain't no rocket science.

       Well OP, I guess there are a few facts here to add to your cognition:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The Russians have never put a human being over 500km (300mi) in space altitude. They reached 475km in 1965.
       </li>
      </ol>

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        1965-03-18 - Voskhod 2 - Belyayev, Leonov - 475 km apogee orbit
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There are many unasked questions about the Russian program still to this day. Why did they stop at 475km? Why did they not figure out the science of radiation shielding as opposed to the USA? Why have they stayed well below the Earth Radiation Belts for 53 years? Why every few years Russia makes some statement about going on a cis-lunar manned mission but it never, ever materializes?

       It's possible that it is being used as such, but I think it's origins (in the modern era) are just due to flat out incompetence/religion. There are people out there who unironically believe this stuff. It's honestly amazing.

       To any flat earthers looming around in this post, I have a question for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       How exactly do you explain the existence of two different celestial poles separated by a viewing angle of 180 degrees? This is geometrically impossible

       people are told that the earth is round from the day they are born. no wonder they have such a hard time believing that the earth is flat. i am still doing research about flat &amp; round earth. the hook that catched people is the issue that if earth was flat it would have an edge. some people explain this with Christianity and say that god controls  these issues. others say its evidence we live in a simulation. you cannot see the edge you just keep traveling and go to the other side of the "map" just like in video games when you decide to fly as far as you can you end up coming to the other side of the "map" while not seeing an actual edge.
