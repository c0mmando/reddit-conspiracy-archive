        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I work for a promotional company that has been successfully leveraging reddit for 2 years. We know how to beat reddit&#39;s algorithm. After some frustrating arguments with people this week, I want to start using this promotional engine to start waking people up. I think I can do this without being caught/fired. You guys are the experts at research so I need help. I need a list of irrefutable facts, things that would go over well in places like TodayILearned. Main stream media sources, government website sources. I will get these links to the front pages of some of the biggest subs.</p>

<p>There is a war being waged against us If you want to be more involved in this campaign please PM me, its time we fought back.</p>

<p>edit: For the technique we use to work properly we need lots of links, the more credible conspiracies or facts you can come up with that will get people thinking and questioning the powers in charge are great, like the top post about Assange judge&#39;s husband. </p>

<p>1) Building 7 is burning and could collapse, like 1 &amp; 2 did, and a reporter makes a mistake on the craziest day in modern history.</p>

<p>2) Reporters are given scripts... as if they couldn’t report on it unless they were told to.</p>

<p>2 just doesn’t make sense. </p>

He was pretty ultra conservative before now he will give me a ride to the dispensary and votes differently. I understand this is family but I have also managed to change a lot of friends. It is easy if the person is already smart, and even the not so smart people who use reddit still have a leg up on most drones walking around. Especially as there&#39;s a lot of things going on that they are having trouble keeping under wraps, if we can show some other proven conspiracies and keep these current events in the news I think it will have a big effect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you got your dad to see it in his 50s, you’re doing something right. Us older ones find changing our belief systems extremely difficult for the most part. </p>

<p>BUT that said, I will say this commenter has a point. Getting older generations to wake up is important but if you want change that will last, look to the upcoming generations.  Plant seeds of truth in their little minds today, tomorrow it will grow into a mighty oak.  They are our best chances for ending the tyranny once and for all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you want to do is great but I&#39;d say some conspiracies that do not have enough proven fact are hard to use. I think teaching people to see what is in front of them from all sources and analytically be able to decide that something smells fishy is what we need to do. A lot of people don&#39;t research politics or science and form an idea on them based on common belief. But if you read something and really read it to understand it, it can still seem crazy and not be a conspiracy per se. It&#39;s just finally getting educated and seeing the truth.</p>

<p>I see things all the time that wake me up that aren&#39;t even considered conspiracy at all. It&#39;s considered normal. I look at what&#39;s directly in front of me and analyze all the ins and outs and realize how bizarre some of the everyday things we do are.</p>

<p>This would give people the power to get themselves awake. We should of course definitely help and I don&#39;t think coming up with a list of the absolute truest facts and real conspiracies that can be proven or at least give actual perspective is not a bad idea but you can&#39;t make a horse drink the water as they say.</p>

<p>They have to want to be awake. </p>

<p>I think about this everyday and how to get people to want to but is that possible? Isn&#39;t the most genuine choice the one you make on your own?</p>

<p>When I started thinking about things differently it took traumatic events and suffering in certain ways to finally say ok, something isn&#39;t right or isn&#39;t all I think it is. I don&#39;t know if there are other ways to get people to wake up without them having to go through something that shakes their views of reality.</p>

<p>Most people won&#39;t necessarily believe or care about conspiracy unless they really feel it effects them and I don&#39;t know if just research is enough. You have to really feel like something is happening to you or people around you and want to make it right.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this because you are already awake</p>

<p>You have a lot of good points.</p>

<p>I am not going to frame them as conspiracies because that will right away turn people off. I think that even if it can wake up a few people that is a good start, people dont really realize just how much traffic a post on the front page of the top 10 subs gets. Maybe the story being shared hits close to home for 1/1000 people and causes an emotional effect that makes them question everything around them. If a post gets 40k views well we just woke up 40 people. Idk what the ratio will be but its better than reading more shitty news everyday</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point. If something is true it&#39;s not really a conspiracy. If we called it searching for truth and not debating conspiracy, that would probably help. </p>

<p>It&#39;s hard because there&#39;s so many alien and whatnot conspiracy threads here and, not that we shouldn&#39;t talk about conspiracy like that, it&#39;s not something easily proven. And we have a lot of for sure real issues that aren&#39;t even conspiracy like people being killed and people starving for no real reason other than no one helping them and sometimes I worry some of the more out there conspiracy stuff is distracting from real problems going on every day that aren&#39;t conspiracy.</p>

<p>To me that&#39;s the real conspiracy. Why aren&#39;t we doing anything about the homeless and the starving when we can? Why are we continuing to hurt the earth when we can stop producing so much of the fun, unnecessary parts of life like endless clothing and phones and worry about what&#39;s more important for awhile? We are we still in these wars for reasons we probably don&#39;t know about? Why do the rich get richer and the poor mostly poorer? Why do we keep repeating history? Why do we keep doing things we know do not end well or that we know cause as many problems or more problems than the benefits?</p>

<p>These aren&#39;t even conspiracies. It&#39;s just what we do. It&#39;s fact. But no one is doing enough about them. None of the bigger people who have the influence and resources to do so, anyway.</p>

<p>Taking people out of power by proving what has been done and finding the truth is important but it&#39;s not going to help anyone fast enough. Instead of having to prove what&#39;s been done why can&#39;t we see what&#39;s been done and just decide to stop instead of replacing the figure heads and waiting for one who will make the difference instead of just changing the few things that actually give corrupt forces power: our idleness, our participation and our consent.</p>

<p>We just need a big strike.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with that. If the truth is being covered I&#39;d definitely call it conspiracy.</p>

<p>I guess I mean what about the bad truths in front of us that aren&#39;t hidden and nothing is being done about them that are problems maybe should be called something other than conspiracy but I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;d call it other than failing to do the obvious right things.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;d even call that a conspiracy. Why are we worried about conspiracies over fixing real problems? Could that be a conspiracy? Could we be kept busy with a lot of theories that aren&#39;t true that could be taking our time from making progress on the ones that are?</p>

<p>You are asking this sub to supply you with information so you have game the Reddit algorithm&#39;s and asking the users to be complicit in doing so. You say you are being met with resistance.

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely. How to take action. That gives people who already are aware the stuff to actually do something. The only issue is, is that what people like me anyway, believe would fix the problem, most people won&#39;t want to do.</p>

<p>The best way to take action is if we see a power of some sort that&#39;s corrupt is to stop feeding it and stop using it. Cut it off. But people don&#39;t want to give up the benefits they get to fix the problem. They&#39;d rather change the system so they can have their cake and eat it, too, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s even possible. And if it is, it&#39;ll take us many more years to get there and idk if we have that kind of time anymore.</p>

If I&#39;m assuming this reality is messed up, which I do feel that way a lot cause of the duality and that life is very absurd, then anything I experience through this reality is also wrong or distorted so I can&#39;t really trust anything. My only answer to it for myself is just to live, be aware and fix what I can see while making speculation important but not the main force and all that is done and strive to do the most good possible for all forms of life. And that when I figure it out, if there is anything to figure out, hopefully I have educated myself enough and grown enough in all ways, spiritually included, that when I see the truth I&#39;ll know it and when I see more bullshit I&#39;ll know it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think we need a combination of platforms for the people to take hold of government. A strong leader without incentive to be bought off is key, but that is nearly impossible to maintain, and we need a revolving door for when those people are taken out (either through bribes or assassination). A strong moral code for a president type leader not willing to play ball with wall street, the MIC, and TPTB. The combination of awareness, a new party (call it the people&#39;s party or whatever) with backings of senators and congressmen and women, and a strong sense of interpretation of the laws is key. Frankly the reason politics can be so corrupt breaks down to law and lawyers ability to maneuver within those laws through complicated legal speak. It&#39;s a daunting task that could ultimately trigger a war as well. PM me if you want to discuss more, but a lot of pieces need to fall in place for this to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion this is not the way to go about this. If you have a way to manipulate the people of Reddit, so too would others. If you were more successful than others, your methods will be adapted or shut down. The objective should not be to wake people, this will only create a divisive environment where discussion can not happen. It would be of more use to show us your methods so we know when it is being used against us.</p>

<p>Also, it will do you no good to find information here to use. You must find new information outside of Reddit and bring it here. It needs to be something a great number of people can relate to with facts which prove it beyond probable doubt. What you will find here today is great information people should know, but it won&#39;t be reaching the ears of those who are not willing to hear it. Those who listened are already here.</p>

<p>If you truly want to fight in a battle for information you will first have to establish trust. Then you need to be transparent and only speak the truth. If you mistakenly share something which is false it needs to be addressed and trust will need to be re-established.</p>

<p>Or maybe we have a problem deeper than it may appear. What if the very way we debate is non constructive? For hundreds of years we have practiced the archaic methods of debate. I feel it is time for something new. I have been looking into alternatives such as the 6 Thinking Hats, and believe that with a little alteration they could be used in a constructive way on Reddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think I have exactly what you are looking for.</p>

<p>There is a list of proven conspiracies in the wiki of this subreddit. This is the link:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/wiki/locc">List of Proven Conspiracies - r/conspiracy wiki</a></p>

<p>An interesting thread that I&#39;ve also found while searching this sub was this one:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/70qvx7/updated_list_of_proven_conspiracies_and_hidden/">List of Proven Conspiracies 2</a></p>

<p>Which is also a list of proven conspiracies, but from a different user (and I believe not a part of the official r/conspiracy wiki, though I could be wrong and the conspiracies are likely to overlap).</p>

<p>I found all of this by typing &quot;list of proven conspiracies&quot; in this sub&#39;s search bar. If you want more, I recommend you do the same or search for a similar term.</p>

<p>Personally, what I think also needs to happen, besides people becoming aware of various conspiracies, is people becoming empowered and knowing that there is plenty they can do to help themselves and the world become a better place. Much of this sub is riddled with apathy, because the reality of our society and our world is so insane in so many ways (and here more than anywhere we are bombarded with this - many times people know what&#39;s going on and simply avoid this sub and similar places because they don&#39;t think they can do anything). People are demoralized and apathetic. </p>

<p>As said, people think they can&#39;t do anything, they can&#39;t help themselves and they can&#39;t make a difference.</p>

<p>But this is incorrect. Every action helps. Every decision to improve yourself, to awaken others, to make better and more informed choices about what you consume, how you take care of your health, how you treat other people, who you vote for in a local or federal setting, the way you act, what you should do for a living,....all actions in life can lead to a better society, better planet and better you. Any activism is also very welcome. People can do so much through spreading awareness, peacefully protesting...etc.</p>

<p>I think that it&#39;s a good idea to give people awareness of what is happening, but besides conspiracy theories (and facts mind you), you should also attempt to bring articles and posts to the surface which help empower people. The best is always a mixture of awakening and empowerment. The truth is there aren&#39;t that many articles and sites like that. I have attempted to make a few threads like that here and elsewhere on Reddit, but my time is limited. The true way to help is always to help people become aware of what&#39;s going on and then tell them that they can do something about it, they are not helpless to change themselves, the world and bring peace into their own lives, their own families, communities, countries - and ultimately onto the whole planet.</p>

<p>Best of luck on your journey to help out. Your intention is noble, I hope you figure out the best way to proceed and make a difference. As you take action and move forward, I recommend you follow reason, but listen to your intuition as well.</p>

<p>Best wishes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to give people a reason to listen, everyone&#39;s aware that the world is shit and corrupt but if that&#39;s true what&#39;s the point in trying, people need to be just as aware that it can be changed and improved with 100% cooperation from everyone. When I get into conspiracys I start thinking that everything is dark and scary and that I can&#39;t do anything, but when I hear stories about people that are high up being exposed e.g. Harvey Weinstein, I feel like there really is hope for the little people, everyone needs to know that we need to improve our way of life bye taking all the power from one person and sharing it equally, and that despite the fact our leaders are sociopaths the world really can be changed no matter how controlled it is bye the enemy, at the end of the day we&#39;re the ones that are giving big companies money and power and we are more in control of them than they are of us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If people didn&#39;t care we wouldn&#39;t be one of the fastest growing subs month over month. The subscribers have been exploding over the last year or two.   </p>

<p>Maybe people do care just don&#39;t know how to take action or change anything so should we focus on that? I am not sure where to begin with that other than getting more people to question the narrative being fed to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely. How to take action. That gives people who already are aware the stuff to actually do something. The only issue is, is that what people like me anyway, believe would fix the problem, most people won&#39;t want to do.</p>

<p>The best way to take action is if we see a power of some sort that&#39;s corrupt is to stop feeding it and stop using it. Cut it off. But people don&#39;t want to give up the benefits they get to fix the problem. They&#39;d rather change the system so they can have their cake and eat it, too, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s even possible. And if it is, it&#39;ll take us many more years to get there and idk if we have that kind of time anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you got your dad to see it in his 50s, you’re doing something right. Us older ones find changing our belief systems extremely difficult for the most part. </p>

<p>BUT that said, I will say this commenter has a point. Getting older generations to wake up is important but if you want change that will last, look to the upcoming generations.  Plant seeds of truth in their little minds today, tomorrow it will grow into a mighty oak.  They are our best chances for ending the tyranny once and for all.</p>

<p>Kind of like Whitney Houston sang, “I believe the children are our future/teach them well and let them lead the way.”   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think we need a combination of platforms for the people to take hold of government. A strong leader without incentive to be bought off is key, but that is nearly impossible to maintain, and we need a revolving door for when those people are taken out (either through bribes or assassination). A strong moral code for a president type leader not willing to play ball with wall street, the MIC, and TPTB. The combination of awareness, a new party (call it the people&#39;s party or whatever) with backings of senators and congressmen and women, and a strong sense of interpretation of the laws is key. Frankly the reason politics can be so corrupt breaks down to law and lawyers ability to maneuver within those laws through complicated legal speak. It&#39;s a daunting task that could ultimately trigger a war as well. PM me if you want to discuss more, but a lot of pieces need to fall in place for this to work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And transferring that to religion (if that&#39;s what you mean by spiritual---you could also just mean spirituality) doesn&#39;t solve the issue. It&#39;s still making up reasons to not fully do something or fix the problem. Some god or some higher dimensional entity or messiah, whatever one chooses to call it, is supposed to fix the problems as long as you follow the plan and then you never fix anything.</p>

<p>I see it as my responsibility to try and do something to make a difference in any way I can and hope more people come around to that. I know there are a lot of people who also feel that way and really do what they can but there are so many more who are idle, myself included.</p>
