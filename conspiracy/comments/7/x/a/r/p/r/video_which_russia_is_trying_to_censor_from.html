       First things first, this video is dangerous as far as the Russian state is concerned. There is a lot of reporting on how they are trying to remove it via legal measures, found
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=navalny&amp;amp;rlz=1C1CHBD_enUS760US760&amp;amp;oq=navalney&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.2471j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8">
        here
       </a>
       but my favorite is from the
       <a href="https://themoscowtimes.com/news/google-warns-navalny-over-sex-graft-investigation-60484">
        Moscow Times
       </a>
       . That is because of what the video exposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;amp;v=RQZr2NgKPiU">
        Here
       </a>
       is the video in question. It features Alexei Navalny, probably the only politician in Russia who  is standing up to Putin right now. So, lets start with the rundown on the important stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video starts with Navalny showing footage of a bunch of sex workers entering his office, trying to be provacative and get footage of them with the staff. This has happened before, but with angry men looking for a fight. The women are kicked out by the staff before anything happens, but Navalny and his team find their social media accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads them to the account of one of them in particular, who documented (idiotically, via instagram) a meeting between
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Eduardovich_Prikhodko">
        Russia's deputy prime minister
       </a>
       and
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleg_Deripaska">
        Oleg Deripaska
       </a>
       who you may remember as the
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBD_enUS760US760&amp;amp;ei=PgaDWpHTNcSUzwKxwKT4Bw&amp;amp;q=oleg+deripaska+manafort+debt&amp;amp;oq=oleg+deripaska+manafort+debt&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i160k1l4.4727.5366.0.5485.5.5.0.0.0.0.137.439.2j2.4.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.4.438....0.9DurKn9xhoE">
        man who Paul Manafort owes a lot of money to
       </a>
       . Based off the conversation in the video taken from a girl's instagram, it was a 'fishing trip', which is a disguise for actual informal meetings between a high government official and somebody with a lot of informal power who was offered private updates on the US campaign by Paul Manafort, who a) worked under Trump's campaign for free while b) again, owing Oleg millions. Navalny also connects these images to a book the woman wrote about her experience as a callgirl to oligarchs, which adds more context and proof that this was more then a fishing trip. She leaves the date in the book, which allows Navalny to track down Oleg's boat and planes at the time (in Norway, outside of Russia), making it more blatant that this was a shady meeting between a oligarch and the senior politician brought in on a private jet to a trip on a yacht with prostitutes, all paid for by the oligarch.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads to two interesting conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Such meetings are how oligarchs work with a government; untracable (unless they fail opsec, such as here) and off the books. Did Manafort have any such secret meetings with Oleg that led to information going from Manafort to Oleg to Putin/FSB/Any other high level Russian figure?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) At the 22 minute mark, Navalny gets to the footage of Putin shaming an old Prosecutor General Skuratov who was caught with prostitutes and then forced to resign, again, which Putin lead as the director of the FSB. The Prosecutor General's defense? They were paid for and sent by an oligarch. This has happened multiple times in Russia's history as a 'democracy'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earlier on in the video (2:38) the prostitute whose Instagram gave away the meeting also put up a video stating that she or her friends will eventually get Navalny in bed, videotape it, and expose it to the world. This is all a common tactic in Russia to build up Kompromat, or compromising material on a person which can then be used against a person. I'm not saying that the Trump tape allegations are true, but that they may be true because it fits the Russian's intelligence tactics, as proven here by Navalny and the idiotic callgirl who recorded too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, this is how Russian oligarchy works. The rich businessmen 'take care' of politicians with bribes, sex, and everything in between. Back channels are used to keep things secret. If things don't work out and the politician stops being complaint, the evidence comes out and their career is ruined.
      </p>
      <p>
       People here may be skeptical for good reason, but consider this.
      </p>
      <p>
       A) Russian mobsters (who often work hand in hand with the oligarchs and politicians in Russia to preserve their status quo)
       <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/fbi-russia-mafia-trump-tower-two-years-2016-presidential-election-us-money-laundering-alimzhan-a7642851.html">
        lived in Trump Towers
       </a>
       , giving them considerable access to the then regular businessman.
      </p>
      <p>
       B)
       <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/trump-sold-40-million-estate-russian-oligarch-100-million-and-democratic-802613?piano_t=1">
        Shady real estate deals between Trump and Russians
       </a>
       which are often done to launder money (in that example, buy a property at $40 mil, sell at $100 mil for no obvious reason).
      </p>
      <p>
       C) Trump's time in Russia (most notably the 2013 Miss Universe pagent)
      </p>
      <p>
       D) Russians are experts at espionage and have been since before the US had the CIA. They had a) access to Trump b) the pattern of getting kompromat on a prominent figure as a means of control or removal. As a prominent figure in America even before he started him current campaign, it is possible that his proximity to Russians made him an easy target for their tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       E) He refused to put in sanctions against Russia, even though the sanctions bill was passed by both parties with almost no votes against it. If that, along with all the facts you've just read, doesn't at least set off alarms on why and how Russian intelligence works, doesn't sound off any alarms for you, I'd be surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, this video is fascinating because it gives us insight into how a possible connection between Trump's camp and Russia but also actual contextual evidence of why the Trump Pee tape allegation is considered a serious possibility by the intelligence community. But considering the

       Very well written.   Out of curiosity does getting caught with a prostitute kill your political future in Russia?  Trump had managed to survive the Stormy Daniels allegations so far, and he admits to chasing women while married on tape.

       A sex tape will ruin a career as long as it gets out there, I can't think of any actual sex tape that hasn't. And again, it has been used by Russian intelligence before, so I'm guessing that yes it will.

       Because it's only allegations, not a tape. This gives plausible deniability, which is very credible as far as his base is concerned so that doesn't matter unless there is concrete evidence that cannot be disputed.

       Yeah I could see a tape costing Trump some voters, although the evangelical community has already sold their souls by backing him.   I'm just not very familiar with Russian culture and how effective the sex scandals work over there.  Would be nice to see an interview with the call girl who accidentally leaked thus stuff on Instagram assuming she is still alive somewhere.

       This is where you're wrong. To understand the Trump base, you have to think about it from their perspective. Those allegations, to them, are just fake news trying to take Trump down. There is a difference between allegations and an actual undisputable tape. The Billy Bush recording is somewhere in between, and as far as his base is concerned, he was just shooting the shit and having fun; the liberals made it out to be more then it is.

       She's definitely in trouble, but she also appears to be deeply tied to Oleg the oligarch (and her stunt in Navalny's office shows her to be in the pro-Putin/status quo camp) so who knows what would happen. But either way, anything she says about this from here on out will be a spin on what happened and cannot be trusted.

       Here's another article from the same day from the same paper:

       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/01/31/stormy-daniels-is-now-denying-her-affair-with-trump-heres-how-shes-confirmed-it-before/?utm_term=.96d6972ecce8">

      <p>
       The historical evidence:
      </p>
      <p>
       A 2009 conversation with political consultants where she said she made him watch "shark week" for 3 hours, a 2011 unpublished interview with some magazine, and a 2016 article from someone saying the story he heard was the same as the story told in the unpublished 2011 interview.
      </p>
      <p>
       One simple question. If this was true, why didn't the interview get published in 2011? Was it that it couldn't stand up to scrutiny? Fears of libel? If so, why should we rely on it as any sort of evidence of anything at this point?

       So, then what other evidence points to the story being even remotely true versus libelous hearsay?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it the 2009 comment about making her watch shark week for 3 hours?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is it the 2016 article that says the story she told in 2011 is very similar to the story she told in 2016?

       <p>
        The In Touch transcript quotes Daniels as saying she had a sexual encounter with Trump at the tournament, then continued speaking with him on the phone or seeing him in person for about a year.

      <p>
       The whole thing is very fishy.   As long as Daniels won't confirm it the story probably won't go anywhere.   But Alana Evans is the reason it popped back up when she said she was asked to join Daniels and Trump in his hotel room.

       Daniels was willing to go on record with a lie detector about the affair.  No, the lie detector does not hold up in a court room but we aren't in a court room.  It definitely adds credence to the story that she was willing to do that.  Why her story has changed?...I assume because of a NDA but we won't know unless something else leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alana Evans is no more or less believable then anyone else.  She already has some fame from her work in the porn industry so I don't know why she would make that story up.

       They all denied it and she signed an NDA (if I recall correctly, the payment for it was found and that's how the whole affair was unearth long after it happened). Except when she thought she wasn't going to get the money she was promised, she gave an interview which was then shelfed for a while out of respect. However, when she came out to deny it (because of the NDA), the interview was released because it was on the record before she signed it, thus being a good way of her not getting in trouble but the truth being revealed.

       They came to an agreement. Trump didn't fulfil his part (

       ). Stormy talks to reporters and threatens Trump to go public with it. Donald pays up and she asks for the article to be shelved. Then the payment is found and people start talking about whether or not it happened, and the reporters that held on to the interview decided it would be okay to do it.

       I'm imagining that she doesn't get the money, assumes its not going to happen, gives up, then Trump pops his head in the global sphere, and then she has a lot more leverage with credible negative information.

       "I'm imagining" is a great way to say "I have no idea but this is what I think happened".  All I've done is question your timeline and very easily poked gaping holes in your idea of the narrative.

       After that, maybe you can answer how it feels to have fallen for fake news. Do you think your ideological committment to Donald Trump made you assume any negative information about him is false? Maybe that played a role in it. Who knows what other beliefs you have were effected by that bias.

       fwiw, oligarch is just a very rich person. i would say with power, but as we all know money in a monetized, property based rentier system, like ours, saying this is redundant.
      </p>
      <p>
       russian oligarch's are often checked by putin, keeping russia from becoming the plutonomy of america's completely unchecked oligarchs. they don't hate putin because they love russians and freedom and democracy. they hate him because he keeps them from being as rich as they want to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       make no mistake, we are run by oligarch's, we just refuse to call spades spades.
      </p>
      <p>
       in terms of evilness, russia's oligarch's are on par with putin. they deserve no more sympathy than putin. putin deserves no more vilification than they do. many have literally killed people and all have had people killed.

      <p>
       you seem gung ho about sanctions.
      </p>
      <p>
       sanctions are evil. they are a modern euphemism for blockade, which is a less modern euphemism for siege. they have almost no impact on the powerful and the rich and the govt, but cause untold suffering on everyone else. it was our sanctions that lead to the deaths by starvation of at least 500,000 iraqi children in the 1990s. sanctions bernie sanders repeatedly voted for and of which madeline albright said were worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
       trump is like bill clinton, sleaze and scandal are their MOs, thus you can even accuse them of rape and it has no effect. let that sink in. hillary clinton ran for office 3 times, won once, and she is married to a man who has been accused of rape since 1978. bill clinton was elected president with a rape alligation hanging over his head. trump is a serial adulterer, as has been known for decades. he already survived the grabbing pussies video. you can only compromise people with shame.
      </p>
      <p>
       if the tape comes out, then what? once it's out it has no power. it can't be used to blackmail. it is 2018. dems need trump to run against in 2020. he isn't going anywhere.

       Great post. I find it patently absurd that this seems to be the only theory around here that people will post about every single day claiming it's all bullshit. Multiple posts a day saying this theory is ridiculous and people who believe there's something to it are sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has had three wives and a bunch of kids. He loves grabbing pussy and fuckin women. It's not that crazy to believe he might have gotten caught up with some pussy in Russia at some point in time. And since they do this shit, it's not crazy that they could have gotten him on tape.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have plenty of interesting stuff hit the front page that are 1000 times more ridiculous than this theory. It's refreshing to not see this post sitting at 0 right now. Because most of the time someone posts about a Trump Russia connection, they get an army of downvotes and ridicule.

       It's the weirdest thing, isn't it? I mean, here we have what could possibly be one of the biggest conspiracies in American history unfolding right before our eyes, and a sub

       The main reason I keep coming here is I want to see the crystallization moment when suddenly people here start seeing it for what it is.

       Not only is it unfolding right before our eyes, but it's the perfect example of the corruption that everyone knows goes on in politics. When someone says "corrupt politicians" its shit like this that immediately comes to mind. That's why it's so weird when people say all politicians are corrupt but then spend so much time trying to discredit this very obvious example.

       Or modern day Democrats and their supporters. Youve stated a lot of actual facts. Possible coincidences and possible connections. But nothing concrete, which is why this investigation is now going on two years with nothing brought forward conclusive, and why topics like this must continue to thrive.
Is there something there? Maybe. Probably. Keep this going, its important. But I'd be cautious as to being vested and determined toward one desired outcome. Good post.

       A very good point. It is important to note two things though.
      </p>
      <p>
       A) Both sides have firm convictions of their beliefs. When the end result is determined and all the evidence is collected, the losing side must accept it. A problem is that the the deep state narrative has been set up to reject any bad news and Trump feeds the narrative in his speeches that the investigation is a coup/people's votes are being stolen. If Mueller, in his current state, is allowed to work unopposed, and comes out and says "There is nothing" then I think most that believe there is a connection will accept it. I honestly fear that this will result in a civil war unless there is concrete proof on either side.
      </p>

       I would heavily disagree. 4 charges, 2 (maybe 3 with Manafort) plea bargins with little to no info because of how secretive it is. A ton of public evidence that isn't being acted on in order to continue the investigation. If this were a normal state of loaw, for example, it would be totally lawful and proper to have Don Jr. indicted for conspiracy to commit treason, as per his own emails and Bannon's statements. The investigation is building a huge case, because this is a huge situation that can implode into war if it's not done right. This investigation will continue until there is a solid case built. Don't take the fact that we don't have all the info as a sign that there's nothing.

       All the Trump Russia posts get upvoted. The second this gets tied back into Democrats you get.down voted into oblivion.

       Nope, nothing to see here. The conspiracy forum isn't compromised..nope. Clinton sells the Russians a bunch of Uranium but it's Trump we gotta worry about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope people reading these comments understands that when it comes to real conspiracies it's not the upvoted/downvotes you need to look at but the bias. When a good point is downvoted to oblivion or when a bad post gets up voted to the top.

       The main reason for that is because there is this guy named "Q" that posts stuff purporting that Trump is taking down the deep state. He is a literal God to a lot of people on these subs because of it. Personally, I wouldn't be shocked if Q wasn't Bannon, Roger Stone or Alex Jones for that matter. The fact that Bannon or Jones  have access to data from their media platforms, or Stone from his contacts(no freaking telling where), I believe it would be fairly easy to formulate what really gets Trumps base going and how to steer them with info. The thing about my theory is that if any of yall watched the last season of Homeland, that season pretty much was a foreshadowing of how the election went with fake social media accounts, Alex Jones being CIA, and that the intelligence community wanted a President who they could get to go to war with Iran. The last one is beginning to gain steam.

       Yep, I agree it is a huge issue. That's what happens when this sub is so divided between the left and right. It's a tough barrier to crack, as there appears to be truth to both the Russian interference/Trump tape as kompromat theory as well as the deep state misconduct theories. I would say that the latter'deep state' theory doesn't look as bad if you consider that if there is truth in the former theory, the latter might be used to prevent the Russians from benefiting too much from their victory in getting Trump in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the fact that people think that either side is 100% correct without reading news from all sides or critically thinking of the many intricacies of this issue are the ones that are 100% wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       My issue with the 'conspiracy theorists' is the political bias that many bring with them, finding theories where they aren't in an attempt to explain politics and refusing to consider theories that go against their political beliefs.

       I know right?  We are so lucky to have moral intelligence communities that would never use their powers for blackmail.  It's a good thing Americans working for our 3-letter agencies are inherently good as we have no public oversight.  If they weren't, they could really do some damage and there really wouldn't be any way to stop them.

       Well in all seriousness, the US intelligence agencies have a lot more checks and balances then Russian ones, so the comparrison isn't the best to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, all it means is that the US agencies have to work harder to avoid getting caught while the Russian agencies only have to work to appease Putin and the ruling oligarchs.

       It's a legitimate comparison to make because we really don't have any idea how effective our system of checks and balances actually performs. Another factor that comes into play is I assume our agencies are more powerful and more secretive making them hard to track.
      </p>
      <p>
       All things considered I would have to agree with you to rather life under FBI than FSB.  But to assume ours infallible or free from scandal/abuse would be a naive assumption.

       This 100%. The US govt shamelessly employed Nazi and Showa Japanese scientists who vivisected other human beings. We tested chemical and biological warfare agents on prisoners. We threw people out of windows. The CIA, on the books, worked on MKULTRA until the mid 70s. The Church Commission is still largely classified. If you think the FBI/CIA are better than KGB/FSB, you just haven't read enough.

       The FISA warrent against Carter Page, if you include all the info, will probably in the end be seen as legit. But there are also probably dozens of muslims who were actually spied on improperly as the republicans are complaining about because they called their grandma back home in countries where AQ operates.

       If you honestly don't like the power Trump has then you should be advocating for the President to hold less power.  It can't be OK for the President to be able to do whatever they want when it is your guy and then it's facist when it's not your guy. It's not Trumps fault he has the power he does.  He didn't give himself these powers.  So  I think it is sort of a fan-fiction fairy tale to dream about bringing down an over-powerful government by removing a person merely holding a position.

       I am a registered independent, and I don't like Obama. He hadthe same foreign policy as Bush, with some socially liberal domestic policies. But he was nowhere near as authoritarian as the right is making him out to be, and not at all when compared to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama didn't literally try and hold fake news awards. He didn't ask for loyalty pledges. He didn't publically attack anyone who isn't 100% behind him.

       I agree Trump should not act the way he often does which I just chalk up as unprofessional and lacking charisma.  However comparing his media relations to Obama's is less than fair.  Trump has been attacked for some of the stupidest/meaningless shit.

       I was going to say, the way I see it authoritarianism went into full swing, continued under Bush, and doesn't look like it is going anywhere even if the FBI brought charges against Trump.  When it comes to recent Presidential candidates we have had the choice between authoritarianism and authoritarianism.  And my point is not whataboutism it is if we are going to blame this on Trump then we would  also simultaneously have to be pretending it would have been different under Clinton.  We would have still had plenty of authoritarianism under Clinton which is why I think it is dishonest to act like we had a choice and we picked the wrong option.

       Exactly.  Being attacked for not "disavowing" things is so ridiculous.  Like when he got attacked for not "disavowing" racists rally when the reality was he denounced racism while simultaneously saying not everyone involved was a racist and he wasn't going to label them as such. It's bullshit. It's meaningless.  I personally don't rank a President hitting me in the feels as important.  I'm more concerned with his policy decisions and you know things that actually impact our lives.

       Not sure why or where you think I said this.  My original point was you can't compare Trump's handling of the media to Obama's because it's a completely different situation with the onslaught of baseless attacks.  I challenge you to find a handful of examples where Obama was attacked for similar frivolous things by the mainstream media and link them here.

       right there shows that we arent going to change each others opinions whatsoever. i dont think any of the attacks on trump have been frivolous, they seem to all be credible issues that should be at the least investigated then addressed. While I think there were a large number of attacks by the GOP slung at Obama that were literally frivolous shit.

       Same/same but with different biases.  Though I can tell you I never bought into the frivolous attacks on Obama either.  However I did have issues with some of his policies just like I do Trump.

       I mean i tend to consider a foreign threat to US elections a major issue that should be acted upon. Considering that every single intelligence agency in the world says its happened and going to happen, but the president refuses to acknowledge that?? The fact the president has refused to acknowledge russia meddling when the House, Senate, and intelligence community, oh and previous administration, oh and military ALL said that Russia meddled in the elections and even put it in to a bill to be passed by congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are suddenly supposed to believe that Russia is the best friend of the US?? come on lol, we are in conspiracy, yet the greatest conspiracy of US head of state suddenly loving Russia and the accounts on reddit screaming support of russia or deflecting it by saying 'muh russia' are just ignoring it.

       It's a little off to me that there is a massive Anti-Russia campaign because they allegedly (Remember we haven't seen any evidence or examples) tried to influence people on social media like they are the only ones doing it.  If you consider what they have been accused of, releasing REAL/TRUE information on a bad Presidential candidate and then the media has people like you irate demanding action now as if they did something super evil is what I find off.  Why would a conspiracy theorist be mad a foreign country released dirt on a Presidential candidate while simultaneously endorsing the Steele dossier when they are the exact same type of influence?  Why does it matter where it came from?  Because Russia has an agenda?  Did Christopher Steele not have an agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me the outrage is what seems off to me as so far it is relatively baseless and unjustified.  Shouldn't we at least see some evidence or examples to get a feel for what exactly their influence campaign consisted of?  Since when do we not care about evidence, all the sudden have blind trust in our IC, and call for action against a country with the ONLY justification being they shared dirty secrets about Clinton on social media or pushed hashtags?  Seems to me like people are largely being told how to feel about this aka conditioned without giving it much thought.  I assume part of it is the high emotion regarding strong feelings against Trump.  If Clinton won I think they would have had to come up with different reasons to incite outrage.

       Since when do you decide to give the benefit of the doubt to a foreign country that has a 70 year history of active, prolonged espionage and has been a declared enemy against the United States?  And you do that before acknowledging that every single US agency (employing actual Americans) and both political parties acknowledged that Russia meddled AND members of the 5 eyes backed it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lol. Its laughable that you would be so willing to believe a foreign government such as Russia before even considering that maybe the functioning US intelligence community maaaaay be on to something.

       Almost all the issues related to Trump and the media have been Trump's making. Honestly, I watch media from the both sides and the only time I though I saw actual unfair footage was from the koi pond feeding incident. He's been attacked for stupid shit because he does/says stupid shit, like the inaguration numbers issue.

       This is true in the sense that they were drastically increasing the state's surveillence powers. Trump's is literally attacking the checks and balances system, purging the FBI of his enemies, and trying to destroy media for keeping him accountable. Those are two very different kinds, and I'd rather a surveillence state then 
somebody trying to set up one man rule.

       Aside from keeping up the patriot act style spying, how would Clinton have acted authoritarian?

       I find this post fascinating because Oleg Deripaska's name has just come under media scrutiny in the last few days for a very
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       reason than OP projects.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Deripaska
       </strong>
       (along with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov) are represented by lawyer (and registered foreign lobbyist)
       <strong>
        Adam Waldman
       </strong>
       - the guy that Senator
       <strong>
        Mark Warner
       </strong>
       (anti-Trump Democrat) was texting and using as a conduit to meet and communicate with
       <strong>
        Christopher Steele
       </strong>
       (author of the Dossier) in March 2017. To what ends those communications took place remains to be seen, but the connections are staggering.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do applaud the attempt to try to tie Deripaska to Trump through his blackmail attempts and through Manafort, and it's still plausible, but he's actually closer to whatever the other side is trying to do or did - perhaps doing the very thing OP states - giving the illusion of credence to the pee-pee tape claim. The fact remains, it's been over 20 months since the IC was clued in to a possible compromise of the Trump team and not one of the 10 central tenants of the dossier has been substantiated by the FBI, CIA, Buzzfeed or anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I don't doubt that Trump has had some unsavory business dealings with Russians (among the Mob and others), but claiming that that the tape may exist because that's how the "Russian oligarchy" works, is ridiculous and reflects the relative lack of knowledge of OP. That's not just how the Russians do things, friend, that's how the intelligence community works. Google "brown stone operations". The CIA and Mossad basically patented sexual blackmail and have even raised the stakes many times to include encounters with minors or people that later go "missing".
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, the more this unravels, the more I'm interested. The intrigue is too good.

       If we believe the FBI/CIA, then we have to wait for their results. Open investigations don't reveal what they've found till then end. They could know all of the allegations are right or wrong, and we wouldn't know until it's all out in the open.

       The Russians had a global intelligence operation before the CIA was even a thing. That's why the US had trouble breaking the Iron Curtain, because much US intel was compromised early on. It's obviously not the case now, but Russian intelligence has a long and decorated history.

       I'm saying that since Warner texted Deripaska's LOBBYIST IN DC, during the investigation that he's co-chair of, to set up a meeting with the guy who WROTE THE DOSSIER that is the crux of all investigations so far linking Trump and Russia, is extremely suspicious, as it is. Why is the guy Deripraska is paying for influence in DC talking to the guy heading the Senate committee investigating the Trump / Russian ties? Yes, I'd say that concrete connection makes plenty of sense, wouldn't you?
      </p>
      <p>
       To your second point, everything even remotely (many not at all) incriminating, to this point, has been leaked. There are reasons for that. There are reasons Flynn hasn't been sentenced. There are reasons we're now getting leaks from the IG's investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to your third point, sure, we all take tips and tricks and hints from each other. All I'm saying is there's nothing particularly uniquely or distinctly Russian about sexual blackmail and it's long been associated in the IC with CIA &amp; Mossad. Russians are more synonymous with disappearing folks, though Kompromat was and probably still is in their wheelhouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really enjoyed your post, and think that Navalny and Deripraska will both affect the remainder of the story that's yet to be told.

       Again, it's me who's looking at this one-sidedly? Wow. You're connecting a guy so disparately that you rely on:

       <li>

         Russians blackmail

       That's not sound.

       If you're following along, not all of these reasons will be a mystery to you. Mueller's team has been leaking as well. We'll see soon!

       Lol. Okay. Warner, Hillary, Podesta, etc. didn't try and set up a back channel to Russia to avoid domestic intelligence surveillance. They didn't set up a meeting with a Russian lawyer believed to be a government agent for dirt on Hillary. They didn't refuse to put on sanctions against Russia in the face of almost entire congressional support.

       You're literally providing one piece of evidence and claiming that my comparison is bad. But there's cobwebs of Russia/Trump connections. So yeah, I'm not taking you seriously.

       The ties between Trump and gangsters have gone on for a long time. Not just Russian gangsters. While obviously, there is never any solid evidence, there is tons of smoke in a lot of different places. The main issue with it is that "Q" has cut off about 95% of the people in the Conspiracy sub with his posts so no one wants to believe Trump is dirty.

       Not exactly, the oligarchs are their own political sphere. They sometimes compete with the security services over influence. But in the end, they are all on the same side right now, tied with Putin. However many are unhappy with their Western stuff being locked up because of sanctions.

       I have no doubt Trump has shady financial connections with the Russian mob=government but I don't think it has anything to do with the election and certainly doesn't justify calling RT a 'propaganda' outlet anymore than the BBC. The media's russophobia was manufactured and carefully curated after the Russians fucked up our Syrian regime change, this anti-russia stuff was almost non-existent 5 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       To restate, I don't like Trump, I don't think the Russians are "good" or "bad" actors (although they do good and bad things just like the US, they act in their personal interest) and I think this investigation wouldn't be happening if Russia had played along in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and don't worry I think the Qanon worship is absurd, I don't think Trump is going to fix anything. I just don't think Putin secretly feeds the Trump administration it's actions in any sense.

      <p>
       There are many ways that Russian involvement could have played out. For example, Russia could have kompromat on one of Trump's higher ups (as they do on Manafort, whose no longer in the Trump team) but nothing on Trump. That person utilizes his position of power to push for Russian interests while Trump is none the wiser. But because Trump is attacking the investigation, that person could get away with it because of that.

       Absolutely true, I honestly think I phrased my last sentence way too definitively. I do have to say that the website you linked seems pretty unapologetically anti-Russian. That certainly doesn't imply poor journalism but it colors the world view of anyone who consumes it (as my sources do as well). I looked and couldn't find anything regarding the
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/30/russia-ukraine-war-kiev-conflict">
        US backed unconstitutional coup that occured during the Kerry\Obama state department years
       </a>
       so that's kind of what I'm getting at, it's always only half the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       A nice quote from the opinion article (I imagine I'd point it out before someone else does):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When the Ukrainian president was replaced by a US-selected administration, in an entirely unconstitutional takeover, politicians such as William Hague brazenly misled parliament about the legality of what had taken place: the imposition of a pro-western government on Russia's most neuralgic and politically divided neighbour.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So if the US
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       have slipped a puppet into Ukraine with the intentions of fast tracking them to becoming home to NATO military exercises on
       <em>
        another
       </em>
       Russian border. Doesn't this at least make Russia's
       <strong>
        indefensible
       </strong>
       (I'm serious) move into Donetsk seem just maybe like a bad reaction to US imperialism as opposed to as the media paints it? (i.e. some cold hearted bastards wanting to watch it all burn)
      </p>
      <p>
       My issue is this idea that the Russians, as one of three world super powers are somehow defacto "bad actors". Sure there's a bit on china building islands in the news but it has nowhere near the same urgency. When the second "smoking gun" intelligence report relies on things like "the hours are Russian time zone working hours" and "Cyrillic keyboards were used" along with some generic code fragments, I'm sorry but I've never been much of an appeal to authority kinda guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       My only point is that this push naturally creates a dichotomy between us and them: the gangster oligarch sociopaths vs the hallowed halls of Congress. I would hope everyone thinks that is absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am looking forward and anxious to see,what Mueller comes up with and I would not deny it if I was facing evidence more substantial that the Steele "Dossier".

       Tinfoil conspiracy horseshit. Also, Navalny only has 2% support of the Russian population, which is considerably less than Russia's mainstream opposition. He's not an "opposition figure", let alone a
leader as he's often called in corporate media.
      </p>
      <p>
       New York Times source before you predictably call me a Russian bot:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Opinion polls conducted by the independent Levada Center show Mr. Putin’s approval rating at around 80%
        </strong>
        and indicate that he would crush Mr. Navalny in a race.** A Levada poll in early December found that
        <strong>
         66% of respondents who said they planned to vote would choose Mr. Putin, with only 2% favoring Mr. Navalny.
        </strong>

       , which also mentions several opposition figures with greater popularity than Navalny. Western corporate media coverage is disproportionately in favour of the objectively less popular "opposition" figures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Navalny's lawyer acknowledged that he broke Moscow's protest laws. This happens repeatedly. The city grants him a permit, he switches the venue without notifying officials, and organizes protests larger than the venue permits can support...
      </p>
      <p>
       For such a leading opposition figure, it's extremely odd that after these repeated instances, he has only been recently released without charges after serving his mere 30-day sentence on charges that can net someone up to
       <strong>
        thirty years imprisonment.
       </strong>
       The sentence is consistent with the severity of his crime.

      <p>
       For being an "opposition candidate" (although that is demonstrably false), he seems to agree with Putin on a few key issues, and has notable similarities to Trump, a person you presumably oppose, in his proposed policies. How is Navalny "standing up to Putin", exactly?

       You do realize that what you're doing is called "poisoning the well", right? Just because Navalny isn't a perfect Democrat
       <sup>
        TM
       </sup>
       doesn't mean that he's bullshit. Neither does low support from a poll. Russian political society has been built around Putin and there is a bit of a cult of personality around him as well. Just because Navalny doesn't have huge numbers in polls doesn't mean he's not an opposition figure. That's literally the stupidest thing in this thread.

       Yes, the Russian people were not naturally Communists. Solzhenitsyn, an eye witness to Soviet Russia said the Soviets were not Russians and not Christians. In fact Communism is an attack on the Christian Tsardom. It failed because it only knows how to destroy and surveil, not create.

       There is a nondisclosure agreement, or maybe not but she won't day which suggests there is one.... Or something like that.

       They all denied it and she signed an NDA (if I recall correctly, the payment for it was found and that's how the whole affair was unearth long after it happened). Except when she thought she wasn't going to get the money she was promised, she gave an interview which was then shelfed for a while out of respect. However, when she came out to deny it (because of the NDA), the interview was released because it was on the record before she signed it, thus being a good way of her not getting in trouble but the truth being revealed.

       My point was not for one to negate the other but just looking for acknowledgement that it happens.  Many people believe the Russians to be supervilians while simultaneously assuming our hands are completely clean.

       Daniels was willing to go on record with a lie detector about the affair.  No, the lie detector does not hold up in a court room but we aren't in a court room.  It definitely adds credence to the story that she was willing to do that.  Why her story has changed?...I assume because of a NDA but we won't know unless something else leaks.

       Alana Evans is no more or less believable then anyone else.  She already has some fame from her work in the porn industry so I don't know why she would make that story up.

       Pizzagate has far less and far less credible evidence and everyone on here believes that.
