        Millions and millions of people worship false idols. Social media stars, Hollywood. It's idol worship. Search up 'Kylie Jenner' on Instagram and look how many accounts there are dedicated to her. You'll be scrolling for a while.

      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the flipside; role models are important. But the culture around role-models has significantly changed and is affecting what children regard as important, admirable, or achievable. Social media allows anyone to be a role-model now, including the young and naive. It creates a sense of community around a figure that builds their status off a particular niche, behavior or subculture. So that person transcends their humanity, in a way. To put it plainly, I don't think teenagers should be worshipping each other.

        People are scared of technology and machines because of a
        <em>
         television drama
        </em>
        , and yet just about anyone can purchase a gun right now and slaughter their classmates.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The flipside; the top trending video on YouTube (currently) is about a robot (machine) that can walk and open doors. People are screaming in the comments "BLACK MIRROR!" because they're so influenced by the media to react with fear rather than embrace and celebrate what human beings can accomplish. It's fear that's keeping us dumb because so many believe that the repercussions of everything we do as human beings will result in destruction, rather than just being fxxking smart and knowing our boundaries. (excuse my language)

         People think racism isn't real. People "can't see colour". People are flabbergasted by the idea that someone would harm someone else for the colour of their skin... even though they themselves were shunned by the cool kids
         <em>
          just
         </em>
         for having acne. Even though the kid who acts gay gets assaulted on his way home. Even though the mean girls bully the girl who's geeky.

         Millions of people don't understand that their porn/social-media/youtube/reddit addiction is a result of complex systems in their brains telling them to search for pleasurable content. Dopamine gets released in your brain just by the act of
         <em>
          searching
         </em>
         for pleasurable content, while your brain rewires itself, establishing triggers and sensitivities to make it easier for you to get a 'high' off these things. People wonder, "What's wrong with me?" When they don't realize nothing is wrong. They're just human beings with brains that have been fucked with. It is not easy to overcome, but it is possible to overcome. Our minds are very vulnerable. You discover this in the book of Genesis. There is an entire industry dedicated to exploiting your mind and seducing you to temptation. It is called 'Advertising'.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The flipside; advertising isn't evil. It's necessary for a consumerist society. I study design in university. We learned about the historical context behind the very first
        <em>
         poster
        </em>
        . It may be one day my job to tell you to spend your hard earned money on something that you don't need in the grand scheme of life. But that's just the way the world works. However, I do believe that there should be more exposure on the way our brains react to certain things.

        When Facebook was first created, nobody thought "this is going to be addicting and monopolize on people's minds." No. Of course not. But when you look at the
        <em>
         function
        </em>
        of a social media site and the way we interact with it- the way our
        <em>
         brains
        </em>
        interact with it, we can then get a better understanding of
        <em>
         healthy
        </em>
        ways to manage our use.

        It's a "conspiracy" that politicians do things that seem shady and the results of their decision have ulterior motives. Look at the death of Jesus. Did Pontius Pilate
        <em>
         really
        </em>
        want Jesus killed?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The flipside; All politicians are influenced by something. Most of all, "the wealthy/elite/whatever" have businesses to monopolize and exercise their control. They do this by hiding knowledge and tricking you, the everyday person. So my saying that Pornhub, a business, takes advantage of your need to mate as a human being by tricking your brain into thinking that its mating, is not me condemning you or Pornhub. Businesses are successful when they can exploit your body and/or your mind. That's why when people develop addictions to pornography or social media they get depressed, because their brains are ADDICTED and they don't know it or don't know why, or can't stop. I'm no better, I was once addicted to pornography, and I'm still getting over my addiction to social media. But it's better you
        <em>
         know
        </em>
        what's happening to your brain rather than thinking "What's wrong with meeee?" when shit starts to get real.

       Western civilization really believes they are the greatest... And yet so many are unhappy as the rest of the world. Unhappy that they must toil through-out their lives. Bombarded by the knowledge of the information age, but blissfully unaware that they are just feeble human beings.

       I'm sorry but, who are
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       to make that judgment about me? I thought you'd catch on, but the hypocrisy is amazing...
      </p>
      <p>
       If
       <em>
        you

       would get off your high-horse, maybe you'd realize that the first thing any Christian would know is that we're

        all
       </em>
       sinners. Which makes all of us
       <em>
        equal
       </em>
       . Nobody likes to hear it, so I don't say it, but we're
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       capable of evil. Evil lives in all of our hearts, including both yours and mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while you sit here and judge me- like how you judged me off the
       <em>
        first reply
       </em>
       to this thread you made- how about you settle the fuck down and look in the mirror for once,
       <em>

       People are so sensitive to criticism. Yes, I brought up guns.

       That doesn't mean I'm saying throw 'em all in a pile and burn 'em.

       Yes, I brought up the negative effects of pornography, social media, and other easily accessible, easily addictive digital material.

       I'm putting this in another comment because it's relevant, but it is a separate point; and that is:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        What happened to boundaries?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that we need to be "limitless" as human beings?
      </p>
      <p>
       That we believe we're meant to inherit "unlimited power" and we're capable of all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Umm, no. Where is that thinking getting us? I'm sorry but it's just a sick, twisted and sociopathic mentality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at fucking North Korea. Look at the social media addiction. Look at the US political party and how they exercise their power. The lack of boundaries are just... unbelievable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do we believe that we're going to give machines unlimited power, and as humans, we're so limited?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like...
       <em>
        what?
       </em>
       Does anyone understand the point I'm trying to make here? What happened to establishing boundaries? What happened to being comfortable with what we've got?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are we just slaves to gluttony? Actually, I think we're just slaves to gluttony...

       I get your frustration. Could be alot of reasons for downvotes, aside from being a personal post I guess, probably obvious, it won't fly with everyone since chances you're going to hit one or two points that don't resonate due to people's preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from the things you've written I'm reading it from a overall big picture perspective. I've started to get a sense that maybe alot, even the most menial of things are introduced the popuation to steer us culturally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometime ago I learned that bacon and eggs was a dish conjured by Edward Bernays and the public was manipulated to accept it as the typical American breakfast. Long ago Christmas as a Holiday was put in place to replace pagan tradition and to assoicate it with Jesus, by zealous mindsets. Similar implementations are likely put in place, imo, sometimes to 'control the herd' and play on people' sense of unity and comfort. Complacent citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was it not for movies, pop culture, one can only guess what people's reactions to a door opening robot would be. Wihtout the constant mental ques, "Skynet is taking over the world", "People are inherently evil, won't generally get along even at the face of a mutual problem (looking at you Walking Dead)
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't imagine people would associate a door opening robot negatively, by default.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you bring up is something as fundemental and important to our situation as social engineering, imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was considering work in advertisement/sales myself (since you brought up the topic), but it  feels disingenuous, steering trend and manipulating a material mind for profit.

       I want to high-light something you said:
      </p>
      <p>
       'Triggered'
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that all reactions, whether negative or positive, should be considered, because it happens for a reason. For every action, there is a reaction, and between that process, are countless reasons and factors that result in the reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       If our species lands on Mars for the first time, and I exclaim in joy, am I 'triggered'?
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone spits on me, and I stand up for myself, am I 'triggered'?
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't just dumb down debate/discourse, it creates a culture in which we
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       police our expressions and decide what is and isn't important to feel in any particular circumstance, lest we be judged by another man.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wholeheartedly abhor the expression 'triggered', it is a word I can only imagine twelve-year olds would use, who have limited understanding of their own human psyche and social discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word 'triggered' is for hypocrites.

       I am strongly opposed against propaganda and brainwashing. I will try to lead your argument

      <p>
       Your argument fails on several accounts and premises. The first of which is that things are as they are and nothing can be done about them – we don't have to live in a consumerist society. It has been bent and broken to be that way. It is unhealthy, inhuman, destructive and bound to fail sooner or later. It's not how the world works. It has been made to do so, with great effort and over the course of decades and centuries and it can be unmade by the same means, overnight.
      </p>
      <p>
       My reason for the analogy: the psychology of propaganda and advertisement is a well-studied science. Using good advertisement to steer consumer behaviour is as fool-proof and predictable as pointing a gun and firing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is killing evil? Clearly not, if in self-defense. Is advertisement evil? Clearly not, if for the right causes and reasons: a bird's dance advertises his biological fitness to potential mating partners.

       I don't think my argument fails, per se. I just meant that I'm very much limited because so much has been built on the world already, and in order to exact change, I have to conform in some sort of way. A.K.A. I kind of have to brainwash people, and in order to unlock more knowledge I have to study underneath my superiors, those who do use advertising to help consumerism :P
      </p>
      <p>
       You totally right, we really don't have to live in a consumerist society; but right now we do, and
       <em>
        advertising for profit
       </em>
       (I should've clarified) is necessary to keep consumer society afloat. However, a consumerist society
       <em>
        manifests
       </em>
       off advertising and design which is actually, in a way, the study of the human mind. I hope more and more people come to realize this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right though, and thank you. I hope to use my knowledge to for the better, that being said I want to urge you to please encourage all the artisans to use their talents and continue to be creative. God has not revealed all to us. Advertising
       <em>
        was created
       </em>
       , and design is discovered. We need artisans to continue to discover design, and pioneer them for beauty and for good.

      <p>
       Thank you for understanding where I was going with my objection. You are right in saying that right now,
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to conform is often not an option, or at least not an easy one. Almost all lines of work are, in one way or another, designed to maintain and solidify the status quo of a profoundly broken system, and are subject to the logic of profit maximization. So unless we withdraw into a cottage in the woods, we
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       doing our part.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have often been advised to "play along" to gain the knowledge and "power" to "change the system from within"; however, I found that on the way to such a position, a lot of bad choices must be made; not making them would mean stagnation. There's a danger of self-rationalizition, "doing it for the greater good". I often cite the example of the Green Party in Germany, who originally wanted to abolish the NATO, got into parliament as hippie tree huggers with long beards and the mud of Woodstock between their toes, but in their first government coalition started the first war since WWII (the one against Yugoslavia). The Pirate party followed the same pattern in a fraction of the time. The system has a way to strengthen itself by opposition. Maybe that is why they say that "power corrupts"?
      </p>
      <p>
       So even as you prostitute yourself (that's what we do, whether as musicians or artists, we prostitute our soul and talent for money), don't make yourself too dependent on it; always be ready for when the time comes this system collapses. Your knowledge and talent will be needed, and that flame within you help through a cold morning. Don't waste it
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       yet.

I agree forums like undone are very accommodating to catharsis essays. You got downed possibly because of the I, me, mine-ing. You are pointing at grander schemes...and you will get well earned votes, points, karma...whatever the hell...when you drop in links to enlightening, related articles which help readers follow your thrusts.

       And I do want to touch on something. There's a lot of I, me, mine-ing because I do
       <em>
        feel
       </em>
       for what I'm talking about. I could write it in my journal, where I write many of my problems, but the title speaks for itself. I was once
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       active on this sub, but I realized that there's a lot of finger-pointing. A lot of "they're the evil ones!!" and "our quality of life is bad because of THEM". And it's like... But what about the everyday conspiracy? The ones that happen in my communities, on my phone, and the groups I choose to participate in? The habits I choose to accept? The parts of life I feel a little more comfortable settling with, when in reality, it's a form of exploitation and trickery?

      <p>
       This is personal because I experience it. I'm not separate from this. I
       <em>
        try
       </em>
       not to use 'we' because I can really only speak for myself. But my eyes don't lie, and I don't let my tongue, or my fingers do that either.

       You are so right though. I've gotta get some links in. I didn't come to discover this by myself, so I should probably refer others to where I discovered my knowledge as well.
