        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is the nature of gun politics now, folks. Every time there’s a mass shooting, the anti-gun Left simply cannot hold their tongues. We should mourn the victims, pray for the families, and wait for the authorities to conduct their investigation. That’s not allowed.  After the horrific shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) took to the Senate floor today to lecture his colleagues.</p>

<p>Sen. @ChrisMurphyCT on Parkland, Florida School Shooting: &quot;This happens nowhere else other than the United States of America, this epidemic of mass slaughter, this scourge of school shooting after school shooting.&quot; pic.twitter.com/bgIrYzrDRl— CSPAN (@cspan) February 14, 2018</p>

<p>“This happens nowhere else other than the United States of America, this epidemic of mass slaughter, this scourge of school shooting after school shooting,” he said. Actually, shootings occur in other countries all the time, Senator. Have we forgotten about the Paris attacks in 2015? Second, mass shootings are rare. They still are, even FiveThirtyEight admitted this—and added that to view the gun violence issue solely through the prism of mass shootings is a good way to craft some pretty bad policy. </p>

<p>If we focus on mass shootings as a means of understanding how to reduce the number of people killed by guns in this country, we’re likely to implement laws that don’t do what we want them to do — and miss opportunities to make changes that really work.</p>

<p>Murphy also said that it happened as a consequence of congressional inaction. Okay—first, we don’t know anything about the shooter, Nikolas de Jesus Cruz, who shot and killed 17 people and wounded at least a dozen others. We don’t know the weapon or weapons he used. We don’t know his motivations. He was expelled. We simply don’t know. Second, the big push Democrats tried to do on gun control was preventing Americans who had not been convicted of a crime from buying guns. Yes, that’s the no fly no buy gun push. As attorney and Washington Examiner contributor Gabriel Malor noted, these are secret lists and there is zero due process of law. In fact, this idea was so bad that the LA Times editorial board agreed with the Second Amendment crowd for once in declaring that the people on the no fly list should be able to buy firearms:</p>

<p>One problem is that the people on the no-fly list (as well as the broader terror watch list from which it is drawn) have not been convicted of doing anything wrong. They are merely suspected of having terror connections. And the United States doesn&#39;t generally punish or penalize people unless and until they have been charged and convicted of a crime. In this case, the government would be infringing on a right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution — and yes, like it or not, the right to buy a gun is a constitutional right according to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>How certain is it that the people on the two lists are dangerous? Well, we don&#39;t really know, because the no-fly-list and the broader watch list are government secrets. People are not notified when they are put on, nor why, and they usually don&#39;t discover they have been branded suspected terrorists until they try to travel somewhere.</p>

<p>With regards to the terror watch list, which has around 1.1 million names, just 10,000 Americans are on that list. Everyone else is not a U.S. citizen, already barring him or her from purchasing firearms (yes, I know—criminals don’t follow laws with firearms). </p>

<p>That leaves us with about 10,000 American citizens (and some legal residents) who, under the proposed law, would be barred from exercising a constitutional right. That gives us pause,” wrote the editorial board.</p>

<p>No-fly list (~40k) is not the same thing as the terror watch list (~1M).</p>

<p>Dem gun ban bill uses a definition similar to terror watch list.— Gabriel Malor (@gabrielmalor) June 13, 2016</p>

<p>Democratic politicians who conflate the no-fly list with the terror watch list and the Dem gun ban proposal are misleading the public.— Gabriel Malor (@gabrielmalor) June 13, 2016</p>

<p>One thing the no-fly, the terror watch, and the Dem gun ban lists have in common: they are secret lists, you have no ability to challenge.— Gabriel Malor (@gabrielmalor) June 13, 2016</p>

<p>The no-fly list was found to unconstitutionally deprive of due process last year, but Admin said it would make changes. Still waiting.— Gabriel Malor (@gabrielmalor) June 13, 2016</p>

<p>Was Cruz a terrorist? We don’t know, so why even suggest that making this into a law would be something to further public safety. Most new gun initiatives from Democrats wouldn’t stop mass shootings or prevent gun violence. That’s evident with their failed so-called assault weapons ban. </p>

<p>So, all this did was politicize something without knowing all the facts—typical of Democrats. The anti-gun crowd is going to mobilize over this tragedy. They will push the same talking points and push for the same bills that won’t stop or reduce mass shootings. The cumulative effect argument is crap. One bad bill that doesn’t reduce mass shootings won’t be helped by a slate of them. What if Cruz bought these firearms legally? What if he had mental health issues? For the first, there’s nothing you can do. A person without a violent history, criminal convictions, or documented mental health issues will pass a background check, as they should. The second is an area where both sides can find common ground, but Democrats aren’t satisfied because they want so-called universal background checks to come with it. </p>

<p>It’ll end as it always does. The Left beats their chest; they get beat because the facts are not on their side, and a chance to do something, like improving detection for those with mental health issues, is squandered.</p>

<p>And a very good reminder about these incidents:</p>

<p>Just your all-too-frequent reminder that social media is poison during mass shootings.— Bob McGovern (@BobMcGovernJr) February 14, 2018</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does the right always try to de-politicize the gun violence by saying “it’s not the time” but it’s never the time. </p>

<p>The news said there have been 18 school shootings so far this year (I didn’t validate that).  When are people going to realize you don’t need an A/R and huge magazines for hunting or even home protection?  I have a shotgun and a handgun and then am plenty safe. </p>

<p>I hope the pictures of the dead kids haunt anyone who thinks this would have still happened if there were stronger gun restrictions. Hundreds, of not thousands of people’s lives will never be the same. But, this is what our forefathers were thinking about, right???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“Why did you need to use an assault weapon, Mr. Defendant?” So, let’s take a look at why American citizens need modern semi-automatic weapons.</p>

<p>One of the overarching themes of the anti-gun movement is that Americans simply do not need these types of weapons. “Why does anyone need a high capacity assault rifle?” After all, high capacity semi-automatic rifles are not used for hunting or sporting purposes, just for killing humans. To which I respond “exactly.”</p>

<p>There are two main reasons and many ancillary ones why a ban on high-capacity, semi-automatic weapons is uncalled for, unnecessary and also unwise. First, we must consider the historical perspective of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The
Second Amendment was added to the Constitution as an assurance that Americans will never lack the weaponry to fight against their own government, if that government becomes tyrannical. Remember, in the late 1780s the newly formed United States of America had just fought a bloody war against England and King George III’s tyrannical government. In order to gain support for the formation of a central government, the individual states required that the language of the Second Amendment be included in the Constitution, or they would not ratify the Constitution.</p>

<p>Do you really think this is a justification for the requirement of arms in the modern world. It is extremely unlikely that civilians will engage in an all-out war with the government (attacks of such ilk would be considered a form of terrorism if done in isolation) and I don&#39;t think a few guns will protect you against the Armed Forces if they were your outright enemy.
Even in that case, it would be more likely that the military would turn on the government first and use their commissioned weapons instead.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been over 200 years since the last need for guns against the government, yet they are used daily by civilians against other civilians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you mean by &#39;A/R&#39;? </p>

<p>Do you mean assault rifles, as in fully automatic rifles? They continuously fire bullets so long as the trigger is held. They&#39;re already banned.</p>

<p>Shootings tend to be conducted with semi-automatic rifles, which fire a bullet every time the trigger is pulled. These can be modified with bump stocks to function similarly to fully automatic rifles. Banning semi-automatic rifles would significantly impact hunting, defence and recreational use. It&#39;s also not something seriously proposed.</p>

<p>Usually what politicians call to ban are <a href="http://assaultweapon.info/">assault &#39;weapons&#39;</a>. These are primarily defined by cosmetics and attachments, rather than killing potential.</p>

<p>While a solution is required, and gun control can be a part of that solution, fabricating classes of firearms and subsequently banning them will not help.</p>

<p>Things that could help include:</p>

<ul>
<li>  More rigorous firearm background checks</li>
<li>  Mandatory training</li>
<li>  Long-term investment into mental health</li>
<li>  Strict restrictions for semi-automatic rifles. </li>
</ul>

<p>These are approaches that have worked for other countries where firearms are or have been prolific.</p>

<p>Of course there have been real ones like this as well.</p>

<p>They have to define it somehow and the definition of a school shooting now is &quot;firearm discharged on school grounds&quot; but probably includes a fuzzy permuter around it as well.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just important to check the status the MSM spits out.</p>

<p>There hasn&#39;t been 18 school shootings this year. How can you try to argue a point you didn&#39;t validate? I&#39;m all down for making it harder to get weapons and stuff, but it&#39;s not going to stop anyone. We banned drugs years ago and still have that issue. Banning something doesn&#39;t make it disappear from the world, it makes people want to get it even more because the gorvernemnt is saying &quot;Hey you can&#39;t have this&quot;. We need to reevaluate school security mostly and it is sad and depressing, but if someone is hell bent on shooting up a school they will find a way. That&#39;s just facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree that it’s not going to stop someone. If we had not let semi-automatics be sold by the shipload (for hunting rabbits, of course) they wouldn’t be such a menace. It’s a lot easier to mow people down with an AR-15 than a rifle (speculation only).  The mentality of “I can do better than that and then I will be famous; they’ll remember my name then...” is the motivation and the weaponry is the tool. </p>

<p>Though I appreciate your point, your corollary to banning drugs is probably not sound.  The drug trade is huge for the US economy and stabilizes the Mexican and S.America economy. With that amount of money, changing hands, the govt won’t stop it anytime soon.  Reagan could have locked down the borders after granting amnesty but the farms need workers and NY and LA need their drugs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do know there are several hundred other semi automatic weapons right? An AK is so easy to buy for like 300 bucks. Getting weapons needs to be reevaluated for sure, but the weapon is not solely to blame. Mental health kicks in, the meds that doctors just throw at our youth is ridiculous. Semi automatic weapons have been around for years and school shootings are just now getting crazy. So what has changed besides guns? Kids being raised differently.</p>

<p>Anything that&#39;s &quot;banned&quot; or &quot;Illegal&quot; helps prove my point. It&#39;s illegal to drink and drive, people do it 24/7. It&#39;s illegal to turn right at certain redlights, people still do it. Making something illegal or banning it will solve nothing. Maybe 50 years down the road, POSSIBLY. But there&#39;s a lot of factors that go into a school shooter.</p>

<p>We could solve the gun issue by going full Australia on it. But I&#39;d say there is a 1 chance in 3 that it goes down peacefully . It would be a fullfillment of a large segment of the populations worst fear.    </p>

<p>I&#39;d be interested to hear how he got the gun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, yes, we know all of your talking points.  You&#39;ll refer to your protected constitutional rights to carry a gun, that was written by men in a time before the concept of semi-automatic weaponry even existed.  You&#39;ll tell me that we need to post armed guards in schools and give weapons training to all of the teachers, and give them guns too!  I&#39;d love to see my old 67 year old English teacher trying to manage that one!</p>

<p>Because in your mind, all of this is a better solution than sensible gun control and enforcement.  You&#39;ll argue with me that people need semi-automatic weapons to fight the tyrannical government coming to steal their land!  While completely ignoring the fact that even if our military magically decided to come and kill all of us, your shitty Wal-mart AR-15 style assault rifle will enable you to survive versus a trained military with superior weapons.  </p>

<p>You&#39;ll tell me that you&#39;re completely OK with a few dozen, hundred, thousand kids dying each year to protect your ability to buy an assault rifle.  &quot;Its the price we pay for freedom&quot; - i believe that was the line used.   OK buddy.  We decided to install locks on our school doors instead of installing proper firearms laws.  That says a lot about us, and none of it is good.   It is amazing though that you manage to still somehow rationalize blaming democrats when all of our mass shootings are done with weapons that Republicans refuse to pass legislation on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since 2013 the U.S. averages a school shooting every 8.3 days, and if after everytime we are told to &quot;wait out of respect and not politicize&quot; then we&#39;ll never actually see any progress made due to them occurring so frequently.</p>

<p>Stricter gun laws are not the same as taking away guns, we just want people to be safer while still free to possess arms.</p>
