Part of that is to be embrace, accept, and integrate the shadow aspects of oneself.  You cannot do that if you do not have access to (and practice and integrate) the power of lethal force.

    <div class="md"><p>A society with no need for firearms is a society that is so heavily armed that nobody ever needs to use one.</p>

<p>As for &quot;free societies&quot; ... there is no such thing as a truly free society, never was and never will be, because inequality and hierarchy is inherent to life on this planet (not just human).</p>

<p>We should always work towards achieving the freest society we can, given our philosophical, technological, and resource limits.  Part of that means widespread popular armament, so that the weakest are equal to the strongest and none may compel another by force.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats just not true. there is no hierarchy to sea turtles, butterflies, psilocybin or dandelions. saying domination is inherent to all humans discounts all those people who have ever not willed to dominate. yes we are a part of nature but we also have the power of cognitive thought and reason the likes of which we havent quite seen in any other animal. using that reasoning ability its quite easy to imagine an egalitarian society where people work for eachother and the planet as a whole rather than just for individual profit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many kinds of hierarchy.  Sea turtles, butterflies, mushrooms, and dandelions all have hierarchy.</p>

<p>Take dandelions.  Some are bigger, some are smaller, some shade the others, some attract all the bees.  Dandelions are not equal.  They express a cacophony of variation and hierarchy depending on genetic heritage, environment, and interactions with other living things.  The principles apply to most other living things.</p>

<p>Including us.</p>

<p>Which does not free us from attempting to achieve as equal a society as possible.  Quite the opposite: it compels us to exert every effort to do so.  But one should understand that anyone selling a perfectly equal and egalitarian society is a fraud and a charlatan because such does not and cannot exist, and it is a terrible failure of their philosophy if they do not recognize this (or they are lying).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>youre not understanding what youre saying let alone what i am. you just said equal society is impossible because some dandelions grow faster and shade out others. thats not hierarchy thats natural selection. the bigger dandelion doesnt grow as big as it can purposefully to shade out the smaller dandelions so it can have all the sun and then proceed to dole out small bits of sun to others as it sees fit. that would be hierarchichal. im not talking about equality im talking about equity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, so trees have systems of reducing the inherent inequalities in a population in order to strengthen the overall health of the population.</p>

<p>But there are still inequalities.  You can talk about equity, or domination, or however you want to discuss it, the point remains. Inequality is a given.  It is impossible to achieve perfect equality.  But we should still strive to achieve as much equality as we can.  (Of opportunity, not of outcome.)</p>

<p>By the way, humans are strengthened by close relationships with trees as well.  &quot;Forest bathing&quot; is a medically-prescribed treatment where people (mostly in Japan and South Korea as far as I am aware) are directly to spend time in the forest every week, to obtain relief from depression, anxiety, high blood pressure, and other disorders.</p>

<p>In the end, I believe that returning to a closer interaction and dialog with the natural world is how humanity can ultimately achieve the most equal and equitable society possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That hoarding impulse, I&#39;m with you there.  That&#39;s an artificial construct.  As a hobby, I&#39;ve been trying to track back where that came from and how it came to play such an important role.</p>

<p>It seems to be a component of &quot;conquest&quot; philosophy.  This originated before the Romans, but the Romans seem to have perfected the philosophy.  &quot;You can have any god or religion you want as long as Caesar is at the top.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the establishment of political hierarchy.  The origin of an ideology that used the fasces as a symbol, which later was refined to form the doctrine of fascism.  You can have whatever society you want, as long as government is at the top.</p>

<p>Then in Spain, it became possible to BUY your way into nobility.  This is what powered the conquest of the Western Hemisphere and indeed the world: the quest for riches in order to buy a noble title.  To be a king on your own land.  To claim a miniature kingdom, where you are part of a divine mandate.</p>

<p>This is where money becomes toxic.  When it gives you power over others.  The power to command.  You can be anything and anyone you want as long as you do perform according to the monetary demands.  As long as Money is GOD.</p>

<p>The answer, as far as I can tell, is to turn away from money.  This is what the communists miss: they still buy into industrialism and the use of money to define value.  But money is the source of the poison.  Money is what allows people to accumulate power and become like gods with the power to command performance from others.</p>

<p>It plays out in little ways.  Time banks, for example, are tax-exempt.  Why?  Because exchanging time tokens is &quot;voluntary.&quot;  OK so if exchanging time is voluntary, why isn&#39;t monetary exchange voluntary?  Because POWER, as I outlined above.</p>

<p>Turn away from money to turn away from conquest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>agreed. but again the only way away from the money and power conquests is decentralization and horizontalism whether thats individual or collective. equity doesnt mean equality and inequality is NOT inherently hierarchichal. hierarchy is artificially induced inequality for the specific purpose of keeping some away from oppurtunity at all while giving some at all the oppurtunity they want. real communists dont buy into money, they recognize that real wealth accumulation comes from centralized control of the means of production of goods by the looter class, which largely entails owning property, at the expense of the people who do the actual labor of production.</p>

<p>I take it you&#39;ve never watched roosters in a flock of chickens?  Inequality in its most brutal forms is endemic to the natural world.  It&#39;s how limited access to resources is managed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>real communists dont buy into money</p>

<p>That&#39;s great in theory, and theory is as far as it goes.  When you get right down to the nuts and bolts of actually running a society under communism, money is still the tool of brokering resource exchange and usage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is not my number 2, it is copy-pasta from Marx’ manifesto directly. But I agree with you it is incoherent, as many other things in that foundational document.</p>

<p>I also agree with your second argument; all the more as “capitalism” is a Marxist word, and is therefore purposefully ambiguous.</p>

<p>The only real political dichotomy is liberty vs tyranny. In a free society, nobody enforces or coerces people into a “system”. So people are free to live as producers/savers (“capitalists”) as they are free to establish/join their utopian collectivist commune / ant society if they so desire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this comment thread is about the 10 commandments of the Communist Manifesto, which call for a tremendously powerful State (especially commandments 5, 6 and 7, with number 5 the worst in my opinion). So I thought your endorsed this. My bad if you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Per your last point, I am reluctant to take anything away by force, from anyone, and that would entail granting someone (i.e. a government) the power to do so (and this power will corrupt whoever has it).</p>

<p>The parasites&#39; ill-gotten gains won&#39;t last long if they can&#39;t loot/rob any further; after they consume their capital they&#39;ll have to actually produce whatever they consume, like everyone else.</p>

<p>As far as I&#39;m concerned I don&#39;t envy them, and I don&#39;t need a part of their illegitimate cake. I can produce my own wealth. But for that I need to be free, i.e. I have to be left alone, and I have to be able to exchange with my fellow humans on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>It is an individual endeavour, not a collective one. You can get them off <em>your</em> back. Stop using their money, watching their TV, consuming their products.</p>

<p>A good start is also to stop advocating fo Marxism, which is their preferred ideology. International collectivism is the end-goal of their “new world order”,  ot individual liberty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yes.</p>

<p>But what Marx wrote is that in order to prevent the revolution from becoming the new bourgeoisie, the population must be armed with weapons of war, in perpetuity.  So far as I am aware, this has never been the case in any major attempt at communism, and in every case the revolution has become the new instrument of oppression just as he predicted.</p>

<p>For the rest of us, being armed means communism is dead before it begins.  We can actually see the same self-involution and destruction of the philosophy of communism right now in America, except that in THIS country, it&#39;s not taking millions of lives with it.  Yet.

<p>The phrasing of it is quite different, and I rather agree with the Frankfurt School that a major problem in our culture is the industrial-scale production of capitalist popular media, but it is not so much of a stretch to associate &quot;social justice&quot; with communism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious as to what material from the Frankfurt school you&#39;re referring to here, the idea that I frequently see touted as proof that social justice is communism in disguise is a misrepresentation of the idea of Cultural Marxism that also relies on a deliberately reductive reinterpretation of communism and/or Marxism.</p>

<p>This analysis I&#39;ve encountered also relies completely on the idea that modern social justice advocates base their beliefs on the Frankfurt school as opposed to cultural icons like MLK.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is &quot;social justice&quot; to you, and how is it completely different from Communism?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me, social justice in its modern definition means the pursuit of equality of treatment and opportunity across lines such as race, religion, gender and able-bodied/disabled.</p>

<p>Communism is a classless, stateless, moneyless society based around the communal democratic ownership of the means of production. It also means the ideology surrounding creating such a society, obviously.</p>

<p>This is where social justice comes in: the elimination of classes.  Marx wrote about gender, race, and religion as all forming hierarchical classes which must be dissolved.</p>

<p>You have stated both definitions clearly, but I am confused as to how you have failed to see that they are inextricably linked.  The whole purpose of social justice is to dissolve the disparate classes formed by differences in race, religion, gender, and ability.  Is this not a central tenet of Communism?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In Marxist terms &quot;class&quot; is your position within the economy, more specifically whether you are a labourer (proletarian) or capitalist (bourgeoisie). It is not a generic term.</p>

<p>You are right that social justice is anti-hierarchy, but that is not specific to Marxism or even communism. Acceptance of hierarchy is the fundamental difference between left wing ideologies and right wing ideologies, which is why social justice advocates usually fall somewhere on the left wing of their country.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have stated both definitions clearly, but I am confused as to how you have failed to see that they are inextricably linked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because one primarily focuses on social interactions between individuals and systemic discrimination while the other is a political and economic ideology based around the abolition of private property and establishing common ownership of the means of production.</p>

<p>Treating communism as meaning &quot;elimination of classes&quot; (where &#39;classes&#39; does not refer to the Marxist definition of the term) is what I was referring to by reductiveness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As for your other question about the Frankfurt School, I would like to link you to this <a href="http://criticaltheory.berkeley.edu/about/">overview from UC Berkeley&#39;s School of Critical Theory</a> which links many of the various pieces together.  If you want I can dig further, but this is literally the purpose of the Frankfurt School and most anyone involved with Critical Theory will happily espouse the goals thereof at length.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah yes I forgot about critical theory, I&#39;m aware it&#39;s based on materialism but I can&#39;t remember much beyond that so I shall read your link.</p>

<p>I do think any attempt to conflate communism and the modern social justice movement will always fail due to the fact the overwhelming majority of social justice advocates are not communists and do not believe communist ideals yet still wholly support social justice without contradiction or compromise.</p>

<p>Going back to your earlier comment though, I don&#39;t think social justice is eating itself alive at all. I believe that is wishful thinking on your part since you believe social justice to be a &quot;philosophy of ever-increasing self-contradicting lines of division, the never-ending screeching of imagined persecution&quot;. I believe it will continue to develop in the face of &quot;crazy SJWs / PC gone mad&quot; narratives the same way it has always overcome attempts to demonise it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply.  I understand what you are saying but I can&#39;t help asking, have you read much Marx?</p>

<p>Does not even the smallest divisions of family, gender, and race end up creating relatively large divisions in economic class?</p>

<p>In Marx&#39;s manifesto, he addresses specifically these issues, and that in order to achieve a truly classless society, these economic differences must be dissolved even down to the difference between husband and wife, man and woman.</p>

<p>You are correct that hierarchy-vs-non typifies the inherent difference between Left and Right.  And, while the social justice movement has a very different flavor than Marxist Communism, I cannot help but see them as having very closely overlapping goals.</p>

<p>Perhaps the dissolution of the SJW movement is wishful thinking on my part.  For myself, I line up more with the voluntaryist school of thought and personally am more interested in personal responsibility and direct work rather than inspiring awareness of our differences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>Ants have built a civilization that is 100 million years old (versus our 2 million at most). They master architecture and farming; they have a complex sociology as well.</p>

<p>In ant society, there is no political institution (the queen merely produces babies). It is believed 1/3 of ants do nothing (lazy bastards, just lie around); 1/3 of ants try to help, but end up doing nothing of value; and the other 1/3 are the only that do anythig value (in various roles), and carry the whole colony.</p>

<p>So ant society is 100% voluntary (anarchist), and 100% collectivist; one ant will never hesitate to sacrifice itself for the greater good of the colony. They seem to have no sense of individuality.</p>

<p>I am willing to accept that, after 100 million years of civilization, after a total and radical spiritual epiphany/revolution, humanity may change its nature and start behaving/thinking like ants.</p>

<p>I prefer thinking that&#39;s not true, as I personally privilege the Randian John Galt hero; but that&#39;s my personal sensibility; I cannot refute the possibility that, one day, after many lives, after a &quot;soul evolution&quot; of some kind, I may see the morality in utter, total, debilitating collectivism. After all, in a higher realm, we are indeed &quot;just one&quot; (Ayn Rand would have laughed at me for that last remark, so it&#39;s to show I don&#39;t agree with her on everything, far from it).</p>

<p>So, ant utopia still involves (it seems) the golden rule, and the non-initiation of violence. So we could, in the mean time, until we get there, agree with the principle of individual liberty and sovereignty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I agree with what you are saying from the perspective of socialist collectivism, but the reason I linked the wiki on libertarian socialism is because individualist ideologies <em>do</em> exist. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990117030925/http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker2.html">This essay</a> kind of haphazardly (he&#39;s not really accurate in his description of Marxism, very alarmist) delineates between state socialism and individualist anarchism.</p>

<p>The big takeaway I got from that essay is that modern day American Libertarianism is a watered down version of the anarchism presented in the essay, modified to support the unlimited ownership of capital. They want, essentially, for the people doing the work and living on the land to own that work and own that land, rather than some mustachioed capitalist living thousands of miles away who contributes nothing and receives everything. You can still own property and engage in whatever economic activity you wish, but it has to be property that you are yourself utilizing rather than something held up in an abstract instrument like a deed. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really crazy how similar some of the things Tucker says are to what I hear from libertarians, with that major difference. It seems to me that the <em>only</em> beneficiaries of this difference between original anarchism and modern libertarianism are the incredibly wealthy, corporations, and the State. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I can build or buy a shoe factory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It certainly complicates things if you&#39;ve done so singlehandedly, but more likely it would be you purchasing the land and materials and hiring workers to do the actual building, which introduces problems related to land-ownership as well as the exploitative nature of wage-labor under capitalism (meaning, with everything private property, did the workers who built your factory &quot;choose&quot; to work there, or was their &quot;voluntary&quot; decision informed by their need to eat?).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have as much of a problem with property ownership as you&#39;ve described, especially if the workers are entitled to a fair percentage of profits. However, their negotiating power is far less than yours, and you could quite easily skew the payment greatly in your favor to their expense. And what else can they do but accept your terms, if there is no alternate employment, or if all other employers nearby offer similar conditions? </p>

<p>But personally I have no problem with you, as the manager/architect of the project, receiving a larger compensation. I see that as a way that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalist</a> workplaces could function, with managers elected and compensation discussed and decided democratically. I just start to have a problem with it if you move thousands of kilometers away and still reap the rewards of ownership, even though you no longer commit any labor to actual production. </p>

<p>Anyway, thank you for this comment and your interest. I highly recommend reading Peter Kropotkin&#39;s <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-the-conquest-of-bread">The Conquest of Bread</a>, although he&#39;s quite utopian in his views I found it a valuable experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thus: the corruption of language.<br/>
When people co-opt words and phrases and manipulate them, attributing certain ideas, actions and implications to them, eventually you&#39;re left with a bunch of loaded terms that people may potentially misinterpret wildly far from their literary definitions.<br/>
Besides obvious politically loaded terms like &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot;, how many other words can you think of that have been corrupted so much so that people make large assumptions when they hear them? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh boy, I can think of a big one: <strong><em>libertarian</em></strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m certain that if I were to use the phrase &quot;libertarian socialism,&quot; 90% of the users here would go &quot;Bbbut that&#39;s an oxymoron!&quot;</p>

<p>However, usage of the word &quot;libertarian&quot; to refer to leftists (i.e. socialists, communists) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism#Etymology">predates its modern American usage</a> by a good hundred years, at least. It wasn&#39;t until the 1950s that it began to be used essentially as a synonym for &quot;anarcho-capitalist.&quot;</p>

<p>And man, this certainly seems intentional to me. 99.99% of users in this sub have absolutely no clue that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism">Libertarian Socialism</a> exists. And the overwhelming majority of them <strong><em>refuse to educate themselves</em></strong>. It&#39;s like a wall has been built up protecting their worldview, and that worldview includes the belief that ALL socialism is STATE socialism. That is not true, no matter how much they repeat it. </p>

<p>The author of this essay isn&#39;t very accurate in describing Marxism, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990117030925/http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker2.html">here&#39;s an essay delineating State Socialism and Anarchism</a>, and I&#39;m sure many of you, <strong><em>if you manage to read it before knee-jerk responding about how dumb I am</em></strong>, will find yourselves in agreement with much of what Tucker says of the &quot;four monopolies&quot; the anarchists found themselves opposed to. </p>

<p>Anyway, this difference between STATE SOCIALISM and INDIVIDUALIST SOCIALISM (which has been nearly entirely forgotten by the American public) is why we have people like <strong>George Orwell, author of 1984</strong> saying things like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it.”</p>

<p>George Orwell, “Why I write” p. 394</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yet, because people have no clue that socialism is a range of ideologies, and not all of them bow to a central state, we&#39;ve got kids reading the book thinking it&#39;s a condemnation of &quot;communism&quot; when, if you listen to what the goddamn author says, it&#39;s clearly an indictment of Stalinist authoritarianism. </p>

What else do you call a system which permits one person to purchase and hold land thousands of miles away, telling the natives who live there what they can and cannot do with their own resources? A system which permits this property to be passed on as inheritance, essentially perpetuating a class divide? How do you reconcile the similarities this holds with feudalism?

<p>You can own whatever property you want as long as you are personally making use of it. The ability to hold capital without limitation, without any restrictions on usufructory rights, results in the creation of problems inherent to our political and economic society.

<p>And? Your point? I see you&#39;ve bought in to the myth that you did so voluntarily, but what if you... didn&#39;t want to make somebody else rich off of your labor? What if you wanted, from the start, to own the entirety of your product? Hmmm, wow, it&#39;s almost like in that case... you have very few to no options. </p>

<p>Where have I ever said that anybody is forced to labor at gunpoint? Capitalism provides other incentives- namely that all being private property, you must labor for one who possesses said property or you will starve homeless in the streets. </p>

<p>The Soviet Union had free public transport, it produced cars that are still super cheap and run really well even though they&#39;re 40+ years old, much higher longevity than American cars. Tetris was created by a man in the Soviet Union. They created a mobile phone which could call landlines in the 60&#39;s. They were the first to successfully retrieve a live human being from space. They were the first to send up a satellite, they were the first to reach the moon and take pictures of the dark side of the moon. They also went from an agricultural society to a global superpower in a fraction of the time it took the west to do the same, even though 70+% of their industry and housing were destroyed by an invasion by a capitalist nation. Standards of living plummeted in the decade after the breakup of the union. </p>

<p>Cuba went from &lt;10% literacy to very nearly 100% literacy through communism. Everyone in Cuba has access to healthcare. </p>

<p>China went from an agricultural society to a global industrial powerhouse in the fraction of the time it took the west, even though it suffered a brutal occupation and then a bloody civil war in the decades before that. </p>

<p>I could go on, but my point is; Your perception of communism is based upon propaganda which have told you less then half the truth. They&#39;re authoritarian, yes, but to claim they had no stylish clothing, transportation or video games is just plain false. </p>

<p>But I’m actually commenting because of another reason. I’ve been looking at conspiracies for a long time now, at least 10 years. For as long as I can remember, most conspiracy forums leaned left to far left. Is it just me, or is it a recent trend that conspiracy forums have started to lean right to far right? Maybe it was just the ones I would frequent, but they all seemed to at least lean left, and there were often discussion about the different leftist beliefs. But now, leftist ideals seem to be all ridiculed and pumped into one “muh communism” banner. I’m starting to wonder if this is a conspiracy in and of itself. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This might not be helpful advice, especially without knowing where your friends are coming from, but I&#39;ve found it helpful to come from this sort of angle of attack when attempting to sway the views of right-wing inclined individuals. 99.99% of the time their perception of socialism/communism is the way it is because they believe that all socialism requires a Big Government central state. Simply informing them that libertarian socialism is a thing, or mentioning Orwell&#39;s involvement with the anarcho-syndicalists-
 anything that diminishes the idea that all socialism is authoritarian is useful. I believe that Tucker essay I linked might be invaluable, as a lot of what he says closely mirrors current right wing ideology- they might be able to see where it&#39;s been subverted. </p>

<p>In conjunction with this, I also tend to focus on the exploitative nature capitalism imparts to wage-labor. With nearly all resources having been made private property, one has no choice but to labor for another in order to survive. It&#39;s not as overt as a gun to one&#39;s head, but the ultimate effect is the same- your need is exploited, you are employed, and your employer reaps rewards through this exploitation. It can hardly be called voluntary when there is no rational alternative for the overwhelming majority of mankind.</p>

<p>In this vein, I enjoy the following quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We cry shame on the feudal baron who forbade the peasant to turn a clod of earth unless he surrendered to his lord a fourth of his crop. We called those barbarous times. But if the forms have changed, the relations have remained the same, and the worker is forced, under the name of free contract, to accept feudal obligations. For, turn where he will, he can find no better conditions. Everything has become private property, and he must accept, or die or hunger.
The result of this state of things is that all our production tends in a wrong direction. Enterprise takes no thought for the needs of the community. Its only aim is to increase the gains of the speculator. Hence the constant fluctuations of trade, the periodical industrial crises, each of which throws scores of thousands of workers on the streets.” </p>

<ul>
<li>Peter Kropotkin, <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-the-conquest-of-bread">The Conquest of Bread</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>BTW Kropotkin is fantastic, but just as a warning, his views are quite utopian (not that they are <em>wrong</em>), so your right wing friends might scoff if they simply read that book. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it just me, or is it a recent trend that conspiracy forums have started to lean right to far right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m honestly not certain, personally, as I&#39;ve only begun to frequent <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> in the aftermath of the 2016 primaries, once the mainstream political discussion boards swung heavily towards Hillary/establishment politics. I&#39;m not surprised if there has been an intensification of efforts to muddy the waters and lump all leftism together, though, since our economic and political situation is worsening every day and a strong Left is the last thing the oligarchs once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely agree with you. There is a remarkable degree of overlap between the two subs in the things people complain about, but very rarely does r/conspiracy realize that many of these things can be traced back to being a consequence of capitalist property ownership.

Instead, they ban people who even <em>post</em> here for &quot;posting in reactionary subs.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve literally asked them to unban me previously, stating that I pretty much only ever post here to talk about socialism, but woops. They are seriously the worst, most dickish, pettiest tyrants imaginable.</p>

<p>The conspiracy minded part of me believes that it&#39;s on purpose, to drive a wedge further between right and left, as well as to play into right-wing impressions of socialism as equitable to &quot;authoritarian.&quot; If they&#39;re not doing it on purpose, they&#39;re doing a phenomenal job on accident...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great comment.</p>

<p>If you are reading this comment, it means the universe now wants you to consider Lew Rockwell’s famous paper, <em><a href="https://mises.org/library/american-classical-liberalism-0">An American Classical Liberalism</a></em>. Here is how it starts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every four years, as the November presidential election draws near, I have the same daydream: that I don&#39;t know or care who the president of the United States is. More importantly, I don&#39;t need to know or care. I don&#39;t have to vote or even pay attention to debates. I can ignore all campaign commercials. There are no high stakes for my family or my country. My liberty and property are so secure that, frankly, it doesn&#39;t matter who wins. I don&#39;t even need to know his name.</p>

<p>In my daydream, the president is mostly a figurehead and a symbol, almost invisible to myself and my community. He has no public wealth at his disposal. He administers no regulatory departments. He cannot tax us, send our children into foreign wars, pass out welfare to the rich or the poor, appoint judges to take away our rights of self government, control a central bank that inflates the money supply and brings on the business cycle, or change the laws willy-nilly according to the special interests he likes or seeks to punish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes exactly. Much like the Swiss president. The power is extremely decentralized, in the states/cantons.</p>

<p>Did you know Switzerland and the USA were called <a href="http://www.theswisscenter.org/sister-republics">sister republics</a>? That&#39;s because the Swiss 1848 constitution is copy-pasted from the American founding document; only its civil war didn&#39;t result in the massive centralization of power as the American one did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very few liberals want to ban guns entirely.  We already have restrictions on gun control - the 2nd amendment does not allow people to buy AA missiles and nuclear arms.  The problem is finding where that line should exist, because having 8 school shootings in 7 weeks should not be okay for anybody.  </p>

<p>To me, the solution lies in manditory training - make it a free class the government pays for that people can sign up for.  This does a few things the right would like - more jobs, more positive exposure to guns, hopefully less negative stories about guns.  You pass this class, your name and SSN (or a new unique id since SSN is shit and compromised as hell) is on an approved registry for gun sales.  When someone sells a gun, they&#39;re required to ensure the buyer is on the list.  They don&#39;t have to record a sale happened (any more than they do now), they just have to ensure the buyer passed the check.</p>

<p>1) the rest of the world has figured this out, so this can only be laziness, apathy and greed.</p>

<p>2) the constitution isn&#39;t clear on what &quot;arms&quot; is, so this is difficult, and there&#39;s pretty universal acceptance to gun ownership, and there&#39;s so many guns in circulation that private sale and theft would have no affect on this.</p>

<p>3) so many.  Are teachers ok with being handed a gun?  Do we pay them enough to also be responsible for killing an intruder?  Are we okay with accidents, bad judgement calls, where innocent children are also killed?  Are we okay with malicious students stealing guns from teachers?  Do we believe all teachers are not murderers?</p>

<p>4)  who determines if someone is incapable of owning a gun?  Does the constitution allow such a law?  Are we doing this case by case (volume issue), or blanket application (rights infringements)?   How many school shootings would have been prevented from this?  also same issues as #2.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best course of action is to get people with mental illnesses help, and if they indicate they are violent (as the FL shooter had done) then they should be monitored by law enforcement. Mandatory training isn&#39;t going to deter criminals, although I understand you are simply trying to offer a solution for a serious problem. </p>

<p>The rest of the world has not figured this out, unless you mean the rest of the west, which coincidentally most other Western countries allow easier access to treatment, and have lower levels of income inequality. Much of Africa and South America have rates of gun murders much higher than the US. So please be sure to clarify next time, or actually do some research instead of making assumptions.</p>

<p>Do you feel like the US has higher rates of mental health issues than other nations?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not certain, but I&#39;d guess that the US has higher rates of people with mental illnesses that are untreated, at least when comparing to the rest of the west. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t you think that the US would have better systems in place than a country like Venezuela to help treat mental health problems? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m guessing the US does. Socialized healthcare does not mean better. For the record, Venezuela has far more gun homicides per capita than the US last I had read.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t you think we should be compared with countries like Canada, the UK, France, Germany?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you should compare across the board to get a good look at all of the variables in play. As I said before, those countries allow easier access to treatment and lower levels of income inequality. They have gun control too, but we know that&#39;s not the only variable influencing the rate of gun homicides because many countries in South America and Africa have gun control, but higher rates of homicide. </p>

<p>Not sure how any of this fits into how mandatory training is supposed to reduce gun homicides, but that&#39;s fine, I don&#39;t mind talking about other aspects of reducing gun crime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You forgot an alternative that is never spoken of. It&#39;s called restructuring or society, so that instead of everyone living to procure monetary capital for the wealthy elite, we focus on other forms of capital like social, environmental, and human. Society where sociopaths thrive to accumulate the Earth after they commoditize it with violence is getting the species no where fast. This creates a society where the least among us feel that there is no future, were disconnected from each other, and greed dominates our lives to the point that the future is thrown away without investment on the next generation. Society must change so that the individual is supported by the community for the purpose of living a life to garner knowledge to advance the species while bettering everything around them instead of the society based upon extraction of all monetary, social, environmental, and human wealth for the benefits of the elitist few.</p>

<p>Except for the laws of physics? If everything has been made private property, what do you expect people to do? If you&#39;re sitting in the middle of empty land, 500 miles in every direction, starving to death, you still can&#39;t use that land as long as someone anywhere in the world owns its deed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We cry shame on the feudal baron who forbade the peasant to turn a clod of earth unless he surrendered to his lord a fourth of his crop. We call those the barbarous times. But if the forms have changed the relations have remained the same, and the worker is forced, under the name of free contract, to accept feudal obligations. For, turn where [they] will, [they] can find no better conditions. Everything has become private property, and [they] must accept, or die of hunger. </p>

<p>And yeah, theoretically they could buy the land, but with what money? A loan from the bank, paid back with hefty interest? (Why don&#39;t the end-the-fed folk see this as usury?)</p>

<p>Personal savings? From what? A wage from an employer? How is that any different than a period of indenture, before the end of which freedom is impossible? </p>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m just pointing this out because &quot;Well, there&#39;s nothing stopping you from going and being socialist!&quot; is so oft-repeated and so thoughtless.</p>

<p>Yes, we must render unto Caesar that which is Caesar&#39;s.  Which is abjectly unconscionable.  But there is no reason to render anything <em>MORE</em> than what is absolutely required.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where you are in the world, but in America there are many mechanisms for living outside the mainstream capitalist system.  Nonprofits, community land trusts, and time banks all come to mind.  Yes, you do need land to work with, but there is plenty of empty land (even in cities!) and sometimes the rent is $1/year.</p>

<p>You have to get your hands and knees dirty and network and talk to people, but if you want to build a socialist commune, there are lots of opportunities.  Hell, there are already plenty of people doing it, if you look closely enough, they just don&#39;t advertise because let&#39;s face it, the Internet and advertising are both instruments of capitalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where I live, there are large areas of land available to anyone who will use it. If you farm it, you can ask for inspection and the government grants you stewardship.  Many people do this.  Not only that, but if you and at least 14 of your fellow farmers form a cooperative, the governments will train you and give you grants of money, free equipment, cheap loans, discounted fuel, and your first million pesos of profit is tax-free.  </p>

<p>We have communist rebels.  They don&#39;t encourage any people to take advantage of these laws.  Just one of their soldier&#39;s weaponry is worth more than the equipment or carabao needed for any 5 farmers, but if they organized a co-op they could get that for free anyway.  They run around collecting &quot;revolutionary tax&quot; by threatening  businesses when the same amount of effort could have helped them secure thousands of hectares.  I know it&#39;s not that hard because my family has done it and many of my neighbors, very poor people who have no resources beyond a carabao and a shovel, and who have no clue how to take advantage of government programs.  </p>

<p>Because it&#39;s true!  I have a friend, a very kind man who is extremely knowledgeable about farming and loves to teach others.  He has a 17 hectare farm open to anyone who wants to live there.  Everyone will share the products equally.  He is still working alone, AFAIK.  This is on an island full of very poor people.</p>

<p>Do you people not even understand the basic fundamentals of the legal system? Over time there are more and more laws introduced. Not removed.. The only removal is when certain provisions or laws are given an expiration date.</p>

<p>The legal system over time is a consistent erosion of rights. </p>

<p>However usually these expirations are near immediately used to make the laws stronger. Such was the case with the Patriot act. Certain parts of the Patriot act expired June 1st 2015. The USA Freedom Act was passed June 2nd 2015. Which added back everything that expired and more. en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Freedom_Act</p>

<p>Yes, and a comprehensive look at facts will show you that the countries with the highest gun homicide rates have higher rates of income inequality and people often do not have access to mental health treatment. </p>

<p>What other nation is comparable? Other western nations have less income inequality, almost all of them have socialized healthcare. No other nation has as many guns (to my knowledge) but some nations still have less guns per capita and more gun control but more gun homicides. Some countries have similar gun control measures but less gun homicides. It seems to me that gun control is not the only variable we should be considering.</p>

<p>Also on gun suicides. If you want to prevent suicides, push for easier access to mental health treatment. Someone who truly wants to commit suicide is going to find a way.</p>

<p>On gun homicides. The vast majority of gun homicides in the US are related to drug crimes, gang activity, and felons. Gun crime in the US has much more to do with the socioeconomic status of people. The vast majority of gun owners in the US do not commit gun crimes of any kind. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s an interesting article I found. </p>

<p><a href="http://theconversation.com/regulating-people-not-just-guns-might-explain-australias-decline-in-mass-shootings-44770">http://theconversation.com/regulating-people-not-just-guns-might-explain-australias-decline-in-mass-shootings-44770</a></p>

<p>Interesting bits:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Australia had 13 mass shootings between 1964 and 2014, involving many different types of firearms. Before Port Arthur, the worst mass shooting was not committed with a high-powered semi-automatic weapon, but with a “single shot” .22-calibre bolt-action rifle. That type of firearm is still commonly owned by farmers and other licensed shooters in Australia today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other shootings involved manually operated “centre-fire” rifles, which are still widely owned. And some shootings were committed with faulty guns that had to be slowly re-loaded by hand.</p>

<p>Australia currently has somewhere between 2.75 million and 4.5 million legally owned firearms in private hands, including some of the exact same types of guns used in past mass shootings.</p>

<p>this too:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Measures including 28-day waiting periods and mandatory police background checks were uniformly implemented around Australia. Predictors of violent behaviour, such as past violence – including domestic violence – and involvement in other criminal activities, including drug use, became reasons for refusing, or cancelling, gun licences.</p>

<p>Most Australian mass shooters from the 1980s and 1990s would be unlikely to qualify for a firearms licence under the current system. Many offenders had records of domestic or other violence, or criminal behaviour more generally. They would almost certainly fail the “fit and proper person” requirements that people must now meet before they are licensed to access any type of firearm – and which they must uphold to keep a licence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This highlights the importance of community awareness of the warning signs of psychological problems, as well as ways to help people in distress. It is vital to de-stigmatise mental illness, encourage help-seeking behaviours and ensure appropriate services are accessible.</p>

<p>Positive changes in mental health awareness and treatment have occurred since the 1990s, which may have contributed to fewer mass shootings. Also, Australian laws now support healthcare professionals reporting to police anyone who may pose a danger to themselves or others.</p>

<p>Together, all of these facts suggest that regulating the types of people who can legally own guns is a more likely explanation for Australia’s low frequency of mass shootings than regulating the types of guns people can legally own. But when Australia’s gun laws are touted as a model for others to follow, proponents typically focus on our gun bans.</p>

<p>Can crimes still be committed with limited magazine handguns? Yes.  Are the gruesomeness of those crimes amplified by the lethal ness of semi-automatic rifles? Also yes.  So you don’t have to take every single gun away. You just create a system where nearly every gun is registered and owned for a legitimate reason.  </p>

<p>No more “well I have a Bushmaster XM-15 because I want one so I bought it at a gun show”.  It would be “I compete in competitive target shooting so I got the proper permit and went through the 6 month background check to get a Bushmaster so I take my gun out of storage to shoot competitively”.  If you want a level fire shotgun for home protection that’s even easier to get.  But you don’t truly need to stockpile handguns and assault rifles so those days are over. </p>

<p>If you mean fully automatic weapons, those were banned a long time ago, and the only fully automatic weapons available are from before the ban and are extremely expensive as they are highly sought by collectors and firearm enthusiasts.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re talking about semi-auto weapons then I do not agree. You can still commit a mass shooting with bolt action rifles or single action revolvers. As the article link shows, the worse mass shooting in Australian history was done with a bolt action .22, in the US the infamous clocktower shooting was done with a bolt action rifle. </p>

<p>The problem with suggesting a system where you can only own a weapon for a legitimate reason is A) firearm ownership in the US is a right and B) who defines what is a legitimate reason? I don&#39;t own any guns, but if I were to purchase a weapon for home defense, I would choose a semi-auto rifle with a low caliber, such as an AR 15. Why? It would offer low penetration, that means any shots that do not hit their intended target have less of a chance of making it through a wall and hitting someone else. A magazine of 20-30 shots would also help in the case of multiple intruders, and would offset the loss of accuracy you&#39;re going to encounter from fear and adrenaline. Additionally being able to press the rifle up against your body is going to increase stability of the barrel. </p>

<p>And on the first point, owning firearms is a right in the US. A right that most people manage to use without abusing. Most gun owners do not commit gun crimes. I have a serious problem with people suggesting that we should take away rights because a small % of the population abuses those rights. If we do that, why should we stop at guns? There are other areas of risk created by small amount of people who abuse their rights and privileges. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I am talking about semi-automatic, large capacity weapons.  Which includes a lot of handguns.  Again, this was addressed in Australia. They asked “how often is there an incident including multiple waves of intruders that warrants the need for a gun that can rapidly kill 10-20 people?”. The answer was not nearly enough to warrant access to these weapons by civilians.  So they bought them back and made their ownership limited to people who absolutely need them with tight control over the permits. If you are caught with one illegally you are sent to jail before you can commit a crime.  Pretty simple and it has worked great for them.  You can own lever or bolt actual guns fairly easily but you can’t just go out and get an AR15 or a handgun without a legitimate reason.  In this case they put the safety of the majority against the few vocal “gun rights enthusiasts” and it has paid dividends for them.  </p>

<p>You bring up the US tower shooter but he was a highly trained sniper - had he had a better or more powerful gun their would have been more casualties.  That’s also why a student who walks into a school in Kentucky kills 2 and injures 18 with a handgun while this Florida kid has an AR15 and kills 17 with 14 injured.

<p>Anyone calling the defense of constitutional rights selfish is an ignoramus, especially when you&#39;ve failed to address points such as the fact that most gun owners don&#39;t commit gun crimes.

<p>Cool, Australia doesn&#39;t have the equivalent of a second amendment, which was made not just so people could defend themselves, but to defend against the tyranny of the government. It&#39;s also foolish to suggest that a change that would work for Australia would work exactly the same for the United States. There are a number of variables at play, one major one is that Australia is a (relatively) small island with no other countries touching it. The US has a much larger border. How do you think the country will prevent guns from being smuggled in? Why are there less gun crimes in Australia even though they still have guns? The same could be said for England or other countries with restrictive gun control in place, but people still own weapons, and shootings are down. What are the different factors? How come in places like Switzerland or Iceland there are many guns but low gun homicides? </p>

<p>Additionally, how do you suggest you ban those types of weapons without criminals or extremist groups from keeping theirs? Do you really think right wing groups will simply relinquish their firearms, or criminals? </p>

We actually have a microcosm of this in the US where you can look at states with more restrictive gun laws like Massachusetts then compare that to states where you don’t even need a permit like Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Montana. For instance, why does Montana have a fairly similar population density to Australia but have 16.7 firearm deaths per 100,000 people while Australia has .93? Why is the rate in Massachusetts only 3.18 per 100,000? People just ignore the statistically proven examples and just say “forgot your fancy science numbers, this is America and I deserve my rights!”  How many people need to die at the hands of a high powered rifle before we realize that maybe the second amendment was written a long time ago for an entirely different reason and we can compromise on what is necessary for hunting or self-defense and what is an unnecessary amount of lethal force for the average civilian? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>What about Illinois? How are those restrictive gun laws working for Chicago? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For instance, why does Montana have a fairly similar population density to Australia but have 16.7 firearm deaths per 100,000 people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, Montana has a murder rate of 3.5 per 100,000, so your only answer is suicide (which do make up the majority of gun related deaths) or accidental gun deaths. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>People just ignore the statistically proven examples and just say “forgot your fancy science numbers, this is America and I deserve my rights!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People also tend to forget that the vast majority of gun owners don&#39;t commit gun crimes, or that rifles are responsible for a fraction of gun homicides every year. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How many people need to die at the hands of a high powered rifle before </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Less than 500 people are killed every year with rifles, and that&#39;s all rifles, not just semi-auto. On the other hand, around 10,000 people die every year from alcohol related vehicle accidents. Are you also going around trying to get alcohol banned? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>we realize that maybe the second amendment was written a long time ago for an entirely different reason</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. The 2nd amendment was written with individual ownership of military grade weapons in mind. Semi-auto rifles <em>are</em> the compromise.</p>

<p>From DC vs Heller</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Pp. 2–53. (a) The Amendment’s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause’s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2–22. (b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court’s interpretation of the operative clause. The “militia” comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens’ militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens’ militia would be preserved. Pp. 22–28.</p>

<p>Regarding your last point, what happened in Australia was that normal citizens either turned their guns in and got permits if they needed them. Criminals found in possession of illegal firearms went to jail for longer terms. And, as you can see, at this point you don’t see large scale gun attacks being carried out. Pretty simple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not that simple, you just think it is. Other countries have stricter gun control than Australia or the US and have far higher gun homicide rates than either. There are a multitude of factors that you are ignoring. In the US for example the majority of gun homicides are done by people associated with gangs or drug trafficking. Many murderers also have mental health issues. The solution is to better peoples lives, banning the majority of guns as you propose will just create a large black market that crime will thrive from.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are 3rd world countries with stricter gun laws and more murders. When you compare us to our peers with strict gun laws like Japan it’s not even close.  Illinois’s issue with guns are pretty well documented with regard to Indiana but at least they are putting people in jail when they find them in illegal possession of guns. If the laws were more strict for everyone and the stakes were more high they wouldn’t be able to get those type of guns.</p>

<p>Just like Australia, I’m not talking about all rifles either. You can still have the bolt action hunting rifles and level action shotguns.  We are talking about semi-automatic rifles and handguns capable of mass shootings.  </p>

<p>The real people pushing the agenda that you are pushing are gun manufacturers.  More guns with highly trained people doesn’t seem to stop these instances.  Chris Kyle is as highly trained as it gets and he couldn’t prevent his own murder while armed.  Fort Hood was able to be shot up when it itself is a military compound.  In this instance with the Florida kid everyone knew he had an AR-15. If the gun itself was illegal then maybe it doesn’t get this far.  One person finds out he has an illegal weapon and he gets arrested before anything happens. That’s the difference. In Australia you need to illegally obtain a “rapid fire weapon” (with that I mean semi-automatic weapon capable of firing many rounds within seconds) and then you need to conceal it and then commit your crime.  It doesn’t happen their anymore. Here you can literally walk around with it in public in certain states.  It’s out of hand and certainly not what our forefathers intended. </p>

<p>So why do you think gun control is going to magically lead to less gun homicides? The US is not the same country as Australia, Japan, or the European countries of your choice. The fact is, socioeconomic and mental health factors play a large role in US gun crimes, and you&#39;re willfully ignoring that. Chicago has the highest gun murder rate in the country, and Illinois&#39; gun control measures are doing little to stop that. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The worst mass shooting in Australia was done with a bolt action .22, which you can still own in Australia. Mass shootings can be done with any type of gun. </p>

<p>You realize people don&#39;t walk around with guns on bases unless you&#39;re talking about MPs, right? You have to leave your guns in the armory. </p>

<p>And once again I will ask, why are you not campaigning for alcohol to be banned? If you care so much about the &lt;500 people killed by rifles, why aren&#39;t you talking about the 10,000 killed in alcohol related accidents? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>In your view it&#39;s not what the forefathers intended. In the supreme court&#39;s ruling, it is. </p>

At the very least what you are arguing is that the United States is not yet ready for their citizens to let go of their guns - that it is not as civilized and decent as the UK or Japan or Australia or Canada where we couldn’t possibly handle not being able to protect ourselves with the ability to spray copious amounts of ammunition.  In the end it’s going to end up just like slavery or tobacco - the reality is going to become too much for the people standing to profit and rationality will prevail.

<p>Go look up the statistics on burglaries and break ins per year and then compare them to how many mass shootings happen every year. Burglaries and home break ins are an every day occurrence, mass shootings are not. &lt;500 people die every year from rifles. The fact is you&#39;re unable to deal with reality, you&#39;re so afraid of guns that you&#39;ve convinced yourself that &lt;500 deaths are a bigger deal than the 10,000 caused by alcohol, which doesn&#39;t even seem to be on your radar. And yes, once again you point out countries WITH LESS INCOME INEQUALITY. IF I thought you had any balls I&#39;d go tell you too look at the murder rates in the US by race and go compare those individuals rates of other entire countries.</p>

<p>You&#39;re also forgetting the fact that in the UK and in Canada you can in fact own semi auto rifles! I&#39;m sorry you can&#39;t argue the facts, you barely respond to any of my points and most of your points have been dealt with. You can take your arguments somewhere else, I have dealt with them and at the end of the day the supreme court has ruled that the 2nd amendment supports the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, and this include ASSAULT RIFLES.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except in many of those countries, you can still get guns. Your idea is to ban semi-auto handguns and rifles, but in many European nations(and in Canada), people can still own those types of guns.   The best rebuttal to that argument is that there are other factors at play, such as access to healthcare to treat mental illness, and less income inequality. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m honestly not sure what the argument is against that?</p>

<p>The vast majority of gun owners do not commit gun crimes. The constitution allows for the individual ownership of arms in common use (including handguns and semi auto rifles). You do not take away the rights of the entire population because a small amount of the population abuses that right. It is also foolish to propose a ban on semi auto rifles, when you will not also vouch for banning everything else that causes similar levels of death. </p>

<p>For the third time, are you going to take a stand against alcohol? Like I said before, 10,000 people die every year from alcohol related motor vehicle accidents. If you do not agree that alcohol should be banned, I have no other choice but to believe you are a hypocrite and only emphasize guns because you hold negative emotions towards them. Is this about banning harmful objects, or about your own feelings towards guns? Why have you not responded to this question?</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what a strawman is. A strawman would be misrepresenting your argument, such as saying that because you believe in gun control you want victims of crime to be helpless. I&#39;m not using a strawman, I&#39;m using to example of deaths from alcohol related motor vehicle accidents to show that your motivations are biased. You want to ban or restrict access to semi-automatic weapons because they are dangerous, but I highly doubt after this conversation you will have the same passion in advocating for the ban of alcohol, even though it has been shown to you that deaths from alcohol related motor vehicle accidents are far more than those caused by rifles of any kind. You did not answer the question &quot;Why should the intention matter more if in both scenarios innocent people are dying?&quot; so I do not know why there would be a greater reason to ban rifles even though alcohol is the result of many times more deaths. The problem is that if you don&#39;t have a good justification, you are simply seeking the ban of one thing based on an irrational preoccupation(or at the very least you have not considered other situations where the same logic applies). You can argue that semi-auto rifles give an individual more power to cause havoc, but that&#39;s a non issue when the actual death amounts are compared. It&#39;s like trying to advocate for the mass killing of sharks because they bite people, and ignoring that dogs bit far more people. The shark may be deadlier in theory, but vastly more people are bitten by dogs. If your reasoning is irrational in that it is inconsistent, then you cannot expect people to take your argument seriously.</p>

<p>Sure, that may very well be true. The detail you&#39;re neglecting is that other western nations offer better access to healthcare, so that people can get treatment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And only about 4% of gun crimes can be attributed to mental health issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source? And what about socioeconomic factors? What kind of correlation is there between shooters and their income status, family status, do they live in a crime ridden area, do they live in a culture that glorifies gun violence or fetishizes guns? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You’ve got examples of 1st world countries who have had lax gun laws and then changed them to watch gun violence drop dramatically.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source? From what I have seen, Australia&#39;s gun crimes were already trending down before the 1996 ban. I seem to recall that the UK saw a drop, but now knife attacks are up dramatically. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have states right in this country that have strict gun laws that see less gun violence than states that don’t require permits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we also have areas where there are stricter gun laws and massive amounts of shootings, such as Chicago. Why do you think Chicago has some of the worst shooting rates in the world? Do you think we might be able to link socioeconomic factors? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every argument for the other side is justification and research being pushed on us by the gun manufacturers themselves. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think that maybe they are pushing the same arguments because they are valid, and as businesses it is in their interest to protect themselves? Do you not think that people who work for gun manufacturers may be firearm enthusiasts themselves and thus they would argue the same way that an enthusiast would? I make my arguments based on a logical interpretation of statistics and facts, I don&#39;t need a gun manufacturer or the NRA to tell me how to do that. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The same with big tobacco and climate denial - there’s just too much money at stake to try to do the right thing. </p>

<p>The right thing is entirely subjective. You say that it involves restricting the rights of all Americans based on the negative actions of a minority, I vehemently disagree. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the main justification is that for some reason everyone in this country deserves to own a very dangerous tool</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They don&#39;t &#39;deserve&#39; it, they have a right to unless they have committed a crime that disqualifies them from doing so. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>even though most other countries have already figured out that it’s both unnecessary and a bad idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not true, many of the countries you have used as examples still allow access to firearms, even semi-automatic weapons, albeit with more restricting in <strong>some</strong> cases. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>People talk about how great the right to have a gun is while our county leads the world in mass shooting of children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can think it&#39;s great to be able to own a gun and think it&#39;s horrible that children are dying, the main thing is I would rather treat the underlying issues rather than try to ban or restrict access to an object. That&#39;s the thing, many things in this country are illegal or restricted, and yet people still break the law and find ways to obtain illegal things. Making actions illegal in no way guarantees someone will still not do that action, and banning or restricting an object does not guarantee people will not be able to access it or will be deterred from accessing it. In fact when you&#39;re talking about objects that are high in demand, all banning or restricting something is likely to do is generate a black market, which will only empower criminals. The same repeating criminals that are responsible for the vast majority of shootings in the US.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also I like having discussions on here but I don’t know why you keep using such a condescending tone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, you did piss me off when you told me that arguing for my rights is a selfish thing to do. I understand you&#39;re upset over gun deaths, but calling someone selfish is simply rude. It seems very ignorant to me to simply dismiss someone&#39;s rights, rights upheld by the supreme court as selfish because some people choose to abuse those rights. The 2nd amendment is not the only right that has negative consequences, but it must be said that negative consequences are not a valid reason to deprive everyone of their rights.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you&#39;re making a very extreme argument, that is to ban or restrict access to all semi-automatic weapons based on the policies of other countries while neglecting the various other variables that play into gun violence, such as socioeconomic factors. These countries also have policies that differ from one another, and there is no cross analysis in this discussion to represent those differences. </p>

<p>I&#39;d would also say that I&#39;m quite frustrated with a lack of your response to my rebuttals, such as how the US differs from other western nations in terms of socioeconomic factors, or that rifles according to the FBI are responsible for a very low amount gun murders overall. According to the FBI, rifles are responsible for less murders than knives, blunt weapons and even fists. The small amount of rifle kills is an important detail, even without considering the comparisons to the latter three categories. It&#39;s fine if you feel I have not responded to certain points of yours, if you feel I have neglected important points, please point them out. There are times in this discussion where I have ignored certain points because I felt that I had already answered them and you were repeating yourself, and other times where what you said was not a relevant point. An example of this is your mention of Chris Kyle, that is an anecdote, and even if we consider an anecdote to be relevant we probably do not have all the information we need. You are using it to show that a well trained person was not able to defend themselves, but we could draw up other anecdotes and possible stats to show that well trained, or not so well trained people have defended themselves with firearms. We haven&#39;t heard the details in this discussion regarding that anecdote. Did the shooter surprise Chris Kyle and his friend? Did Chris Kyle and the other man killed have reactive emotions towards harming the person that caused them to delay their response? That&#39;s pretty much why I didn&#39;t answer that one point, and there are similar justifications for others. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>just hoping to find out what the mind set is on the other side.</p>

<p>That&#39;s fair. My main reasoning as I have said is that I do not agree with limiting the rights of the majority because of the abuses of individuals. I do think it&#39;s important to tackle the underlying issues. Here&#39;s a great article that explains the reasoning behind my type of stance.

Whether it&#39;s called a strawman or a red herring or whatever, your attempting to move the goalpost from a discussion about semi-automatic guns to a discussion about guns, alcohol, and whatever else might be dangerous within our society.  Calling me a hypocrite is like denouncing me for having a alzheimers charity because I&#39;m not giving equal attention to leukemia.  So let&#39;s focus on one issue at a time here which is guns.  After this debate we can certainly debate alcohol or opioids or whatever you would like - obviously American society isn&#39;t perfect so there are a lot of issues to address but you are attempting to move the goalposts using fallacies rather than just discuss the facts regarding guns in America.  </p>

<p>Now, regarding the sources that you want, here are some main points from a New York Times article regarding guns in America that touches on a lot of what I&#39;ve been trying to explain/I&#39;ve been quoting. It&#39;s copied from another discussion this site. I found your Washington post article interesting though not entirely convincing since they mainly just said &quot;in my research I found this&quot; without really showing much of the research or statistics.</p>

<p>There are is a lot of interesting debate here about gun control. Here&#39;s a TL;DR from <a href="https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/americas/mass-shootings-us-international.html">here</a> </p>

<ul>
<li>Americans make up about 4.4 percent of the global population but own 42 percent of the world’s guns. From 1966 to 2012, 31 percent of the gunmen in mass shootings worldwide were American <a href="http://adamlankford.com/research.htm">1</a></li>
</ul>

<p>*  Adjusted for population, only Yemen has a higher rate of mass shootings among countries with more than 10 million people. Yemen has the world’s second-highest rate of gun ownership after the United States.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If mental health made the difference, then data would show that Americans have more mental health problems than do people in other countries with fewer mass shootings. A 2015 study estimated that only 4 percent of American gun deaths could be attributed to mental health issues <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24861430">2</a>
EDIT : This was misleading - The published paper reads </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, the 1-year population attributable risk of violence associated with serious mental illness alone was found to be only 4% in the ECA surveys. Attributable risk takes into account both the magnitude of risk and the number of people in the risk category within the population.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>America’s gun homicide rate was 33 per million people in 2009, far exceeding the average among developed countries. Americans sometimes see this as an expression of deeper problems with crime. But the United States is not actually more prone to crime than other developed countries. Rather, they found, in data that has since been repeatedly confirmed, that American crime is simply more lethal. <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/8/27/9217163/america-guns-europe">3</a></p></li>
<li><p>A New Yorker is just as likely to be robbed as a Londoner, for instance, but the New Yorker is 54 times more likely to be killed in the process.They concluded that the discrepancy, like so many other anomalies of American violence, came down to guns.</p></li>
<li><p>In China, about a dozen seemingly random attacks on schoolchildren killed 25 people between 2010 and 2012. Most used knives; none used a gun.
By contrast, in this same window, the United States experienced five of its deadliest mass shootings, which killed 78 people. Scaled by population, the American attacks were 12 times as deadly.</p></li>
<li><p>The United States also has some of the weakest controls over who may buy a gun and what sorts of guns may be owned.</p></li>
<li><p>Switzerland has the second-highest gun ownership rate of any developed country, about half that of the United States. Its gun homicide rate in 2004 was 7.7 per million people — unusually high, in keeping with the relationship between gun ownership and murders, but still a fraction of the rate in the United States. Swiss gun laws are more stringent, setting a higher bar for securing and keeping a license, for selling guns and for the types of guns that can be owned. Such laws reflect more than just tighter restrictions. They imply a different way of thinking about guns, as something that citizens must affirmatively earn the right to own.</p></li>
<li><p>After Britain had a mass shooting in 1987, the country instituted strict gun control laws. So did Australia after a 1996 shooting. But the United States has repeatedly faced the same calculus and determined that relatively unregulated gun ownership is worth the cost to society.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That choice, more than any statistic or regulation, is what most sets the United States apart.</p>

<p>EDIT : Formatting</p>

<p>EDIT 2 : A lot of questions about gun violence and mental illness. Here is (once again) a link to the text version of the paper (from 2015, by the US National Library of Medicine and the National Institute of Health) - (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4211925/%C2%A0%C2%A0and">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4211925/  and</a> thanks for the gold!</p>

<p>EDIT 3 : Please read the linked article! Takes about 6-8 mins tops. The title is &quot;What explains U.S. Mass shootings?&quot;. I&#39;m a firm believer that reading well researched articles/papers/journalistic pieces which provide the sources as well, lead to well informed, civil discussions based on facts and data. Since I&#39;m a lurker_n00b Redditor who hasn&#39;t fully understood the etiquettes of posting, I placed this comment in this particular post since the discussions revolved around gun control in the USA - perhaps it deserved it&#39;s own post elsewhere. Also, in my haste I might have left out important contextual information around the points that I summarised! Please accept my apologies. I urge everyone stepping in here to read the linked article. Thanks.</p>

<p>EDIT 4 : (Probably final edit, thanks for all the comments!) I decided to delete the final quotation - which was from a tweet - that I had included at the bottom of my comment from the original article. I think it&#39;s unnecessarily dramatic and takes from the point of the original article and you can find it there anyway.</p>

<p>One main point you keep bringing up is that, if there were restrictions on these guns people would just use knives or non-semi auto weapons but you make that point as if that wouldn&#39;t be a good thing.  It&#39;s obvious that a knife is going to be less deadly than a semi-automatic gun with high capacity magazines.  You also keep bringing up an incident in Australia regarding a .22 - I would love to check that out to see what the circumstances were. Similarly people bring up the Texas tower sniper Charles Whitman with the same article but they fail to mention that he was a highly trained military marksman at a high vantage point. He killed 17 people.  In Port Arthur a nearly mentally retarded man with an IQ of 66 (which 90% of 11 year olds score higher than) walked into a cafeteria with an AR-15 with a 30 round mag. He killed 35 people, 12 of which were mortally wounded within 15-30 seconds of the first shot.  It&#39;s hard to imagine Whitman wouldn&#39;t have been more lethal with a more advanced weapon like is available today or that Martin Bryant could have done what he did with either a 10 shot magazine or a bolt or lever action weapon.  </p>

<p>In regards to socioeconomics - that&#39;s actually the biggest argument <em>for</em> restrictions in my opinion. As of now, even in Chicago, you can just either go to Indiana or have someone go there and buy a handgun for you with no permit.  It&#39;s sourced again and again with the Chicago argument - most guns aren&#39;t bought there.  So then the argument back is &quot;well criminals will just find guns somehow&quot; which they currently do. But, if handguns and semi-automatic rifles <em>weren&#39;t</em> readily available in the US and the penalties for being caught with one were more stringent (since they would both be an illegal firearm AND unregistered at that point) at the very least the barrier to obtain them becomes a lot higher.  Think about Japan where you need a VERY specific reason to have handgun and being caught with one illegally can carry a 10 year prison sentence.  Obviously the difficulty in obtaining one is a lot higher where your average teen with a couple hundred dollars can&#39;t find a way to skirt the rules and no one is going to risk trafficking guns for a couple hundred dollar profit when you risk spending the rest of your life in prison.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s the main part that people don&#39;t address from the other side.  Of course <em>some people</em> will still be able to get illegal firearms.  But when it comes to large scale statistics, reducing the ability to get those guns and the number of guns available statistically reduces the occurrence of those crimes, as we&#39;ve seen in a lot of civilized countries.  Really, at this point, the only argument that prevents gun control is the &quot;but muh rights&quot; argument.  The 2nd amendment is exactly that - an amendment. Amendments were added to allow women and African Americans to vote.  An amendment can be added to drastically reduce mass murder of innocent children as well.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another fallacy from you - this time electing for the “slippery slope” argument.  “If they prevent people from buying handheld killing machines, next thing they won’t let us vote or speak out mind!”. You’re probably the same kind of person that is against gay marriage because you think it will lead to sex with animals.  Again, I’m not talking about taking away all of the rights or even all of the guns. As of right now you can’t buy an fully automatic uzi or a bazooka.  But the second amendment is still there? If we add semi-automatic handguns with 20 shot clips - literally designed solely for killing humans, the 2nd amendment would still allow you to maintain a well regulated militia. With the proper permits and reasons you could still potentially obtain those types of weapons. But you wouldn’t be able to walk into a store in Texas, show your ID, walk out with a handgun, and shoot up Fort Hood. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a strange little nod to the philosophy that led to the American 2nd Amendment in this whole story.  Ironically, the only country with enough guns to actually achieve Marx&#39;s dream is America, but at the same time America is probably the only country with enough guns to ensure Communism will never happen.</p>

<p>The other part I find so interesting is that Communism was supposed to be an organic process, but all I see are a bunch of wannabes trying to force the issue.  That doesn&#39;t work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, since you are working to actually solve problems in the real world, here&#39;s a thought that occurred to me a while back:</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that once people experience a well-constructed socialist environment, they will understand the necessity and purpose and desirability of it, but not until they experience it first-hand.  So, what if you supplied a service that people desperately need, but in order to obtain it you ask not for money, but for participation in a much larger (socialist) experiment?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good idea and I think it would be really beneficial in influencing peoples&#39; views towards socialism, but the problem (at least, in my case) is the lack of resources necessary to offer such a service &quot;for free.&quot; If a system like UBI were ever implemented where peoples&#39; basic needs are met, I think there would be a lot of free services and organizations that would spring up. But as long as people have rent to pay I think it&#39;s impossible for the vast majority to dedicate any additional resources towards something like this.</p>

<p>But yeah, definitely a good idea as far as outreach and changing minds are considered, just not feasible for most people to do right now at least. Not that the working class couldn&#39;t pool resources effectively, but a lot of people are operating on razor thin budget margins as it is :/</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Assumption two: That I describe myself by skin colour, sexuality or gender.</p>

<p>Assumption four: That I&#39;m a liberal.</p>

<p>Why does someone saying that racism, sexism and homophobia exist make you feel the need to make hyperbolic and disingenuous assumptions about them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really, really have that backwards. Liberals are the Starbucks drinking college kids who vote along gender/identity politics and feel-good reaction, without any sort of examination whatsoever of the political or economic history which has led to our present. Not that they&#39;re stupid, but they are ignorant.</p>

<p>Leftists have reached their opinions through intense reading and discussion, examining the structural aspects of society which give incentive to create the conditions we currently see. Most often they are in intense opposition to capitalism, and they see how the capitalist elite are inextricably linked to our political &quot;representatives,&quot; and for this reason they wish to see the end of capitalism entirely.</p>

<p>Because of both the relationship between capitalism and the state <em>as well as</em> the history of opposition to leftist movements everywhere in the world, I can&#39;t think of a rational leftist argument to do away with guns.</p>

<p>Disarmament of the working class only makes sense in the mind of someone who trusts capitalism and trusts the state. </p>

Yes. If a totalitarian government wanted to actually control something worth controlling then they would need armed men to do it. And guess what, gun owners in America absolutely and vastly outnumber law men (police and military) without even counting the how many law men would defect, especially military.

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the people I know are democrats, and literally none of them want to ban guns. What they want is <em>reasonable</em> gun controls measures. For example, the measure that Obama put in place restricting gun access for people with a history of severe mental illness. Trump rescinded that almost immediately when he got into office. The people I know also want to close the background check loophole for gun shows. There is no rational reason to require background checks for gun shop purchases but not for gun show purchases. These are the kinds of &quot;gun control&quot; measures that the democrats I know want.  </p>

<p>The problem is that right wing bloviators like Limbaugh and the like have somehow convinced the Right that the democrats literally want to disarm the country. The propaganda at work there is extremely powerful and effective, and especially disturbing given that there is literally zero--null, nadda--evidence to suggest that the democratic party wants to take away people&#39;s guns. In fact, the democratic party consistently goes out of its way to true to refute this false narrative. Yet, the narrative remains. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not looking to fight anybody either, which is why I am trying to use words here to persuade others. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>a failed rhetoric inspired by an intellectual moron</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1) &quot;Communism&quot; isn&#39;t &quot;a failed rhetoric,&quot; or even a failed anything. It is a <em>theoretical</em> end state of a society which has fully socialized the means of production, and which has become as a result classless, moneyless, and state-less. That is <em>the definition</em> of communism. </p>

<p>You&#39;re mistaking &quot;communism&quot; for Marxist <em>derived</em> ideologies, i.e. Marxism-Leninism/Stalinism/Maoism et al. </p>

<p>I understand why you are making this mistake, because they&#39;ve referred to themselves (in the USSR/China etc) as &quot;communist.&quot; This is because the communist end state I described is the nominal end goal of the ideologies these states support. That does not mean they they themselves or the states they represent are a representation of a communist society.</p>

<p>2) <strong><em>Communism predates Marx, and even among his contemporaries he was not alone in criticism of capitalism or description of alternatives.</em></strong> Look up Pierre Joseph Proudhon and Josiah Warren. Their conclusions were themselves derived logically from positions espoused by Adam Smith. Criticism of capitalism didn&#39;t just spring from Marx.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you have identified the failures of various authoritarian regimes as &quot;Marx inspired,&quot; but Marx is far from the only intellectual to advance these ideas. </p>

<p>Peter Kropotkin, for example, was a famed anarcho-communist revolutionary, but he abhorred Marxism, like many of Marx&#39;s contemporaries did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>P.s. to further illustrate that what you are speaking of as &quot;communism&quot; (state socialism) isn&#39;t all socialism, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism">anarcho-syndicalism</a> is an example of libertarian socialism. There is no state, and little if any similarity with Marx derived ideologies. It was with the anarcho-syndicalists that George Orwell fought Franco&#39;s Fascists in Spain. It was his experiences there that made him a life long socialist. Yes, Orwell was a socialist, 1984 was an indictment of authoritarianism and Stalinism, not &quot;socialism.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If capitalism was brought down in the US the most likely method would be gradual legislation, in my opinion. A majority of millennials don&#39;t like capitalism, and if that opinion persists as they get older and actually start to vote then capitalism may start to get whittled away.  Even if they change their opinion they would still probably prefer a hybrid socialist/capitalist system. This slow change probably won&#39;t cause any armed uprising of capitalists since there wouldn&#39;t be a hard target. It would just be their neighbors voting differently. </p>

<p>Think about it. What would cause you to get your gun and start shooting? Where&#39;s that line? </p>

Liberals are the Starbucks drinking college kids who vote along gender/identity politics and feel-good reaction, without any sort of examination whatsoever of the political or economic history which has led to our present. Not that they&#39;re stupid, but they are ignorant.</p>

<p>Leftists have reached their opinions through intense reading and discussion, examining the structural aspects of society which give incentive to create the conditions we currently see. Most often they are in intense opposition to capitalism, and they see how the capitalist elite are inextricably linked to our political &quot;representatives,&quot; and for this reason they wish to see the end of capitalism entirely.</p>

<p>Because of both the relationship between capitalism and the state <em>as well as</em> the history of opposition to leftist movements everywhere in the world, I can&#39;t think of a rational leftist argument to do away with guns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are 3rd world countries with stricter gun laws and more murders. When you compare us to our peers with strict gun laws like Japan it’s not even close.  Illinois’s issue with guns are pretty well documented with regard to Indiana but at least they are putting people in jail when they find them in illegal possession of guns. If the laws were more strict for everyone and the stakes were more high they wouldn’t be able to get those type of guns.</p>

<p>Just like Australia, I’m not talking about all rifles either. You can still have the bolt action hunting rifles and level action shotguns.  We are talking about semi-automatic rifles and handguns capable of mass shootings.  </p>

<p>The real people pushing the agenda that you are pushing are gun manufacturers.  More guns with highly trained people doesn’t seem to stop these instances.  Chris Kyle is as highly trained as it gets and he couldn’t prevent his own murder while armed.  Fort Hood was able to be shot up when it itself is a military compound.  In this instance with the Florida kid everyone knew he had an AR-15. If the gun itself was illegal then maybe it doesn’t get this far.  One person finds out he has an illegal weapon and he gets arrested before anything happens. That’s the difference. In Australia you need to illegally obtain a “rapid fire weapon” (with that I mean semi-automatic weapon capable of firing many rounds within seconds) and then you need to conceal it and then commit your crime.  It doesn’t happen their anymore. Here you can literally walk around with it in public in certain states.  It’s out of hand and certainly not what our forefathers intended. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Controlling a populace (without destroying infrastructure or the work force) requires boots on the ground. It requires law men on the streets, enforcing the laws that a totalitarian society lays forth. Even if the government had a death star, they would still need boots on the ground to enforce order without destroying the thing entirely, and if they do that then they&#39;ve lost because now they&#39;re in control of a pile of ashes so... Yes. If a totalitarian government wanted to actually control something worth controlling then they would need armed men to do it. And guess what, gun owners in America absolutely and vastly outnumber law men (police and military) without even counting the how many law men would defect, especially military. Because guess where most of the military comes from? Red States. Our military is sworn to the Constitution, and not the people that happen to be in power at the time. </p>
