       I'm sick of seeing this piece of shit appearing on the front page with some bullshit positive story and seeing hundreds of comments like "wow I'm an atheist but this guy seems like a great person" or "I'm glad we have a person like this in the world today"

       The pope isn't there to comment on leaders. He is there as the voice of God, and in the grand scheme of things i don't think God gives two shits either way about who is president. Or maybe he does and loads of people prayed hard enough for Hillary not to win.

       two-three things about that.
       <br/>
       first, the infallibility principle established in the 19th century states that the pope is, just like god, infallible.  he can declare lierally whatever to be a church dogma and doctrine starting from tomorrow and noone could challenge him.
      </p>
      <p>
       second, the fundamental jesuit motto is that the end justifies the means.  so they can lie, kill, rape and torture without impunity, since ultimately its for 'gods greater glory'
      </p>
      <p>
       third, the mkultra style jesuit training developed by loyola in the cave and the extreme secret oath they all take after a certain level combined with near unlimited power granted by the order you can have an idea of the mindset these people posess and operate under.

       the big bang was invented by a jesuit astronomer.  (btw the biggest binocular telescope in the world today is called lucifer and is operated exclusively by jesuits on old indian holy grounds.)

       the darwin family was a known jacobin family.

       the bavarian illuminati was founded at ingolstadt, a jesuit university.  the french revolution was organized by the very same illuminati.  the french revolutionaries called themselves the jacobins.  the theory of evolution is a jesuit construct.

       I wake up everyday, and think about ways to take down Soros, Rothschilds, M.I.C., War Mongers, Banking System, Pope + Vatican, The Pedo Rings, Religion (Especially Judaism + Islam), the Plutocracy, and so on. All of us here should be waking up like this and thinking solutions daily

       Well, we can feed the troll or starve the troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       In terms of how to "win" I'd say 2 ways. The first is to start with yourself, grow, change, become enlightened. The second is to keep waking others up because when we reach Hundreth monkey level of human awakening, then the shit "they" have been up to gets exposed in the light.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also alt movements, start new cities with new models of Gov, crypto, gardening, alt schooling with critical thinking and teaching kids trades/crafts. etc. Create completely off the gird communities based on solar/tesla batteries/tech with a balanced community farming system: Hydro/aquaponics/animal/fish/etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Create some sort of meritocracy, social contracts system, where people have trust values just within the community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be completely off any of the banking systems that are Rothschild's based and create new alternatives.

       There are a handful of icons that make the front page about once a month, including the Pope and Freddie Mercury.  Even though the reddit userbase is mostly secular atheists who were born after F.M. died.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think these icons make the front page because of a NWO pedo conspiracy.  I think the admins pump these icons because they are symbols of things the admins want to push.  Freddie Mercury is a martyr of the homosexual movement in the era of AIDS.  The pope is a symbol of a resurgent left wing social justice movement, particularly as it applies to Latin American Marxism.

       Woah woah woah. You have to give me some evidence about Freddie. Yeah he was flaming gay, and was an international icon but dudes have been butt fucking each other since the dawn if man. I'm stright, but got no beef with the gays. I would not put Freddie and the pope in the same categories just because he openly liked butt stuff. Now prove to me he raped and murdered children and I'll be on your side.

       Pope Francis has been a huge step forward for the church, and has done a lot of good things. Problems that existed with the Vatican mostly still exist, but that doesn't make Pope Francis not an improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't expect you to care OP, you have pretty clearly made up your mind, but maybe consider that there are a large number of people on Reddit who see good acts and improvements from the Pope as something to celebrate.

       I'm more saying that even if you believe the Vatican to be a monstrous organization, as OP clearly does, electing a new head that shakes things up in many positive ways is clearly a cause for some celebration, and I think much of Reddit sees it that way.

       I understand its nice to celebrate positive changes, but if people really knew the horrors of what actually goes on, and what gets covered up.... they will see the positivity is just an attempt to balance their actions to stay relevant and "godlike". But to each their own always. Conspiracy or not this stuff is actually happening. Even right now as we are typing

       Would you mind commenting on some of the ways he has shaken things up in a positive way? I am genuinely curious about what he has done since he became pope and I do not know enough about the Catholic system to judge whether an action of his could be considered a "shake up."

       This list touches on some of the things (although it's a few years old) that got people excited about Pope Francis. Unfortunately I'm not somewhere I can do deeper research for you, plus this'll probably just get downvoted with the rest.

       I see myself fall in that aswell, Seeing something heartwarming still has that little place in your heart even if it is the pope. 
Now, Does that mean we should say hes a great guy? No. He did a good thing. Thats it.
The bad that this guy has done isnt even comprehendable to the population. Even if its not all true that doesn't matter.

       Except that's not true. Benedict's literal brother was implicated in the cover up of the abuse of hundreds of boys in a choir he oversaw for 30 years. It is widely agreed that his brother knew about the abuse and ignored it. And that's just one example. Benedict made a show, but there wasn't real substance.

       That's what I don't understand. If you take any one part out of the "gospel of the lord" to fit the needs of society, how is

       Sigh - not a troll.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was raised Catholic and always questioned the seemingly crazy things priests were saying. I never liked going to church because it always felt too cultish for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I moved out I was finally able to stop going to church without the level of guilt my mother would impose on me.

       Apparently happened when he was in his Popemobile. Hit his eye when brakes were slammed. There’s aren’t many photos of the day it happened, but there are photos of him with drops of blood on his clothes. I dunno.

       What constitutes a failure as far as being pope is concerned?
      </p>
      <p>
       He's gods representative on earth,no?
      </p>
      <p>
       What he says and does is the will of god so he literally can't be wrong. He can't be a failure unless god himself is a failure.

       he won't even visit his own country(Argentina), because of his aligence to the former and most corrupt government ever seen here. In a real dick move he's visited every country surrounding his homeland including Chile which is practically our backyard.  he doesn't like the current democratically elected president and doesn't even dissimulate his disapproval.

       And whilst in Chile, he said in one of his masses or public appearances that the accusations against a local priest were absolute lies. The testimonies of the victims and witnesses have already been part of the evidence to convict at least one other priest.

       Just like with any other politician, there is no way you can become a Pope if your hands aren't dirty. Fuck, you can't even be a fucking candidate to be a Pope if your hands aren't dirty.

       Several priests did horrible things.  The entire Catholic Church has apologized and made reparations over and over.

       At what point can they try to fix their flaws, and get back to being a religious institution?

       If you say never, and that the Church should go away because of those crimes...you become a voice that doesn’t matter to them.

       To be fair, this pope doesn't live in that church, or in the Papal apartment. He lives in a 2 room unit, with other clergy, in the guesthouse, where he was living before being elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm no fan of Catholicism, but dude is a little rebellious, compared to his predecessors. Fundamentally, he hasn't changed much. He's not majorly disrupting doctrine. Pope Benedict still lives at the Vatican and has been rumored to still be writing. He announced last week that he's dying soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect some kind of reveal after his death. Some kind of prophetic writing that this whole niceguy Francis buildup has been leading to.

       I think that this guy (Pope) is genuinely OK guy or good guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But problem is people see organization (Vatican or church in general) through the Pope.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meaning if main guy is good then organization is good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its all about perception and I believe Vatican choose this guy because they wanted to improve their general image (PR move) in the eyes of the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps that translates into more donations or something like that.

       Since Generation X, Catholics were already not getting married in churches or baptizing/educating their kids. Since the Spotlight revelations, even the devoted bailed. Not just tithing in church, but paid services like each sacrament, endowments, schooling, KoC, etc. The small city I lived in previously went from 5 churches, to barely maintaining one compiled parish.

       If Scientology is financially ok.  Even after having &gt;50,000 members worldwide.  CC is great!

       Imagine how great the Catholic Church is at the end of the day.  Can cry wolf, but facts are clear.

       CC could not receive another donation for the rest of time and still out live everyone of us.

       The US Bishops are definitely strapped for cash, with reduced members and having to pay settlements on so many abuse cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not so sure the Vatican is secure. They got tied up w Rothschild money in the 1920s, I believe. I wanna say a book on Opus Dei speaks about the "black bishops", the ones operating under the radar of all the pomp and declarations.

       I know all of your links, and without comparison to Nazi/Peo Popes, you would have a point.  But I have been keen and amazed with his condemnation of Pollutors, gun manufacturers, Corporate greed, and war profiteers.

       Who is the black pope and what does he do?
I remember obama was going to bomb somewhere, and the black pope spoke out against it...and he listened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he's a Jesuit?
A Latin American “Black Pope” joined the Latin American “White Pope” in Rome today - meaning that for the first time in the Church’s history two of the most powerful figures in Catholicism are from South America.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also the first time for Catholicism that the top two posts are both occupied by Jesuits from the same part of the world. The Jesuits this morning elected Venezuelan Fr Arturo Sosa Abascal to be the new leader a role known as the “Black Pope” because of the order’s global influence and because the society have often been seen as a parallel power to the papacy.

Regarding being called the 'black pope,' I don't like it "The idea is to be an organization, the Society of Jesus, that can help the Church when, where and doing what the Church needs.  And who is going to determine what are the needs of the Church? The pope. The pope, because his function in the Church is that." The new general, a 68-year-old Venezuelan, says that "the Society of Jesus wants to serve the Church within their own vocation, which is to serve the Church and support what the bishops and pope ask them to do."

       "In approximately A.D. 1139, Saint Malachy received a vision in which it was revealed to him that there would be 112 more Popes, with the last one being the “black Pope.” Interestingly, the current Pope, Francis I, is Pope number 112 after Saint Malachy’s vision (although the count of Popes varies somewhat). Some see a connection between Pope Francis I and the color black due to Francis I being a Jesuit, and Jesuits traditionally wearing black cassocks. So, is Pope Francis I, the 112th Pope, going to be the black Pope?"

       In as 1139, “black” would not have referred to a race of people. The idea of “black people” as we know it to mean people of African descent is a real Ivey new invention, 1700 or so.

       I only read one of the articles you linked, the one about him "absolving 2000 pedophiles". Weird that's not what the article says at all. This is legitimately fake news. There are a lot of Injustices in this world, OP, why don't you go after some actual injustices rather than some editorialized titles against the head of a religion you obviously hate.

       Obviously you're a different religion (probably Protestant) that wants to make up things and use horrible sources to denigrate the Catholic Church, or you're just really fucking stupid, I guess either one seems equally likely.

       and you are 100% right.  and it was going on for a long time. they used to put in a lot of effort to hide from the eyes of public, to hide the fact, how consolidated and omnipresent their power is.  but today they are not really trying to hide it any more and despite this people are still blind to see.  america, canada, australia, uk, european union are the most openly controlled countries.  stockholm syndrome perhaps.

       The pr campaign started after they hired a catholic zealot from fox news as Vatican PR chief.  They dumped Nazi Ratzinger because he was a PR nightmare.  The man looked and sounded like nosferatu (the willem Dafoe version).  If you can find a video of ratzinger speaking, check it out.  Horribly creepy.  Not to mention, his brother was in a huge sex scandal, and ratzinger was central to the Vatican effort to cover up rapes.  All complaints went to his office before he became pope, and he instituted the policy of not making any allegations public until long after the initial complaint.
      </p>

       Pope Francis is only there because he looks more human.  Many obvious shill comments here on Reddit after his election.  I saw "I'm not even catholic, and I love pope Francis!"  many times.

       There are a handful of icons that make the front page about once a month, including the Pope and Freddie Mercury.  Even though the reddit userbase is mostly secular atheists who were born after F.M. died.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think these icons make the front page because of a NWO pedo conspiracy.  I think the admins pump these icons because they are symbols of things the admins want to push.  Freddie Mercury is a martyr of the homosexual movement in the era of AIDS.  The pope is a symbol of a resurgent left wing social justice movement, particularly as it applies to Latin American Marxism.
