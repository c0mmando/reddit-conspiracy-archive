<p>Austin Richard Post (born July 4, 1995) does not come up on a search on geni.com nor intelius.com. His dad, Richard Jordan Post, does come up on intelius but Austin is not listed as related. Why not? Amy, Elizabeth, Sydney, Byron, Jordan &amp; Mary are there. On instantcheckmate there is a Richard J. Post ,45, relatives Amy, Carol, Elizabeth, Louis, Mary, Richard, RJ &amp; Sydney but no Austin. Austin R. Post is on instantcheckmate with relatives Enna, Jodie &amp; 2 Richard Posts. Idolwiki.com says Yes, the rapper has Jewish roots. Although they are somewhat crap websites, a google search brings up prenote . net and airmax-zero . net also say that post malone is jewish. 
&quot;Malone is simply a 21-year-old white boy rapping shallow lyrics about fucking bitches and counting stacks over polished beats, and he still earns a No.1 spot atop Billboard&#39;s Top Rap album chart.The only problem with this all is: He&#39;s probably a fraud. In roughly a year, Malone — real name Austin Post — went from making Minecraft tutorial videos and covering acoustic pop songs with his friends to rocking braids and gold teeth while rapping with a distinct ghetto &quot;twang,&quot; an accent he plays with in some interviews. Many of the videos from his past life have since been deleted, only adding to the suspicion that Malone is an industry plant. Malone&#39;s success story is remarkable — so remarkable that it tiptoes into being unbelievable. Only months after moving into Los Angeles, Malone met FKi, a production team consisting of Trocon &quot;1st Down&quot; Roberts, Jr. and Steven &quot;Sauce Lord Rich&quot; Bolden, through mutual friends. While it&#39;s possible that the Dallas teenager had connections in L.A. that landed him opportunities with a production team credited for producing bangers by 2 Chainz, Tyga, Wiz Khalifa and Travis Scott, it certainly makes all his credit for producing a smash hit first single a little less impressive.&quot; -DBKnews.com.</p>

<p>Above was posted Oct. 11 2014 with the caption It was great seeing you kiddo. Good luck chasing your dreams out on the left coast.</p>

<p>Then in Feb 2015 the transition is already fully underway with the release of &quot;White Iverson&quot;. </p>

<p>This is the only other picture of him before the rap transition on his dad&#39;s twitter. Jewish teenager JIDF mode. Posted 20 Sept. 2014. The rest of the pictures of his son are just retweets of his promotional rap posters. 
He seems like another iteration of the white negro project they have Justin Bieber on. </p>

<p>Austin Post is promoted by Az Cohen, son of Lyor Cohen. Lyor&#39;s mother is Ziva Sirkis Naumann a patrilineal descendant of Rabbi Joel Yaffe Sirkis [The Ba&quot;Ch] ‪(1561 - 1640). <a href="http://www.seligman.org.il/joffe_origins.html">http://www.seligman.org.il/joffe_origins.html</a> <a href="http://www.frumkin.org.il/Files/frnevbe.pdf">http://www.frumkin.org.il/Files/frnevbe.pdf</a>. <a href="https://wiki.geni.com/index.php/Jewish_Dynasties">https://wiki.geni.com/index.php/Jewish_Dynasties</a>. Yes, we are dealing with Rabbinical Dynasties. </p>

<p>Rich Post posted one or two Merry Christmas photos but just a tree no family a what looks like co-worker picture. So which is it Austin &amp; Richard Post? </p>

<p>This brings us to Gustav Elijah Åhr or ..Lil Peep
From Wiki :  His parents were both Harvard graduates who divorced when he was a teenager.[6] Åhr&#39;s mother, Liza Womack[7] is a first grade teacher and his father is a college professor. He has Swedish, German and Irish descent.</p>

<p>I have a real hard time believing that Harvard graduate parents would let this kid do the drugs that he sang about &amp; get such awful tatoos. Cannot find the name of his father yet. His Grandmother, Liza Womack&#39;s mother, is Jenny Kastner. Jennifer Pirie married Peter Kastner. From When Scotland was Jewish : [Finally, Tyrie graveyard had several Semitic surnames: Pirie, Lyon, Lee, Lovie, Lowe (indicative of lion/Loewe for the tribe of Judah), Shirran, Lunan (Sp. de Luna) and Chivas.] Kastner is Ashkenazi jewish last name for cabinetmakers. </p>

<p>Peter Kastner&#39;s IMDB page: Peter Kastner graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) with a degree in Modern European History. He studied also at UCLA for a Masters degree in that field but put those studies aside to pursue acting work. He was a lifelong learner, most recently teaching himself Yiddish in the original Hebrew script. First wife Wendy Miller. Second wife Jenny, to whom he was married 34 years. Has a stepdaughter, Liza, and two grandsons, Oskar and Gus. One of many actors who read for the lead role in The Graduate (1967) but lost out to Dustin Hoffman. His parents were involved in a printing and publishing business. He was the second of four children, including older sister Susan Kastner, and younger siblings John Kastner and Kathy Kastner. All were involved in the entertainment business in some way - Susan was a journalist at the Toronto Star, New York Post, and Agence France-Presse; John was an actor who turned prolific director and producer; Kathy was a Toronto-based host of a current-affairs show. After choosing to leave acting, Peter became a high-school English teacher. He had a breakdown in 1991 and was hospitalized for a while. Following that, he taught himself all aspects of videography and became a video teacher and mentor to many students. He created his own video art which was funny, wry, quirky and political and, at times, deeply personal, particularly on the subject of his own experience as a survivor of incest. He wrote many songs and recorded two CDs. One of his songs, &quot;Testosterone&quot;, was set to animation by the brilliant Jonathan Amitay. It can be seen on YouTube. He played at Club Passim, in Cambridge, Massachusetts (the former Club 47 of Joan Baez fame), and at the Free Times Cafe and other venues in Toronto. A proud survivor of incest. He spoke out about it in his art and would have brought it further into the light, particularly the devastating effects of mother/son incest. </p>

<p>Lil Peep is probably a Jewish actor. This means his death may have been faked as foreshadowed by his lyrics. On the other hand wikipedia suspiciously states &quot;Foul play was not suspected,[42] with his death believed to be from an overdose.&quot; From his twitter: &quot;I don&#39;t need Zionists amongst my fans. Israel is not &quot;defending&quot; anything they are murdering innocent children every day.&quot; &amp; &quot;Fuck Israel.&quot; </p>

<p>Perhaps certain people were angry at Peep and wanted him gone for those comments. After Lil Peep died, Post got a similar &quot;Crybaby&quot; face tatoo above the eyebrow: Stay Away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your buzzword. From (about) 1945-1965 statistics show year after year improvement for blacks. Then after the social engineers got involved ( &quot;great society programs&quot;, &quot;civil rights movement&quot;, &quot;sexual revolution&quot;, cia flooding their area with drugs, abortion clinics nearby, food deserts, 70&#39;s pimp movies, rap ect..) &amp; choose theirs as a weak point to control culture from* all statistics relevant to misery have increased year after year. Yes unfortunately they were chosen first. Now the rap, drugs, sex has spread into mainstream culture far enough that the jewish kids are getting in on it besides the financing. On one hand I find this hilarious &amp; on the other this is dangerous. How awful if a single one of our young men emulate Post, Peep, Lil pump, Lil Xan, Lil Skies, Lil Uzi Vert ect.? I&#39;m sure there are others. Angry because I know they will if these are the characters provided!</p>

<ul>
<li>This is from a founder of the cia Gregory Bateson. They create and manage culture not just spy on other nationstates. Think about how this would apply in U.S. </li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;The most significant experiment which has yet been conducted in the adjustment of relations between “superior” and “inferior” peoples is the Russian handling of their Asiatic tribes in Siberia. The findings of this experiment support very strongly the conclusion that it is very important to foster spectatorship among the superiors and exhibitionism among the inferiors. In outline, what the Russians have done is to stimulate the native peoples to undertake a native revival while they themselves admire the resulting dance festivals and other exhibitions of native culture, literature, poetry, music and so on. And the same attitude of spectatorship is then naturally extended to native achievements in production or organization. In contrast to this, where the white man thinks of himself as a model and encourages the native people to watch him in order to find out how things should be done, we find that in the end nativistic cults spring up among the native people. The system gets overweighed until some compensatory machinery is developed and then the revival of native arts, literature, etc., becomes a weapon for use against the white man (Phenomena, comparable to Ghandi’s spinning wheel may be observed in Ireland and elsewhere). If, on the other hand, the dominant people themselves stimulate native revivalism, then the system as a whole is much more stable, and the nativism cannot be used against the dominant people.[73] [emphasis added] ~ Gregory Bateson”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I clearly did below but I&#39;ll try again. Their community has experienced heavy social engineering for 50+ years (all of ours have but anyway). Since the 60&#39;s illegitimacy has reversed! within their community. The social engineers destroyed the black nuclear family in the 60&#39;s, 70&#39;s (this creates near immediate welfare slavery- The government is Dad), flooded their neighborhoods with drugs &amp; created the pimp as their cultural icon. So I do think the current state of their &quot;culture&quot; sucks and has been purposefully weaponized against them &amp; everybody else. Behavioral not racial</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the government forced black people to start rapping? I don&#39;t disagree with a lot of your points but I absolutely disagree at the way you&#39;re trying to tie them together. </p>

<p>Maybe rap is a form of expression, and as a result is cathartic for all those things you listed that black people have had to put up with. Just because you think rap is toxic / bad / harmful or whatever, doesn&#39;t mean it is. </p>
