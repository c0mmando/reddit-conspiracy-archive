<p>The instant I first saw it, the conspiracy theorist in me slowly nodded and said &quot;yup, perfect timing to try and scare people off street weed a year or so before it is legalized and sold by .gov approved shops.&quot;</p>

<p>Another thing this &#39;might&#39; accomplish is planting the idea in some dealers head who might actually do it - OR - to be even more conspiratorial, for .gov-affiliated types to circulate some fent-weed so they can then test the stuff and say &quot;see? Told ya so!&quot;</p>

<p>Either way, I think some will actually be found within the next few months and it will be widely publicized.</p>

<p>What you say, Reddit?</p>

<p>Edit: For background, I frequently volunteer at a drop-in center for poor people/addicts and also at a busy soup kitchen in London Ontario. Word on the street here is that if any &#39;fent-weed&#39; shows up, it was probably the cops that did it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like a plausible enough conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>But considering how many pot smokers there are, fentanyl contamination would probably become a public epidemic in no time if it were actually really being added to cannabis.</p>

<p>If there is no sweeping pandemic death toll from fentanyl infested street weed going on, I would say that the media is trumpeting scare tactics.</p>

<p>Just my thoughts.</p>

<p>being added to cannabis</p>

<p>Questions: </p>

<p>1) How would one add fentanyl to weed? I assume it is a white powder. Dusting it would be obvious. It would come off to the touch, and it would also come off in a bag and collect at the bottom, beside the &quot;shake&quot; You would know. Also I would be highly suspect of a weed dealer donning a level 3 contamination suit to sell me a dime.</p>

<p>2) Dealers like money. Why would a dealer loose money by dusting an expensive drug on a dirt cheap drug? He cant charge much more than the worth of the plant without people telling him to pound sand. Why risk killing his income source?</p>

<p>Observation:</p>

<p>Fake.</p>

<p>Recollection:</p>

<p>10 years ago there were roomers of stone (cement) dust being added to weed to increase weight. Again the story is full of holes. </p>

<p>No dealer wants to kill or make sick his livelihood, or have them go elsewhere for weed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m Canadian and a sortof heavy smoker. This is honestly the first time I&#39;ve heard these rumors. </p>

<p>A lot of the dealers I buy off of are growers as well. When it gets legalized I&#39;ll probably buy from retailers unless it&#39;s taxed too much and its cheaper to get it from a dealer. These rumors might scare people that have serious dementia problems, but for average people like me, we&#39;ve known our dealers for too long to really believe any of these rumors.</p>

<p>One of the reason BC has more deaths is we have a very large homeless/addicted population. Vancouver has the warmest winter weather which encourages the homeless to travel here rather then stay in their own province.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;yeah your drug dealer is totally wasting expensive drugs on your cheap shitty weed...&quot;</p>

<p>I have been thinking the same thing. It just doesn&#39;t make much sense at all. If their goal was to get people addicted on opiods so they could sell it as a higher profit margin product, there are so many dealers that the chances of the smoker coming back to them in particular are slim. Why make that investment with little chance of an ROI?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t smoke weed, btw. But I&#39;m not against it or anything.</p>

<p>But the warning was based solely on concerns from community members and no fentanyl-laced pot had been seized.</p>

<p>Federal Health Minister Jane Philpott set the record straight in March after a Conservative MP raised concerns about fentanyl and pot being combined.</p>

<p>“In fact, there is zero evidence. Very important that everyone understands that — and we have confirmed this with chiefs of police, law enforcement officials across this country — there is zero documented evidence that ever in this country cannabis has been found laced with fentanyl. So it’s very important that we make sure that that message is clear,” Philpott said at the time.</p>

<p>London police haven’t seized any marijuana containing fentanyl, but the city’s police chief backs up the warning by the Middlesex-London Health Unit, saying illegal drugs always carry risks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t find any information on dispensery being sysmatic raided. Most information is on a drug bust at the airport, where an individual had 30lbs of marijuana which was linked to a dispensary. This is probably the city rather then the feds or province.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had my local one shut down but that was due to local city regulations on the location being to close to a school. </p>

<p>There is roadside tests that get around the situation you&#39;ve described using saliva, but the problem is setting the legal threshold. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the method being used though. </p>

<p>My dispensary charges 10/g for its mid-range which is what the government is looking to charge to for its own product. But I&#39;ve seen a recent report most Canadians spend 7/g for there own product. </p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to see how it plays out. If everyone goes to the black market, I&#39;m sure the government will change their own policy to get tax dollars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a matter of smoking and driving, <a href="https://herb.co/marijuana/news/how-long-does-weed-stay-in-your-system-marijuana">Cannabis stays in your blood a very long time</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The total amount of time that weed stays in your system depends on the conditions of the user and how frequently they smoke marijuana. As you continue to consume cannabis, the THC accumulates in the body. The more cannabis you consume, the longer it will take for the THC to clear out of your system. How quickly you metabolize THC as an individual will also affect how long the chemical stays in your system. There are several other important factors involved, too, such as how you are being tested.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means that anyone who uses cannabis on even a casual basis will fail the tests, and we&#39;re not even talking about medical cannabis users, they just became second class citizens because they won&#39;t be able to drive. Scary prospect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it, the cdn gov is about to become the biggest dealer on the block, they need to get rid of the competition. Also, all the pot activist are being pushed out as well. These crazy ideas like &quot;fentanyl laced weed&quot;, &quot;children eating the leaves are gonna die&quot;, are all scare tactics from where?, IDK. I know my local police seem to think that the world is gonna end come july. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The motive is definitely there. I mean honestly.. Fentanyl laced weed is about as likely to happen as.. Hold on I&#39;m trying to think of something.</p>

<p>Lightning. You&#39;d be far more likely to be hit by lightning. </p>

<p>Seriously.. No one is giving away opiates for free when there&#39;s so many opiate addicts to sell your product to and like.. Actually make money, instead of losing it.</p>

<p>If I had to guess at an &#39;innocent&#39; explanation that doesn&#39;t involve the govt plotting against street weed: Some kid who still lives with his parents had an opiate habit. He/she overdosed(or thought they were) cause they are young and dumb and not a responsible drug user.</p>

<p>They then end up in an ER room and this kid SWEARS to God all he did was smoke some weed. They, being in Canada, dealing with opiate overdoses everyday in that ER most likely, could clearly see it was an opiate related OD/visit. He continued to deny ever touching opiates and they then informed the police/authorities that there may be fentanyl laced weed going around.. As would be responsible of them, even if none of them believed it for a second.</p>

<p>That or some dealer just sucks and he chucked some nugs in a loose baggie he found under his car seat that still had a decent hit of fentanyl in it, lining the bag. Someone then buys this shitty dealers weed, with 0 opiate tolerance, and then proceeds to OD Etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is pretty much the same story that the government peddled in the 60&#39;s only then they were claiming that street weed was being laced with heroin. The obvious thing to do then as now would have been to legalize or decriminalize it to take it out of the hands of the drug pushers.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t anticipate any real changes coming about. In fact the government still intends to prosecute people who grow their own for their own personal use whether that&#39;s medicinal or recreational to keep the cops and the courts happy. </p>

<p>They have no genuine health concerns... this is all about a government monopoly for the benefit of the companies they licence to grow it and major donors to their own party that are all heavily invested in those companies. </p>
