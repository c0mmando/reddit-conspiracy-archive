       Two different types of killers with two different mental profiles. Also Bundy was a psychopath and probably said that so people would think he had something of a humane emotional response.

       This was taken from a confession tape near the end when Bundy was much more open and revealing about his crimes. I don't think anyone who ever lived would be calm or hungry just after killing 17 students- just doesn't combine in the least.

       Bundy also famously blamed pornography in an interview with televangelist James Dobson - he was so very interested in his public persona or how he was viewed by others. He also had a habit of disassociating himself from the crimes themselves - he'd use statements like, "Well, the killer did this..." and "The killer was thinking this..." rather than frame his own experiences as
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       experiences.

       But you're thinking of this from the perspective of a rational mind (I'm assuming you are a rational human being that doesn't enact massive acts of violence).

       Very true - but he continued this mentality even after he was sentenced to death. Thus the "hail mary" attempt to excuse his crimes as a response to pornography.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you read any texts on Bundy? There's quite a few out there that do an excellent job of breaking down his psychology and motive(s).

       Definitely! I think this is one of the reasons why Bundy is one of the most infamous (and scariest) individuals in American crime history. The combination of his social background/privilege, his good looks, his education and social prowess - he managed to walk the fine line of respectable member of the community/absolute monster.

       Some- he was terrorizing Seattle when I was in school and lived there. He single handedly turned women distrusting of men in general during that era. I easily could see from Day 1 that he was the ultimate manipulator and con man.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't agree about this at the end however. Those confession tapes were his attempt to shed some light on himself. I believe it when he says he was horrified and agitated especially after his earlier killings. He said eventually he calmed down. The BTK killer in Wichita said the exact same thing about his earlier killings. Exactly the same with Ed Kemper early on.

       This is really interesting! He was definitely the "ultimate manipulator and con man" - and I think that's precisely why you have to take his last interview, specifically about the pornography, with such a grain of salt. He was conning people till the very moment he died. He knew exactly what he was doing by granting an interview with a huge evangelical figure - he was hoping to get the "Saved by Jesus" crowd on his side.

       I think most serial killers that have some semblance of normality experience an initial "Holy shit, did I really just do that?" moment. Even Dahmer, after committing his first crime, took some time off because he was horrified at what he'd done. But again, that initial emotional reaction did nothing to sway him from becoming more and more violent and sadistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's pretty obvious Bundy is a special example of how
       <em>
        normal
       </em>
       serial killers can be - Bundy loved to be the center of attention and loved his lifestyle. He managed to claim he was "horrified and agitated" after his first crimes, and yet he continued to commit atrocities, arguably getting even more and more brave and vicious as time went on.

       I listened to that interview when it came out. It didn't fool or con anybody at the time, so not sure what kind of traction Bundy thought he would gain from it. Bundy was into thrasher movies and literature, more so than porn. And the porn of that era was tame and harder to come by compared to now. In hindsight I would say Bundy was more prescient than I thought at the time he did that old interview.

       I think the interview did an excellent job of "proving" to evangelicals the danger of pornography, though. So in that case, I think the interview was successful at fooling people - thus why so many people still point to it as "proof" that pornography is dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never seen the claim that Bundy was into violent films/literature OTHER than pornography. I'm trying to find information on that now - do you remember where you read that?

       1984 interview with Detective Robert Keppel (regarding the Green River Killer)
      </p>
      <p>
       ...this guy is responsible for twenty or thirty more deaths at least, and there's a certain aspect of possessiveness in that. I think that's one way of describing it in rather bland terms, a possessiveness where the corpse could easily be as important as the live victim, in some respects. I mean, it's that physical possession and ownership, a taking, if you will, that is just part of the syndrome. I think that sense of power and ownership is one of the reasons why I think in some cases—not all, certainly—is why I think he might be individually intending to return to the scene to either view his victim, or in fact, interact with the body in some way.
In my opinion, the best chance you have of catching this guy is to get a site with a fresh body and stake it out.
...just like anybody else with an obsession, whether it be fishing, bowling or skiing, he has ways he can vicariously satisfy it. Maybe he is going to peep shows and reading detective magazines. I think there's an excellent chance that one way he gets off is by going to look at what that call the slasher films.

       But he's making that assumption about Ridgeway, not himself.

       And yes, I do recall reading about how Bundy was into "detective magazines" - but I don't think you can equate that with slasher films.

       Really you think he was advising about Ridgeway in a vaccum and without keen insights?

       Not at all - but I don't think he was speaking about himself. Bundy got off on being asked to comment/profile Ridgeway - it made him feel powerful. And, given his own background, I'm assuming he probably had a pretty good insight into the man's mind. But I don't necessarily think it suggests that he was simply providing insights into his own mind under the guise of profiling Ridgeway. If Bundy wanted to blame slasher films for his actions, I'm pretty sure he would've had no problem slipping that into his anti-pornography interview with Dobson. There'd be no reason not to.

       I guess we'll never know though - it's kind of tough to definitively interpret his words now that he's dead.

       There are very big differences, psychologically, between serial killers (Bundy) and spree killers (Cruz). You're comparing apples and oranges.

       Yeah. Spree killing is generally done with a form of impersonal attack. Ie a gun. But serial killers tend to feel the life leave their victims in their hands. They watch their eyes go dark. That's personal. That digs into your mind. It can break even a broken human.

       Actually, many of them are - Mark Barton, Andrew Cunanan, Charles Starkweather, etc. You should check out Douglas's "The Anatomy of Motive" for a really good discussion of spree killer psychology.

       Also, there's a text I haven't quite finished just yet but speaks directly to the psychological profiles of spree killers (compared to serial killers, rampage killers, etc.) - "Rethinking Serial Murder, Spree Killing and Atrocities: Beyond the Usual Distinctions" by Robert Shanafelt and Nathan W. Pino.

       But he's making that assumption about Ridgeway, not himself.

       And yes, I do recall reading about how Bundy was into "detective magazines" - but I don't think you can equate that with slasher films.
