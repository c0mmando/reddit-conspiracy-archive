        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Many of us here know shilling occurs, the blatant use of bots and alt accounts on Reddit has become disturbing. Whether it&#39;s CTR/Share Blue, T_D obvious shilling, Top Minds, or actual Russian Trolls (if you believe in that mind of thing).</p>

<p>What bothers me is, this should be a bigger deal. This is something that is active trying to shut down free speech via use of bully tactics (on both sides.) People today want the truth, and many are fooled into believing they are looking at it because that&#39;s what everyone else on the internet is telling them. The information is out in the open, it just hasn&#39;t picked up the attention it should (mostly due to the ones deploying these armies of disinfo have a hand in the distribution of main stream info.) </p>

<p>I truly feel if somehow, someway, we can bring this to the public eye, it would help bring about the kind of changes were looking for. It was only 2 years ago where we saw how much of an impact social media was able to have in calling out the bullshit peddled by the main stream media. They fought back, and they&#39;re winning. With armies of crybullies leading people to believe an idea is more popular than it actually is, and the trolls that are intentionally trying to discredit the opposition by acting like negative stereotypes. If more people knew just how bad it is, I truly believe they would start regaining the ability to think for themselves. Actually think for themselves, not follow a herd. If there is a battle to be won in this war, it&#39;s this one. </p>

<p>Twitter, Facebook, Reddit have all been compromised by prepackaged outrage and division, exposing it would help bring people back together, and remind then who their real allies and enemies are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually really simple. News is a for-profit business. It used to be isolated and it was the loss leader to draw in audience for the entertainment. But no longer. Not it&#39;s expected to make money like any other content. With that in mind it becomes evident that everything on the news is sponsored. It won&#39;t be there unless someone pays for it. Sometimes it&#39;s obvious. Sometimes it&#39;s just controversial, titillating or violence to draw audience to watch commercials. It&#39;s not academic though. There are no high standards. It&#39;s all paid for. If you are in the club of those who pay for it you won&#39;t even notice.

    <div class="md"><p>Might be hard to wrap your head around, but there is no such thing as unbiased information.</p>

<p>Even something like pure technical data has bias, in the sense of what data is shown, and what is not. Even if all the data is factual and accurate, and all the data is show, the order it is shown in has an effect on the conclusion that is reached by the reader.</p>

<p>Check out an episode of &quot;connections&quot; by James Burke on youtube. He clearly illustrates that, even with all available information, there are always multiple ways to weave through a story. Of the many ways to piece things together, none are objectively <em>more</em> correct than any other way. Many paths exist, and the path through the information changes the story, even though it may reach the same goal.</p>

<p>Underneath it all, humans are a story telling creature. Information is used to tell the stories, but the stories are our primary method of understanding. Information is just the building blocks of the stories, and in isolation carries no meaning.</p>

<p>Another way to put it, is that whatever information we get, we weave into a story. The story is how we correlate bits of information to other bits of information - so you can see that even something like the order we get factual information in has an effect, because of our need to have causality in the stories.</p>

<p>We all come here to find the truth. However, what we will accept his truth varies wildly based on our worldview and past experiences. I think trying to discern the truth of the shooter is an excellent study of what people will accept as truth.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, debating our way towards the truth can sometimes result in accusations of shills, or Bots, or trolls. It&#39;s easier, intellectually, to write off a controversial opinion as something fake rather than acknowledge the possibility that what you believe is false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your comment here is terrific. As you say, it is easier to write off controversial opinions as &#39;fake&#39; or &#39;crazy&#39; than to engage with them properly and honestly.</p>

<p>This is why so few on this sub are aware of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gORu-68SHpE">no planes</a> or vicsims on 9/11. These angles seem completely &#39;fake&#39; or &#39;crazy&#39; at first. Only those who take the time to engage with the evidence will come to see things for what they really are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an excellent point but it shouldn&#39;t be overinterpreted to believe that you can&#39;t have a less biased presentation of information and facts. In many cases there are a limited number of interpretations for an event and the actual data is in complete contradiction to some of those interpretations. Sure, you can still get into nitty gritty issues of biased presentation within an interpretation, but it&#39;s still important to recognize that we should strive for evidence based approaches to problems that limit bias as much as possible, even if we can&#39;t eliminate it and that some narratives are completely devoid of factual support at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to believe in your headline, but it seems like there are less and less people looking for the facts on here. </p>

<p>Yesterday, I made two posts that just gave facts about the florida shooting. In one I simply posted the timeline  for the shooting, and the other I linked to the archived Instagram pages of the suspected shooters.  In neither instance did I even give an opinion, other than passing on the information for others to do their own research</p>

<p>Neither post got much traction, and in fact people were downvoting.   I‚Äôm not saying my posts were so amazing that it should be front page of this sub, but until I see more raw information collected by subscribers (not linked articles with a clear agenda) making it to front page I am not convinced most here want to critically think for the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a lot of people here that only want to consider things that benefit their agenda or align with their worldview.  They even go as far as being intentionally dishonest by finding associations they know don&#39;t exist for the purposes of perpetuating their agenda. It sucks. People who do that are an enemy to this place and don&#39;t belong here. I try to call them out as much as I can and hopefully others will to. </p>

<p>Conspiracy is not supposed to be convenient or easy.  If you are doing this right you should be challenging your worldview often. Sometimes you have to challenge deeply held notions that have formed part of your identity.  It takes courage to do that.  This isn&#39;t about championing an agenda or poking your enemies in the eye, it&#39;s about the truth. The truth is what matters.</p>

<p>But yes there are still people here who do want to hear the truth instead of the noise and would appreciate it.</p>

<p>Feel free to call them &quot;shills&quot;.</p>

<p>But to me there is a BIG difference between a paid shill and someone with a certain ideology posting on their own volition.</p>

<p>As for the &quot;shutting down free speech&quot;, that happens overtly, you can read about it in the media when they propose new draconian laws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 2013 there was a repeal on the law that disallowed state propaganda, and after that, there was a law passed that allowed companies to share information on their customers in order to not be held liable for what customers did using their products.  It has all come after the building of the largest data structure that we know of in Utah.  Plus we had &quot;revelations&quot; from Snowden that we already knew about from Binney, but Snowdens led to a complete change in how the Internet is used and secured with encryption.  Plus all this happened pretty significantly after the Occupy Movement reached its apex and then was splintered.   </p>

<p>Personally I think it was a concerted effort and a plan was placed, but honestly I don&#39;t know except that it led to the point we are at now.  Free speech has been decimated more in the last ten years than ever before in US history.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I need my news in a spreadsheet format. When a story breaks, I need to know: Who&#39;s behind the story or broke the story (like when the internet was pushing an AHA story about how coconut oil is bad for you, as the AHA works for big vegetable oil), who&#39;s cover it, and are they covering it fairly, overhyping it, or downplaying it, and with what intensity. Like, story broken by the ICIJ, being downplayed NYT and WSJ, overhyped by infowars, covered fairly by the Huffington Post, and being ignored by the WP. I&#39;m mostly interested in the stories that are widely blacked out. If it seems important, but most main stream media acts like it doesn&#39;t exist, then I want to know. There are also stories that are covered a little big, but quickly dropped, because it looked bad when they didn&#39;t cover things like the Panama Papers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been lurking here for some time now. This is my first comment so please be kind. I come here to read about what conspiracies people are talking about because somewhere in this discussion is at least some truth. Now days most things that happen in the news are so outrageous that often a conspiracy is the most common sense explanation there is! I&#39;m only looking for the truth. That&#39;s it. I have no agenda, I&#39;m not trying to find information that aligns with my beliefs. I&#39;m not looking to find others opinions that make me feel better about myself or the way I feel about an issue. Just the truth. Why did something happen? Who&#39;s behind it? Who profited from it? You won&#39;t find the truth in any one place. It&#39;s harder and harder to find it everyday.</p>
