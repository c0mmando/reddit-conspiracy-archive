       I just realized I've somehow removed them all. All ads in my email have been spammed (this I have to keep doing) but if it's soliciting, spam. I no longer watch broadcast TV at all, but before that, everything my family watched was DVR'd and all commercials we're fast forwarded.  I pay for Netflix and Hulu. No ads there, just thumbnails. I pay for Google music which includes YouTube Red. No ads there.  All ads in podcasts can be skipped. Even shows that incorporate ads within, I stop watching. No magazines. No newspapers. No network news.  It's quite nice not having a constant annoying influence in my life and it's improved everything about it. I'm not anti-capitalists, just anti-manipulation.  Maybe I will no longer be manipulated into spending my money on something I don't need or even want.  Maybe this is the last smart phone I'll own, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I need a product, I research it, then buy it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone else see the value in removing advertisements that uses decades of scientific human research to manipulate you to spend money?

       Edit: I am blown away by this morning's conversation I've had on this subreddit.  Thanks r/conspiracy users.

       I use some level of adblock. Not total adblock. As far as the internet goes, I ignore and never, ever click and if it gets annoying, I close the page and never return unless I'm linked to it and again, that red button in the top right is your friend.

       Me neither, it blows my mind. In 2016, my buddy wanted to watch the Superbowl on my TV and have a party. I said sure, i don't watch sports but I'll DVR it (DVR and piped in crap are all gone now) and he said he had to watch it live.  So many people have been led to believe that if they don't watch a game live, they're missing out on something. It's insane that these people are being tricked into watching product placement.

       I'll watch sport live if I can, but I will try to avoid all the bullshit on beforehand - I hate sports pundits with a passion, what a completely pointless job that is. If it's half time in a rugby match I'll go and do something else for 20 minutes, and fortunately F1 and MotoGP doesn't break for ads mid-race (unless you're watching F1 highlights because Sky fucked it up for everyone.)

       Rugby is two halves of 40 minutes, with a half time of 20 minutes. No ads are shown when the game is being played, even if the game is paused for several minutes to deal with an injured player, and if it's shown on the BBC there are no ads, period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Football (soccer, or as we rugby fans call it, wendyball) I believe is much the same, but I don't watch it.

       On face value, that sounds awesome. What most people don't understand is the intrusiveness of the BBC as it applies to them entering your home and conducting searches to see if your TV receives their signal. Care to say anything about that?

       You must have a license. It's those without a license that are subjected to this violation of privacy, right.  It's all over YouTube. I admit I don't fully understand it, but from what I've seen, the BBC is quite an evil broadcast network (they all are really)

       I've just renewed my license in the last few days. If you don't have one they'll send you snotty letters, and then I guess it escalates to a visit. The problem is that it is a legal requirement for you to have one if you're watching live TV.

       I'm sure you agree, that is not okay.  I've seen so many videos where these people force their way into someone's home because a child answered the door or they use the police to force you to grant access.  Insanity.  We have some pretty insane shit here, too.  At least your police appear a bit less tyrannical.  You know, no gun to shoot someone that doesn't respect their presumed authority.

       That's too bad.  I have no doubt that change will eventually come.  It will get worse before it gets better.  Our government has basically backed themselves into a tyrannical corner.  They must become ever more tyrannical as the people become ever more enlightened to their abuses.  They're only saving grace are the millions of subservient people in my country that trust the government is going to protect them from all the harms in the world.  Government , like media, is the cancer of the human race.  There was a time for government, but that was so long ago.

       I dated someone addicted to sports. It's a team mentality. There's some kind of delusion that watching has an impact on the game or is participation. Plus, needing to be able to discuss it. The guy could name stats, players etc, but couldn't tell you the name of local officials or news events. It's a narrative of time and experiences for them.

       It's unfortunate, and apparently it's targeted at males. I'm a male myself, but just never really understood the attraction. Maybe being able to see through it  is what brought me here.

       It's a form of toxic masculinity. Extreme actions of violence or joy, but a limited emotional range, and nothing of redeeming value for society, like art or science. The outward appearance of success because of money and fame, yet brain and body damage and the most optimistic post-career is to be an announcer.

       Yes, toxic masculinity. Like sitting on your couch watching somebody else play a game makes you a man. It's no wonder this all so many can talk about. They think this is Alpha male characteristics (not that I care who or what an alpha male is.) They can't have a conversation without reverting back to sports. I usually just say that I don't understand what they're talking about. Without sports, many have nothing else to fall back on. Just empty shells of lost potential.  I'm not here to hate on sports fans, but sports is definitely heavily manipulating psychies. I'm here only to do my part to bring that to light.

       Sadly I feel the same about the Olympics too. So many people think of the Olympics as a noble event with an impressive display of athleticism and human spirit/hard work, etc. But I can't watch it without cringing. The Olympics are shady as fuck and I have a hard time finding any of the athletes very... likeable. And I'm sure they're almost all doping to a certain extent, in every country.

       No doubt, the difference is though, I have the control of what I read.  I can't do the political stuff (where most of the agendas lie) anymore and that is very strange to me since I came from being extremely political.  It did teach me to read between the lines, but I had a major shift in my belief system and the left/right narrative will never be a fit for me again.
      </p>

       Thankfully, I can simply not subscribe to agenda driven subreddits.  I don't care what is popular on Reddit and I almost exclusively view by "New".

       Now stop paying for netflix, hulu and google music, and discover the wonderful world of torrent. Use an open source client. There will still be ads if you watch stuff (products &amp; ideas placement), but no overt ones, not even thumbnails. And by not paying you won't be feeding the beast (and enriching child molesting Hollywood executives with your labor).

       I'm quite familiar with torrent, but it became quite a hassle. Then came xbmcnow called Kodi) and several excellent plugins that have now fallen by the wayside. This is why I now pay for those services. I recognize much of the overt idea placement inherent in today's media and call it out to those that don't. If I want to watch a movie, it's usually from the thousands of ripped DVDs from Netflix, mostly movies from the 80s and before when idea placement wasn't the obvious attempt at manipulation that it is now

       Save your money man.  Genesis is dead. Exodus is dead.  Whatever replaced Exodus is dead.  It just got too popular and some entity is going after the plugin creators, paying them off to issue an update to shut it down.  It's been sometime since I've gotten anything to work so I gave up.  Half the videos on YT about some new plugin that's better than Exodus is usually BS.  Do your research and please, let me know if if things have changed and there's a plugin that still works.

       Google Play Music pays for itself with the ability to watch ASMR with no ads, plus all my songs available online w no home server needed. I have PTSD and music/noise is my meds. I could get nothing done without the music

       Sexual abuse and abandonment from my father. Emotional, physical, spiritual, financial abuse from my mother. A rape at 13. (Also when I found out a deep, personal conspiracy, that I haven't worked up the ladyballs to talk about here yet) Then years of drugs, rapes, homelessness and abusive relationships, w brief periods of help/hope, only to return to fight/flight/howthefuckdidIrepeatthis mistakes. Reached a point of critical mass about 2 years ago, I'm stable now, but have flare ups, of course. Ended up walking home 3+ miles today because I just couldn't deal with the bus a 2nd time.

       Idgaf, unless you do? I'm talking about it on reddit now (even though I scrubbed 4 years of comments just this week).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't drink (over 4 years) and about a year and a half ago, had to quit weed too, because of MASSIVE paranoia, and basically, it turned to crack for me. Couldn't eat, couldn't sleep. I don't take any meds, cuz benzos were a problem for me and SSRIs made me more suicidal. Any anti-seizure meds gave me tics. I eat dark chocolate everyday, instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm single for about 6 months, I was dating a guy off and on for 4 summers and finally realized that while he wasn't abusive, it was a relationshit and I was using him just as much as he was using me. Not focusing on my actual feelings and using sex for pain relief made me feel like I was sliding backwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live alone, far from family and I have a cat and a dog. I had to move to find a quiet neighborhood/apartment.  I go to therapy, some support groups, volunteer, exercise. Vit D, Vit C and a probiotic are a MUST for mental and physical health. So much of PTSD is held in the body, so shit like stretching, yoga, just remembering to breathe/drop my shoulders are key. I sleep w a mouthguard, cuz I have ground down the enamel on my teeth. My dog is snoring with his head on my thigh right now (I'm hoping he'll be trainable to be a service dog, but he's a stubborn ass). I want to try to make myself a pressure blanket, too, they're hella expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to journal and write a lot, but that kinda stopped when shit hit the fan about 5 years ago (had my 3rd miscarriage w emergency ectopic pregnancy surgery and other family drama). Crafting, gardening, being in nature has been a coping mechanism for as long as I can remember. I always have a copse of woods near wherever I live. It calms me. I crochet in meetings that would otherwise be hard for me to sit through. The small movement and mental distraction helps a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm back in school 1/2 time. Rebuilding "self esteem" is shit my therapist says, but I'm not rushing anything. I have a pattern of pushing myself too hard and burning out. I'm content for the time being to be sitting at home on a Friday night, with a snoring pitbull in my lap and delaying homework to reddit. Lulz.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, I get lonely or disappointed in myself, that I should be doing more or like, go ask this guy out, but I feel like I'll actually KNOW and feel when the time is right to add more stress to my life. There's still days I do not leave the house, crank the music and ritualistically organize or rearrange furniture until the "fight" instinct passes. And there's definitely days I do not shower or do the dishes and snack instead of making a real meal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't imagine combat. I talked w the air force once and was like, yeah, no, I can't even deal with this info session.  I'm gonna end this novel now, bc the dog woke up and wants popcorn.

       Okay, there's whole lot to digest here but since I've personally found cannabis is excellent for keeping the images at bay and dealing with them when I'm ready.  I was having a discussion about my PTSD with another sufferer and I'd like to link you to it. It would explain abstractly (I was high when I wrote it) how I use pot as a tool for PTSD and more of a description of what my PTSD is like for me.

       It worked for me for a while, until it didn't? Idk if it's because of other hormonal shit in my body or if I was using weed abusively, but I couldn't stay present. I do miss the physical pain relief and attention to detail, but I don't know how to describe what 2 weeks of no REM sleep does. The clinical diagnosis was sleep deprivation psychosis. My definition was seeing people's auras. I hate talking about it, because it did feel schizophrenic, and of some of the shit I've read here, some would call it a spiritual scrying. It didn't feel good, like it was a religious practice I needed to perfect, it made me feel like I could not separate the drugs from the PTSD and that's a huge reason why I stopped drinking, because I would get physically or verbally abuse when drunk. I couldn't stop the flashbacks. Weed was always recreational or self-medication, until after the last miscarriage. Idk, probably some endocrine shit, that unless I'm diagnosed with cancer, I'm not willing to fuck with again.

       I used to drink so much that I was always worried about my liver. I thought I might be an alcoholic but never had any issues not drinking for a year here and there while deployed. Still, I could kill most of a fifth in an evening. Every morning I'd wake up with a pounding headache and feel so shitty when I see that bottle in the morning and realize just how much I drank the night before.  I was trying to come to grips with a shorter lifespan and leaving my family husbandless and fatherless.  I was drinking to dull the memories and the chronic pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything changed when I became reaquainted with pot after 30 years.  I all but gave up drinking.  I don't like the taste of my favorite whiskey anymore.  The thought of getting drunk now seems like a ridiculous and terribly unhealthy concept to me. Cannabis along with my diet treats my chronic pain. Obviously not for everybody, but it helps me.

       I don't really care, to be honest.  They chose an invasive manipulative business model that I can work around.  I don't click on advertisements so why should I view them.  For them to receive money from advertisers, those ads have to generate traffic to another site.  Do you really click on advertisements to support creators?  If so, you're supporting that business model.  If a platform pays for creators by views of the content, they get paid whether those ads are displayed or not.  I said I pay for YouTube, Hulu, Google Play and Netflix.  That's how I choose to support the creators on those platforms.  As long as I have a choice, I'll exercise my free will to view content the way I like.

       Some ads pay out based on page views. Not all are click through. Please note that my reply was not targeted at you.

       Per your post, however, do you feel like you're missing out on new products without ads? I was glad to get in on Bud Light's "Dilly Dilly" campaign for football season. That shits hilarious and made haunted houses substantially better. Unfortunately for Budweiser, I think Bud Light is trash and don't buy it.

       I despise the global corporate take over of craft beer.  I'm a home brewer.  I'll admit that this is what I used to think, but I haven't thought much about it since I stopped brewing a year ago.  I've gone through a big shift since then and may not agree with that anymore.

       What's wrong with having mainstream beer? (MSB, if you will, popular beers mass produced) I genuinely want to hear more about your views on corporate beer. Its not an issue I've really considered before, though I will always try a local beer before turning to my usual

       I totally get that. You're the last person an ad agency would ever care about because you're very near immune to the effects of advertising. I operate similarly with electronics. Its pathetic how many people line up every year to buy a new device when the old one is perfectly fine and already meets their own needs.

       I went to Ireland and on sheer luck, I tasted a great beer.  It became my favorite beer.  Caffrey's.  I later found out that beer was available at my favorite pub in the states.  It was awesome.  I enjoyed it for a couple of years.  I introduced my friends and family to it.  Some even called it their favorite beer to.  One day they ran out.  I asked the bartender what was up.  He said it just didn't come in on the truck, but it should be there by the time I came back.  It never came.  The bartender didn't know why but the had removed the tap handle.  I had to conduct internet research at a time when it was not so easily done to find out why.  The website caffreys.com just said coming soon.  I found out Coors had bought the distribution rights to it.  I started calling Coors, asking when it would be available again.  They kept saying soon.  This went on for awhile.  One day, one of their people told me that it would only be available in Canada and never the US and didn't know why.  More research and I discovered that Coors had bought the rights and immediately pulled it out of the US because it was cutting into their Killians Red bottom line.  I found that beer by chance on the other side of the world then found it again at a place I already frequented and Coors took that away out of greed. Caffrey's soon after closed the brewery.  That is why I don't like corporate beer and, apparently, still don't.  And to this day, I frequent the brand lists of these ridiculously huge megacorporations of beer just to make sure a particular beer I'm about to buy isn't owned by them (I just haven't had to in quite some time as I rarely drink beer anymore. I prefer cannabis.)

       That's fine, I am not forcing anyone to do anything. They can stop producing content if they want. And I'm not stealing anything as I'm not taking away - i.e. depriving - anything from anyone.

       You certainly don't have to because I mostly agree. I downloaded and seated the s*** out of Thor Ragnarok. I wouldn't have seen that movie If I had to pay for it, and I'm only too happy to erode profits for Disney. They are truly the kings of copyright abuse

       Not subjecting oneself to the mental abuse of advertisements is one of the benefits of cutting the cable. I have been cable free for over two years now...I say this with my heart of hearts, it has been one of the best decisions of my life. My mind, my emotions and my well being felt more grounded after just a couple weeks of removing myself from the madness of broadcast TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not just the ads that fuck with your mind, the night network news is PURE propaganda sponsored by the corporate war and Pharma machines. The drug commercials alone are insane. Series programing contains propaganda, subliminals and shaming of all sorts depending on which corporate interest is paying the writers.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in all I'm a happier person I removed that evil piece of shit out of my life. I still have Netflix when a good movie or doc comes along...but, they are watched with the utmost care and awareness of what it may try to plant in my mind.

       Well said. You, sir, know exactly what I'm talking about and I agree 100% with what you've written. Cutting that cord in 2016 was the best decision I've ever made. My mind is freeer because of it and now it is used by me and me alone. Since then, I've become much more enlightened about myself and my individual belief system. For the first time in my life, I know who I am.  Cutting unwanted manipulative media isn't the only factor that led to this awakening, but it is the biggest by far.  Nobody tells me how to think anymore.  I finally think for myself and it is truly liberating.

       I agree with you and I believe cable/PR companies, who pay for downvotes, don't. The old manner of showing both was worse for the shill/PR team, as it validated those who could see xxx amount of people agreed with them, even if xx amount of people didnt't. You know

       Okay, that's what I hoped you meant.  I have seen 'Score Hidden' on some threads and didn't understand why, but I see them here.  Is this a subreddit option then?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you catch the part where I sort Reddit by 'New' only?  I don't care what other people like.  I only care about what I like.  Not saying I don't care about other people, but I came here to find what I find interesting and not what other people do.  Clicking on anything else might as well be an advertisement in my book.  I look for the unique and interesting and not what's popular.

       I agree and am doing the same thing. The next step is online board surfing though including Reddit. Many posts here are by either corporate or political operatives our by those who are still controlled (and unknowingly pushing ideals of) by media propagandists.

       Pihole for Raspberry Pi is pretty simple, and straightforward. I'm not a networking guy myself, managed to get it up and running in an hour or two. Just requires a Raspberry Pi kit (I have

       Adguard dns has been doing the same thing for me. At first I was afraid of using a third parties dns, but you do that anyway for 99% of configurations. They have a bigger product to support and would likely not betray their customers (at least anymore than google or Verizon).

       Same. I'm at the point now that when I do happen to see an ad, say at the gym or whatever, I have a visceral reaction to it. The spuriousness of it and the blatant manipulation is so disgusting and obvious when you haven't been exposed to it for a while.

       Too true. It insults your senses while insulting your intellect. The masses just eat it up though. It really does sadden me mostly because I was once one of these people at least when it came to the news. The funny thing is I thought of myself as being more informed than everyone else around me. The truth was that I was probably more manipulated than those around me, at least with my opinion of current events.  I don't really have opinions anymore. I have an open mind and a belief system that is subject to change based on the
       <strong>
        real
       </strong>
       interactions i have with the real people around me.

       its a debian linux based fortified os that runs from a usb stick. your data is encrypted on the flash drive and you leave no trace on the computer you are using. it even wipes the memory once your session is done.  all your internet browsing is routed through the tor network and the browser is configured for max privacy and security.  it is also very simple to use and is equipped with a usable set of preinstalled programs.

       Thanks, I've considered myself been awake/waking up for about 15 years at this present time (been/got into all sorts of stuff via Coast to Coast A.M in the mid 90's and with the explosion of the info age during/shortly after took it way farther haha).
It's hard to describe but I used to be able to just have some non sense show or a show im into either or, going on in the background well I research/read etc (I am adhd and have trouble focusing and kinda have bunch a things going on at the same time) anyways I dont want that stuff on in the back round anymore, as its like I can sense the bombardment of negative energy and programming/propaganda way more then usual. 
I have also been meditating and working on raising my vibration higher alot more these past few months, might ave something to do with that. Cheers

       A Celestine Prophecy reader perhaps?
      </p>
      <p>
       I listened to Coast to Coast back then too before George took over.  I remember always thinking, "I don't believe this stuff, but I have an open mind."  Now it's more like, "I have an open mind until something can be disproved by my own research."  If it's something that doesn't interest me much and isn't worth my time, I remain neutral and try to understand all perspectives on the topic.  (I'll apologize here, I just got a little high and you may not be following me.)

       Excellently descriptive!  I'll only add that that feeling you just described so eloquently, I can feel it (mentally) rubbing against the grain of my being and because of that it puts me in a sour mood.  That, my friend, is precisely why I have simply, removed it from my life.

       Cool and The Ra Material in a shorted form is about  "material, which was channeled by L/L Research between 1981 and 1984, discusses the law of one, the infinite Creator, the Logos's plan, the seven densities, the two paths, and free will." and then some haha. 
The Wes Penre Papers covers a lot of stuff ranging from The Global Elite to Higher Dimensions, how to break the reincarnation cycle etc, I haven't got trough all of it yet myself yet as there is quite a lot of material.

       I'm considering publishing my belief system and I never considered just making a website.  I don't foolishly think someone would pay to read it anyway.  I just want it put out there for debate.  No where near being ready for that though.

       Thanks, I've considered myself been awake/waking up for about 15 years at this present time (been/got into all sorts of stuff via Coast to Coast A.M in the mid 90's and with the explosion of the info age during/shortly after took it way farther haha).
It's hard to describe but I used to be able to just have some non sense show or a show im into either or, going on in the background well I research/read etc (I am adhd and have trouble focusing and kinda have bunch a things going on at the same time) anyways I dont want that stuff on in the back round anymore, as its like I can sense the bombardment of negative energy and programming/propaganda way more then usual. 
I have also been meditating and working on raising my freq/vibration higher alot more these past few months, might have something to do with that. Cheers

       No, you're not. They do.  YouTube has the problem of being to big to regulate itself so they fall back on viewers and algorithms to regulate it for them.  Human beings are biased and the algorithm is arbitrary.  Some people follow channels they don't agree with just so they can report every video that is uploaded.  They censored PragerU of all channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm hoping that the platform will mature after being sued so many times, but I just don't see how an entity which relies on advertisers will ever be free from censorship.  What about actual legitimate racist hate speech and not political speech or dissent?  Should they censor that?  If you care to research my profile, you'll find that I am very outspoken against censorship.  I believe all voices are equal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like a new video sharing website that doesn't censor anything.  Run by the users in a way that is similar to Reddit but without any heavy moderation.  I follow what I want to see and never have to see what I don't want to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't actually pay for YouTube.  I pay for Google Music which includes YouTube Red.  The point is moot since the money from both go to Google.  I just wanted to be accurate.

       Yeah, I agree with all of that.  I believe we're not going to continue developing as a species until we stop trying to stifle free speech.  We have a lot of tyranical garbage left over from our past and we're not going to get past it until we can all talk freely and without assumptions or preconceived notions.  We simply debate it out of our consciousnesses.  Bad ideas will fade under honest and rigorous debate.

       I have seen a little on dtube, but it was some time ago.  Maybe it's the answer, maybe not. One thing I do know is most people will always choose the censored corporate solution because they feel like it's safer.  Free speech, OTOH, can be quite scary for an opinionated person.  It takes courage and most people just sadly lack it.

       I haven't seen any type of ads for around five years now. It's one of the reasons I don't watch TV. Never been happier. But, these ad companies are never going to stop they'll continue to think of shady ways to force ads onto us. Sadly, this is a billion dollar industry that will never die.

       I'm not so sure.  I really think the advertising business model is dying.  How do I know this?  Look at this thread.  More and more people are cutting ties with media and advertising.  They don't know it yet of course and will die trying to keep it alive.  They might survive but it certainly won't be because of you, I, or any of the other fine people here.

       It may be growing.  I'm thinking more along the long term as it becomes easier and easier to circumvent these ads.  It's possible most advertisers are being fooled by media.  Advertisers think some of these platforms are bringing them sales traffic and maybe they are, but not as much as they think and when the value of advertising begins to level out, it might become less lucrative.  I don't know.  This is all speculation on my part.  Maybe they'll win and we'll eventually be forced to watch ads while we're at work or while our driverless cars transport us to and from our places of employment and the 'centralized consumer store' where we spend our earnings religiously.  Hopefully, I'll be long gone.

       No doubt, the difference is though, I have the control of what I read.  I can't do the political stuff (where most of the agendas lie) anymore and that is very strange to me since I came from being extremely political.  It did teach me to read between the lines, but I had a major shift in my belief system and the left/right narrative will never be a fit for me again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully, I can simply not subscribe to agenda driven subreddits.  I don't care what is popular on Reddit and I almost exclusively view by "New".
