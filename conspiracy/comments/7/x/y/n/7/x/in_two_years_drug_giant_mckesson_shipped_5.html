       This story is interesting (and made it into r/news!) because its a mainstream admission of what many people have known since the start of the hillbilly heroin craze. i.e. that legal Pill Mills were running throughout the country for years. These were
       <em>
        instrumental
       </em>
       in providing a 'base' level of opiate addicts that will take generations to dislodge (if we ever do).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here we have MSM surfacing of this mess which necessarily implicates the drug companies, FDA, and institutional shareholders. Will anything come of it?

       Or Kratom which they have in their crosshairs.  I have seen Kratom actually help people get off of opiates.  Knowing that it is actually helping people get off of pharmaceuticals there is no way they will let that carry on.

       FDA now considers kratom an opioid which can only mean one thing for certain, when measures are taken to do with the opioid crisis you can bet kratom will be swept away along with everything else.

       I mean, personally, I am torn when it comes to Kratom. I know people who own a kava/Kratom bar, I know very well their regulars and clientele. It’s close to my house and is sort of my escape from home so I go there all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       People really do seem addicted to the Kratom. And I have heard more than a few people talk about withdrawals from no longer drinking it. It’s still more mild, but it does keep people coming back. The regulars at the Kratom bar easily spend $500-1,000 a month on the stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, I have seen how many recovered alcoholics and people trying to get clean from opiates are able to get help through Kratom, and kava (which is not physically addictive). I’ve also seen lots of happy older people get off their opiate meds prescribed to them for back pain and joint pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s tough for me because I see the benefits for sure, but I also see the real, though more minor, addiction. Of course no matter, what making it illegal is not going to help anything.

       Kratom helps people to not use opiods because it uses the same receptors as opiods, therefore if you stop using it the withdraws can still happen. I used Kratom for a few months, drinking a few grams in my tea and I had zero side effects after I stopped. I didn't even realize I had stopped until I had been off of it for weeks. Not saying that's anything definitive,  just my personal experience with it. My GF used it much more than I did and also had no withdrawal symptoms. Its for sure to keep people buying opiates. Its literally competition.

       Oh absolutely. I know that about it and have drank it myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see how amazing it is for people needing pain relief and also for people needing to get off harder drugs. But, I also see some people who have traded one addiction for another, and a few people who ended up dependent on the stuff when they never had an issue before (not that it’s more addictive, because it’s definitely not, but just that those people had never been addicted to anything before and now spend a bunch of money on the stuff).
      </p>
      <p>
       It needs to stay legal, but I’m not opposed to a warning with the stuff, just a heads up that it’s effects are definitely real.

       Where is that? Illinois Ican buy it at smokeshops or online. Helped me with PAWS after addiction. Wish I had known about it sooner. I feel it is a psychological addiction for kratom if any.  Sure beats being dope sick.  r/kratom is a good source of information too

       People definitely do go through withdrawals from Kratom, they are just minor comparatively to way harder opiates.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe you can order it online if you need some. It does help with withdrawals when coming off other opiates. So does DLPA (DL-Phenylalanine) which is an essential amino acid, and DLPA can do wonders for reducing withdrawals. Opiates cause DLPA deficiency and that deficiency plays a big role in withdrawal symptoms. By taking DLPA, you can reduce your withdrawal symptoms and also get rid of aches and pains in anyone.

       The whole using Kratom to get off x is just a scapegoat. If you really wanted to get off, say opiates, you could taper yourself off it with minimal withdrawals. I considered using legal "supplements" to get off benzos but I knew I was just going to end up replacing an addiction for another. I just ended up doing a slow taper that took months and I had no withdrawals. I'm about 8 months clean so far.

       Pill Mills are a scourge on our country. In a previous life, it was extremely easy for me to walk into any "Pain clinic" in town and 15 minutes later walk out with multiple prescriptions for ~ 300 extremely powerful opiates. Oxycodone and oxymorphone mostly. Street value of around 6000 dollars. This is just one person, from one clinic.....you can imagine how out of hand it has gotten.
      </p>
      <p>
       Luckily I've straightened my life out and wouldn't touch that shit for all the money in the world. My health and family are much more important to me. I don't want to even tell you how many people I know I've had to bury in the past 10 years because of this poison.

       And what’s crazy is about 17 years ago I had a severe recognized health issue which caused an absurd amount of pain for me and I could not get anyone to give me a prescription to help. I had to go to another state and see “the world’s top pain specialist” to get help. It always baffled me that opiates were so easy to get, but I could not get prescribed them... but then again, I went to real doctors who knew those pills could cause trouble for people.
      </p>
      <p>
       **i went years not wanting pain pills until it got to the point I was becoming suicidal from the pain, and I had tried literally everything else possible. I also lucked out because I did not develop an addiction to the stuff, beyond the physical addiction which is unavoidable when you need to take it daily. I only ever liked it for its pain eliminating properties and am just not the type person who wants to get high or drunk, luckily.

       Remember when the feds shut down all the amphetamine factories in the early seventies? I don't, because I wasn't born yet, but it happened. I wonder if the time may have come for similar action on opiods?

       See, the thing is that pharmacy is in rural Appalachia. That pharmacy may service the whole county and surrounding areas. This also stopped back in 2015. Now, you can't get a pain pill in West Virginia even if you're dying. Now, it isn't even the pills ruling this epidemic. It is heroin and illicit fentanyl from China. The CDC and  DEA are lying about statistics too. For example, a person with cancers goes to hospice. Hospice gives the person morphine to ease the pain at the end of life. CDC has been caught marking that cause of death down as a pill overdose. Several cases like this have been exposed. A person who is on pain meds dies in a car wreck not even driving. They will mark their deaths as an overdose. We always have to have someone to blame, but this time it really isn't big pharma. Something else my husband pointed out to me is that when the news is talking about heroin and illicit fentanyl overdoses they show bottles of pain pills on tge screen. Really fucked up.

       The thing is, this same story came up just a couple weeks ago involving a town only about 10 mi. away from this one (Williamson and Kermit). They're not near larger populations. There's CVS's, Rite Aids, etc near both towns and surrounding areas. There's definitely something up there.
