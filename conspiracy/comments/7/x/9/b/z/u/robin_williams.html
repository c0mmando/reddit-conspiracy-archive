A drug known to cause suicides (the last thing he looked on his tablet by his bed was drug side effects). I could speculate that might have something to do with it but we will never really know.</p>

<p>A bottle of Seroquel prescribed to Williams on August 4th, just seven days prior to Williamsâ€™ suicide, was missing 8 pills. The Seroquel instructions advise to take one pill per day as needed. </p>

<p>Side effects associated with Seroquel include psychosis, paranoid reactions, delusions, depersonalization and suicide attempt. </p>

<p>1- 6 weeks, notice that spread? The reason for that is because the effects vary greatly from patient to patient. If the patient already has a compromised liver or kidneys the full effects could easily hit them in a week or less.</p>

<p>Robin Williams had a history of alcohol &amp; drug abuse. It could indeed have an effect on him earlier than the listed 4-6 weeks.</p>

<p>I just wanted to point out that the 1.5 hours isn&#39;t accurate for the full effects of the drugs when taken for the first time.</p>

<p>That being said, I saw a subject that I can confidently comment on and did so. Your comment about his history of drug and alcohol abuse is what lead me to this line of thinking as well. That and personal experience with a few buddies in the Army, alcohol and seroquel. Nasty stuff on it&#39;s own, even worse when you combine it with alcohol (and an alcoholics damaged filtration system)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If his wife had just left him 7 days before it would have been brought up and have been huge news in that story. But the glaring issue of the initiation of a drug known to cause suicides wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Mainstream media get&#39;s a lot of money for advertising from pharmaceutical companies so when yet another suicide/homicide happens caused by these drugs it&#39;s not mentioned.

<p>&quot;The manufacturer of the nation&#39;s second-best-selling anti-depressant must pay $8 million to the relatives of a man who killed himself and three others after taking the drug Paxil, jurors said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just two years after Prozac came onto the market, a 48-year-old man, Joseph Wesbecker, went into his workplace with a gun, killing eight and injuring 12 before killing himself. The drug company, Eli Lilly, paid vast amounts of money to the families of victims on condition they keep quiet. A few years later there were 170 claims against Eli Lilly from people who claimed similar instances of violence and suicide.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be confusing something here. The drugs are in your system immediately, but your body tends to take several days to weeks to adjust its own chemical balances in such a way that the interaction produces the desired effects.</p>

<p>I have plenty of experience with opioids and anti-depressant drugs, and it&#39;s virtually always the same deal. You have medium to severe side-effects after about half a day, lasting for about a week or so when your body begins to adjust and compensate for some of the side effects. </p>

<p>So in my experience, it&#39;s very likely that Robin had a hell of a shitty week due to side effects and he, unfortunately, broke before his body and mind could adjust to the medication.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha yeah I get that. With all the new products being made, I would suggest trying CBD oil. They remove the THC part so it&#39;s all pain relief with none of the anxiety. But to each, their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never seen seroquel activate a bipolar. Now throw a ssri or amphetamine on a bipolar whose mood is uncapped with a mood stabilizer, that is disaster after the first dose. Atypical antipsychotics need weeks to build up in the fat cells until it finally saturates the brain (which is mostly fat) to see the eps and pseudoparkins. </p>
