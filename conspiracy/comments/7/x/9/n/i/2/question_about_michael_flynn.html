       Can someone explain to me what he did illegal? There was news yesterday about a Susan Rice email she sent to herself discussing the content of a meeting with Obama and Comey right before innaguration and there concern over sharing intelligence with Flynn because he was possibly “compromised”....so was he?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I just remembered that Flynn (a private citizen at the time) had his phone call with the Russian ambassador leaked...which basically started all of this...LEAKED...who did that? Huh.

       The same one training insurgents through charter schools and running heroin rings in the US? Sure wish he succeeded. Anyone who doesn't know about Fetullah Gulen and his close knit ties with the CIA/Mossad should really read or watch NewsBud.

       Sounds like propaganda by Turkey in order to support the illegal kidnapping of someone residing in the US.

       ....No, hardly. Especially when Erdogan has been a Gulen lackey since in office, and whenever he deviates outside of the interests of the US/Israel/Gulen, there's yet another coup attempt. Seriously, how much do you actually know about Turkish affairs? I highly encourage you to look into the alternative news sources that don't stem from US outlets like Newsweek.

       I would like to point out that we

       I’ll be honest and say that you’re right that I don’t know that much about Turkey affairs.

      <p>
       From what it sounds like to me though that was that the coup attempt was a false flag or orchestrated by Edrogan as a way to consolidate power for himself.

       And yes, we’re in a conspiracy sub. Doesn’t meant everyone has to believe in the same theories.

       If by 'attacking' Meuller you mean pointing out his complicity, time and time again, in the face of corruption, then yep. This is the guy who helped cover up 9/11 and the IRS scandal, for one.
      </p>

       Go on and keep labeling everything not conforming to your bias 'propaganda,' especially when you admitted yourself you had no clue on Turkish affairs or any information on Gulen.

       Except I don't choose based on biases, but on their reporting history. WaPo and NYT reliability spout pro-CFR, pro-war, pro-Western propaganda, not to mention their being infiltrated deeply by the intelligence agencies.

       The Russian he was talking to was being surveilled. That's how the US intelligence community had access to the conversation.

       Your post is at -5, but Flynn has been well known for his integrity even long before 2016. Whistleblowers have nothing but good things to say about him, and one of his most vocal opponents is James Clapper--the same guy who committed perjury when he straight up lied to Congress about not spying on the American people.

       I think a lot more information is going to be revealed about the Flynn situation that will clear the air.

       His sentencing hearing being pushed back is certainly curious. It was pushed back for a reason and what that reason is will actually reveal quite a bit.

       That is one viewpoint yes, but that’s not the obvious conclusion.

       It’s already reported he had a plea deal and that would logically require some form of cooperation.

       For sure and that’s to be expected honestly since the details of the investigation are (for the most part) kept under wraps.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could definitely be that they’re holding Flynn to the fire for more info, but it could also mean there’s procedural issues that effect the validity of the charges and subsequent plea deal.

       <p>
        After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of "treason" and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel's Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That’s his full statement. I don’t know honestly, he calls accusations false, recognizes lying to the FBI was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Set things right” could basically mean cooperate however he can and be truthful and forthright. If his wrong was lying to the FBI, then cooperating and being forthright would effectively “set things right”.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that he’s flipping on Trump is still predicated on having information to flip. If that information doesn’t prove Trump colluded than it doesn’t mean what people are reading into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not saying I don’t think he has info, I’m just saying it may not be what many people think it is.
