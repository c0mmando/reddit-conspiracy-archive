    <div class="md"><p>I participated in an active shooter drill with local police when I was in high school. We did it on a Saturday at the school from roughly 8:00am - 12:00pm. No nonsense, cops bought us lunch and we all got extra credit.</p>

<p>Find it odd they would have an AS drill during an actual school day. I’m not saying they didn’t but that doesn’t seem like a reasonable thing to do with an entire school filled. For reference, we did a 5-600 student school with about 10 cops and 20 students flipping roles after each try (I played a shooter/victim/parent/teacher on different occasions). Back then it was super fun though.</p>

<p>B) The simulation is unrealistic, with the building only being a fraction full</p>

But we pay police officers, and give them lots of power, precisely so that we can rely on them to carry out justice fairly, without emotion. It&#39;s not their job to exact revenge on other citizens who are constitutionally protected from ANY punishment until they are convicted in a court of law.

    <div class="md"><p>It’s fine to admit you have no decent argument other than the over-used “this one cop killed a person that may or may not have deserved it”. Using that argument would be like me saying that the one idiot who claims that lizards run the government makes all conspiracy theorists like a group of complete retards. You can’t judge an entire group based off of the actions of a few. Also, police and military are constantly doing things that should be worth mentioning that benefit the country but it wouldn’t fit into the medias agenda to publicize that. </p>

However it sounds like the word was out on this kid being a threat  and yet nothing prevented this from happening. My nephew was in this school today and luckily he made it out alive.

The victims families grief and suffering for years to come. That&#39;s when I disagree with you. That&#39;s when I start hoping this kid dies very ,very painfully and very, very slowly and just when he thinks it&#39;s over and he can finally rest , they wake him up and start the process all over again.

<p>In the end, you can&#39;t stop crazy. The key is to try to keep weapons out of the hands of crazy, but there&#39;s no great solution to it. You ban guns, they&#39;ll use bombs. You ban bomb making materials, they&#39;ll use swords. You ban swords, they&#39;ll use knives. You ban knives, they&#39;ll use acid. You ban acid, they&#39;ll use sticks. You ban sticks, they&#39;ll use rocks.</p>

<p>Better background checks is a good start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is.  It&#39;s also a place for debate.  And I will continue to debate against people who think any of these shootings don&#39;t have real victims.  There is no good evidence for those theories, and there&#39;s never a reason to jump to that conclusion.</p>

<p>Manchurian candidate sure.  Drugged patsy like I see a few people suggesting?  Plausible.  60+ fake victims who will be seen by thousands of people and hundreds of medical professionals?  Not really worth discussing.</p>

<p>It feels to be that this whole line of thinking is a distraction narrative to have people arguing in circles about nonsense.  Same with the flat earthers who invaded around the same time.</p>

Every single policy in existence changed for him, the only one which did not is cutting his own taxes and the death tax, that is the only thing he ever wanted. Even was Friends with Clintons his whole life no he leads the charge against them, then he says no charges, then he says clinton is the deep state against him. You nutjobs. Most contradictonary person in history. But maybe you don&#39;t even know about his &quot;older&quot; views before he found that GOP base is simpler and easy to sway. Also talks all the time about make american higher american and has companies employing nearly only foreigners, makes his stuff overseas. Not contradicting just smart. lmao you guys.</p>

<p>Not one example was contested by you not one. Have a nice evening buddy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“However, the plan also gets rid of the personal and dependent exemptions. That allows each person — the tax filer, their spouse, their dependents — to make $4,050 of their income exempt. Taxpayers took 293 million exemptions in 2015, amounting to just over 1.1 trillion dollars. As a result, the math gets a little harder on families here: gaining $600 and losing the taxed portion of $4,050 per child, essentially. For larger families, the hike on the standard deduction isn’t going to wipe out those losses.” Walt Hickey 538 </p>

<p>Furthermore - the state tax and local tax exemption is disqualified if you use the standard deduction. There is a lot more to all of the changes and how they effect individual taxes but I’m not writing a novel. </p>

<p>Well I suppose if he only hires foreigners that puts the lid on him being racist. You’re gonna have to come with something heavier than “Trump flip-flops you guys are idiots.”</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder if folks like you even try to present good arguments.</p>

<p>Take your argument compeltely apart and take a look and see how nonsensical it is.</p>

<p>A person can be several things at the same time and this person will have priorities. A racist person that is even more greedy will higher whatever is the cheapest that doesn&#39;t make him less racist this just shows his priorities. That&#39;s why he says hire and build american and doesn&#39;t do it. His priority is his wealth. </p>

<p>You are welcome I solved your conundrum how a racist person can hire foreigners. </p>

<p>He was pro ---&gt; against like every issue ever.</p>

<p>Literally shit talked the president for playing golf than played more golf and this times 100x with a multitude of different issues. If he wouldn&#39;t be the president you would consider him the psycho uncle type.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Admit yours that you seriously think Trump is not the most condratitonary flip-flopping politician in a high office ever. Do it. Admit it. Admit that his flip flopping is near psycho level. For every major policie change in a &quot;normal lieing&quot; politician you can respond with like ten lol.</p>

<p>Every issue.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Guns</p></li>
<li><p>Abortion</p></li>
<li><p>Healthcare</p></li>
<li><p>Foreign policy</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Not even counting the daily insanities like saying he will never take vacation then literally being the most freetime president ever, with starting to work at near noon after watching TV for hours like a kid that has summer break. I mean you could blast the 10k character limit with a post detailing all ridiculous things he says.</p>

<p>Honestly dude, say it out loud so we have it black on white, say Trump didn&#39;t contradict himself more than other politicans. Do it, type it out and read it yourself. Have some dignity and stop licking assholes for a while. Still can&#39;t believe he shittalked Obama for golfing and then became the fulltime golfer, he cares so little about the opinions of his cultists he didn&#39;t gave a damn how dumb this would look. But yeah compare this with Bernie who for like 5 decades has a pretty straight forward line because he changes his opinon on some stuff, while Trump literally switched to GOP because he thought the voters there are dumber</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah go ahead show how she is more flip floppy. Again you can find changes for everybody nobody denies that but you know yourself <strong><em>nobody</em></strong> beats Trump. Hillary changed on gay stuff? Cool Trump changed on everything like 5 times back and forth. Honestly I can&#39;t imagine how a more flip floppy president would look. Trump is already a caricature of the flip flop politicians. He is satire.</p>

<p>Say the president is Kenyan? Then say always respect the president and flag and stuff. </p>

<p>Say the president is lazy. Well start work day at 10 and make more holidays</p>

<p>Say president keeps Secret service form family? Do the same</p>

<p>Say president golfs too much? Golf more.</p>

<p>You know we could do this for daaaaayyys.</p>

<p>Iam dead serious Trump is satire. If you would have wrote satire 10 years ago a President would have looked like this. You guys will be laughed at for decades. They will say &quot;well people voted for Trump you never know&quot;. People like you who believed he is not flip floppy while literally flip flopping in your face will be used as example of how simple people act. </p>

<p>Btw he was pro choice now against. He is no fan of immigrants overstaying visa and stuff. He married one. Hired them. Is familiy values has three wifes and abused one. Talks about Obama and his kids, prefers golfing over visiting his 10 year old. Is against cutting medi cait then cuts medicait. Shittalked debt increase then increases the debt. Is against the confed flag then is for it. Tells president to not take vacations takes more than him. Shittalks Obama because he gets paid to golf he literally goes to his own resort and lets his entourage pay him. Lmao. Talks about low stamina cuts his stuff short because he is low stamina. Thinks leaking is good ---&gt; hates leaking. Thinks protests are good---&gt; hates protest now. Shittalks hillary for intel stuff then gloats about intel to russian.</p>

<p>Your very first attempt to add any facts to your argument and half of them are dishonest. I asked this already many Trumpists. Why being dishonest? If you are right and Trump is a good leader why lie? The Truth should be your best weapon</p>

<p>That he did. But you lack the understanding to understand how this is not a good thing for you in the long run.</p>

<p>Why lie? Why be dishonest if your case is valid? Did I lie about Trumps flippy floppy? No, there is no need to lie about stuff like that. But there is need to lie about Trumps performance. To some soul searching and think about this. If lies and manipulation are neccessary you might be on the wrong side.</p>

<p>You asking people for crash courses in economy?</p>

<p>Imagine you are rich self centered person with only rich friends. Now think how is the best way to get richer? Well cutting taxes helps right? But then the people will hate you, right? So you cut theirs too a little bit, you throw them a bone, you are one of them. But keep in mind you are self centered you only care about yourself. What you do now? You get the money back. How? You cut social programms of people who just before got their taxes &quot;cut&quot;. But you want more, well so you put some little taxes on gas which are hidden poverty tax because this tax disproportionately targets poor people. You get math? A gas tax is ridiculous high on a poor person in percentage terms. That is a good start. Now what more. Well you just for the start lend the money which you don#t have to pay for tax cuts. But how will this money be paid back? Not by you and you rich friends obviously. Well you can then obviously inflate the money a bit so the poor people money is less worth. Do you care about this? Obviously not most of your assets are not in any fiat currency. Hmmmm delicious. </p>

<p>But I will give thr GOP credit. When this comes down and people notice they actually have less buying power, the dimbos will think it is the dems fault. Buying power of US citizens started shrinking since Reagen. You look at your pay check and don&#39;t get how your life gets disproportional more expensive. You chuckle for your breadcrumbz while you pay 5 times more for internet because your corrupt politicians ass rape you.</p>

<p>You cheer the billionaire who is lining his pockets you guys will be remembered.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Uhm. This is totally unaffected by taxes and a growing population will create more taxes. Not sure what you don&#39;t understand. Why would the taxes shrink there are more people every year and the world economy is growing at the moment. </p>

<p>Who said this lol. I said tax revenue is increasing pretty much every year for every country unless they shrink. More people more taxes, more inflation more nominal amounts of tax income. Honestly not sure you are equipped for such discussions. The actual number of tax income doesn&#39;t tell you anything. Relevant is the deficit. When you inflate the currency you will get more taxes but have a worse deficit. Not sure you fully understand how taxes and budget works.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I actually like the situation. It is facinating to watch. The smugness that will follow will have epic proportions. The proposed tax on gas is a nice beginning. Very interesting. Also that you guys pay the wall that mexico will pay &quot;later&quot; is also very nice. At first I was afraid there is a slight possiblity this buffon launched a nuke on accident but besides that it is very entertaining. As you might have figured I am not really affected by this. Feel sorry for people left behind tho. Sad to see how vile humanity can be at time were we could have abundance. Well maybe it will serve as example for your kids. Have a nice evening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t be a ancom without first being a liberal in your beliefs and you can&#39;t be a nazi without first being conservative in your your beliefs.</p>

<p>Sure people can lean multiple ways and even start on one side and totally flip to the other but we&#39;re talking about the extremes of both ends.</p>

<p>To put it bluntly its about ideology not &quot;brand names&quot;. When one ideology is the precursor to another they are forever linked.</p>

<p>I&#39;m begging to question your intelligence level at this point..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if there was any singular connection between your average white supremacist and murders, how can you neglect to mention the murders by other groups? Why single out the white guys? Why single out any group? You can make a link out of almost anything. There’s something fundamentally wrong with some folks. Whether they pay somebody to do this shit or are actually mentally sick there’s always somebody afterwards that has to play the race card. </p>

<p>Pin it on a race. That’s everybody’s go-to. As if your political preference or skin color automatically makes the correlated group at fault. </p>

<p>Isometric warfare.  Helicopter pilots, the crew that works on them, the people giving them orders, and the politicians all have family members that live amongst us.

<p>Having nukes is not ideal as if you have nukes others will feel the need to have nukes to be safe from your nukes.

<p>Guns, in America specifically, are the same. They&#39;re everywhere and they proliferate our culture due in major part to our 2nd amendment rights and our ever increasing nationalism and patriotism.

<p>We keep our guns not because we view it as a scenario of &quot;if&quot; but a scenario of &quot;when&quot;. &quot;When I&#39;m being robbed I&#39;ll be able to defend myself.&quot; &quot;When the government becomes tyrannical I&#39;ll be ready.&quot; Our society going back to the founding fathers themselves is based on paranoia and mistrust of any larger government figure and is one of the main reasons this sub even exists today.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think so and I gonna tell you why. The primary purpose of an armed population is to be &quot;immune&quot; against dictatorship and bad leaders. I argue the propaganda techniques kiled this possiblity. People will not see when they have bad leaders thus will never ever use their privilge despite lifing in an actual situation where this would be appropriate. I will give you example why I think people live already in this reality</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Mass incarnation for petty offences.</p></li>
<li><p>Heavy use of directed propaganda against citizens. Straight up bullshting by the WH</p></li>
<li><p>Extreme diffrence between and rich and poor and every increasing inequality</p></li>
<li><p>People die for stupid reason like lack of funs.</p></li>
<li><p>While production et cetera are increasing in staggering numbers the money and purchasing power does not arrive at the bottom or even the middle</p></li>
<li><p>Higher chance to get killed by the government than in any other Western Country</p></li>
<li><p>You get spied on by your intellency services.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Yet the population sits tight. Why? People at the top have the means to be dictators/bad leaders without people knowing. Thus the actual spirit of the 2nd is void. People are sitting in jail for smoking a plant while you think you are free and your guns will keep the freedomm.</p>

<p>You miss my point. You wouldn&#39;t want people to have nukes because you are not a dumb moron and see this increases your chances to get killed. With guns its the same but people just don&#39;t see it. Without any guns in the US your chance to get killed would decrease yet you are against this. There is no significant quality of life gained to make this a good deal. Its just brainwashing. You keep guns and freedom but can&#39;t smoke a plant. It is illusion</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except all of your examples happen in almost every major power having or not having guns doesn&#39;t make the situation better or worse. It provides an avenue for rebellion against tyranny if we ever recognize it but it gives bad people the means to do bad things.</p>

<p>Just because you don&#39;t see average joe walk up to the white house with an AR and shoot DT doesn&#39;t mean people sit tight on these things either. Most people I know are prepared to do something if it happens but would realistically like to work things out through dialogue. Most people are relatively over the whole spying thing anyway as they see it as a simple and easy to live with necessity in a first world country and its not like anywhere else is any better. Also as much as I would enjoy pot becoming legal I currently don&#39;t have much sympathy for anyone who gets caught smoking or with weed in possession as it is illegal and the consequences are known.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t miss your point at all. You&#39;re right in that I don&#39;t really want people to have nukes I could go either way on guns because I own them myself and enjoy shooting and hunting. The problem with your argument in both cases however is that you assume that both nukes and or guns could just evaporate overnight and problem solved. Nukes and guns both exist therefore they cannot not exist and we need to be practical and unbiased in our approach to regulating them.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll agree it&#39;s an illusion but that illusion provides a certain peace of mind which again in most peoples minds seems to outweigh the incredibly small risk of ever encountering gun violence in person.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say anything to that effect my argument is solely theoretical. The US is fucked in terms of guns there is obviously no going back. </p>

<p>Well the non quatifiable piece of mind. If this becomes the leg the 2nd wants to stay on you might have a weak case. I want to point out that by most &quot;happiness&quot; studies the US ranks pretty low considering the fact how rich the average US citizen should be. So not sure how the piece of mind works out for you. This obviously as well could be a reason to &quot;rebel&quot;. Maybe guns are one of the biggest irony of the US society in that they achieve actually the opposite of what was intended. The politicans stripping you of rights and putting you in jail for stupid shit talk the loudest about your rights to own guns while taking all the others slowly away. Truly dazzling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you agree then that guns aren&#39;t going anywhere which means efforts should not be made to remove guns from the people but provide better regulations on how and by whom they are obtained.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really feel like you can correlate those two things together as I don&#39;t really see the peace of mind provided by guns to have any impact about the way our society feels about their overall happiness. I guess if we&#39;re looking at it from Maslow&#39;s point of view it provides a basic need but not nearly as much as other things we lack in this country like proper healthcare, ease of access to living space, and necessary resources. Our happiness is low not because of the guns existing or not existing but because we lack other basic needs that prevent us from climbing the pyramid.</p>

<p>I think what truly dazzles me is how much you seem to care about people going to jail over &quot;stupid shit&quot; when they broke the law. Regardless of your views on certain laws I don&#39;t think that should exempt anyone from punishment for breaking those laws while they are in place and enforced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what they want you to think m8. People thought the same about the 13 colonies vs British Empire. The insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan put a pretty damn good fight against our unlimited $ recently and I think if push came to shove our citizenry would step up to the challenge and outdo them. We&#39;d certainly be better armed.</p>

<p>Government is inept man this fact is shoved in our face everyday. Don&#39;t be scared of them. </p>

<p>On the other hand if revolution took the form of a full blown Civil War...? That means a big chunk of local police military and Government would support resistance. Then they wouldn&#39;t need to fight like the apache and <em>could</em>confront the tyranny head on... and just maybe win? </p>

<p>The shitload of guns we have in every home scares oppressors and invaders alike. It is one of the few things keeping them both from steamrolling over any pretense of freedom we have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The families can be explained in a way that makes sense to me. 1. Money 2. Threat of death for talking and 3. the biggest motivator of all - religious convictions. 
They are either Satanists who have taken blood oaths or they are people who really really hate guns. Imagine a brainwashed religious zealot who&#39;s anti-gun and believes that a lie is acceptable in order to prevent the loss of life of kids. They are told that this lie will prevent future Columbines. They are told this lie will bring about gun control laws that will limit death... After all, nobody died at Sandy Hook so would you lie to save lives? To save your own? To save your kids? 
And besides, if they changed their mind &amp; decided to tell the truth, would anybody believe them (aside from crazies like us?) Would anybody in Main Stream Media cover the story? 
I doubt it. I can see why they would lie.</p>

The families believe they&#39;re justified in the lie because it will take guns away which will prevent a real Sandy Hook from happening in the future.  I nice sum of money to each family for their trouble is icing on the cake.  I still think they&#39;re CIA, but CIA agents are real people, not robots.  They probably gathered up a bunch of CIA agents who are anti gun, and away they went.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me ask you since your European.  Do you trust the American government?  As an American I don&#39;t trust our government.  We&#39;ve been practically in nonstop war for the past hundred years.  The first amendment is constantly under attack, as well as the fifth.  As soon as the American people are no longer armed, we will be in serious trouble.  We (everyone in the world) like to think of ourselves as more enlightened and peaceful than a few hundred years ago, but are we?  A government WILL turn on its people again, but I can promise you it won&#39;t our government turning on us, as long as we&#39;re armed to the teeth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hell no i dont trust the american government. But i also don&#39;t trust the american people. We know for a fact that every society is made up of average men and women, some smarter than the rest and some who are willing to harm us in any way possible. By having a policy of anyone and everyone having access to a firearm you are catering to the needs of the worst in your society. In Europe, we don&#39;t have firearms because we know that 0.01% of the population is fucked up enough to use it against their own people so even tho there is always that tiny minority you have to ensure that they cannot carry out acts even if it limits the &#39;freedoms&#39; of the 99%. We have to cater to idiots or we face the consequences.  As for the government i don&#39;t see how that could ever happen in a modern society. The army is much more loyal to its citizens than to it&#39;s government especially with Trump in charge.</p>

<p>&quot;All&quot; the guns were not taken - far from it. Pump-action and lever-action rifles/shotguns are fairly easily obtainable with a basic gun license. Handguns are still allowed, too. Semi-automatic rifles and semi-automatic/pump-action shotguns are heavily restricted but technically legal for farmers, professional pest controllers and some clay target shooters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. At that point the rifle wasn’t recovered. Where would he drop it that no one had found it? If he was blending in with students he most likely would’ve had to drop it in the school. Or at the least least in front of someone. That’s what I am getting at. I appreciate the smart ass remark because I’m a smart ass as well, but I feel like it would be difficult to go on a shooting rampage, drop the rifle and blend in with other students. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the most part, your incorrect. In 1986 the National Firearms Act was created which just means no new machineguns can be manufactured but you can still purchase the 200k+ still in existance and you have to pay a $200 tax when purchasing one. Same criteria for purchasing suppressors, short barreled shotguns/rifles, aow&#39;s, grenade launchers (each grenade is a $200 stamp). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow i stand corrected! i did some quick research on my state&#39;s laws and pretty much exactly what you&#39;re saying. from what i understand, since no new ones have been made since 1986, you would always be purchasing a used gun (transacting a &quot;transfer of license&quot; &amp; not creating a new registration for the weapon), and would have to make the purchase from a certain authorized dealer (Class III). also, due to this, full-autos run on average ~$14,000.</p>

<p>is this accurate?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the most part. You can either transfer from a FFL dealer that has their Class III occupational license to handle NFA items or you can transfer directly from another person/trust. Either way all paperwork for the $200 tax stamp transfer is submitted to ATF which as long as your 21yo and can own a regular gun, your approved. It&#39;s a tax stamp, no license or anything like that. Your just paying a tax for the transfer and the stamp is just proof you paid. </p>

<p>Nice find benogan3. I&#39;m fishing for strange occurrences too. I heard a teacher interview that sounded disingenuous too. Talking about some innocuous crap of how the recent fire drill probably saved them from more casualties and proceeding to do that thing where people go &quot;sorry&quot; when they pause and try to force themselves to cry. Idk, could be legit. Whole thing stinks. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice as how Cruz mentions someone in his post multiple times, once you look up that user on Instagram you get the bio &quot;MSD FOOTBALL #26 RB🏈 2019&quot; -- or in other words Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t matter who he supported or who the fucker wanted to kill but hopefully they&#39;ll get some answers out of him.</p>

As for the other guns, you&#39;ve got a cheap pump shotgun, what looks to be a .270 hunting rifle, a tiny .22 rifle, and a pistol. If you live in the U.S. no one is going to be knocking on your door to collect these cheap legal guns. I own more myself as well as the majority of Americans do. </p>

<p>The difference between you and me is that your approach is straight forward and common sense, however it&#39;s totally unrealistic and not possible to implement realistically in the real world. Everything does sound great on paper and on forums but it&#39;s the actual action and implementation to take place that I&#39;m after and what your saying would not stop that matter at hand. Even if there were to totally outright ban sales/limit everybody from owning them it would still probably take a few thousand years to see clear results from that based on current percentages. </p>

<p>And your guys argument about how your country doesn&#39;t have so-and-so issue is comparing apples to oranges. Do you understand the U.S. is basically comprised of 50 smaller countries that each also has their own set of rules/regs in addition to the federal laws? Do you realize your country probably doesn&#39;t even make up 1 or 2 of the 50 states we have? It&#39;s not comparative. </p>

<p>This is a mental health issue we are dealing with here and it coincides with the inbred terrorists that are popping up all over the world (easily getting guns in Western countries that outright bans them).  </p>

<p>You guys want to solve a complex issue by putting band aids over it which is downright uneducated and incompetent because you don&#39;t have any idea what your talking about. Your only point is sensationalism...being worried about getting shot at school, hotel or festival; like dude do you not realize how minuscule of a percentage of that for it to possibly ever happen to you? Your more likely to win the lotto 10x over. </p>

<p>And now your going to bring up healthcare where again you already don&#39;t know what your talking about? Do you realize implementing those socialistic values degrades your healthcare? That&#39;s why Canadians are hopping over the border at an exponential rate to get our superior healthcare at much less of a rate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in Australia, which actually has a way bigger population than NYC. Our states all have different laws and regulations too, but after our last mass shooting they regulated our guns and we don’t have mass shootings any more. We can still own and use guns, we just don’t let 19 year olds stockpile them, we have rules. People were upset initially (“but what about my freedom?!” Blah blah blah), but eventually everyone was cool with it because everyone that needed a gun could still have one, if you didn’t need one but wanted to shoot one you can (I have a shooting range 10 minutes from my house that I use sometimes), but the main reason everyone is cool with it is because we could see that guns were probably not the best thing to let people buy cheaply and easily.</p>

<p>Our free healthcare is fantastic. I was diagnosed with ALL Leukaemia when I was 18. Spent just over 6 months in hospital and was getting outpatient treatments for over 10 years. Didn’t pay a cent, so I think our healthcare is pretty good. Shit, I’m in the waiting room of a radiologist at the moment waiting to get an MRI. Free. How much would an MRI cost over there? </p>

<p>The reason I bought up healthcare is because this is a mental health issue, I agree with you there. It’s also a society issue, arrogance issue because you guys feel that everyone needs one (or two, or 30, or however many guns and bullets you want), but most of all IT IS A GUN ISSUE. IT IS TOO EASY TO BUY WEAPONS IN THE USA SO OF COURSE THERE IS PSYCHOPATHS USING THEM TO SHOOT INNOCENT PEOPLE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Brotherman, I&#39;m happy for that situation and I&#39;m glad it worked out for Australia but I&#39;m not about to start debate the tax you pay to get that and the apple to oranges debate of why it can&#39;t scale out for the U.S.. </p>

<p>But man, Australia <em>barely</em> has 3x as many people there are in NYC...and that&#39;s just one city in one of the 50 states in the U.S. ...More than half a trillion guns out there and no way to stop hand to hand transactions. It&#39;s not feasible. To late. Not happening. Tens of billion dollar industry revolving around them and if the manufacuters can&#39;t sell guns to the public where they generate ALL their profit, then they can&#39;t afford R&amp;D to make the military newer guns and compete for contracts.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for wanting to change the world and make it a better place but it&#39;s taking realistic steps and approach to get to where we need to be that is going to ultimately solve the problem we have which is mental health. </p>

<p>So, it wasn&#39;t the fact that he is a psychopath or is suffering from other mental illnesses. The guns themselves imposed their will upon him and forced him to kill people. That is <em>literally</em> what you just implied. THat&#39;s strange, because I own many guns myself (handguns, rifles, AR 15s, AK47s, etc) and never have I killed someone. Nice logic, dude. Quit acting like an angry child, grow up and just admit to yourself that your position is moronic.</p>

<p>See what I did there?</p>

<p>Guns are actually a very excellent choice for mass killings. This is exactly why we&#39;re not experiencing an epidemic of box cutter attacks, nor of mass poisonings. It&#39;s also exactly why law enforcement and our armed forces wield guns instead of fucking scissors and teddy bears.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also point out that you couched your statement above in &quot;when you are in a place where other people have guns.&quot; You&#39;re aware that this was at a high school, right?

<p>And of <em>course</em> people who wish to kill others will find a way. That&#39;s been true for <em>literally</em> every organism and every species on this planet since life came to exist. It also turns out, though, that a shark&#39;s desire to kill me is a substantially smaller threat than it otherwise might be were it armed with an AR-15.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in no other debate is your flawed reasoning considered by anyone to be an intellectually valid reason to throw our arms in the air in exasperation and declare that there&#39;s nothing we can do. People kill others? Great! Let&#39;s take murder off the books. People fly airlines into buildings? Great! Let&#39;s not allow the cockpit doors to lock, because what&#39;s the fucking point? Blind people can&#39;t see? Awesome! Let&#39;s let them drive. People can manufacture the ingredients necessary to make homemade bombs? Sweet -- can&#39;t wait until I can buy C4 at Walmart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to outlaw all guns. I think the 2nd amendment is important and we shouldn&#39;t forget that.</p>

<p>Instead, I think the process to obtain them, generally, should be quite a bit more onerous and reflect the gravity of the decision. This process should much more closely resemble buying a house and getting a mortgage than buying a six-pack. I think the bar should be raised even higher for individuals who show warning signs, and I think it should be quite a bit easier for the people who <em>see</em> these warning signs to feed that information back into the process.</p>

<p>I do think that certain types of firearms and modifications should actually be outlawed. Here I&#39;m thinking about things like high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, semi-automatic rifles, etc, that enable the significantly higher casualty rates we see in these incidents. These items serve no useful purpose towards the ends of self-defense, nor of hunting. We all seem to be in agreement that the 2nd amendment doesn&#39;t endow me with the right to bear nuclear arms or an Apache attack helicopter and I think we need to dispel with the notion that all firearms are created equally.</p>

<p>I think that buying a gun should be a solemn affair. Moreso, I think that talking about your gun, showing off your gun on social media, or treating it like it&#39;s an extension of your masculinity shouldn&#39;t be a common occurrence. I think we should strive for a place in which these <em>are</em> the warning signs that show us something is amiss, rather than an ingrained part of certain parts of gun culture.</p>

<p>I think we need to have a serious discussion about why a cop who kills an innocent man in a hotel room because of mistaken identity has &quot;You&#39;re fucked&quot; on his stock. I think we need to have a serious discussion about why Alex Jones has mods that have labeled his safety a &quot;safe space&quot; and others that say &quot;liberal tears&quot;. I think we need to have a serious discussion about why the NRA remains silent when concealed carriers like Philando Castile are killed by <em>the state</em>, but don&#39;t bat an eye spending money to produce videos in which they pretend to light the New York Times on fire and smash televisions with sledgehammers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking along these same lines.  It&#39;s not guns, before 1968 guns were unbelievably easy to get (as in mail order) and there was so little security anywhere.  You could literally carry a gun on a plane and nobody would know because we didn&#39;t even have airline security.</p>

<p>There&#39;s something about the nature of life in America that&#39;s causing people to go off the rails with anger and frustration.  I don&#39;t know what it is, economics, politics, smartphone/internet-focused social relationships, and/or the rotten synergy of all that and other things.  </p>

<p>My most recent thoughts (just before I heard about this shooting in fact) was how little tolerance modern life has for even minor issues -- make a mistake at any stage in your life and you run the risk of personal and financial ruin, or if you&#39;re young enough and don&#39;t have much yet to lose, you just get eliminated from any chance at improving your life and get slotted into a perpetual second rate life of low-wage employment at best.  It&#39;s not hard to see how this kind of zero-sum, no-second-chances kind of structure makes people go TILT.</p>

<p>It would almost be comforting to have some kind of grand conspiracy explain it, instead I fear there is no conspiracy &quot;in control&quot; and that it&#39;s actually some kind of emergent phenomenon of modern life.  There may be actual conspiracies or forces in control of elements that lead to the emergent phenomenon but they are more basic (making the rich richer, etc) and people going off the rails is just a higher order byproduct, not an intended outcome.</p>

Have your guns for hunting. Give up handguns and assault rifles, restrict ammunition quantity and register the guns. Even if this kid wasn&#39;t able to fire as many bullets it would have given them time to escape or disarm him. 
He shouldn&#39;t have been able to buy any gun without extensive training and screening.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s very mature.  The 1% number is globally. It&#39;s a human issue. So why are there more mass shootings in America than anywhere else? 
ACCESS TO FUCKING GUNS. You don&#39;t like the answer so you&#39;re ignoring the solution. You just proved my point about immature ignorant people owning firearms. 
Do you have your life threatened often? Are you always scared of people wanting to kill you? Have you sought help for this irrational fear? That&#39;s called schizophrenia. You might need therapy/ meds and you probably shouldn&#39;t own firearms. </p>

Says the guy arguing against gun control who leaves assault rifles laying around unaccounted for. That&#39;s some top notch logic. 
You can&#39;t properly argue my points so now you&#39;re going to pick apart my choice of words. Classic sign the argument is won. 
Welp! Good luck when they come to take your guns!
Spoiler alert. They&#39;re better armed than you. No matter how many assault rifles you leave laying around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said I leave them laying around. Now you are putting words in my mouth. I said they are unaccounted for. They are in safes, I just dont know off the top of my head how many I have.</p>

<p>I never argued against gun control. You are imagining that I am.  Did you know that it is already illegal for mentally ill people, drug users and felons to own guns? I agree with that gun control.  I agree with background checks.  We already have a lot of gun control laws and I agree with them.  So I dont know where you get the idea Im arguing against gun control.</p>

<p>Oh, wait, I do know where you get that idea: your imagination.</p>

<p>Youre using strawmen, putting words in my mouth and misusing words.</p>

<p>You really should stop before you embarrass yourself further. But you wont, you feel compelled to get the last word because of your fragile psyche.  So go ahead, get the last word. It will be word you misuse, but go ahead and use it anyway. Youll feel better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main difference is the extended clip, better grips and and the ability to fire semi automatically instead of one shot at a time then manually reloading. 
Schizophrenia is a disease where the person often hears voices, and is delusional about the people around him wanting to harm him. So... You. 
Idk what this arguing against foolishness is so i can&#39;t speak to it. 
Also gun control varies from state to state. So because your state might be more strict, most others aren&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compare it to the social and cultural issues of the past that have destroyed cultures and civilizations. China as the sick man of Asia, Ottomans as the sick man of Europe, the fall of what should have been unstoppable Rome, and the self destruction of the British Empire. The difference is that America is new and has been subverted into self-hatred. There is no rational alternative to American rule, even it&#39;s enemies understand that. </p>

<p>American society has somehow always been susceptible to self-polarization, but when faced with a proper adversary, that enemy will regret ever getting on their bad side. Look at Europe post WW1. Fought each other over colonial control, gave it all up, fought each other in two wars that were less harmful to their main proponents than those less involved. Western society recognizes in it&#39;s entirety, it&#39;s main problems. However western thought encourages special pleading and excuses things until they reach their boiling point. After whatever mess is made and cleaned up, prosperity will be returned and the cycle will repeat.</p>

<p>Right now that problem is prescription drugs and prescription drug abuse. Which is sad to see and pathetic for the greatest country in the world. Nobody wants to acknowledge the reality of it. There is no such thing as mental health issues besides people who truly are disturbed and are predisposed to violence, etc, etc. </p>

<p>Our greatest strengths are our greatest weaknesses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one knows every detail of Sandy Hook or any other similar tragedy. Or of any news story for that matter. Just because you don’t know about a detail doesn’t mean it didn’t happen and just because you think you know something or saw it reported doesn’t make it true. I’m all for a good conspiracy but if you think someone had a bunch of little kids murdered for a political agenda you’re fucked in the head and have watched too many amateur YouTube videos . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So every parent was a fake. Every kids picture, that kid either never existed or disappeared? Every teacher was in on it because obviously they would’ve called bluff if they used a picture of a kid that didn’t go there. Every kid that went to school there was in on it because they too would’ve realized those “dead” kids weren’t their classmates. Every cop, EMT, doctor, nurse and public official in the city was in on it. </p>

<p>A school shooting isn’t something you can fake. People think the moon landing was fake, whatever, thats plausible. Not 27 people/kids being murdered, plus an additional with the dead gunman.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Around 3 Years ago some kid was commenting on a song called “The Anatomy of a School Shooter” and was talking about shooting up his school. I found out where he lived by looking at his google account and googled high schools in that area. I than contacted people who went there by typing it in on Facebook. Within a day they caught him. He was a little fucked up kid doing school shootings on Minecraft. Within a day ! Within only one day they figured out who he was and came to his house. How come nick Cruz wasn’t investigated ?</p>

<p>Not saying everyone with bags like that is on drugs, just throwing out possibilities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll set up a theoretical for you;</p>

<p>I’m the shooter, i go to the school wearing my red shirt and jeans. I have with me all my things needed to pull off the most dumb and heartless plan I’ve ever devised(weapon,smoke grenades for some reason, and a gas mask). I then shoot random people and when it’s all over and I feel accomplished, I take my things and I drop them on the ground and walk away. </p>

<p>During this process, every person that I haven’t killed and got a decent look at me knows that i wore the red shirt and jeans, and maybe even more, such as my bright red hair and freckles. </p>

<p>Basically what I’m saying is it’s not all that surprising that they found him so fast and that it’s not all that crazy of an idea that he would drop his shit off before he decided to walk back home or wherever the hell he was headed.</p>

I edited my comment last night to correct my original statement due to more information being released about the entire arrested and how it unfolded how it did. I guess i just found it weird because with most mass shootings you dont actually see an arrest, you find out that they either killed themselves or got shot by a cop and seeing him just calmly get arrested was just surprising.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a boy who cried wolf situation. This is the least suspect of the countless mass shootings since 2012 (in terms of conspiracy theory), naturally people will compare it to the unexplainable and conflicting events of the last while (Vegas, Sandy Hook). Constant social media documentation of every moment of the lives of people who use those platforms has been going on for a few years but none of the high profile crime cases have had as much go out so quickly. Considering it took place in a high school it isn&#39;t surprising that it was recorded on social media, but that doesn&#39;t excuse people who play the other massacres off as false flags because it wasn&#39;t on video. </p>

<p>People react and over react every time, but it seems we never get a real explanation. Many people passing this off as a &quot;real shooting&quot; since he was taken alive, yet a few years ago those same people claimed the Aurora shooting was a conspiracy yet he was taken alive too and had a curious background. Biggest problem in this community is early reaction and taking lack of clear evidence as evidence of something nefarious, or alternatively confirmation bias based off of some obscure detail. </p>

<p>For the past couple of decades we have glorified war (Iraq/Afghanistan). We have made the military/police to look like &quot;heros&quot; The government has given the narrative that our soldiers need to kill the bad guys to protect us, when in fact it&#39;s just business for the military industrial complex. This is what happens when you glorify war. You make killing ok, insignificant, and in some cases rewarded (like American Sniper) and at some point people are going to &quot;take action&quot; on who they see as the bad guys. </p>

<p>IMO, this is what happens when you’re a shitty ass person and decide to do something life-changingly stupid. I honestly don’t see anyway that we could have stopped a person from doing something like this given how easy it is to do/get anything at all nowadays. It’s a sad fact.</p>

<p><strong>Lyrics</strong></p>

<p>Valentine told me who&#39;s to go</p>

<p>Feelings he treasured most of all</p>

<p>The teachers and the football stars</p>

<p>It&#39;s in his tiny face</p>

<p>It&#39;s in his scrawny hands</p>

<p>Valentine sold his soul</p>

<p>He&#39;s got something to say</p>

<p>It&#39;s Valentine&#39;s day</p>

<p>The rhythm of the crowd</p>

<p>Benny and Judy down</p>

<p>Valentine sees it all</p>

<p>He&#39;s got something to say</p>

<p>It&#39;s Valentine&#39;s day</p>

<p>Valentine told me how he feels</p>

<p>If all the world were under his heels</p>

<p>Or stumbling through the mall</p>

<p>It&#39;s in his tiny face</p>

<p>It&#39;s in his scrawny hands</p>

<p>Valentine knows it all</p>

<p>He&#39;s got something to say</p>

<p>It&#39;s Valentine&#39;s day</p>

<p>Valentine, Valentine</p>

<p>Valentine, Valentine</p>

<p>It&#39;s in his scrawny hands</p>

<p>It&#39;s in his icy heart</p>

<p>It&#39;s happening today</p>

<p>Valentine, Valentine</p>

<p>It&#39;s in his scrawny hands</p>

<p>It&#39;s in his icy heart</p>

<p>It&#39;s happening today</p>

<p>Valentine, Valentine</p>

<p>Earlier it had over a thousand followers and way more following and had the same profile picture as the original suspected account.

I actually filmed this two weeks ago as a part of the proactive self-defense masterclass that will be launched next week, but with this latest crazy school shooting, I just wanted to put it out there. As sad as of a reality as it is, statistically speaking this is going to happen again. I just want to share a couple useful tips about what to do in this situation. 
My deepest condolences to anyone involved. Such crazy times we live in. If you have questions to ask do so and I&#39;ll try to answer as many as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a question. If this was a planned fire drill. Why are there no fire alarms going of in the videos? Or if the shooter pulled the fire alarm to get people out of the classroom... why cant you hear fire alarms in the video. Maybe there is a video where there are fire alarms that are going off that I have not seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except all of your examples happen in almost every major power having or not having guns doesn&#39;t make the situation better or worse. It provides an avenue for rebellion against tyranny if we ever recognize it but it gives bad people the means to do bad things.</p>

<p>Just because you don&#39;t see average joe walk up to the white house with an AR and shoot DT doesn&#39;t mean people sit tight on these things either. Most people I know are prepared to do something if it happens but would realistically like to work things out through dialogue. Most people are relatively over the whole spying thing anyway as they see it as a simple and easy to live with necessity in a first world country and its not like anywhere else is any better. Also as much as I would enjoy pot becoming legal I currently don&#39;t have much sympathy for anyone who gets caught smoking or with weed in possession as it is illegal and the consequences are known.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t miss your point at all. You&#39;re right in that I don&#39;t really want people to have nukes I could go either way on guns because I own them myself and enjoy shooting and hunting. The problem with your argument in both cases however is that you assume that both nukes and or guns could just evaporate overnight and problem solved. Nukes and guns both exist therefore they cannot not exist and we need to be practical and unbiased in our approach to regulating them.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll agree it&#39;s an illusion but that illusion provides a certain peace of mind which again in most peoples minds seems to outweigh the incredibly small risk of ever encountering gun violence in person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not how things work in a civilized society. Anders Breivik killed 80 children and the police didn&#39;t beat the snot out of him. If a suspect is walking into police custody healthy he shouldn&#39;t be going to the hospital 30 minutes later because the cops extracted some impromptu revenge. Violence begets more violence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it had already been found, I was just to lazy to edit my post cause I looked right after I commented. And what are you talking about? You have a gun and everyone is running the away from you so it wouldn&#39;t be hard to ditch it literally anywhere and then keep running towards everyone else. You don&#39;t have to be the head cashier at walmart to figure that out. Oh and nice, get all pissy about me being a smart ass an you turn right around and do the same. Get back to work peasant. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s your answer so take it or leave it. No i don&#39;t fear cars. A car is built with the purpose of transportation. A gun is made to exterminate life, and mame. In the western world, we need cars for transportation. You know what we don&#39;t need? GUNS! 
It&#39;s funny how you mention cognitive dissonance when you sit there literally ignoring every single point being made because, MURICA! There&#39;s no fucking dictator waiting to take your imagined freedom away. You know what there is though? Millions of deranged people on the brink of snapping and killing innocent people. One percent of the population suffers from psychopathy
That means there are likely at least 3+ million psychopaths in America. Psychopaths with easy unlimited access to tools of war. 
Now that I&#39;ve answered your question, honestly answer this one. Why on Earth would any rational peace loving person WANT a semi-automatic weapon? I hope your answer makes it worth the massive casualties they cause every day in America. </p>
