       He likely did not exist, did not and could not perform the experiment attributed to him, which would have had the same result with a flat earth and local sun. It takes for granted that the sun is 93 million miles away, which anyone can see with their own eyes is preposterous.

       They have exposed a lot of other conspiracies and bull shit with NASA, that I appreciate.  Have you ever seen an actual photo of a satellite in orbit or of our planet from space that doesn't look cgi or cartoon?  Have you seen all the fake stuff from the ISS?  Do you really believe we landed on the moon?  Why are NASA shills so quick and belligerent in attacking these?

       yeah i agree a bunch of it bs, and no i really don't believe we have gone to the moon. there's been obviously doctored shit from nasa, but none of that leads me to believe the earth is flat. I don't see the correlation.

       I'm not saying the earth is flat either, I just like to keep an open mind no matter how far fetched a conspiracy may seem.  It's lead me to see a lot of the things they question about NASA.  I was just trying to point out that they don't detract from conspiracies when they add so much to other ones.  (BTW I think the earth is round and hollow)

        but do flat earthers believe that Eratosthenes was some sort of NASA shill from 2,000 years ago? how do they object to that?

      <p>
       With the shadow experiment Eratosthenes had to ASSUME that the Sun was millions of miles away with the rays all hitting parallel in order to make the math work out for a ball earth.  If the Sun were smaller and much closer (like it has been shown and measured to be) then it would also work on a flat plane.  Math can be reverse engineered to fit whatever model you want.  Do you not find it odd that there is no observable, detectable, or measurable curvature of Earth anywhere besides the CGI bs that NASA gives us?

       You obviously are not familiar with the subject at all.  No, even by heliocentric math you wouldn't see curvature from a drone.  Also I can tell you haven't researched the subject because the video you linked is a balloon with a fisheye lens that distorts the horizon.  Did you not find it odd that there was a giant curved horizon when the balloon was about 50-100ft off of the ground 6 seconds into the video?

       Because drones can't fly high enough.  People have sent high altitude balloons 120,000ft and there is no visible curvature.  How high should you have to be to see curvature?

       Because if you claim the earth is a 25,000 mile in circumference ball then that means there is specific spherical trigonometry that you can use to know how much curvature there should be.

       Why do we have uniform gravity across the surface of the Earth?  This shouldn't be the case for a non-uniform object as different places on the surface of the Earth would be different distances from the Earth's center of mass.

       Now this was actually a pretty cool video.  But the big white blob doesn't seem to be in the right location to actually be the Rogers Centre (comparing the skyline pic she shows at the end, also I'm from Toronto).

       Even if that's not the case we would expect some curvature in the light waves bouncing off of the Rogers Centre towards Fort Niagara.  Light curves along with spacetime meaning that it curves when it passes by a gravitationally massive object (the earth).  For reference check out this link:

       You should research into Admiral Byrd.  He is probably the U.S.'s most famous explorer.  In the 1950's he gave an interview where he said there were uncharted and untapped resources in Antarctica larger than the U.S. So that is coming from a famous explorer that has actually been to Antarctica on expansive explorations.  Since the Antarctic treaty like I said we are not allowed to independently explore for ourselves.

       I don't think you know how perspective works.  No matter how high you ascend the horizon always rises to eye level.  If we were on a ball the horizon would start to drop below eye level but it does not.  Also you can not see forever, it is visual perspective.  Just like a long hallway doesn't really get smaller until the ceiling and ground converge, that is just from perspective.

       The treaty you're referring to makes no mention of exploration being banned, go read it for yourself.  Only thing that's banned is military activity:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The area is to be used for peaceful purposes only; military activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited but military personnel and equipment may be used for scientific research or any other peaceful purpose;"

      <p>
       "Article 2 – Freedom of scientific investigations and cooperation shall continue;"
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways why would I have to explore the arctics.  What if I just went due West or East, would I eventually come to the edge of the Earth and fall off?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also as far as we understand it the Universe does not have an edge that we could ever reach.  This could be either due to expansion or because the Universe bends in peculiar ways we don't quite understand yet.  Either way the universe is a very tricky subject that we definitely don't understand.  The Earth is a big rock.  The rock either keeps on going forever or it has an edge (or it's a sphere).

       Not sure I understand the question.  Here's the formula for gravity:
      </p>
      <p>
       "F = (G
       <em>
        M
       </em>
       m)/(r
       <sup>
        2)"
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where G is a constant, M and m are the masses of the objects and r
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       is the distance (or radius) between them (actually between their centers of gravity) squared.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could just as easily remove the G and write that F is proportional to M*m/r
       <sup>
        2.
       </sup>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now since the mass of the earth is so massive compared to every object on the earth (say a bowling ball, a person, a plane) we usually find that M*m doesn't change very much no matter which object we're calculating the force of gravity due to Earth for.  So the only real value that would change the equation is the distance between the two objects centers of mass.  If the earth were a big flat block its center of mass would be in the middle (obviously).  As we moved farther from the middle of the flat earth the radius would increase and thus significantly impact force due to gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       However you can go anywhere in the world and measure either the force due to gravity (by weighing yourself on a scale, you don't weight more in different countries or different parts of the world) or you could measure the acceleration due to gravity for an object in free fall.  Either way you'll find that it always comes out to the same value no matter where you are on Earth.  That's because the Earth is a sphere so the radius between the two object's center of mass is always the same.  This would not be the case in a flat earth, unless you have an alternative explanation and equation for gravity?

      <p>
       Actually gravity pulls the plane downwards because it has mass.  At a constant altitude the plane's engines and aerodynamics create enough lift to counteract the force of gravity and keep the plane flying straight and at a constant height.  Planes actually do constantly "put the nose of the plane down" so that they can maintain that constant cruising altitude.  Go ask any pilot.

       Go look at the stars outside your house, keep track of some constellations.  Now wait 6 months and go look at that same patch of sky, you'll see different starts and different constellations.  These occurs as the Earth orbits around the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also it's tricky to detect the motion of the Earth because everything on the earth (including it's atmosphere) is rotating along with the Earth as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of when you're on a fast moving train.  Throw a ball straight  up into the air and it'll come back down to your hand.  How does that make sense if the train is moving at 100 km/h?  Shouldn't the ball have gone flying to the back of the train once I let it go?  The reason is that everything inside the train is moving at the same speed as the train itself (assuming I'm standing still and not walking forwards or backwards).  Another way we could say this is that relative to the train, I am not moving (again, if im sitting still).  However relative to the trees outside I'm still moving 100 km/h.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when I release the ball from my hand it keeps moving at the 100 km/h it was moving at while I was holding it.  Then assuming the train doesn't slow down or speed up it'll land perfectly back in my hand (because my hand also keeps moving at 100 km/h).

       </a>
       He has a whole series of videos called "balls out physics" where he goes into depth about these subjects and brings up lots of questions from a formal science background.  The bottom line is you have to have a big leap of faith to believe that gravity exists.  The Cavendish experiment has never been repeated and there is no experiment that I have found to show gravity is a real force.  Gravity is the magic fix it all for the heliocentric theory and was invented to try and fill in all of the glaring holes in the theory.

      <p>
       Huh?  What do you want me to ask a pilot?  There is no evidence that the nose of the plane is constantly being put down.  Pilots have confirmed they do not do that and if  "gravity" was doing it you would see it on the gyroscope which does not happen.

       I mean I showed you that there is no observable, measurable curvature.  You were under the impression that you should be able to see earths curvature from a drone.  You were not aware of the spherical triginomerty involved in the ball earth theory that you support. So I did educate you on the fact that is not possible to "fly a drone high enough to see the curvature".  I'm sorry but the very first step should be to prove a spinning ball earth (not prove a flat earth) since that is the status quo.  You have not provided any evidence of curvature or motion of the earth.  You can only parrot theoretical equations just like everyone else that I have this conversation with.

       First you are assuming that things are being "pulled down" and are not just falling due to density and being more dense than the surrounding air.  Also many people (physicist and engineers included) believe we live in an electric universe and "gravity" can be explained by elecromagnetic energy.  Also there is the Aether and many other aspects that to not get proper attention when it comes to this subject.

       It actually is (an attempt at it anyways).  You made the claim earlier that the current theory "explains everything perfectly".  I find that funny because for the current theory of gravity to actually work there has to be 85% "dark matter".  Scientist admit they do not have any idea what dark matter is but it must exists to make the equation work. So 85% of the "perfectly explained" theory is unexplained but has to be put in or the theory falls apart, once again how convenient.

       This is definitely possible.  We don't claim to know what causes gravity, only that we can see its effects all around us.  Personally I think that gravity is due to the bending of spacetime around massive objects (or any object with mass).  A simple visualization would be a bowling ball on a trampoline.  Spin a marble around on the trampoline and it will eventually be pulled towards the bowling ball.

       He wasn't disappointed in the lack of evidence that gravity exists, he was disappointed in the lack of evidence showing how gravity works or could work.  Here's an quote from one of his letters:
      </p>
      <p>
       "It is inconceivable that inanimate Matter should, without the Mediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon, and affect other matter without mutual Contact…That Gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to Matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance thro' a Vacuum, without the Mediation of any thing else, by and through which their Action and Force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an Absurdity that I believe no Man who has in philosophical Matters a competent Faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an Agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this Agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the Consideration of my readers."
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately for Newton he was about 200 years too early for Einstein's theory of relativity, which is how we started to gain some more understanding on how gravity waves propagate through space-time.

      <p>
       To be fair I was talking about the spherical earth theory, not gravity when I said that.  But you're right, "dark matter" is a great example of what you called "reverse engineering the math".  We needed dark matter because there was more gravitational force being exerted than should have been possible based on the estimated observable mass of the universe.  I've even heard the number as higher than 85%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I think that "dark matter" is complete BS.  It's nothing more than the aether theory of our time.  My personal theory is that the universe(s) that exists "before" a certain instance and maybe even the universe(s) that will exist in the future, "after" an instance, will still exert their gravitational energy on our current universe.  Gravitational waves don't care about "time", they care about space-time.  This is just a theory I have from smoking too much weed though haha, no science behind it.

       Good luck because there have already been high altitude balloons (with non fisheye lens cameras) that have been up to 120,000ft and there is no observable curvature.  Also you can go to a beach and watch a ship "go over the horizon" then take a Nikon p900 zoom camera (or a telescope) and bring the ship completely back into view proving it only goes out of visual perspective and not "over the horizon".  There are many experiments that we can do ourselves that prove there is no curvature especially as technology gets better and cheaper.  We don't just have to rely on "authority figures" to tell us what reality is.

       Its also 100 miles up, so you should really look at its angular velocity instead.  5miles/s is very different tracking wise if the thing is a mile in front of you or 100 of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The orbit is predictable too, it doesn't change unless its being boosted.  So all you need is a computer and an electric motor.

       Here's some math---The earths tilt is 23.4 degrees. The most common angle used is 90 degrees (no one should dispute that).        90-23.4=66.6
      </p>
      <p>
       The earth rotates around the sun at 66,000 MPH (link below)

       The way they measure the curvature of the earth is 8 in per mile squared. At 10 miles there is a drop of 66.6 feet and at 100 miles there is a drop of 6,666.6 feet.
      </p>

       He was trying to say that the 90 degree figure is very commonly used and that he finds it "convenient" that the Earth is titled by 23.4, given that if you subtract it from 90, it equals 66.6.

       I get that, but it's still really arbitrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       90* is a nice, clean angle - but there's nothing special about it. Let's not forget that 360* is a human construct in itself. I'd imagine that existed long before the tilt of the earth was observed

       If I round the curvature up to 1000 cubits per hectacre, it measures 615 degrees per light year, which in fact is the area code of Young Buck, the demonstrated round Earth grand Mason.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you take away the rounding, it all falls apart, as does the 8 inches per mile rule. Not like the ancient Jews used English measurements anyway.

       The Flat Earth Society is absolutely a controlled opposition group designed to be abundantly available when people search the Internet for flat earth. Anyone here who is a flat earth person, I would wager, disagrees with that organization and would agree that they are intended to discredit Flat Earth Theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is different from saying Flat Earth is a psy-op to discredit conspiracy theorists, which doesn't really make sense. Why would there be a psy-op within a psy-op? The Flat Earth Society believes that earth rises at the rate of gravitational acceleration and that you can fall off the edge and all this other nonsense.
      </p>

       Think about this: if the moon landings were fake, and they were, that means the first photo of a ball earth was taken c. 1971 --
       <em>
        and it was fake.
       </em>
       This is why the next step after you realize NASA is full of shit is to question the description of our world and its location.

       The Flat Earth society isn’t controlled opposition, it’s literally a group of trolls. The most well known flat earth site (referred to as the Flat Earth society) was known to be a troll group at it’s inception a while back and only recently new Flat earthers (likely inspired by Dubay) have flocked to it and in ignorance taken it as a serious source.

       Nasa also destroyed all of the moon landing footage “accidentally”. We no longer have the technology to go back to the moon because “we lost it”. Also there is now a radiation belt around earth that prevents people from leaving the earth yet it wasn’t a problem back then. Now given the above information why would you even trust these people?

      <p>
       It doesn't prevent people from going through it, only from staying in that specific belt.  Going to the moon you passed through the belt fairly quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It effects electronics as well.  For example: The recent SpaceX launch included a 6 hour delay until the burn to some kind of solar orbit because that is the time it took to pass through that belt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The belt wasn't really that well known in Apollo era either, we hadn't been actually flying satellites or people that long.  It just wasn't studied.  Its like how Voyager has "left" the solar system several times, because each new area discovered is later understood to be a new region of solar/galaxy wind interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       We didn't lose the technology, the people designed the engines for the Saturn V died because of old age.  We used the Shuttle instead for decades, which used different engines and technology.  Over time you just kind of lose knowledge if you don't use it.  It gets shoved into an old warehouse or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even SLS, which kind of looks like Saturn V, has more in common with the shuttle.  Its using the Shuttle engines and solid rocket boosters instead.  Why would we use tech from the 60s anyways?

       Because that random youtube video has Don Pettit speaking in it and I’m pretty sure he’s qualified enough to speak for nasa. Are you biased towards “random youtube videos”? Im only using his words are you saying that is not Don Pettit or did you not even watch the video? Also a “normal” car should not be able to survive in the vacuums of space with no atmosphere which is why everything nasa sends to space is made specifically for that. Using materials ranging from gold, to titanium. The fact that people actually believe this shit is laughable.

       I agree i tried to find the raw clips but I’m lazy. The video itself is still from nasa a the quote maintains its meaning. You can do a bit of research yourself you know. If you think it could mean anything other than what he said then I’m open to your interpretation. Also the car would not survive space’s 455 degree temperature or its -300 degree temperature so the vacuum is the least of the cars worries.

       I did, that's why I explained why we don't have the technology to go to the moon right now.  We abandoned it in favor of using the shuttle.  In fact, the story of the shuttle has a lot more it than that.  Its technically called the Space Transport System, and originally the plans included a tug and a NERVA based interplanetary craft as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       But funding for space activities crashed as public interest was lost and we ended up with just the shuttle and no funded means of moving people beyond LEO.

       A vacuum doesn't have a temperature.  Temperature is the measurement of the heat of physical matter.  The metal and plastics of the Tesla car can more than survive the few hours it was recorded for under the conditions that would be present for it in LEO.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about plastic and metal do you think cannot survive the heating from the radiation of the sun?  Do think the materials in satellites or the ISS are really that dramatically different?  The radiation of the sun would have only gradually heated the car.  And I am sure the metals of the car can survive that temperature fluctuation too, at the very least for a few hours.

       Why aren't Russia or China or any technologically capable adversary using their resources to prove this? It would totally embarrass the US, yet they never even make the accusation.
      </p>
      <p>
       FWIW I'm not sure if the original landing/footage is real, but I'm more interested in the theory that there have been tons of secret trips there and multiple moon bases by the US and China. That way it is in all party's interest to keep the secret.

       You're making some serious leaps in your logic. So, just because the moon landings were almost certainly faked, that means that the Earth being round
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be fake too?

       I agree. I questioned it, researched heavily for myself, and came to the conclusion that it is indeed spherical. Just like all the other observable planets. Turns out physics works the same regardless of locality or scale.

       If you believe humans have never gone into space or landed on the moon (or believe we did but with alien technology that was destroyed) then you're about as close to a flat-earther as you can get.

       Exactly. There is def some good points regarding stuff NASA puts out or oddities on the map, but now if you try to point it out it is instantly dismissed as flat earth stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people had focused on stuff that was wrong instead of make the claim of flat earth then more would prob have taken it seriously. Lots of stuff you can point at, like the older footage obviously fake, geographic patterns on map repeating around world or in weather or surface of other planets, africa having very similar shape as Australia, venus giving off its own light, other astrological observations... the "electric universe theory" actually makes a lot of sense and found that from looking into flat earth so maybe that will get more traction. I think the "expanding earth" theory sounds interesting too.

       I was saying this back in the mid 2000s when all the reptile, shape-shifting BS starting mixing with all the government conspiracies that were being confirmed as true. It's disinformation campaigns to discredit legitimate facts being leaked that get refereed to as conspiracies.

       Yes, just like the term 'conspiracy theory' was weaponized after the JFK assassination, to the point that when you say 'conspiracy theory' the first image that pops into most people's heads is some crazy dude in a tin foil hat.

       You might be correct. Eric Dubay came out of nowhere and was automatically vaulted to the top of all youtube searches. Plus, the guy has a checkered past and definitely has some high government connections. Either people really fell in love with his ideas and he got popular organically, or he was placed there by someone higher up.

       No, the earth really is measurably flat and motionless. The earth is flat, and obviously flat. It’s blowing up because everyone to honestly look into it becomes a flat earther.

       Totally man. Where is the proof its a ball??? If it was there should be a mountain ofl evidence but really the only proof we have is everybody believes it and they tell us it is. I find it funny too because people become angry, name call and character bash instead of providing evidence. Ive been on the flat earth wagon for a year now and havnt seen a shread of evidence to change my mind. Nothing to do with being a shill or psy op. To the contrary actually. Flat earthers on here speak up and spread the truth. Those who are also truth seekers will come to the light.

       Umm, buy a telescope and look for yourself that planets are balls? Now show me some evidence that we live in a dome that you don't even know what it is, whats outside of it, or anything about it for that matter... good luck.

       Looks like a circle to me, i wouldn't expect it to have a spherical shadow since it emits light.
      </p>
      <p>
       But dude, thats not even what i asked about.
       <em>
        Planets
       </em>
       are obviously spherical and anyone can buy a telescope and see that but if you say that isn't evidence that planets are spheres then there is no penetrating your thick skull.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, you haven't given
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       information at all on this supposed dome but yet somehow the "evidence" suggests we live in a dome? This is rediculous.

       I, like many others heard “flat earth” and we did what?...we automatically thought to ourselves “that’s the stupidest shit I’ve ever heard...I’ll believe a lot of shit, but I have to draw the line somewhere!” Well, that’s what I thought to myself at least. And like so many conspiracies, once you take the red pill, start questioning things with an open mind, that rabbit hole gets deep, and it gets deep fast.

       I find it funny how you say that so matter-of-factly. Like you are so smart and know it all and everyone who disagrees with you is ridiculous. People have been brainwashed to think everything to do with faith is just fairy tales, to the point that it makes people like you so angry they have to curse while trying to dispute it.

       Oh lawd the anti flat earth narrative continues in this subreddit. How does this stuff keep getting coverage? I see many more anti flat earth posts than I ever see of flat earth posts. It's clear there's a concerted effort to quell the movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The earth is not a globe. ((NASA)) and ((SpaceX)) are part of the deception. There seems to be more anti conspiracy people in this subreddit than conspiracy realists like myself - that is very telling in itself.

       Perfectly said. It is absoulutely amazing how many supposed believers in conspiracies actually don't believe in them judging by post history and jump on the sub to ridicule and scream LIAR over and over as if it somehow makes them right and us wrong.

       I live in Nanaimo BC, on Vancouver Island. On a clear day from a beach here you can see Mt. Baker located some 250 km away in washington DC. According to the curvature of the earth it should be 32 km below the horizon. Nothing should be visible yet I can see almost the whole mountain. Im not the only one seeing beyond the supposed curviture.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a hardcore conspiracy theorist and was the first one to look into the flat earth nonsense. But once you start digging you end up realisingg that something is up.  Lets not bash and name call because we think it is stupid. Explain to me why I can see 32km below the curvature?

       The fact that there are so many here quick to judge and hurl insults at anyone who questions the spherical Earth leads me to believe there really is some truth to it. Why try so hard to discredit and ridicule anyone who questions the mainstream narrative? We all believe in conspiracies to some extent otherwise we wouldn't be here. Why the vitriol? It almost seems like a form of censorship where they gang up and use insults to keep people who question quiet.

       Yes...I’ve scrolled down and down....not one flat earther responded that I saw...appears it’s working. I’ve researched about every conspiracy under the sun over the past 10 years, and I’m amazed at what I’ve found, most of which I could never fathom. I don’t think we are doing our job as “conspiracy theorists” if we don’t at least do our due diligence on a given topic and keep our minds open to EVERY possibility. There are far too many contradictions on flat earth to not at least weigh all evidence and make an objective conclusion.  Ok commence down votes.  Just remember kids, there was a time when anyone that mentioned 911 being an inside job was looked at with hatred and scorn.

       Not a math guy myself but here is a book devoted to using math to prove the flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the description on Amazon.com:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Spherical Trigonometry is the study of curved triangles, triangles drawn on the surface of a sphere. The subject is practical, for example, because we don't live on a sphere. The subject has numerous elegant and unexpected theorems. I give a few below. For starters... To find the curvature of the earth... You must use Stanford’s 8 Inches per Mile Squared. Using the theorem of Pythagoras a2 this number above the a means squared and has been challenged by people who do not know how to square a number. This books debunks the spinning globe theory using everyday Spherical Trigonometry."
       <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Spherical-Trigonometry-Dummies-Proving-Earth/dp/1514638800">
        https://www.amazon.com/Spherical-Trigonometry-Dummies-Proving-Earth/dp/1514638800
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Math can be manipulated to prove/disprove numerous things so it is not the end all, be all of evidence for proof of anything, especially when it comes to outer space which uses many assumptions to create the numbers used in the equations. This video explains it better than I ever could.

       I never said I believe the other guys math. I said math can be used by anyone to try to prove their position. There is math that can prove flat earth just as there is for spherical earth so it is not definitive proof one way or the other.

       I've heard some stupid shit like NASA is profiting off spreading this lie. Yes, every NASA employee is living in a mansion throwing bank rolls at hoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're right for one though. I do have an agenda. Promoting science and hard work. There is no money in astronomy or astrophysics unless you become a pop science guy narrating documentaries and giving lectures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science is a labor of love for most academics and researchers. It makes me mad - maybe unreasonably so - that these anti-science cults denounce the hard work of polymaths, philosophers, researchers over the millennia with half assed theories. The worst part is that it catches on with the younger generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, it's the same reason I get mad at the federal ban of many beneficial schedule A drugs. It's the same reason I get mad at doctors who look at you differently when you tell them you partake in alternative medicine and homeopathic treatment.

       I agree with you on many points of the pharmaceutical and medical industry but we disagree on the use of math/science. While both are extremely valuable, they are easy to manipulate by TPTB to serve the purpose of misleading the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for NASA employees, I doubt they are all in on it but I have no way of knowing. My guess is information is compartmentalized just as it is done in the military so that people only know a small section without being able to see the bigger picture.

       Apparently Mount Everest's summit can be seen from as far as 336 km away. The formula d = 3.57 &amp;root;h where h is your elevation allows you to calculate how far you can see
       <em>
        without factoring in atmospheric refraction
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Washington, DC is on the other side of the U.S. entirely. You mean Washington state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Searching for the distance from Nanaimo, BC to Mount Baker I found 218 km, not 250 km. The mountain's elevation is about 3300 m. Using the above formula, one should be able to see about 205 km from the summit of Baker. However (and this is very important), this number is the distance without atmospheric refraction, which adds about 8% depending on temperature, air pressure, etc. making the actual distance more like 221 km. So, depending on conditions between Nanaimo and Mount Baker at any giving time, its visibility is not surprising, and
       <em>
        certainly
       </em>
       not evidence that the Earth is flat.

       I forget where I heard it but I want to say the source was Joe Rogan who said Flat Earth was actually started as a joke on 4chan and then wackos ran with it and now we’re at a point where we don’t know if ppl seriously believe it’s flat or just trolling. Can anyone else confirm or debunk?

       People that actual use critical thinkng do not follow the flat earth society or people like Mark Sargent. The psyop isn't that they're using these groups to discredit all conspiracies, it's that they are using them to discredit the flat earth theory.

       As a truth seeker and a flat earther, well I don’t know it’s flat 100%. but I do know it’s not as round as they say. NASA is full of shit and have lied. I get what your saying. But as always I stand by what the evidence leads me to. We have been lied to about where we live. I’m sorry if you feel it discredits you. But I 100% believe it.

       I think a person is in danger of seeing the world through a warped lens when they open their mind to conspiracy theories, because once we learn the world has lied to us about one thing, it opens the door to believing most anything. I think you'll be lucky to find a flat earther who doesn't believe a bunch of other conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've only seen one flat earther interviewed and it was a buddy of Joe Rogan's on his podcast. Guy seemed totally genuine to me. Seemed to believe a host of other conspiracy theories though. Seemed warped as fuck in fact.

       People have been talking about a flat earth for 1000s of years. Plus it involves the earth and that affects umm the entire population it isn't OKC JFK or 911 its the whole earh. If you have no idea why it is so popular you're a idiot. This will trump all other conspiracies forever until it is debunked people are seeking the TRUTH. And should be encouraged by all to be thinker.s The fact that this is even a thread in this Sub is amazing and makes me question the authenticity of this entire Sub.

       This is one of their standard tricks. They strive to artificially create a continuum from the most clear examples of conspiracy like the bankers' plot, to the craziest stuff, like lizard people living inside a hollow earth, and link them all together so they are all discredited.

       Well I just got back from my haircut and my hair stylist was very much a flat earther and called herself that. On one hand it’s nice to see people question the world around them and think for themselves. On the other hand it’s dangerous when these people don’t take evidence as an answer.

       yeah I'm not saying that all flat-earthers are knowingly shills. I'm just saying, the first flat earthers on the internet were probably shills, and then somehow people actually started believing it.

       Yes, it seems that way as I have never met a single irl. But
      </p>
      <p>
       Also what it flat earther movement is there ro teach the public about critical thought. An easy to disprove theory that at its core has one fundumental issue, a fact that only a few people have verified for themselfs irl with their own eyes. So an a level its the perfect theory to make people look at evidence and assess its legotomacy. Or a perfect way to make people complacent with the evidence they are given and to comdition them to disregard all conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       And seeing how propoganda works I am inclined to believe the latter.

       I think that Flat-Earth theory was a joke created by the skeptical community. I think it's hilarious that people actually believe it.

       This also explains why Alex Jones created his on air character/persona. This became painstakingly clear once Trump was elected. All those years of anti-government, power to the people, small government “libertarian” YELLING, to now, where he just gets on air everyday to ballwash a sitting president, with undying love and adoration, and tries to justify it with the occasional “I never said he was perfect, but.....”. You see these operations so frequently nowadays, and they are gaining more and more traction, and becoming a lot more mainstream. Disgraceful

       Flat-earth is an interesting idea but there is just too many things that derail it. Same with a hollow earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if a flat-earther is willing to answer I have a question.

       What is heating the water from the deep water wells? Yes I have been near a few and the water from some of them was really bloody hot.

       Im going to say no and heres why. Flat earth is probably the grandest of all conspiracies or at least up there with the big boys. It undermines everything underpinning our lives and belief systems. If true literally everything would come crashing down.  Now we are bombarded with evidence of the heliocentric model, convincing and (if indeed untrue in part or in its entirey) well constructed. Apart from a small online presence on the fringes of the conspiracy community Flat Earth carries no weight, unlike global warming denial and antivax Flat Earth has no effect on government policy nor does it hold sway in any educational circles. On the surface it would
       <em>
        appear
       </em>
       that Flat Earth is a belief system on par with the existence of unicorns or purple dragons on Venus - it is completely benign.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this leads me to question just why there is such a concerted effort on behalf of flat earth debunkers especially with such vitriolic fervour. What lead me to start to question the standard accepted model on the earth and universe was flat earth. Thats not to say I believe in a flat earth per se, but the idea of even considering such a  polarising point of view gets you to start to question, it gets you challenging the little things and challenging the innate cognative disonance ingrained in us. I'm not saying I want to be spoon fed by Eric Dubay but nor am I willing to accept a false dichotemy and ignore what I perceive as issues with things like Nasa footage - I'm talking about the back combed hair, signs of people on wires, blue screens, the lack on non-composite images of the Earth, lackof significant stellar parallax, lack of visable curvature at high altitudes with non-fisheye lenses and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes I do see value in Flat Earth theory either as a thought experiment, a means to challenge embeded viewpoints or even just as an interesting but benign point of view to consider.
