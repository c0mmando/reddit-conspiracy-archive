       <p>
        Some 90 percent of school shootings over more than a decade have been linked to a widely prescribed type of antidepressant called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs, according to British psychiatrist Dr. David Healy, a founder of RxISK.org, an independent website for researching and reporting on prescription drugs.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Fact: At least 36 school shootings and/or school-related acts of violence have been committed by those taking or withdrawing from psychiatric drugs resulting in 172 wounded and 80 killed (in other school shootings, information about their drug use was never made public—neither confirming or refuting if they were under the influence of prescribed drugs).  The most important fact about this list, is that these are only cases where the information about their psychiatric drug use was made public.

       I bet the Florida School shooter was also on these pills, but you won't see this ever mentioned because the Conspiracy is to keep America Drugged for profit

       An assumption could be made that the demographic breakdown only covers the medicated, therefore it appears to be the factor in causality. There is no equal numerical representation for the non-medicated yet diagnosed mentally ill. If there were, one could make the case that the data did not point towards medication as causation.

       (Echoing another user) And why are school shoots so frequent in the US compared to other countries, when SSRIs are used all over the world? How can SSRIs be the primary factor when we do not see the same spikes in other countries?
      </p>
      <p>
       My opinion? Maybe it's more of a cultural problem.

       It absolutely is. The number one thing you need to concern yourself with is population density where the attack goes down. Someone in a crowded square, 6 months of working out, and a sharp blade is going to seriously fuck a lot of people up. A mall would be better than a square though because people would be slowed down fleeing. Theres a million factors that go into it, but a blade is just as deadly.

       No, it's because it's just as easy to get a gun. If you go to a place where it is more difficult to get a gun, like, say, England, you find a lot more assaults with knives.

       People are going to go on killing each other for whatever reasons exist in the current social culture. Whether it be terrorism, government sponsored terrorism, mental health issues, racism, or any of the million odd personal reasons somebody thinks that it's okay to take other's lives. They are simply going to find the best tool they can for the job. I work with a knife in a kitchen and I can absolutely guarantee you I could kill a man with just as little effort with that knife as I could with my gun. The
       <strong>
        ONLY
       </strong>
       difference would be in how close I needed to be to do it.

       That's just not true at all. It is undoubtedly easier to get your hands on a knife than a gun. I'm not sure what argument you're trying to make, but you're not doing a good job.

       Come on guy.  When you are shooting people you can just stand a safe distance and spray.  When you go in for a knife attack you better not miss that moving target or else that mofo is fighting for his life and can get you off balanced and other people can jump in.  You don't have to get that close to people with a gun and it allows you to survive longer.  When you walk into a room you can just sit there and shoot everyone from a safe distance.  If you start going into the mayhem and stabbing people you leave yourself vulnerable.  I mean honestly would you rather be facing down a guy with a knife or an automatic weapon.  I pick knife and start throwing desks and chairs at him.

       I'm not arguing that guns are not the better option. I'm simply making a strong case for why blades are actually dangerous as fuck. I work with one every single day, I'm quite familiar with how dangerous they are.

       No, I wouldn't. Knives are sharp. And yes, I know dull knives can be even more dangerous. You working with knives doesn't give you some kind of insider knowledge of a tool that's been around for thousands of years.

       Also stabbing someone to death is so much more personal as opposed to shooting someone , this one never held up to me because it's a lot easier to get over killing someone if all you do is press a trigger, not stab a human being till their life drains from their body

       It always amazes me that people fail to make this connection. They debate endlessly between mental health and stricter laws. “Why the false flag? It must be totalitarianism!” Maybe the goal is to have an overwhelmingly armed populace that would be impossible to take over by an invading force. Just a guess ;)

       True, in the rural south there is a culture of kids having access as young as 11-12. I like that kids are trained on gun safety, but emotional teenagers having access is a mistake for evryone.

       I agree with this. I would teach my kid so they understand EXACTLY how a gun was dangerous, and what never to do to it. And then it would be secured behind a few inches of solid steel and they would not get the combo.

       A few inches of solid steel is going to be one hell of a safe.

      <p>
       A "safe" made out of sheet metal that I could open with a hammer was like 200lb, I can only imagine the cost of a few inches.

       I was and hung out with other emotional teenagers (aren't they all) that had access to guns from a young age. No one I know ever shot up a school or anyone else. It's parenting or lack thereof that's the biggest contributer I think.

       Definitely a mixture of the mental illness and their environment. Most of the school shooters were bullied heavily in school which probably causes their mental illness, add in parents who don’t check on their kids/poor discipline and you’ve got the perfect school shooter.

       i was thinking exactly this earlier. im fine with people owning guns, but i think itshould be socially unacceptable for people to have easily accesible guns with kids under 18 in your home. the parents definitely bear some responsibility here.  id love to see a study on avg ages of mass shooters, because a kid shooting up a school seems 100× more common than some guy shooting up hos workplace.

       As someone from the south who grew up shooting guns well before the age of 11 or 12, i cant think of anyone who was raised like me who ever did something stupid with a gun. I had a lot more respect for guns than other kids who were never around them; they were always the ones acting a fool, waving and pointing them around. Unloaded or not, thats a way to get your ass kicked.

       That's a bit like saying, "how many drunk driving incidents are caused by irresponsible drivers?" All of them (there are trivial numbers of truly exceptional cases, such as someone discovering the hard way that they have a genetic condition that renders them drunk on very little alcohol). But what is that an argument for? Not creating strong rules and liability around the sales of alcohol and access to vehicles while impaired?

       Isn't there still adolescent violence and severe bullying in korea though? People still get hurt. And if they had access to guns they would probably also commit many school shootings. Which strengthens the point that it's the culture that causes children to be violent. We need to raise our children better. The Netherlands, for example, or Poland, doesn't have the same school culture as here or Korea, and they don't have the same level of suicide and destructive action among students as here or Korea.

       Yeah but if you already have a big problem about your culture and education then wouldn't you agree it's best to restrict gun ownership? It's logical to minimize the dangers if the situation is mostly out of control. You don't change a culture in a few years.

       While we definitely need to raise our children better, in evaluating school shootings, some people strain to look for causes, when if you just look at other countries you can see:
The biggest factor in the answer of "Does country X have school shootings" is whether or not its easy for an ordinary person to get a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       To blame school shootings on SSRI overuse, or mental health issues, or bad culture, or anything else is missing the forest for the trees. Take away easy access to guns (as Australia did, many years ago) and school shootings magically disappear. It's common sense.

       Are you really going to compare Korean culture to the US because they are pushed to the limit? Come on now. The US doesn't have the highest number of school shootings because of a race to the top but a race to the bottom. There is no comparison between the two, any part of US society compared to other modern countries is a complete clusterfuck because the US has allowed to let money rule every part of their existence to the point that it's legalized corruption. The net result is that corporations have their talons on everything and as a result everything favours profit instead of the benefit of the people. I think very few Americans have any idea how bad the situation is because they've grown up with it.
      </p>

       People can get guns all over the world if they want to shoot someone, the idea that people don't shoot others because they can't get to them is as incorrect as saying people wont do drugs if you apply enough repressive measures, it's all about mentality. That last step of getting a gun sure is easier in the US, but it's a minor detail, if people were that desperate to hurt those around them, they would have school stabbings in Korea.

       Killing with a knife and killing with a gun are very different actions. This  killer had a passion for both knives and guns, judging by his Instagram photos. Can you guess why he chose to kill with a gun and not a knife? Could it be that it's psychologically and physically easier? Hmm..

       Have you been to any other countries? I have lived in 4 countries, including the US and Korea. It's impossible to get a gun in South Korea.

       A few years back, a solider got drunk and took a single gun off a military base somewhere. It was interrupting, national news until that single gun was found.

       That's not the point, the point is that even if they would be able to get one, it wouldn't automatically lead to situations like the US. Korea might be an exception when it comes to being able to get a gun, but school shootings seem to be a cultural phenomenon reserved for the US, so it obviously isn't simply because they have guns coming out the wazoo.

       Lol OK, arguing the problem with guns in the US doesn't involve the ease of access to guns? Argue its more about culture if you want but flat out denying access is part of it is what got your country to this point.

       Don't equate "the problem involves ease of access to guns"
to "having a gun makes you a murderer"
If you're not an idiot you know damn well that's not the point being made. People being able to get guns really easily is how the people that
       <em>
        shouldn't
       </em>
       have them can plan mass murders. Americans are so helplessly obsessed you can't even just keep it to slow-firing handguns. 
That reaction of "well
       <em>
        I'm
       </em>
       not a mass murderer, so access to guns isn't the problem" just shows how little you've thought about the problem. Other people are. There will always be people fucked in the head and if you make it easy for them to get an automatic assault rifle they're going to use them. 
You're right about the culture being a huge problem, but part of that culture is that people want easy access to tools meant for killing many people, and any logic that points out the problems with that is met with hostility and fear. the NRA is a goddamn Cult.

       Gun aspect is not irrelevant. The tiny bump on the difficulty in obtaining a firearm makes a substantial difference. Small obstacles, that do not prevent normal gun owners, help to filter out cases that have no time, patience or trust to go trough formal channels. This makes them to choose another (most of the time) less deadly tools.

       This again filters people. You need more money and connections to get illegal guns. You need to find some one that has proper weapons and is willing to take a risk of selling to you. There is added risk with the possibility of sting operations or seller just jacking your money. Again reducing the odds of a mass shooting.

       This is a single data point. Let’s say psychiatric drugs do cause violent tendencies. So in the US guns are aplenty so guns are used.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Australia and Iceland the gun ownerships is extremely low. So when one gets violent tendencies... they obviously can’t go shooting people.
      </p>
      <p>
       So by comparing gun violence between countries with entirely different gun cultures you add in an irrational and incomparable data point.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had two countries with virtually identical gun ownership rates and laws. Then you could compare drug usage rates and see any difference.

       You're just lying. Literally this has never been documented. I'm gonna go with what pro athletes around the world know.
      </p>
      <p>
       They eat super high calorie/high protein because they burn 7000 calories per day. It's simple math. Changing your metabolism/hormones, etc. changes how much each person burns per day, by the order of hundreds.
      </p>
      <p>
       To burn 5000 calories per day without exercise you'd have to be running at a temperature of probably 105.

       No. Everything I said is in fact accurate. Correlation doesn’t equal causation. But that doesn’t mean a correlation isn’t a causation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s simply means on its own it is not a causation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I’m not going to take it down a notch because there are 65 comments from people on this thread saying this exact same correlation causation comment with zero other data or information given.

      <p>
       This is not a spurious comparison in the example of this thread. Most drugs like this have a blackbox warning saying they can cause violent thoughts or behaviors. So when there is a statistic that a high percentage of them are the shooters, or rather a high percentage of shooters are on them... that is not a spurious correlation. It is data.

       Based on my research, these dangerous class of pharmaceuticals should be avoided not pushed.  We are in the midst of a great human experimentation, with eerie similarities to Eugenics (Serotonin reuptake inhibitors even mess with the sex drive.  I wouldnt be surprised if this is channeled towards violence in those prone to it)

       It’s not a stretch. SSRIs have warnings that say they cause violent thoughts and behaviors or can.
      </p>
      <p>
       We already have black box warnings in the USA that these drugs cause violent behavior. Now a stat shows most shooters are on these drugs that are proven and have warnings of causing violent behavior...

       It is plain ignorance, and I don’t know why you are so opposed to looking at that possibility.

       It’s very hard to find details in every case because many of the records are sealed due to being minors.

      <p>
       The most famous of mass shooters were all medicated. Easy to find that.

       Here’s some more data (biased source but sort through the opinion for the info and it is compelling).

       The key is that 90% of the records released show them being medicated.

Dude says "weapon access and culture" lead to the attacks, you say "lol no look at this data, it's SSRIs" and then later say Australia doesn't have this problem because they don't have weapon access.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, you too think weapon access plays a role in school shootings, why laugh at the guy for saying the same thing?  Is it because you don't think culture plays a part at all?  That seems like a pretty dubious claim.  Why doesn't Canada, for example, have a higher rate of school shootings?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm absolutely not for gun control, I just think you're trying to reduce a complex issue into something misleadingly simple.  Why shouldn't I think American culture plays a part in the equation?

       there are plenty of other countries where citizens have access to guns (including a few where citizens HAVE to own guns by law...) and they don't see shootings like we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Culture is definitely the problem, among other things probably.

       in Switzerland there is compulsory military service, during which a conscript MUST store their weapon inside their home when not in use. Private citizens can also buy rifles and whatnot, just like in the US, except they have an interesting permit system

      <p>
       Thats quite a big difference
      </p>
      <p>
       First off all, military service isn't compulsatory for women, while they make up 50% of our citizens.
Secondly one third of the male population is unfit for service and therefore does not get a gun.
Then, even when you're in the army, you can still do a so called 'weaponless' service and are not forced to have a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also never own the gun during your military service, it's just in your possession. (You can actually buy it at the end, but it will be refitted to semi-automatic and you need a permit)
      </p>
      <p>
       Noone is forced to keep the gun at home either, you can give it to the armory if you don't want it at home.
You also don't get any ammo anymore unless you'rd in a special unit.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, the swiss arms law are much stricter than in america, the recent shooting in Florida for example would have been extremely hard to do in Switzerland. You need a permit to buy a gun, selling a gun needs to be reported, having gun stolen needs to be reported and will get you in legal trouble.

       That explains the homicide rate (like gang shootings that account for most urban homicides) but these school shootings are not really explained by culture imo. The shooters are almost always very strange social outcasts. Access to weapons is definitely a factor.

       So kids have had unfettered access to AR15s for 150 years? America has an unhealthy obsession with firearms. It's a gun problem, a culture problem, an access to gun problem, a parenting problem. Both parents working 40 hours a week, with no real chance to raise the child plays a part along with everything else.

       Unfortunately that legislation is no longer in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the kids getting guns... Parents should have firearms locked up. Gun and ammo in two different places.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the parents, the owners of the weapons should be punished as well, as the responsible party for the weapon itself?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think giving gun owners legal responsibilities for how their mishandling of firearms would help? Knowledge that they could be charged with... Hmmm. Manslaughter? Contribution to a firearm crime? Liability lawsuits? May help keep their weapons properly locked up, to prevent deaths caused by third party users of their firearms...

       It is illegal, in my state at least (MN), to have your guys easily accessible to children. So yes there usually are legal responsibilities in place for gun owner. I don't think people realize there already are a large number of laws in place for legal and responsible gun ownership.

       Child Endangerment; Access
to Firearms
(Gross Misdemeanor)
It is a gross misdemeanor to intentionally or recklessly cause
a child under the age of 14 to be placed in a situation likely
to substantially harm the child’s physical health or cause the
child’s death as a result of the child’s access to a loaded
firearm. It is also a gross misdemeanor to negligently store
or leave a loaded firearm in a location where the person
knows or should know that a child under the age of 18 is
likely to gain access, unless reasonable steps are taken to
secure the firearm against access by the child.

       the best way to do that (if we’re arguing about people taking psych meds) is making it illegal for ppl taking psych meds to buy guns. but even if you do that (which is something that i agree should be implemented) there’s also the black market. banning guns for psych med users could deter mass shootings but it’s not possible to prevent them all. if said person can’t get them legally they can try getting em off the street. conversely you can argue that said person might not have the resources or connections to get a gun which is a good argument, but you can kill in other ways; the headlines merely change based on the tool the person uses. you could argue that said person won’t commit the crime cause it’s easier to be apprehended when you’re running around stabbing ppl as opposed to being protected with a gun but most school shooters wind up killing themselves in the end so their personal safety isn’t really a priority

       Do you really think it's a wise idea to restrict the constitutional rights of an individual not based on what they've done, but because of the actions of a minority group(the small % of people who commit mass shootings) they and others share traits with?

       i don’t really like the idea of taking away people’s rights but most school shootings have been committed from people that were taking psych meds so it seems there’s a little bit of a correlation. as an aside i also listed the weaknesses of this hypothetical legislation (black market, resorting to alternative killing methods etc) so it could have no effect at all
      </p>
      <p>
       but if it has even a .0000000001% chance to prevent something like this from happening then i do think it’s wise. “constitutional rights” are all subjective based on the country you live in. look at japan, citizens aren’t allowed to own guns at all and they’re doing alright. they also have the 2nd lowest gun violence rate % in the world. im not saying that’s because solely bc of the ban on guns, imo it’s more of a cultural thing plus they only have a third of the population we have. they also have an alarmingly high suicide rate compared to the US so they have their own problems but im getting off track here. i’m also a person who would be banned in this hypothetical scenario since i take psych meds plus i actually like guns (i go to the shooting range every now and then)

       But why stop with just guns? If we are willing to take away someone's constitutional rights to mitigate a very small risk(since most people who take these drugs do not go on shootings, and most people who own guns do not use them in crimes) why not take away other people privileges that are not protected as rights if there is even a small risk of them harming themselves or others? Why you we allow people who drink to drive at all?  After all, it's only a matter of time before some among them get behind the wheel drunk. The problem with this kind of logic is it's very easy to start hacking away at peoples rights, freedoms, and privileges when they have done nothing wrong, just because there is a small risk they might abuse those things. If the mentally ill can't own guns, then why should they be able to have children, drive cars, or have free speech either? There's a risk in each of those things that other people will be harmed.

       It's nice if your intentions are to make sacrifices to help others, even if I do think you are misguided in how to do that.

        now that i think about it, you could just implement a system of requiring a license to own a gun, plus verifying mental health status, taking gun safety courses, having to pass exams on gun safety etc and that could potentially deter someone bc of all the hoops they’d have to jump through, this way rights could still be preserved, but as i said earlier if it’s not a gun they could use a knife. it’s all speculation. im just trying to remain as objective as possible

       The fact is the vast majority of gun owners do not commit crimes with guns, and the vast majority of guns are not used in crimes. From what I understand, most gun crimes are committed by people who acquired a firearm illegally, or even that the firearm was stolen. These ideas have been proposed before by people who have done very little research into gun crimes (no offense) and every time people have to tell them those ideas are going to do very little except inconvenience people who will never commit crimes with their guns. I also don't think your rights are being preserved if you put up a tremendous amount of hoops that someone must go through to use those rights. That's an easy way to make someone apathetic about the rights they have, by making it such a hassle to use them you ensure people will not go through the effort of using them at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we want to prevent shootings, it's much better to focus on the problems in society that cause shootings, such as socioeconomic status, and helping the mentally ill get treatment beyond medication. That's going to prevent more shootings than taking away people's rights.

       i’m aware most gun owners do not commit crimes. keep in mind the scenario i posed only affects those taking psych meds, not everyone. only around 10% of ppl in the US actively take psych meds so it’d be a very small minority of people. and in this scenario i’m not outright banning them, just putting on restrictions where there’s been a common correlation
      </p>
      <p>
       it only makes sense that someone’s mental aptitude be tested and confirmed before gaining ownership if they are currently taking psych meds because there IS a correlation, especially in the US, where the perpetrators of school shootings usually suffer from some sort of mental illness requiring psych medication. i’m not trying to imply psych meds cause these tragedies to happen, but this can work as a deterrent bc the individual might not want to jump through all the hoops. a psych med user who is stable and likes guns shouldn’t have any problems, their rights aren’t being restricted because they still have access, they just have to confirm a couple of things first. a system like this isn’t perfect but there’s no detriment to it and it can only help

       I don't really like the idea of restricting the rights of people on certain medications. Medications can have lots of different indications for use. For example I take lamotrigine because I have a seizure disorder, but lamotrigine is also used for people with bipolar disorder. That is a slippery slope that I can't get behind. We can't restrict people based on diagnosis either because of HIPAA.

       i don’t like the idea either, i was just replying to the guy who threw a blanket statement out there. that would be the perfect way but it’s not fair at all and i agree with your points. ultimately it comes down to culture and self sacrifice. look at japan’s gun violence rate compared to the US; it’s astronomically lower bc basically no one can have guns. no guns = no gun crime. but the gun culture of japan isn’t even close to that of the US. historically japanese fought hand to hand or with weapons like kunai/swords/shuriken etc whereas the US’s history is riddled with guns. japan has also never had a mass school shooting, only one where the perpetrator used a knife. from this i can only ascertain it’s because of a difference in culture. japanese people are more accepting of self sacrifice for the whole whereas those in the US are not, mainly republicans, but that’s obvious since they oppose gun restrictions. i don’t align with either side, i like guns, i’m just brainstorming

       Here in South Africa you are allowed to own guns but you have to apply for a license. 
In order to get that license you go to some lectures you have to pass a competency test and write an exam on all the laws pertaining to guns and gun ownership.
 You also have to provide affidavits from several people attesting to your state of mental health.
If you pass you can then buy a gun. If you want another gun you have to motivate why you need another gun, apply for a license for the second gun and then wait until it is issued before you get the second gun. All in all if you want a gun you can get one , but it’s not a quick process and there are very strict laws on where and how you keep your guns. If a gun is lost/stolen you can get into serious trouble.

Still getting used to Reddit which seems to be a FAR more intelligent and happier place that I have learnt a lot from.

       I'm 53 years old. My generation never even had a thought of shooting up a school. I think the reason is because we were allowed to fight. If there was a bully somebody in the school would kick his ass and teach him a lesson. At most we'd get a few days suspension and a good talking to. I think zero tolerance causes kids to keep those emotions bottled up until they snap. How many times have we heard of the football captain doing a school shooting. It's always the nerds, the outcasts, the ones with emotional and mental problems. The bullied and the outcasts. In today's atmosphere these kids are literally bullied til they can't take it anymore often with the tacit approval of school authorities. Let the damn kids fight it out, hell toss them in a boxing ring with a pair of gloves if need be. Kids are under too much stress and that anger has to go somewhere.

       While likely not the whole deal, it certainly plays into it. Zero tolerance is bad, but selective zero tolerance is worse. Teachers and school faculty do play favorites and everyone turns a blind eye to what the popular or the rich kids do. It only ever is considered a problem when the smaller kid sticks up for himself. Then it's suddenly a huge issue and the entire school administration gets involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that bullying should be tolerated, it's that we need to let kids stand up to bullies and not punish them for doing so. Also, you talked about the punishment being a few days suspension and a talking to. Well when I was growing up in school the punishment for any fighting was 10 days out of school suspension, cops were called, and a minimum $200 fine was issued. And oh gee, sure is a coincidence that there is such a nice size fine for kids fighting in school and the cops are called at the drop of a hat. I'm sure everything was totally on the up and up and that there were in no way kickbacks to the school from the police for all this extra revenue. Afterall, the cops were only at the school every single day.

       You are right on! What ever happened to letting them work it out behind the A&amp;P? As a  13 year old middle schooler, a girl was bullying me on the bus on the daily. I remember telling my dad about it and he told me that the next time she threatened to beat me up, tell her that we can fight it out in my front yard when the bus dropped me off. The next day she started it again and I simply grabbed her up by the T-shirt and said let’s go. She said “no I can’t” and shyly sat down thus never bothering me again. I taught this method to my daughters and no one ever bullied them. Bullies thrive off of weakness.

       the other things we didn't have as kids were dozens of vaccines (injected aluminum), climate engineering (airborne aluminum), a constant barrage of RF/mW (cell phones, wifi, bluetooth devices, and cordless phones) AND violent content available 24/7.  why do you think there's so many more people with alzheimer's, autism, and mental illness now. our brains are malfunctioning, and it's not a contagion.

       That kinda depends too, maybe you are right in this situation. But take something like pcp and give it to any population, anywhere, ever and they are going to have correlating rates of craziness.

       While small, their 300k people is way more than enough of a sample size that we would see it play out statistically. Saying "we are very different sizes" shows a fundamental misunderstanding of statistics.

       Because per capita doesn't account for "person per square inch".

       If you have a huge ass country, but a quarter of the population spread around in it, then everyone has way more breathing air, which leads to a completely different people dynamic.

       That's not US specific.  None of these things that are being raised (narcissistic social media culture, SSRIs, guns, spoiled kids, bad parents) are specific to the US.

       You make it sound as if school shootings aren't completely taboo across the vast majority of the U.S. There still has to be a trigger, something that pushes people over the edge to engage in taboo behavior. Much as you may hate the NRA or even the military, those are the two biggest symbols of gun culture around and neither of them pump up school shootings, it really is the opposite, believe it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched violent movies and played war with old school realistic looking toy guns and army surplus gear as a kid. I played violent video games as as a young adult. I listened to lots of heavy metal and got plenty drunk and high on legal and illegal substances.  l and never took part in the real life counterpart to the stage show fantasies that were presented to me never bit the head off a bat or sacrificed a baby to Satan or shot up a school.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's the factor that is the over riding catalyst for destructive behavior? Simply culture? Because there are plenty of violent people all over the world, and how they play out their fantasies varies greatly with culture and access to guns I'm sure, but what is it that sets them off in the first place? Mental illness probably. Whether or not that destructive behavior is ecsaserbated by medicine is what is really crucial to this debate here today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, plenty of people get stabbed or road raged in countries with less guns and plenty of people get taken hostage or suicide bombed in countries with more. Those are symptoms of a bigger problem. Maybe it's culturally specific, or maybe there are connections across cultures, idk. Gun culture in the U.S. isn't the primary reason people act destructively or against taboo. It's a factor in how a broken person plays out their violent urges for sure, but not the primary cause. At least not as much as mental illness is.

       I actually mean culture in a broader sense, I'm not making some simplistic association like violent video games = violence.  US culture is geared toward conflict, toward aggression, toward confrontation.  Look at any of the recent police shootings and you'll find many people who put forth opinions like "he didn't listen to the cop, he deserved to be shot."  Especially in the south and rural areas these views are widespread, just a complete lack of proportionality and a sick view of the world.

       True. Last time I was in the video game section of Walmart, the first thing I noticed was that about 9/10 of the games were just first person shooters. Walked away shaking my head. They're feeding us violence over here. Movies aren't much better. But I guess any country that is going to constantly be at war would want its people to be desensitized and think killing is fun and exciting...

       Maybe, but it's still largely considered to be taboo to shoot up a school. Also, researchers have discovered that there is something to be said for the release of the soon or fantastical ideation through virtual simulation. Once people are desensitized, which they will inevitably be if connected to just about anything society on this day and age, might as well provide an outlet of some sort. I'm pretty sure most people get it outta there system while only a few insist on taking it to the extreme and living out dangerous fantasies.

       If even half of the americans watching these accepts this kind of thinking as part of their culture you very well could call this  desensitization.

       Guns plus culture are part of the problem in the U.S. Mental illness and it's course of treatment are still critical. It's what is triggering the violent episodes that needs to be fixed the most. If u have a significant portion of people in Britain who have a connection to anti-depressants and engage in knifing people or road raging it needs to be taken into account as a potential trigger for destructive behavior.

       I realize this is chicken--&gt; egg scenario but I have always thought it was unnatural the amount of revenge fantasy and murder obsession programming that originates in the US. Whether chicken or egg, the process gets started and then turns viral seeming to devolve further and further to some eventual end. 
I mean, there are entire channels focusing on and fascinated with murder and it's various results. My entire adult life there have been true crime books, TV and movies abt the subject of serial murders of mostly women (also children). 
Not pretending it's only in the US and not denying other cultures obsessions w horrible practices. Just that US culture seems to have an unhealthy appetite for murder and revenge. Is this true of countries like Iceland?

       I have to doubt these figures. Especially in the US with no gun registration in most states, private sales and estate guns the best anyone can do is an educated guess. Great Grandad could have bought home a weapon from WW1 and the gov't would have no clue that the 4th generation since still keeps it as an heirloom.

       Sure, but what problems are they having, if any, that are potentially related to anti-depressants is the real question. If the answer is none, than your contention that gun culture is the over riding problem looks correct. If however, there is an increase in some other culturally relevant or specific destructive behavior that could be linked to prescriptions, than anti-depressants use should not be discounted.

       If tracking anti-depressants and it's link to school shootings in America while trying to discover a connection across cultures, I would think it prudent to consider anti-depressants culpability in a variety of other destructive behaviors as well. Something like seeing if there is an increase in Japan of dudes going to the suicide Forrest and an increase in suicide bombings in a place like maybe Pakistan or Iraq and it's potential connection to anti-depressants, if that makes sense? What exactly this vague notion would tell researchers I'm not sure, but it passes my personal kinda makes logical sense off hand sensibilities.

       If Iceland simply doesn't have guns or a ton but still a ton of anti-depressants, than Iceland should be studied for culturally relevant or specific deviant and/or destructive behavior.

       okay phew! it’s a little hard reading the tone :) so I googled firearms in Iceland and I had no idea there were so many guns here! Was really surprised. But there was talk about letting the Icelandic police carry firearms, number of guns must be the reason for that. In 2011 they had 60 thousand registered guns. That is a huge percentage of the 320.000 people who live here. Jeez.

       From what I understand, the biggest suicide risk with SSRIs is giving them to someone who is so depressed that they have no motivation to do anything, even kill themselves, and the SSRIs bring them up enough to allow them to do things again but not stop the suicidal thoughts. So it's not that the SSRIs cause the suicidal thoughts, it's that someone who hasn't been able to leave their bed in 6 months is finally able to leave again and pick up a gun/their suicide method of choice. Could be wrong though, it's been a while since I looked into this.

       That is such an over generalization of mental illness and/or depression as well as school shootings in general.  I’m not saying you’re wrong or not painting a fair picture but each situation is very different and it can’t all be blamed on just medication or just guns.  There are so many factors that go into why someone would and could get to that level that they could commit a crime like what happened today.

       exactly, it’s ridiculous to infer that medication is the tipping point that makes someone decide to pull the trigger. there are so many variables to take into account. their motive, their ideology prior to taking the medication, what medication it is, how long they’ve been on it, i could go on forever

       The reason for the suicide warnings is genuinely interesting, if not really in a conspiracy way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depression isn't just feeling sad. It's an impressively broad damper on motivation, energy, and outlook. Many people hate living, but can't drum up the willpower to kill themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, take just such a person, and give them a pill that boosts stuff like motivation and energy back towards normal. Turns out it takes awhile to get used to a working brain again. This hypothetical person would still have an enormously negative view of existence, but also finally have the motivation to act on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can get through this dangerous stretch, your brain eventually adapts to having a healthy (chemically compensated back to normal) balance, and you cool off on wanting to die. You only go through the dangerous part because it's working, but the path out of depression is just inherently perilous for a lot of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's actually really similar to why, if your friend has been acting depressed/lethargic and suddenly seems super happy/content, it's actually a major red flag. That's a person that finally committed to dying, instead of stressing about whether to be or not to be, and boy, what a relief that solid decision is.

       You are spot on. I went thru a massive depression a few years ago, I literally didn't care about anything and had so little motivation I wouldn't shower, brush my teeth and hair for weeks, it was bad. All I did was lay on the sofa or my bed and txt with a friend of mine who was going thru the exact same thing. We would google methods of suicide trying to find the easiest way with little pain and best chance working. After a year or so I found out I had breast cancer and admitted to my Dr how low I was and was given anti depressants. He also told me I couldn't live alone (considering I was almost out of money and maxed out my credit cards I couldn't afford too any longer). It wasnt until I was done with chemo that he explained he didnt want me living alone because he was worried once the meds started to work I would still be suicidal and I would have the willpower to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life is good now, cancer free, overwhelming crippling depression is gone, showering daily etc and I'm happy. My friend didnt do as well, she started the antidepressants a year after me and about 4 months in she was doing better, so much so she spent a month cleaning out her house, painting the rooms and all sorts of repairs. A few days later she left me a voice mail telling me now that the house looked good and she wouldn't be embarrassed for people to come in she could finally go. She hung herself immediately after. I kick myself for not figuring out what was going on and making sure she wasnt alone.

       So yeah your post is spot on...

       Even though its been about 3 years it still seems like showering daily is a treat (for lack of a better word)! I'm ok if I skip a day but it scares me if I have to miss 2 days, I worry I'm going to get out of the habit or something. And I dont wash my hair everyday like I did before and its much healthier, which i wouldn't have known if i hadn't been so depressed. I try to find the positive in things no matter how meaningless and little because no matter how shitty something is there is always something good to be found!

       God damn thank you for bringing this up. It frustrates me so much when people blame an SSRI or other ADs for suicide. After that black box warning was added suicide rates actually increased because less people started taking SSRIs! Now we know it's important to watch for those warning signs (agitation, excessive energy, restlessness), especially in youth, so we can properly treat people for depression without increasing their risk for killing themselves. Fuck these threads really bother me sometimes.

       That's because there is actual scientific research showing SSRIs increase suicide risk in young people, and that pharmaceutical companies lied about the risk of suicide:
      </p>
      <p>
       "An analysis of 70 trials of the most common antidepressants - involving more than 18,000 people - found they doubled the risk of suicide and aggressive behaviour in under 18s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a similarly stark link was not seen in adults, the authors said misreporting of trial data could have led to a ‘serious under-estimation of the harms...
      </p>
      <p>
       After comparing clinical trial information to actual patient reports the scientists found pharmaceutical companies had regularly misclassified deaths and suicidal events in people taking anti-depressants to "favour their products".
      </p>
      <p>
       Experts said the review's findings were "startling" and said it was "deeply worrying" that clinical trials appear to have been misreported."
      </p>

       Other
       <a href="http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/special-reports/relationship-between-antidepressant-initiation-and-suicide-risk">
        studies
       </a>
       have found similar results:
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence supporting the first black box warning came from a meta-analysis that combined spontaneous reports of suicidal thoughts and behaviors from pediatric RCTs of newer antidepressants, mostly SSRIs.2 The risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, or suicidality, was found to be higher for children treated with antidepressants than for those given placebo (odds ratio [OR] = 1.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14, 2.77). The FDA also presented results of an analysis of prospective data (suicidal ideation or behavior rating-scale item) that showed no effect for emergence (OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.75, 1.15) or emergence and/or worsening of suicidal thoughts and behavior in the active-drug group compared with the placebo group (OR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.76, 1.11)."

       I think I phrased what i meant incorrectly. That BBW is absolutely there for a good reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose what I meant was that it's not the SSRI that is introducing new thoughts of suicide or something. It's giving people the motivation and energy to follow through with a plan they may have thought about before. As the person I replied to gave a good summary for the reasoning I won't discuss that again. I just mean that the BBW shouldn't stop someone from taking an AD.

       I settled for killing myself slowly with my food choices. I'm trying to work to undo that now, but it's really difficult thanks to IBS. Now that I'm trying to eat healthy, but I can't eat onions or garlic or artichokes or gluten, but meat is sort of a safe zone (it's healthy in the right proportions, but I'm worried my proportions aren't healthy).

       Well more like chemically functioning a little better.  It isn't normal having those drugs in you.  Many people don't feel quite right on those drugs, even if it improves motivation.  So that is another factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you get your brain truly balanced, there would be less risk of suicide because your brain is now how you want it to be.  The problem with drugs is that one is still imbalanced, but now differently, and though this can obviously have positive outcomes to relieve symptoms of depression, it takes some getting used to and it doesn't get to the root of the problem, which is a fatal Achilles heal.

       Interesting. Why is the risk of suicide after starting SSRIs particularly high for people under 18?  Wouldn't children and adults both have basically the same increase in motivation?

       That's a good question, and I'm not sure there's a well-supported answer for it yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       My wild-ass guess that should absolutely be taken with salt? We know that one of the last things to keep developing in your brain is your impulse control, which doesn't really finish baking until around 20-24. Suicide is often impulsive, at least in terms of the "boil over" moment - we have statistical case studies of how suicide rates change when people can kill themselves conveniently, instead of needing several minutes to prep (and possibly back down). So for teens, the cocktail of motivation, negative outlook, and incomplete impulse control... that may be more powerful, on the average, than the experience of adults taking the very same SSRIs.

       This is what I came to ask. If 90% of Americans were on anti-depressants, then the statistic in the original post would have been meaningless.

       11% of Americans are on SSRIs, and 90% of mass shootings are by people on them. Wow.

       Could this effect be explained by mass shooters already being batshit insane and therefore prescribed psychoactive medicine that failed to prevent them from shooting up a school?

       Why is this surprising to you? This means ~11% of  the people are actively pursuing a means to deal with their depression and mental issues.

       Medications have such an influence on the brain, their normal selves might have not even done such a thing. It diminishes a person's filters. I'm not saying they're not guilty, but for fucks sake, SSRIs are NOT A FUCKING CURE ALL for every fucking thing.

       You don't need to simulate every atom in the human body to determine causality with statistical confidence. There may be a metric fuckton of interactions within the body, but (almost) all of them are part of a larger system, which obeys known rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, you could look at each interaction between insulin and insulin receptors as an "event", which makes the problem seem overwhelming. Or, you could view this entire process in the context of the insulin-glycogen negative feedback system and understand how it works without understanding each fundamental component.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a factor of lost information, as looking at the system rather than each interaction is obviously less data. But as long as the system you're generalizing doesn't have many

       We have actually studied the emergent properties of various organ systems, and factor that information in to our predictive models.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, we have had fairly accurate predictive models of immensely complicated systems (biology, ecology, meteorology, etc) for a while now. We can accurately predict hurricane paths, when the butterfly effect was literally named after meteorology because of the emergent properties and general unpredictability due to chaos. Yet the models are very good.

       The models are good, you can thank me, but trust me they're not that good yet, you can get a good outline, but there will always be details missing. You do the best you can, and over time as you gather more data, you can make better approximations eliminating variables that don't contribute to the effect you're after. Let's be real here though, we're still some ways away.

      <p>
       All the cloud protein folding programs have had a huge influence in current research. There's still a lot we don't know though, as far as we can tell nothing is more complex than the human brain.

       Gravy even assuming your numbers are true they dont say anything. All it says is that people have attempted unsuccessful medical interventions.  Its like saying 10% of americans have been to the hospital but 90% of americans die in hospitals so hospitals must be causing these people to die.

       That's why I was asking a question rather than making a statement - we essentially identified a correlation and then went on to pose the question of if it was in fact causation.

       Black box labels warn against suicide, not mass homicide. Suicide and mass homicide are mutually exclusive. People who are suicidal want to kill themselves. They are not homicidal. They are two entirely separate phenomena, and one would folly to argue their correlation.  (not trying to argue opinions— this is just plain reason and logic).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also. Perhaps your focus shouldn’t be on antidepressants. Perhaps the real problem is a permissive culture obsessed with violence and a society that provides ample opportunity to obtain a gun. It would be silly to think that, but for antidepressants, mass murders would not happen.

       I can explain to you the suicide warning, it's because antidepressants also have a stimulatory effect. The action of the antidepressants regarding the affective side (anti depressant effect) can start to appear by the 4th to 6th week of treatment, while the stimulatory effect (giving you a little push in your energy) can appear by the first week, so if the person has a deep depression, the first weeks of treatment you can give them the energy they lack to commit suicide, before the emotional improvement appear, that's why a person with intense suicide ideations should be hospitalized during the first weeks of treatment, or at least have a strict vigilance from their family.

       I only think this way because I dropped out of highschool due to bullying that started in elementary. The system is harsh and competitive, not to mention the entire curriculum is taught one way and I did not benefit from that. I thought I hated learning, just because I could not for the life of me retain anything said. In classes of 30 children, you only ever thrive if you learn the way you are taught. You only ever thrive if you are included in all the other kids' shit, and only if you are decent competition can you actually be on anyone else's level. In my opinion, school is a big fat competition for who can trample who and end up on top. I am in no means stupid. I just did not benefit from that environment and frankly it felt like I was jailed for 8 hours a day of ridicule and self-ridicule for not grasping concepts. I can understand why this would drive kids to violence like this, though I would not act the same way. If your grades are bad, if you don't get along with the teachers or students, you are absolutely fucked. you get no support, no help, and ultimately you are looked down upon.

       I can't speak for anti-depressents, as i have had no experience with them, but what i can say as first hand experience is that the drugs and meds you can buy off the shelf in the States (or the states i have been to) are a hell of a lot stronger than most stuff we get in Britain that is prescribed by our Dr's.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have some 'advil' from America, that shit is straight up Ketamine. Knocks you for six and makes you feel very...out of it. To have anything like that here in UK and Europe you would have to undergo major surgery. I know we can get strong painkillers like codine but nothing like the yanks can buy over the counter.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe, the anti-psych meds you guys are giving out like sweets, are actually a lot stronger and more dangerous than the UK/European equivilant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many, many countries in Europe have pretty much open gun laws or you just need to 'acquire' (buy through bribery of the local police) a gun license. But the shootings in Europe are...well, we had anders brevik and a couple of nutty muslims.

       Advil, as in ibuprofen?

      <p>
       I'm having trouble seeing anything resembling a narcotic effect coming from ibuprofen alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you took some Advil Cold and Sinus medication which has pseudoephedrine.  It can cause drowsiness if you're not used to it.  It's still quite less of an effect than codeine.

       Other countries actually know they are a problem, though. Take benzodiapines. There is little controversy in the UK medical community that they are a terrible drug that no one should be on. Here in the US they're the greatest thing since sliced bread according to all the published literature. They don't polydrug people into oblivion and it's used as a last resort for extreme cases.

       And you have to ask yourself those 3 terrorists in London not long ago who attacked people with knives. Hundreds of people fled the scene in terror. Now had those 3 terrorists been armed with guns against 100's of people. Rather than 1 death and 12 injured it would've looked like a something that happens in America. There are bad people all over the world. You can't stop every bad person, you can help prevent a lot of deaths though. Something America isn't doing.

       A problem with most anti depressants are that they give you a bit of energy and motivation fairly quick, but lifting your mood takes a little while longer.
       <br/>
       So people have been sitting around with depressive thoughts of suicide (or shooting up a school), but it always seemed unmanageable and not worth doing anything about those thoughts, but the pills change that before they brighten up your thoughts/mood.

       It's a mental health issue, and schools are woefully understaffed with mental health experts that can spot the signs and address them. This shooter had all of the signs, and instead of trying to help, they kicked him out. So yeah...cultural.

       In the Uk its a lot more difficult getting guns. I'm not saying it's impossible, and if you really wanted a gun you could probably get one. But all the times I have visited American friends in the USA, they all have guns in the house. In the UK we don't generally have guns we can get hold of easily.

       It's the drugs. MANY of these drugs may cause mania as a side effect. Manic episodes lead to the homicidal or suicidal behavior. Food and Drug Administration requires that all antidepressants carry black box warnings, the strictest warnings for prescriptions.

       Why/what four?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most bipolar patients are on a mood stabilizer and perhaps an antidepressant.  You could also get prescribed something to deal with side effects of medication, e.g. beta blockers to stop tremors.  Don’t know your case and doctor, but four potent ones isn’t scientifically backed up, especially long term use. The gold standard for bipolar mood stabilization is still lithium, which can lead to toxicity and side effects if not monitored, but is not usually thought of as a potent mind altering med.  Something in the atypical antipsychotic class, say Risperdal, can really mess with cognition and negatively influence hormones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Glad to hear your meds are helping.  If it ain’t broke don’t fix it probably.

       Not far off tbh mate, vaproic acid, quetiapine, venlafaxine, propranolol, diazepam, methadone, sometimes zopiclone too. I have many issues, I sincerely aren't over exaggerating mate. I don't take lithium because of the negative health implications and the inability to find a vein very often, I'm recovering from a ten year heroin addiction you see. Two years clean. I appreciate you kind words though mate.

       You are a fortunate one. Millions of people consume psychotropic medications and most have no suicidal or homicidal ideation or action. But it's fact that these drugs have indeed induced suicidal and homicidal behavior. As a psychiatrist and a cousin, I have seen it all to often...Sudden increases of norepinephrine and serotonin can lead a small susceptible segment of the population to do things completely irrational and sometimes harmful to themselves or others.

       I understand where you're coming from. You only have to look at glaxosmithandklein's piece of shit corruption regarding paroxetine and how it killed a lot of young kids who shouldn't have been on the meds any way. But like I said, medication is never the only reason and typically the affected will commit suicide and not hurt others. It's a shit scenario, the mental health side of things, and more bilateral research needs to be done without any influence from pharmaceutical companies.

       If you compare these instances against the number of people who are on these medicines (staggering, doctors prescribe them at the drop of a hat), you would find some minuscule hundredth or thousand or less of a percent.

       Your observations are accurate. Have you noticed the 'suicidal ideation/behavior' warnings in the black box? It took decades of suicides, litigation, and lobbying in order to get that side effect warning added to the label. The outrageous influence of pharma upon the government, politics, news media and medical curriculum is the sole reason 'homicidal ideation/behavior' has yet to be added to the black box warning. 
People would think twice before putting themselves or their child on psychotropics if the black box warned of homicide and suicide as side effects...Am I wrong?

       Antidepressants lower inhibitions in the first couple of weeks after starting or stopping or changing dosage for the medication.

      <p>
       You are much more likely to commit suicide when you first start antidepressants.

       There would be correlation between mental illness and school shootings. There would be a correlation between mental illness and any mass shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is, "Is there correlation between medication and terrorist acts"
      </p>
      <p>
       No. They give mental people drugs to keep them from committing crimes. You take away the drugs you get alot more terrorist acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Millions of people take these drugs. I would even say 50% of the population will take these drugs or ones similar at some time in their lives. You can't tie anything you don't like to "big pharma"
      </p>

       That said, Big pharma is a problem that needs regulation, I just don't see how that's related to school shootings.

       That's a good question. I'd wager that it's linked to some combination of poor diet, drugs/alcohol/caffeine intake, lack of exercise, unnecessary intake of chemicals through plastics and other products that are in contact with the body, and overload of (useless and overstimulating) information, especially while people's brains are developing so dramatically during their youths.

       Because being sad is an illness now. Instead of you know.. A regular emotion we all feel at some point.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as the requirements to meet 'depressed' are so loose and ridiculous, there will be tonnes of people prescribed these drugs needlessly. I'd say less than 5% of the population ever actually has a chemical balance problem leading to depression.

       Don't know why you're being down voted. This is true. Doctors prescribe antidepressants like they're candy. I was diagnosed as a child. Great up. Decided I wanted to try medication again because I felt I might be needing something. Went to a new doctor who didn't seem to care too much. The appointment ended with the doctor concluding that I was sad and prescribed me Zoloft or whatever the fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Okay, tie this in with how many teenagers "think" that they're depressed when really they're either just feeling a bit sad lately, or want to be the depressed kid at school. Go and get prescribed and shit, I don't know.

       I think it's mainly awareness and therefore more diagnoses.  It's like when old people die, it's not because of "old age" anymore, they narrowed it down to cancer, Alzheimers, heart attack, etc.  As information regarding mental health spreads and loses some of its stigma, more people are likely to go seek treatment.  I mean a hundred years ago, not many people thought depression was an illness, but rather a character trait.

       I recently read an open letter sent by a couple of big investors to apple in which they basically tell apple they should do something about addiction on their devices.
      </p>
      <p>
       If what you say is true, now we throw social media and addictive apps to the mix, I was very surprised with the suicide rate in teenagers that used their phone for large periods of time.

       My fiance was abused, and has a family history of schizophrenia and bi-polar. Her dad tried to kill her in front of her mother. He never took his medication. My fiance attempted to harm me, which is when I checked her into the hospital. Now she is medicated, and has no more violent tendencies (unless she relapses due to severe stress).
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is keeping her on her medication. It's the same with most people with severe mental illnesses. They take their meds, feel normal after a few weeks, and decide "nah! I don't need those!" And then they have an episode not long after they cease their meds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most Mental Illnesses are either hereditary, or foster from abuse.

       I would say that there’s over medication and under medication.  Poorer communities are under medicated, more affluent communities tend to be overmedicated.  Also, I would argue that as medicine has progressed and we’ve had better outreach more people have coverage.  It’s not that people 100 years ago weren’t sick, it’s that we now have the means to detect sickness and treat it.  The same with any disease, cancer is not new but people being treated for cancer has risen, why?  Because we’re able to detect it earlier.  We can now detect and treat stage “zero” cancers.  That was not a reality 20-30 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same now with mental illness also.  200 years ago someone with schizophrenia would be said to have “demons”.

       Medicalisation. Take a normal and widespread emotion, like being shy and anxious before making a speech, tell people there's something wrong with their brains because if you're not happy and stress-free all the time there must be a problem, and give them pills that might not do anything at all. I remember reading up on how they wanted to market antidepressants in Japan a few decades ago, so they got a big promotion team and started advertising depression as this kind of hip new cool thing amongst teenagers with vague symptoms in magazines and such, and it worked, antidepressant sales started sky-rocketing. That's just one of the things wrong with stuff surrounding Big Pharma and the mental health industry anyway.

       I can only speak for myself. I have used anti-depressants before and they can seriously mess with your attitude. I wasn’t sad as often as I was but I gained a crazy temper. I would flip at anything I perceived as a slight. I was a straight up monster and people at work became scared of me. I damn near lost my job several times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I eventually figured out is was in fact my meds. I then decided to go cold turkey. Bad idea. My mood swung so much I thought there was something even more wrong than just depression. I took them again and tapered off the right way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I am back to my old self. Still a little bit a jerk but not even close to how I was before. It took many months before the people around me weren’t too afraid to joke around with me. 
I’ll never touch any of that shit again.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when I hear that anti-depressants are linked to school shootings I believe very much so that the meds played a big part in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can’t say that the meds were the driving force but they certainly don’t help the situation.

       I never experienced it personally but I had a friend who tried to kill himself and a family member who went on essentially an insane crime spree both while on zoloft. Numerous other people have told me that Zoloft made them insane and if they stopped taking it it made them hyper-depressed.

       Totally! I tried that once, it was not good. Even a slow wean over two months is tough on me. I’ve been on and off of it for over 8 years. Even at a super low dose I’m trapped.

       I’m thinking maybe you could be on the wrong stuff. Just a thought though. Don’t get me wrong some people benefit from meds so that’s fine with me. They could possibly transition you if you’re trying to get off Zoloft. Don’t take anything I’m saying seriously. Absolutely talk to a doctor.

       Fair point, but how about we get a bit more strict about being able to own guns if you are on psych meds, or if someone in your house is.  I think we could all agree on that, no?

       I am on the right and I don't get this.  If you literally can't handle life that you need to be on anti-depressant that is a huge red flag you shouldn't be entrusted to own a killing machine.  Even if you don't believe the drug itself is doing anything.  Just to be on those meds you have to be a little messed up.  They don't just hand them out because someone had a bad day.

       Can we start with kids under the age of 25 on SSRIs?  Does a 19 year old kid whose mind is still developing really need a gun?  Let alone one that has shown mental instability to the point they need to be medicated.

       Okay so let's say a 24 year old with an anxiety disorder. Yes that person has the right to own a firearm for sporting purposes and even more importantly personal protection. Does a 19 year old kid need a gun? Yes for many reasons. You have to consider what you are suggesting. You are not really defining what kind of metal problems you are speaking of. I also do not think you are aware if just how these medications are used. Not everyone that takes Paxil is mentally unstable. I personally believe that Form 4473 covers all it needs to in regards to mental health requirements.

       You are never going to find the exact combination to be able to take guns out of the hands of those who will commit, and those who won't.  If you know taking guns out of hands of a small subset of society will save peoples lives then you do it.  It's like the drunk driving laws.  Should we not have drunk driving laws because drunk people have the right to be on the road just live everyone else, and not all of them get in accidents or drive dangerously when they drink?

       A small subset? You are talking about anyone with anxiety, OCD, depression, eating disorders, PTSD, etc. That is only if you stop at SSRIs. What about other medications not categorized as such, but are still used to treat other kinds of conditions that you might feel are dangerous? Your comparison is ridiculous. Drunk driving laws do not prohibit people from owning vehicles. It just says they cannot operate the vehicle when intoxicated. Carrying a gun and being drunk is illegal too by the way.

       As someone who takes anti-depressants, missing a couple of days is sometimes worse than the original depression itself, accidentally taking two is equally chaotic.

       Americans take SSRIs at the highest rate of any country, this may or may not be true, the graph in the article even says getting an accurate number is difficult.

       Mental illness rates are fairly constant across the globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between 2010-2012 there were a similar number of mass school attacks in china as in the US. The Chinese attacks caused about half as many deaths but twice as many injuries. Why? Because all those attacks were done by knives or hammers, with the killers usually committing suicide after, same as here, but they tend to do things like burn themselves to death rather than shoot themselves in the head. US attacks caused more deaths because all of them involved firearms, while none of the Chinese attacks did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cause is mental illness. SSRIs are more likely to be prescribed to the mentally ill.

       It's because we don't address the actual issue, but instead, drug people up to the point of sedation where we can deal with them minimally.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's exactly the same mentality of obese people seeking out a "diet pill" to solve their issue instead of making lifestyle changes, because ((god forbid)) they change their lifestyle....

       It's the hubris of the medical system thinking they can hack our brains with pills.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know enough about neurotransmission obviously, and we should stop fucking with it until we know more about the brain.  We should also have a better methodology of determining which drug to take via an objective test, not "take this lithium for a couple months to try it out, and if it doesn't work, we'll try something else [̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°̲̅)̲̅$̲̅]". How these pills work is based entirely on feel and maybe some questions/counselling.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the doctors are getting paid a cut to prescribe drugs, wouldn't it be in their best interest to get the patient to switch through all of the drugs before settling?

       I take SSRIs to boost my serotonin and I resent this implied correlation. It's obvious that these types of people are way out on the spectrum of mental illness and I would even argue that many more tragic events, like this one, are prevented by getting someone the proper treatment.
      </p>

       I would liken this post heading to the correlation of the murder rate in New York City going up at the same time that the sales of ice cream does. MSM never covers this because of big dairy's cash cow.

       Depressive thoughts, psychotic behavior etc wouldn't be listed as side effects if they didn't parse that out first in their studies.  But you are right to say it isn't merely the drugs. It is the fact we give kids shitty drugs instead of what they need to grow and heal.

       Your question is based in the definition of their illness requires a medication. The whole system is fucked from the get go, they quickly and excitedly diagnose patients when they may in reality have a different problem, then prescribe psychotropic medications that are unreliable and dangerous unknown long term effects or effects that may vary, they at least mess with your thoughts. I think the stat is so high cause in the rest of the world the medical industry isn't so quick to prescribe, they take other factors into consideration and prescribe other things than psychotropic drugs

       U.K. has other issues, like grooming gangs, sexual deviancy being covered up with the elites (Saville, Edward Heath), Brexit, a rising nationalism that is against open unvetted immigration, Rothschilds bankster system (New London):

       And on and on. The shop I used to work at was owned by a Brit, and we would get guys regularly (welders) from U.K. who would come on a 3 month visa to work. During my time there, I got to know about 30 Brits, and all of their only interests were to get pissed (drunk), get laid, and make it to work on time in the morning. It got me wondering if perhaps U.K. has a bigger idiocracy than the U.S. has. But then again, these were all welders, and most blue collar workers are dumb AF meatheads anyway

      <p>
       Not everyone has mental illness, and gets put on drugs at an early age because the parents witnessed that they were "hyper" like how kids naturally are when they are full of energy and playing with others. The doctors use any excuse to put them on pills, and the rest of the time they get fucked up from the pills, disassociated from classmates, school work, "the system" and so on

       Guns are everywhere in the U.S. and easily obtainable. Guns are not easily obtainable in the U.K, so you have 2 differences in the collective consciousness of 2 different countries separated by a massive body of water with differing cultural anomalies.

       Good for you. We dont have problems sleeping around. My only take from Brits, is every single one I ever met, about 30 thus far, has been dumber than a box of rocks.

       Oh diet, how obvious! Obviously food is the problem! So what's the solution? Veganism? Keto diet? Omega-3s? Mediterranean diet? Paleo-crossfit-raw-cultured-gluten-free? Is there a specific vitamin or mineral deficiency depressed people have eluded every single blood test ever performed?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's your evidence? Have you read a study showing that this country whose population is pretty much the same in every way with the other country other than their diet has significantly less depression?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well maybe that's an impossible scenario in the real world, so do you have a study showing
      </p>
      <p>
       A: an adequate sample size of people
      </p>
      <p>
       B: randomly assigned to a control or interventional diet in order to
      </p>
      <p>
       C: eliminate possible confounding variables, and ensure the only possible difference is solely the diet
      </p>
      <p>
       D: has statistically significant depression reduction in the interventional diet cohort?
      </p>
      <p>
       So you find a study, you find dozens of studies in fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's the mechanism? How does X diet change lead to Y behavioral change?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you break it down further to the molecular level, and prove it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you design a chemical that can replicate that effect without actually changing people's diets?
      </p>
      <p>
       Holy shit you can?
      </p>
      <p>
       Congrats on your Nobel Prize in Medicine for answering all of these questions, millions of dollars from novel anti-depressant drug sales, and global recognition as the man or woman who cured depression!

       Ok, but your anecdotal opinion on medication doesn't mean that it doesn't work well for other people, and much how you individually figured out how to medicate yourself others should be able to do the same with whatever treatment works.

       I get the impression that those here who support SSRIs ,have never had to use them....I've been struggling with clinical depression for 35 years...and to this day my experience has been nothing but a guessing game by the Dr's. The numbers that support such substances have been skewed by money and profit....none of you think its odd that since such drugs were developed, depression rates have skyrocketed?.... I'm not saying that some dont need them, I'm saying they could be replaced by a number of methods,including diet,therapy, and natural sources... Finding the psychological cruxx of the issue should be the first stage in treatment, not trying any and every chemical solution first...today's medical professionals, are under rediculous pressure to be correct on the fist try....or face the wrath of a lawsuit prone society. As was mentioned above....culture is were we are going wrong.....all that follows is an effect....

        Social media and the obsession with celebrities and fame

       <li>
        Society, the economy, and education failing to adapt to each other - pushing college as the only way to get a job and be successful

       It's obviously more nuanced that I made it out to be, but no one would read a novel and I didn't want to type one. All the things I listed combine to create an environment that some people and families simply aren't equipped to deal with.

       I'm 44, and this is one of the biggest changes in society that I see. Parents start sending their kid to daycare when it's 3 months old and it never ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when the parents finally do see the kid at the end of the day, they're exhausted from working 8+ hours and don't have the energy to meaningfully engage with their children.  Parents aren't "raising" their children, they're just being in the same general vicinity as the kid while it grows up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus for a long time schools shamed parents who were engaged calling them "helicopter parents".
      </p>
      <p>
       This lack of parental involvement had led to children being exposed to damaging things. Pre teens are watching hard core pornography on a regular basis. They're going to message boards where people joke about shooting up schools. They're watching tv shows that romanticize suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a sad state of affairs.

       Happening at younger ages too. Starts with YouTube on the tablet while they're little, because parents just want a break to get some chores done. Then the kid grows up with free reign on the phone/tablet.

        Why do these shootings happen routinely (approx 1 school shooting per week on average) in America when people take SSRI's around the world and don't see the same results? Surely if these are the cause we should see similar trends in the UK where people use them.

       And while you have fallen for the Fox News narrative that all the criminality you mention in London, one city in the whole of the UK, the massive difference here is we haven’t had 8 nail bombs, or 8 acid attacks or 8 truck attacks in the first 6 weeks of 2018 unlike America’s 8 school shootings.

       We can solve the school shooting problem here by having teachers armed with training, having locked door/security systems in the schools, and school metal detectors.
      </p>
      <p>
       The right to own guns here is vital and needs to be in place, so that our Government can't make it illegal to criticize religions, the way it is in Orwellian UK

       This.  My guess is that there are X cases where the use or non-use of SSRIs is discussed, and in 90% of those the shooter was on SSRIs.  But that's likely not a representative sample of the SSRI use of school shooters because SSRI use would likely not be discussed for the vast majority of cases, especially if there was no SSRI use.  That 90% numbers smells fishy.

       Yes and SSRIs dull down reality.  That's why they work for people with anxiety as well as depression.  If you already had violent tendencies and now your reality feels more like a video game than it did before, you might be more likely shoot a school up.  If you don't have violent tendencies it's not going to give them to you, but if you do it can make the situation worse.

       While that may generally be the case, you never know how someone will react to each individual medication, not to mention if there are other meds in the mix. All I'm saying is that how one person experiences a medication can be vastly different from the next.

       That’s absolutely not at all, not even remotely, what SSRIs do, you absolute unit. They initiate production of serotonin lack of which has been said to induce depressive state. They bring serotonin levels from low, to normal, that’s it.

       Before you throw out insults maybe do a little research.  About 10-20% of people who use SSRIs experience what is called emotional "flattening", and something I personally experienced.  It also affects everyone differently and isn't fully understood by the psych community, which is why people will try different drugs until they find one that's right for them.  It's not as simple as how you describe it, and in fact it is insulting to people who have struggled with this.  It doesn't simply "raise serotonin" levels.  If you seriously don't know this, then do some research or don't open your mouth next time you are making yourself look stupid.

       Over-prescribing is certainly an issue, but unless we can prove that happened in this case, then we need to treat it as a separate issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't solve problems if you don't compartmentalize, and break them down into solvable chunks, and attack them one at a time. If you don't, then the problems become too big and the issues become too muddy, and nothing is ever done to fix them.

       Doctors aren't awarded by big pharma for over prescribing medications. Working in the healthcare field, that is not true. There is a culture in medicine that when a patient comes in with a problem, we give them a med and fix them. That practice is the problem, but there is definitely a change in trend where we are only starting to give meds if there are absolutely needed. The bigger problem is that the US has a broken system in place to care of the mentally ill. We don't know how the meds work and they work differently for every person and it take years for the right combination of meds to be found. The psych system now serves more as a form of containment than a form of treatment. This and the stigma against the mentally ill can contribute to under treatment and worst case scenarios like school shootings. With antidepressants (like SSRI's), in the first few weeks patients have an increase in motivation before they see relief from their depression symptom. This often lead to suicide attempts when these meds are first given. Maybe in certain cases, the person receiving the SSRI was already thinking about hurting others, and the drug gave them the motivation to actually do it. That's the only correlation I can see with your statement.

       Do they add a bonus to a doctor's pay for selling x amount of opioids. I don't see a reward here. There is a crisis yes, but are doctors being rewarded for it, no way.  Like I said previously, over treatment of issues is the problem, and the recent trend of medicine is only intervening when necessary.

       Let's look at it rationally.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be on these medications you would need to be diagnosed as suffering a mental illness. That doesnt guarantee you have a mental illness, certainly doctors have been known to misdiagnose, but it's certainly likely the person is in some sort of mental distress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, can we say for certain that these drugs will have a positive effect? 
No of course not, the manufacturers as well as testing agencies and patients will all tell you they affect each person differently. You may benefit or not, and you may have side effects, this is the case with all drugs but especially psychiatric drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why are there such a high percentage of school shooters on these drugs? Could the drugs themselves be contributing, and could there be a cover up by big pharma?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the question is whether its possible that large pharmaceutical companies would consider a cover up against the public interest, I think we would all agree it's a possibility. However I don't think that it is the case here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't it be likely that those who shoot up schools are mental ill in some capacity, and that if it had been diagnosed prior to the shooting they would have been prescribed some sort of psychoactive drug?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, these drugs are used all over the world but these shootings seem to only happen regularly in America, where there is ready access to firearms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I think the pressures we put on people are more likely to contribute to these incidents than drugs developed to help people with anxieties...etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's just me, I don't trust pharmaceutical companies and they'll put money over ethics every time, I just dont think this one is on them.

       Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying drugs do not play a role or have no relation to these events. I just dislike when people make these bold claims, especially since this was posted shortly after the shooting. I'm no expert by any means, but if benzos caused school shootings there would be many more.

       Benzos cause increase rates of homicide. So it is possible that a school shooting was in effect caused by use of benzos.

       Ultimately it's an area that needs more study if we are going to be able to say anything definitive about it.

       Did I say it was just SSRI's? Perhaps its combining Benzos, adderall, or some other shit with it that produces some sort of psychosis effect that's being covered up by Big Pharma.

       Also I have 2 cousins on SSRI's who described it as "hell" trying to come off of them, so they stayed on, because living with the side effects is better than the "hell" of getting off of them

       I mean every Western Country uses those drugs. You don't see this simple connection? Every Western Country is pumped up with drugs only one has so many massacres. Keep looking for something that is different in the US and you might get closer to the actual answer.

        Stanford anthropologist Tanya Luhrmann found that voice-hearing experiences of people with serious psychotic disorders are shaped by local culture – in the United States, the voices are harsh and threatening; in Africa and India, they are more benign and playful. This may have clinical implications for how to treat people with schizophrenia, she suggests.

       Interesting idea but what are the odds?
      </p>
      <p>
       You could make some educated guesses for this if you start checking if US spouses ( you could controll by race ) are more violent with their spouses. If those voices result in massive disproportional cases of massarces they should do something comparable in domestic disputes, right? Obviously should be controlled for gun use.

       its a good question. When we try to figure out why so many school shootings happen in America, we have to consider psychology, culture, medication, gun access, human nature, and ton of other facets that make this a very complicated area of study

       Adderall is a psych med and I was wrongly diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed to a multitude of different medications which in turn made me hear voices and want to harm myself as well as others. Its an amphetamine which is comparable to meth as it was frying my brain It got to the point where I brought a hatchet to school because I wasn’t eating and was delusional. I was prescribed because I wasn’t doing well in school due to neglect as a child which wasn’t properly addressed until later. My doses were upped every six months for no apparent reason. Maybe the doctor prescribing people medicine the moment they walk into the office is the main problem here as it leads to overmedicating. I’ve been off meds for 8 years and am miraculously no longer “crazy as shit”. I only felt this way when I was on these meds. Not every case is the same though this is just a real life example.

       Yup, and the media and entertainers will NEVER accept they were in the wrong for glorifying self image to the point people start going batshit crazy and killing others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's not just that simple, but I strongly believe the general culture in the US is very narcissistic, there are people like that all over the world and in every country, but the US really glorify all of those self-image obsessed people and a lot of more people just eat whatever the media throws at them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember while growing up, teachers always talked to us about how important is to check sources and that even the big corporations lie to us so we should always stay in check and read about both sides so we could form an honest opinion by ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what they teach to kids in the US but I certainly see a lot of articles just telling people what their opinion needs to be instead of telling them how to form a self-opinion.

       so true. i don’t even think i believe in adhd i just wanted to have vyvanse in case i had to make myself do hella homework back in junior year of hs and i walked up into that office and did the tests exactly the way someone who “has ADHD” would answer it and they’ve been like drug pushers ever since. got a prescription on my first apt and was told that behavioral treatment doesn’t work and that i should take it everyday and that it has no long term side effects (total bullshit) and it was WAY to easy. in fact it was harder for me to go down in dosage than up. i don’t take them anymore tho cuz fuck big pharma and fake mental illnesses created to shove people into boxes with labels instead of letting us reflect on how society caused our unfavorable behavior. like seriously they give young kids basically speed bc they have a short attention span? and nobody goes wait what the fuck?? especially when the medicine (when it’s not making u stay up for days straight or hallucinate smoke from exhaustion and briefly feel like nothing is real) makes anyone into an obedient slave to the system who is actually excited to do excessive paperwork for no reason

       The shilling by use of upvotes/downvotes is crazy in this sub. But maybe it isn't shilling and it's just that a large portion of reddit users take these drugs and "feel" great on them (they are designed to make you feel great, and it has no bearing on the changes to the actions you perform under them).

       I can't believe you're being downvoted. I went to my doctor and told her I thought I was anemic because of all the symptoms I was having -- she said "I don't think you're anemic, you should try an anti-depressant." I was
       <strong>
        furious
       </strong>
       and said "JUST DO THE BLOODWORK." The bloodwork came back and sure enough I was anemic. I was absolutely disgusted with this doctor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine how many patients just go along with her advice and wind up on needless anti-depressants when they have a normal deficiency that can be cause with over the counter vitamins! Unbelievable. I would bet any patient that has a Vitamin D deficiency -- which can cause depression -- goes through the same thing.

       Unless you are suggesting that the american health-care system is so good that everybody with whatever the fuck mental illness you are referring to are treated with with these meds that these people are in your words relying on so that "they don't DIE".

       I’ve argued for years now that anyone taking psych meds or strong depression meds should absolutely be restricted from purchasing all forms of firearms.

       There’s a medical database used in healthcare that immediately tells insurance companies if you have a pre-existing condition based on what prescriptions you’ve had filled.

       Why can’t this same database be used to flag people who are on psych or severe depression meds when they go to purchase firearms?

       You make the most sense of all.  Problem is, some of the younger shooters are just using their parent's guns.  Also, number of deaths are also correlated with prior domestic abuse.  So, in addition to the mentally ill, the police should be flagging domestic calls and removing firearms from those premises as well.  I don't care if hunters are carrying uzis, but if that hunter is also beating his wife, he shouldn't have a gun.

       Good question, perhaps we can also ask why only American schizophrenics have "malevolent" voices in their heads, compared to that of other countries who's voices are more "playful and benevolent", and of course also easy to get guns

       Stanford anthropologist Tanya Luhrmann found that voice-hearing experiences of people with serious psychotic disorders are shaped by local culture – in the United States, the voices are harsh and threatening; in Africa and India, they are more benign and playful. This may have clinical implications for how to treat people with schizophrenia, she suggests.

       One possible cultural reason, in addition to lots of other reasons, is that US pop-culture gives out a lot of really nihilistic messages wrapped in cynicism, a sort of "life is meaningless" attitude. Young guys without an aim or a purpose can become pretty dangerous pretty quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course you can find nihilism in other countries, but whenever I watch popular TV shows in the US they seem to almost always feature super cynical characters that have the attitude that life is hardly worth living or caring about. House. Rick and Morty. Heck, the characters of Big Bang Theory seem like they always hate each other even though they're supposedly friends? I'm not saying TV shows make people murderous haha, but that maybe people that grow up in the US are much more exposed to the idea that being nihilistic and uncaring is the cool and intelligent way if living life. And that mentally ill people might pick up on that more strongly and act on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's obviously a lot more to the cultural influences than just that, but I don't remember ever seeing so much "life is meaningless" attitude in the cultures of other countries that I've been to.

       Yeah, and there's a step between having a gun and using it on kids in a school. Most school shooters have been suicidal and ended themselves before being caught, but there's a question of why they would shoot up a school rather then just shoot themselves and leave everyone else out of it. People commit suicide all over the world, so why is it that some in the US commit school shootings first before ending it, rather than single murder-suicides or just an individual suicide. That's something cultural that doesn't get addressed by just gun laws or lack thereof. Some kind of combination of 'given up on life,' 'seeking attention/notoriety,' 'angry at the world/peers/whatever.' The notoriety thing in particular seems to be a big part of it. Addressing the cultural/psychological aspect will only help reduce violence, in addition to any gun reform that people want to pass.

       Yeah, I didn't say otherwise. I was just trying to think about why this type of crime and not just suicide, when most of the shooters have been suicidal. Plenty of people commit suicide with a gun without shooting anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as school shootings go, this one actually seems pretty unusual because the shooter didn't kill himself or get into a gunfight with police.

       This is mostly speculation, but could it be that it's not as simple as "drug = more likely to shoot"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be that our VERY WAY OF LIFE, disconnected from spirit in the pursuit of empty profit in service of our financial overlords, batters human beings into states of deep depression and bitterness, at which point they are taken to "professionals" and diagnosed with "medical conditions" and drugged up just enough to maintain productivity and the status quo? And this is the type of person that could be driven to shoot?

       Pretty much. And for the people in this thread making it seem like guns are the problem (because this discussion hasn't been had 1000's of times) wouldn't the explanation that American culture is becoming increasingly flawed and the kids committing these atrocities have been exposed to some of the worst parts of our culture and society make more sense?Unfortunately then we all have to acknowledge that the way our education system is set up, as well as the way we raise our children, is the problem and the shootings are the symptom, and most people are incapable of admitting they aren't perfect.

       This is the same reason so many people are on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds. Our society isn't compatible with the psychological needs of your average person, so we try to 'fix' the person by drugging them until their numb enough to get by rather than addressing the fucked culture that got them to that state. People aren't meant to sit in cubicles all day. They aren't meant to get by without a tribe of sorts or sense of importance in their community. Everything is so materialistic and individualistic, that many people aren't getting their basic needs met.

       It's basically like giving everyone in a room sealed with a running car  headache medication rather than just shutting the damn car off. You're hiding the symptoms, but everyones still slowly dying.

       “The real hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does. They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted.”

       "Brave New World Revisited (Harper &amp; Brothers, US, 1958; Chatto &amp; Windus, UK, 1959),[31] written by Huxley almost thirty years after Brave New World, is a non-fiction work in which Huxley considered whether the world had moved toward or away from his vision of the future from the 1930s. He believed when he wrote the original novel that it was a reasonable guess as to where the world might go in the future. In Brave New World Revisited, he concluded that the world was becoming like Brave New World much faster than he originally thought."

       Yup. The root causes of violence are always the same; disenfranchisement, isolation, lack of social mobility or economic access, and a sense of hopelessness. Very few people resort to violence without feeling like it's a last resort.

       this is retarded. ive taken almost every ssri there is. SSRIs definitely aren’t a great solution to depression and anxiety and are pretty shitty “medication” (take forever to work, awful side effects, frustration of jumping from one to another if one doesn’t work etc) but they don’t cause mass shooting rofl. someone that fucked up is going to commit the action regardless if they’re taking ssris or not. then again what else could i expect from this ridiculous sub

       It affects everybody differently.  As someone who's also been on SSRIs I can assuredly say that it altered my behavior.  Let's take someone who already has violent tendencies, give them a mind altering drug that can make you a bit numb to reality, and a gun?  Seems like a great idea...

       so what’s your end game? ban SSRIs? as much as i don’t like SSRIs conversely many people have benefitted from them, i could also argue that SSRIs/psych medication in general have stopped or deterred things like this from happening due to their ability to alter your mindset; as you said they affect everyone differently, especially with people suffering from an illness like schizophrenia who are more predisposed to violent tendencies and need medication just to get through the day. i consent that people taking psych medication should not be allowed to buy a gun, that is a serious flaw. but even if that were changed the outcome is still inevitable in a psyche like this person. if you want something bad enough you’ll find a way to get it legally or illegally and if you still can’t get it you’ll find other means
      </p>
      <p>
       serial killers don’t become serial killers because medication turned them into one they become serial killers because that’s who they are deep down. obviously SSRIs change you, that’s the whole point. it’s a valid point to make that someone’s violent tendencies can be exacerbated by taking SSRIs but it’s also valid to say the opposite since they affect everyone differently. it’s beyond presumptuous to infer that medication was the tipping point that made this person decide to do something like this. as outsiders we can only speculate. we don’t know this person’s personality, what his motives were, what he was being treated for, how long he was taking x/y medication, what they were taking it for, there are so many variables you have to consider. it’s just a blanket statement to blame it on meds

       Americans seem either want shit banned or completely unregulated. SSRIs like pretty much any medication gets over prescribed or misused. You don't need to ban something if it's becoming a problem, you just need to actually address the problem. Which no one ever does.

       At that point you can't really blame the drug because you are suggesting its a latent psychological issue.

       Some people are more pre-disposed to getting drunk than others, it's proven to be genetic.  Does that mean we don't create laws to keep drunk people from driving cause it wouldn't be fair to blame the alcohol?

       It isn't that they cause it. It enables you to do it. If you don't feel emotions, it is much easier to do if you are not. That is my experience with them. There is a reason they cause suicides cause they make you not give a fuck

       bias? how do i have a bias when i admit their deficiencies while also acknowledging that they help others? and when did i say they didn’t work? i already said that many people have benefitted from them so they obviously work for certain people, they just didn’t work out for me, and you’ll find a good amount of people who have personally experienced psychiatric medication would attest that the current model of combatting depression and other mental illnesses with the medications we have now isn’t ideal

      <p>
       Basically, this is OP's argument
      </p>
      <p>
       Say there are 1,000 school shootings.  You have data for 20 of them.  In all 20, the shooter used SSRIs.  Does this mean
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         100% of school shooters used SSRIs.

       <li>
        <p>
         Fuck if we know what % of school shooters use SSRIs because the data pool is incomplete.

       I think there is a correlation / causation issue with your findings. They are talking Zoloft &amp; other SSRIs because people around them can clearly see they are troubled and are trying to help them. The fact that 90% of them have medication prescribed to them is a really, really good thing. It means that people around them, or even themselves, recognized psychiatric problem, were actively seeking help, and were actively taking medication (many cases were people who had stopped taken them).
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly I’m surprised that 90% of them were pre-identified with issues. Some medications can cause you to have feelings of disassociation, feeling like your consciousness is an observer to reality, instead of your consciousness being the agent of your reality. That feeling a little weird and can cause people to stop taking their meds, which is a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main issue here, as I see it, is if you are a parent, you would know if your kid was having these issues. You’d be the one encouraging them / checking to make sure they took their medication. If you have a kid like this, the second you feel like they might have issues, STOP getting them interested in guns. If you have guns keep them locked up, in a safe bolted to the floor, and out of site of the kid with issues. Don’t tell your troubled kid how to get your guns “in case of an emergency”. Don’t tolerate them with knives. Kick them out of the house or into intensive counseling if they persist.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you make a kid, it sucks if they have issues, but FFS, you made them, you brought them into the world, they are your responsibility. It is a lot more work than you would have wanted, but you have to be diligent.

       Correlation is not causation tho, school shootings and use of psych meds are probably both very highly correlated with depression and psychiatric illness.

       First off, thanks for down voting me for my opinion. Second, I’ve come down from SSRIs and all it made me  want to do is kill my self not others. I’m worried people will see this and be afraid to seek help or take medication to even themselves out. I’m not a fan of big pharma, let’s get that out of the way right now. What I’m saying is my meds makes me able to be me. And many others are in the same boat. And don’t get me started on everyone who needs them, but are afraid to take them because of ridiculous theories like this. 
I can assure you, the shooters did not commit these horrific crimes because of being ON SSRIs, but for most likely not being on anything .

       I think you're being glib there Matt. Independent of anything else, there is evidence that some antidepressants
       <em>
        raise
       </em>
       the risk of suicide and aggressive behaviour in under 18s, that is to say - a higher risk than would be present in the same individual otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course this is not to say 'school shootings are happening because of X' but I think it's glib to dismiss this factor as a nonsense correlation.

       Of course.  Fortunately that's why we've had clinial trials, longitudinal studies, etc.  Million of people actually feel better on this medication- there's proof in this thread.  I am a physician, and I am very wary of the pharmaceutical companies.  But these meds have been around for over a decade and have positive results.  Now let me be clear, any med that is a mood altering drug can have side effects.  But this medication literally just brings up serotonin to normal levels.  I'd not be opposed at all to longitudinal studies in teens on this.  But it isn't some massive conspiracy.  The drug largely works.

       Wow, pretty crazy to think about. People with mental issues that are prescribed drugs tend to do things that people with mental issues can end up doing. I also hear that medication is linked to 90% of suicide and 90% of self harm. How is this even a fucking headline you mutts.

       SSRIs do have their issues, no doubt about it, but acting like the drugs are the ones responsible for these crimes is laughably dumb. If you want to point a finger at anyone other than the killers themselves, point it at our failed mental health system and our stigmas surrounding mental illness, not the drugs that are supposed to be helping people.

       But what is wrong with asking the question?  Maybe these drugs bring out the worst of people with violent tendencies.  It does dull down reality, I know from experience.  It didn't make me violent, but I was never violent to begin with.  It's like drinking alcohol some men beat their wives when they drink, some sit on the couch watch star trek with a grin on their face and fall asleep.  If the drug is altering someones mind you have to consider that it could be a contributing factor and not disregard the possibility.  This is a conspiracy subreddit and we are supposed to ask questions exactly like this.  If we wanted to the cookie cutter answer we would be at

       I understand your perspective, but the fact of the matter is that there are tons of factors that go into what leads to a mentally ill person shooting up a school. Clearly the mental health system was not able to get this person under control. But mental health is too complicated to boil it down to just medication.
      </p>

       For the record, I don't think that there's anything wrong with asking the question. I was simply explaining why something like this isn't taken seriously by the MSM. Clearly they're going to stick to their partisan arguments they have every time a tragedy like this happens. None of us should be surprised by that.

       I will have to agree to disagree.  Should countless kids die until we figure out exactly what the combo is that creates this violence?  Whether you believe its the chicken or the egg in this article, there is one fact:  Take guns out of hands of people on SSRIs and you will take guns out of the hands of 90% of the people who commit these crimes.  yes some of these people still will find ways, but some won't.  It's not like one day the shooters decide I'm going to kill someone and decide on a gun.  Sometimes it can be a fantasy that builds over time just by having guns or being surrounding them.  Shooting a gun is like a drug for some people.  Never give them easy access to the drug and they may never pick up a weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would think something like you can't have guns if you are under 25 and are prescribed an SSRI would go a long way in preventing some deaths, and will still allow people who have a bit more maturity and also on SSRIs the ability to protect themselves and their family.  A 19 year old with mental issues does not need to have a gun, but that's just my opinion.  You're entitled to yours :).

       I think you may have misunderstood what I was trying to say. I actually don't disagree with your viewpoint that young people on SSRIs probably shouldn't have access to firearms unless they can prove that they are capable of handling them and/or need one. I'm saying that as a young person on a SSRI.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of my previous comment was to say that mental health issues are really complicated and we really don't fully understand them yet, that's the problem. Our current system is not working and it is a shame to see things like this happen. SSRIs are supposed to be part of the solution and while they aren't perfect, they're really one of the only things that work right now.

       Speaking generally, consider that SSRIs are given rather generously to many diagnoses. Mental illness is complicated to the extent that we don't know that they are any real than they are out of the norm. To me drugs are the absolute wrong way to go apart from in very specific cases. By accepting a person needs to be medicated is to accept that their affliction is abnormal and needs to be oppressed rather than expressed. We don't want to deal with the negativity of depression, or the deviance of many schizophrenic symptoms, so we give drugs and label it as not normal when I think in many of cases it is an honest and genuine reaction to the human condition, and need the attention and love of humanity. So I suppose you are right when you say it's complicated, because on one side of the spectrum many would prefer to dull the feelings with drugs, much like how many use alcohol, because they don't want to deal with it either.

       I have a feeling that you personally don't experience any of the conditions we are speaking about. As a person who's life has been saved by SSRIs from suicidal thoughts, I can't fathom how you could possibly call the negativity of depression "an honest and genuine reaction to the human condition". Nobody should have to feel the way that I have felt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could agree with you possibly in the case of people who have
       <em>
        incredibly
       </em>
       mild cases of depression, but nobody should be forced to endure depression without the option of treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I've previously mentioned, medication alone can't save these people. They need therapy, they need a supportive family and peers, they need a surrounding world of people who understand their issues and they need those people to be accepting of them. Tragedies like this should prove that we need
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       treatment and
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       research.

       I should be cautious because every case is different, but I feel that depression can be a stepping stone to a higher sense of living. Being dissatisfied with your own life is an indicator of a better way to live in my opinion, and should be celebrated. Depression for me is realising the ingenuity of the life I was living, it was maybe illness in that a higher reality called but I was not answering. I was never diagnosed, I wouldn't have wanted to because there were just a lot of obvious things in my life that would cause sadness so it would take away from those who didn't understand their own sadness. For me it's just a journey, and if you don't understand the journey of life you think there's something wrong with you. In a way there is something wrong, but you don't just try and return to the "norm" you look further. Some turn to God, others to spirituality, others to alcohol. It's actually terribly arrogant for me to talk for other people because it's all different, I just want to appeal to anyone that wants to think different you know.

       There was already contraversy already about SSRIs actually, including suicide and violence around when it was first introduced. It's something that is obviously hard to study and pinpoint because everybody on it has already been declared mentally ill, thus it is so easily overlooked. In my opinion it is the dulling of the mind which leads to more extreme thinking. The brain is artificially dulled but that just leads to the thoughts that caused the illness to not express themselves properly as they should, you can imagine the stereotype of the quiet one that lets things build up and because the external causes of those things are not addressed by the drug, they just become worse because most of the time they are inhibited in order to function
       <em>
        as normal
       </em>
       , but they are no lessened. So I think it's a symptom of us in regarding issues caused by the general state of humanity to be chemical imbalance, and how would you feel if your feelings were regarded so and forced away through drugs? You'd probably snap, not nearly as worse as some but for those few this approach can result in terrible consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps we can't discourage the use of the drug on these cases alone, but as an indicator that this approach to mental illness can be very flawed.

       Using a throwaway for obvious reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been perscribed SSRIs (Zoloft) for the past ~4 years on and off. I always stop taking them because they make you feel dull. I think that they can be helpful in the certain situation and patient (both mental, physical, and emotional status), they are not, however, a 'catch-all' fix it drug. Drugs are overperscribed in this country as it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never felt quite the same since I stopped taking that stuff. I wish I never did take them. Random worrying I never used to have. My brain goes all fuzzy sometimes and I can't concentrate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet 100% there's a link, maybe not the root cause, but there is most likely a link between these drugs and these actions.

       im I’m the same boat, but i was prescribed them about 20 years ago. By the same doctor Phil Hartman’s wife was seeing when she killed him. I now only smoke minimal cannabis and meditate, and it’s great. The other thing people forget is that life isn’t supposed to be rainbows and unicorns all the time. Shit sucks. People are mean. Society is a clusterfuck. The negatives should be used to guide what we want to change in the world, not some things to be dulled out by extremely dangerous drugs. Ever read the side effects panels on psych meds? The real kicker is that placebo has a HIGHER effectivity rate than antidepressants. That’s some fucked up shit right there, and the majority of the population has no idea because they don’t read the fucking manual.

       I've been on some psych meds that were fucking terrible for me, and only made things worse/produced strange/scary side effects (these same meds actually helped other people I know with the same mental illness) and I've found meds that work incredibly effectively for me with no side effects what so ever (these same meds were ineffective/produced negative side effects in others) Your anecdotal experiences with psych meds aren't in any way indicative of their general efficacy.

       My anecdotal experience is backed up by actual studies, that's the difference. Your retort is a sad and pathetic example of ad hominem. Maybe if you had any peer reviewed studies to support your claims, people with multiple science based degrees (B.S. majoring in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, double minoring in both Math and Physics, M.S. in Biophysics, going for my Ph.D.), or even just the scientifically literate, wouldn't find your kind of drivel so laughable, and you wouldn't feel so triggered when educated people corrected you.

       At this point, statistically it isn't about betting. There is 100% a fucking link between these drugs (not just SSRI's, but a lot of prescription meds) and violent crimes, specifically these super-narcissistic ones where somebody kills many people with no remorse/empathy/FEELINGS.

       The link is people who have a mental illness are more likely to both be prescribed meds and enact school shootings.  I've been on some psych meds that were fucking terrible for me, and only made things worse and produced strange/scary side effects (these same meds actually helped other people in I know with the same mental illness) and I've found meds that work incredibly effectively for me with no side effects what so ever (these same meds were ineffective/produced negative side effects in others)  Your anecdotal experiences with psych meds aren't in any way indicative of their general efficacy.

        Fact: At least 36 school shootings and/or school-related acts of violence have been committed by those taking or withdrawing from psychiatric drugs resulting in 172 wounded and 80 killed (in other school shootings, information about their drug use was never made public—neither confirming or refuting if they were under the influence of prescribed drugs).

       Let's see that data.  You just finished talking about how many people are medicated, now you're saying there is a sufficient number of severely ill people who are not medicated to conclude that they are less violent.

       The data is provided by OP is it not? 90%?

      <p>
       So 4 out of 5 shooters are on medication.
      </p>

       But here’s there data:

      </p>
      <p>
       They say 56% of mental illness undiagnosed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also say 1 in 12 youths have major depressive episodes, and that 1.7million of them receive no treatment. So again about half of those who “have it” don’t get treated.
      </p>
      <p>
       But once again the school shooters are always among those treated.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we have multiple data points that seem to imply that those who don’t receive treatment are underrepresented.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the treatment worked wouldn’t the undiagnosed or untreated be more common than the treated?

       Read the Heller opinion by Scalia, they upheld Maryland's ban on assault weapons because they constitute "uncommon use" and are clearly weapons of war. You can't own explosives either.

       Psych meds like SSRI's are a relatively new drug.

       They change the way the brain works, only slightly, but were talking about a serious drug.

       I agree completely. It we can attack this problem from multiple angles and the most practical and controllable aspect is to limit the killing power of weapons that are available to the public without any kind of training or purpose.

       I think we should actually be treating the mentally ill.  How much money would the families of the wounded and dead be willing to spend on healthcare, if only their people weren't dead?  Wouldn't it have been better to help the shooter BEFORE he shot the people?

       I agree 100%, we are way behind the curve with mental health and the stigma in this country doesn't help people seek treatment. Howevee, I also recognize use the fact that there's no way to prevent completely prevent mental illness from metasticizing into violence. I recognize that society will never be completely free of murderers. There's no guarantee to prevent weapons from falling into the hands of people who would use them to harm Innocents.
      </p>
      <p>
       By that logic, it only makes sense that we would make some effort to reduce the killing power of weapons most available to the public. The founders could have never imagined the capability of semi or full-auto weapons and even justice Scalia, in his opinion on the Colombia v Heller decision, admitted that the second amendment didn't protect these weapons of war or large magazines that extend beyond "common use." Sure, it wouldn't stop someone from using a gun to kill people.... But the number of casualties would certainly be reduced.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO it's not very sporting to have 20 round or even 15 round magazines. Rifles are too cumbersome to be used in necessary self defence. It seems to me hunters don't need anything more than a bolt action rifle. But I'm apparently in the minority of people who believes "sporting" means there's a chance you don't win. Hunters should be happy with the fact that deer don't shoot back. I know plenty of hunters have taken down big game with bolt action rifles.

       I don't think hunting is a sport.  If you're going to kill somebody, get on with it and kill them as quickly as possible, and cut down on the chance that your victim is running away in pain and fear while you reload and dick around.  Every hunter should have a semi-automatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       The decisions on killing people shouldn't be made at the level of what instrument is available.  The decision should be made at the level of who is doing the killing.  That means all forms of irresponsible, irrational nut jobs should be disarmed - whether the mentally ill, separatists, wife beaters, drug users, and the type of paranoiac who thinks they have to defend their home from droves of intruders with a gun.  There should be tests, licensing, and national databases up the wazoo.  A policeman should be able to enter an address or license plate into a database, and know exactly what kind of armaments are associated with the situation.  Maybe once we have that kind of data, ATF would have the time to hunt down weapons owned by criminals.

       It's a matter of practicality. We're never going to be able to accuratelyscreen a person's propensity for violence. All we can do is limit the damage.

       It is incredibly easy to screen someone's propensity for violence.  1)  being abused as a child  2)  living in a house where the adults are violent to each other  3) in utero and / or after utero exposure to toxins or drugs  4)  No support system / isolation  5)  recent life stressor
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not even looking at the serial killer / psychopath type stuff like incontinence, porn problems, and animal torture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, we could screen people - hospital records (psychiatric), criminal records, CPS visits, domestic violence calls.  What you mean by "never going to be able" is that we would rather spend money on our military than on building databases or providing social support for communities.  As long as we spend $297,000,000,000 annually for military contractors, I'm sure we'll be too poor to fix the "unimportant" issues.  Maybe when we cut foodstamps, or another piece of healthcare, we'll have the money we need.

       Here's the thing-- we're the world enforcers. It's not where I'd like to be but we have the most massive military expenditure because it serves our interests. I agree, it's bloated... But nobody in any party seriously believes we need to stop funding our military.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you've described is annecdotal. You won't find an academic study that suggests any of what you're suggesting. And you can't just discriminate against people becuase of their situations. The brain is complicated and we don't understand it all that well. It wasn't 50 years ago that we were giving people lobotomies for a variety of perdieved behavioral "disorders." You can't screen for violence. Period.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we can prevent the degree of harm by reducing the weapons available to the public.

       I think the key collapse in thought here is "massive military expediture because it serves our interests".
      </p>
      <h1>
       1.  What are our interests exactly?   I want some definitions at this point.  "Terrorism" doesn't really cut it.  A bunch of unemployed psychotics in the middle east are not going to be defeated by a war of attrition when the conditions there keep breeding unemployed psychotics.  Plus, you've forgotten that on 9-11, our very own vice president stopped  NORAD from intercepting the terrorists.  So, is sabotaging the USA and allowing 3000 civilian deaths an acceptable definition of terrorism, even if performed by our own vice president?   What were Cheney's/Halliburton's interests?  What are America's interests now?  Better lay down some clear definitions and objectives before the leeches finish bleeding us dry.
      </h1>
      <h1>
       2.  Is the funding commensurate with results?  $279,000,000,000, and when our guys are in trouble in Niger, the FRENCH have to rescue them, and a GD contractor has to go collect the bodies.  Meanwhile, our senators know we aren't spending money on training or maintenance, and they can't even keep track of where we're fighting or what we're doing.  Never mind that our common-man president can't remember the names of the four dead long enough to offer decent condolences.  BTW - $279,000,000,000 is the amount given to CONTRACTORS.  That wasn't even to the USA military - that was to private corporations, who also received a 14% tax cut.
      </h1>
      <p>
       That seemed like a total detour from gun control.  However, here is the connection:  We have a society that is made of many parts, from Halliburton (or, if you prefer 2018, Lockheed Martin, Academi, Aegis, GK Sierra, etc), to the baby born in the throes of opioid withdrawal.  All of those parts influence what happens here, and our state and national budgets, in turn, impact the functions of those parts.  So, the money you use on one segment of society is obviously not used on another segment.  Mass shootings are at some level a result of not using money to study, treat, prevent, etc.  For example, Nikolas Cruz - he was basically under control while his mom was alive, right?  Why was his mom not provided by HHS with training on how to raise a mentally ill person?  Why did she not have healthcare to NOT die of the flu?  How can we give the guy who called off NORAD a f'ing mechanical heart, and we can't prevent a mom from dying of the f'ing flu?  THAT'S why first world countries don't have mass shootings.  They spend their money differently.

       This is compelling; however, you can't say with any amount of confidence that these shooters would not have done this if they had never started taking SSRIs in the first place. This seems like mental health problem to me, not a SSRI problem. Who knows, maybe there would have been even MORE shootings if no one was taking SSRIs.

       Either that or you can’t read. You’ve still avoided responding to any information I gave you in the initial comment. Instead you’ve used Reddit’s favorite terms:

      <p>
       Ad hominem.

       The interesting thing about drugs like SSRIs is that symptoms often improve in "waves" when a person is first prescribed them, and it is well documented that most take upwards of 4 weeks to become effective. This is key to the "black box" suicide warning issued with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depression has physical and psychological symptoms. Physical being things like fatigue, lethargy, hypersomnia, insomnia and psychomotor impairment, to name a few. Psychological symptoms being things like anhedonia, suicidal ideation, feelings of worthlessness, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone is started on SSRIs, typically the physical symptoms will improve first. What this translates to is a person who is still possibly feeling suicidal and worthless, who was so depressed they could barely get out of bed, let alone formulate and carry-out a suicide plan now has a new found amount of energy. This is where the suicide risk comes into play, they suddenly have the energy and motivation to carry out suicide plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, I don't think SSRIs cause mass shootings.

       Sigh. If more armed people = safety, Syria, Iraq, and most inner city neighborhoods in the US would be the safest places in the world. Oh, you can't? Those places aren't safe because of "criminals?" Funny how most mass shooters weren't "criminals" before they killed. Sorry...oops! They were "mentally ill." Riiiiighhhhhtttt.

       True but thats like saying that 100% of thunder storms involve lightning. It's kind of a statement that doesn't prove anything when you actually disect it, but to many idiots when they first hear that they will be like "YEAHHH, YOU ARE RIGHT, THERE IS ALWAYS THUNDER WHEN THERES LIGHTNING".

       Yo. As I watch the news, all I could think of is the little gurl on CNN begging trump to do something on gun control. And then this happen. It’s like all the crazy shit u can think of has a weird correlation to something else that’s strangely unrelated. My mind is upside down.  The US is the upside down. It got to be. And this is another one—meds. /s back to lurking.

       This is not schizophrenia or other severe mental illness they're talking about. These are widely prescribed, maybe like Prozac? I'm not saying depression isn't a mental illness, but as someone who grew up with a full-blown paranoid schizophrenic, complete with visual and auditory hallucinations, depression is much more commonplace and the drugs are different; they work on serotonin and such, and they say they can decrease inhibition of violent acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you have all these people —
       <em>
        kids
       </em>
       — on drugs long-term to elevate their mood to survive everyday life, and they can't handle when things really get bad, or they go off the drugs.

       Is this correlation or causation? I’d argue the point that one is highly likely to be mentally ill to kill innocent children so there’s a good chance they were on some type of med for that.

       It could be that girls at that age have more ways of getting attention than boys. A lot of school shooters seem to be looking for attention/notoriety, and shooting up a school is basically instant national recognition for an act that just takes moments to commit. I seem to recall that a lot of psychologists have been recommending for years that we give as little attention to the shooters as possible by not printing their names and such, because nihilistic notoriety seekers will continue to see it as an avenue to make a big splash and get some sort of recognition in a world that didn't notice them before.

       Even if true.  People with mental illness do horrible things?  C'mon the pharm industry does enough horrible shit that we do not need to lay blame anywhere other than where it belongs.  People who should not have access to very dangerous weapons have access.  If anything mental health treatment should be further expanded.

       They will always have the chicken or the egg argument, though. Big Pharma is untouchable because of this and no one can ever prove anything even with mountains of correlation and circumstantial evidence it will never ever be enough. So many peoples lives are obviously ruined by these drugs. Even most doctors will tell you they're horrible for you. Even a lot of psychiatrists are waking up to it. But still, people want the easy way out. Pop a pill to take care of your problems. It only makes it worse.

       I don’t think this is much of a conspiracy. Anyone who goes for any sort of help when dealing with depression will have some sort of SSRI prescribed immediately.. It’s just what doctors jump to right away.
      </p>
      <p>
       The illness that arises from abusive/shit upbringings and diet is the issue. At least they went for help first off, but sadly nothing worked and they would have just snapped.

       This is just my experience with other people on psych meds, not really related to the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know quite a few people that has been - or are - on psych meds. Some of them are fine with the meds.
      </p>
      <p>
       But some of them stop being people. (I know, just hear me out) I don't recognize their behavior, I cannot connect to them empathically. They are just strange, and scary. It is like all normal human emotions are gone and I'm interacting with a puppet, or a stupid sociopath.

       As far as I know, pediatric physicians are very hesitant to prescribe, at least, anti depressants as it is known to much higher instances of adverse effects on teenagers. I don't know about ritalin/Adderall though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, if a child is on psychiatric drugs, there's something amiss with that child, beyond the prescribed drugs and/or withdrawal from.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as we all know, the onset of schizophrenia for males is late teens.

       No surprise whatsoever. Not only does Western medicine have a limited understanding of the human physiology at large, even moreso is the inner workings of the brain essentially still a mystery to science.

       Major psychological instability emerging in individuals with existing mental conditions who are taking basically experimental psych drugs is just... What else could you possibly expect?

       Antidepressants are certainly more impact full than society believes they are.  Especially so in a mind that is still developing. I'd rather doctors prescribe weed than some of the powerful drugs they give out.

       Well obviously we will need to figure out if it's the guns or the school attendance that causes it.

       So I would suggest no school for a period of 10 years, followed by no guns for 10 years.  That will show us where the problem lies.

       Most of these SSRI's are generic now and thus like $4 a month. Big pharma does a lot of fucked up things but there are literally millions of people on SSRIs and they arent all shooting up schools.  Obviously the people shooting places up have issues and are more likely to be on prescriptions than the general population.

       i've tried anti-deps once, my body couldn't tolerate that shit, couldn't eat for days, i'd vomit if i tried to eat anything. once I stopped, over course of several days the whole vomit thing stopped. columbine shooters were (at least one of em) was on SSRIs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual problem aside from the SSRIs is the fact that the dumbass curriculum actually REQUIRES kids to read about fucking columbine senior year. I remember reading that shit I was like, why is this shit in school. Next day you see the new, weird kid show up in a trench coat and acting all awkward. then someone called him out on it, and he didn't know what to say aside from the fact he wanted to troll.

       Or, bear with me here, the mental issues that require medication contribute to this issue. If all people who take aspirin experience headaches, it's probably because they took aspirin for their headache.

       Or just it is easier to report to the entire world than it was 200 years ago so you hear about it more and it may not have been school shootings but would have been mindless killing of innocents in one way or another because of the lax gun rules

       Are you saying that gun industry is insignificant? Cause I can see that your MSM constantly rails against the gun industry every time a shooting happens in your country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the biggest problem with American culture is the lack of proper family bonding. When your parents pay the minimum attention you need, you don't go full psycho and add easily available guns to that, you've got yourself weekly school shootings.

       My opinion won't be popular but I believe it's the bullying and isolation culture that happens in the US schools that causes this. Sure kids are awful anywhere but other countries have their own variables to deal with this, such as strong religious beliefs and a strong sense of discipline and honor, whereas 'muricans are self entitled and individualists AF. In my humble non 'murican opinion the only way to fix this is with mandatory weekly counseling for ALL kids in ALL schools, which would cost heaps of cash just to hire the psychologists to begin with. Besides it would never happen because you'd also have to convince the parents that therapy is an actual thing. Don't mean to offend - each subculture has their little quirks.  ¯_(ツ)_/¯

       Why in every shooting are there no life flights?  No bodies transferred to the hospital... no hurry to save anyone. I know for a fact it takes precision to kill with just one or two gunshots, and this 19 year old or Adam Lanza etc do not have that precision. Why are there always high body counts and no saved lives?

       Nah, I'm actually significantly less angry now because of the meds. And whilst it is true that meds affect everyone differently, this guy is peddling classic anti-science bullshit always brought up all-out mental health, which is why he's scum.

       its not just the pharma drugs. its more coordinated and evil than just making a drug that causes people to do shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think these drugs are designed intentionally to interact with specific symbols and messages embedded in MSM and video games. This allows them to set false flag event by triggering this kind of incident  they might not know when or who will do it, but they know it is likely to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that doesnt work they have their more hands on mk ultra approach. Ted Kazunski, James Holmes (dark knight shooter patsy), and Charles Mansen had clear MK ultra connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       In science these connections between mk ultra and shootings would be considered statistically sitnificant, meaning that it shows that there is a clear link between mk ultra and violent shootings in modern US history.

       Yeah I think so too. Like if your underlying issues are negativity, anti-culture, don't fit in, etc, then it amplifies those aspects and causes these sorts of people to go deeper into darker aspects of culture until they snap in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think alcohol, weed, benzos, and other things like foods, BPA's, fluorides, etc cause interactions as well

       The conspiracy is to set up Americans for a life long treatable diseases, so pharmaceutical companies can keep selling you designer poison for life. That's the whole goal of vaccines, the pharmas are double dipping, they make money on the vaccines, and then they make money treating your auto-immune disorders.

       The most effective and efficient thing we can do now in the short-term is to arm Teachers and Admins for self-defense.  Imagine several frequently trained Teachers at your school with AR15s locked in special cabinets in their classrooms.  Like I said, this is a
       <em>
        temporary
       </em>
       counter-measure, we have a major issue with enforcement of gun laws and we need to improve laws such as auditing families with suspect children (like this recent scumbag).  Taking guns if anything is long-term, we need effective action today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowing Teachers to legally possess a firearm costs almost nothing, and if there is a way to allow personally owned weapons, that would further reduce the cost.  I know of many Teachers who would be pro-gun as in willing to buy their equipment, as they dont want to die or see others die, so
       <strong>
        enabling actual self-defense
       </strong>
       against shooters is key to survival.

       This is why you have to rule out bipolar disorder before starting an antidepressant.  Antidepressants can cause people to switch to mania, which can open the door to all kinds of terrible problems.

       I don't know why people think this is so far fetched. It's basically the hypothesis of "The Bourne Legacy," when they imply that mass shootings are done by people on mind-controlling drugs, in the lab shooting scene.

       it's almost like guns are linked to 100% of school shootings. and 100% of guns are designed to kill.
      </p>
      <p>
       SSRIs linked to 90% of school shootings. 100% of SSRIs are designed to treat depression and similar illnesses. 80% of depression cases improve with SSRIs. millions and millions of people take SSRIs and millions and millions of people don't shoot up schools. what do you wanna do? ban SSRIs?
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm no psychiatrist, but as someone who takes SSRIs i was warned of the slight increased risk of suicide they bring, because, as far as i know, if you have suicidal thoughts, these give you energy to recover, but in a minority, also energy to go through with it. also, there's an increased rate of suicide among people on SSRIs just because they're probably suicidal already and no drugs a miracle cure. iirc 1% of people with suicidal thoughts also have homicidal thoughts, so i'm guessing the same could apply and yeah, maybe 90% of school shooters are on antidepressants. but that's such a small minority of people on antidepressants in general, do you not realise that maybe its the guns and the homicidality that's the problem not the fucking drugs prescribed to treat it ??

       It is really tragic that the real problem gets pushed to the side.
      </p>
      <p>
       American culture treats the mentally ill like shit.Everytime a mass shooting happens politicians talk about mental health.About loons,nutjobs,crazy People.Yet when it comes to funding for mental health causes they always say no.Ever heard of Greyhound therapy?That's the prefered choice.
And btw. the mentally ill are far more likely to experience violence rather than be perpetrators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately lobbying leaves me with nearly zero hope for any positive change.Be it gun regulation or mental health.

       Well yeah - but I think you're looking at it backwards.  People who don't feel like shooting up a school, aren't going to be on the drug.  If you feel like shooting up a school, you'll be on the drug pronto.  The police had him in the police cruiser for only minutes before they were all, "hell, no - we need some sedatives here", and packed him off in an ambulance.  The problem is that the drugs aren't as great as everyone hopes.  They aren't antibiotics.  What a person that feels like shooting up a school actually needs is a lot of human support on top of the semi-decent drug.  You also don't hear people talking about the cost of seeing a counselor, or surviving without money while being unemployable.  Was the guy on SSDI?  Was he seeing a counselor for cognitive behavioral therapy at least once a week?  Was his family being educated on how to handle a mental person?  Nope.  Well, instead of paying for his healthcare, we now have a bunch of dead, and we can pay to keep him in jail.

       Anti-depressants help many people. But some people have awful side effects with them, or the drug doesn't work on a particular person.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years ago I was prescribed Adderal. Well, if you know me online (check my posts) and in real life, I am a very kind person. Yes, even online. Well, Adderal made me mean! I was actually picking verbal fights in real life (which is totally not me).
      </p>
      <p>
       I finally figured out it was the medicine and stopped taking it. After a few days, I was back to normal.

       AD drugs and SSRI's are proven to have no statistical benefit higher than placebos when real scientific tests are actually done on them.

       Well, in my case, they did work (except the Adderal). Not on them now. But for the brief time I was on them, it helped.

       But I do agree that it doesn't help all people. And also, in some cases, has bad side effects.

       Think bigger, people. If you were leading the world’s first superpower from the shadows as it slowly started collapsing, would you:
      </p>
      <p>
       A: clamp down on enforcement of the populace
or
B: encourage lots of gun ownership to prevent outside invaders from getting any ideas
      </p>
      <p>
       Cos every shooting leads to ONE thing: more gun sales. Think about it. The U.S. is a porcupine of gun owners. No one in their right mind would invade.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way for every mass shooting to be a false flag. But people that believe in Dems v Repubs or liberal v conservative don’t deserve to call themselves theorists. Go watch your TV. The world is bigger than those bogeyman stories that never come true. So think bigger.

       Sometimes I wonder, is the best way to fix depression to use synthetic chemicals targeting a single neurotransmitter in the brain?  Perhaps there are things the brain / body is actually designed to take in that will bring the mind and body back to normal.

       Shootings are correlated to SSRIs because that's what they prescribe for depression. Imagine that; depressed people kill themselves and others at a higher rate than normal people. Who knew?

      <p>
       Not sure the issue is meds or mental illness. It's super easy to play the mental illness angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mass shootings and killing people are not symptoms of any specified mental illness.
      </p>
      <p>
       One can be suicidal or homicidal and not have a formal mental illness diagnosis.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no medicine that is designed to treat suicidality or homicidality.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are thinking about hurting yourself or others, please get help.

       What if the whole thing starts with our education system , then moves over to our television programming, then moves to the next step like lack of jobs ? The whole depression cycle has been started and then we have the big push on the availability of guns . Ever notice how the school shooters are never shot and killed?

       Yes, the people are unstable, but it is the drugs that send them in this direction.  The drugs can make a depressed person psychotic.  There is a meaningful link that needs to be looked at more carefully.

       I'm fully aware as I've been on SSRi's...but even people like me have a conscious. To blame the meds is one thing, to draw a correlation and say it's the meds is another. It makes more sense to draw the conclusion that most people who commit these crimes are severely  disturbed People, not just someone who's depressed.

       I used to work in a residential treatment center for violent teenagers. I gave them their medications.
      </p>
      <p>
       One drug in particular called Seroquel was supposed to treat schizophrenics and severe anger issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many kids on it complained it really fucked with their heads. From what I saw it made them into unnatural zombies. What was scary about it is when a kid would stop taking it even for a day, they would often go crazy, becoming angry and violent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had kids intentionally not take it knowing it would make them act up to get revenge or attention from guards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure if Seroquel is in the same class of drugs, but it is widely administered to the same kind of kid as Kruz in US institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody should have to take it.

       its a good question. When we try to figure out why so many school shootings happen in America, we have to consider psychology, culture, medication, gun access, human nature, and ton of other facets that make this a very complicated area of study

       No, it's because it's just as easy to get a gun. If you go to a place where it is more difficult to get a gun, like, say, England, you find a lot more assaults with knives.

      <p>
       People are going to go on killing each other for whatever reasons exist in the current social culture. Whether it be terrorism, government sponsored terrorism, mental health issues, racism, or any of the million odd personal reasons somebody thinks that it's okay to take other's lives. They are simply going to find the best tool they can for the job. I work with a knife in a kitchen and I can absolutely guarantee you I could kill a man with just as little effort with that knife as I could with my gun. The
       <strong>
        ONLY
       </strong>
       difference would be in how close I needed to be to do it.

       Nope. I'm agreeing with the person above that correlation isn't always causation. In your link the US is at 110 per 1000, and Iceland, the second highest, is at 106 per 1000.

       If tracking anti-depressants and it's link to school shootings in America while trying to discover a connection across cultures, I would think it prudent to consider anti-depressants culpability in a variety of other destructive behaviors as well. Something like seeing if there is an increase in Japan of dudes going to the suicide Forrest and an increase in suicide bombings in a place like maybe Pakistan or Iraq and it's potential connection to anti-depressants, if that makes sense? What exactly this vague notion would tell researchers I'm not sure, but it passes my personal kinda makes logical sense off hand sensibilities.

       If Iceland simply doesn't have guns or a ton but still a ton of anti-depressants, than Iceland should be studied for culturally relevant or specific deviant and/or destructive behavior.

       This again filters people. You need more money and connections to get illegal guns. You need to find some one that has proper weapons and is willing to take a risk of selling to you. There is added risk with the possibility of sting operations or seller just jacking your money. Again reducing the odds of a mass shooting.

       I never experienced it personally but I had a friend who tried to kill himself and a family member who went on essentially an insane crime spree both while on zoloft. Numerous other people have told me that Zoloft made them insane and if they stopped taking it it made them hyper-depressed.

       I’m thinking maybe you could be on the wrong stuff. Just a thought though. Don’t get me wrong some people benefit from meds so that’s fine with me. They could possibly transition you if you’re trying to get off Zoloft. Don’t take anything I’m saying seriously. Absolutely talk to a doctor.

       I'm fully aware as I've been on SSRi's...but even people like me have a conscious. To blame the meds is one thing, to draw a correlation and say it's the meds is another. It makes more sense to draw the conclusion that most people who commit these crimes are severely  disturbed People, not just someone who's depressed.
