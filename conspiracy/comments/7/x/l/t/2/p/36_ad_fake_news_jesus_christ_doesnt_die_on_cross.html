       all-star conspiracy cons: Jesus Christ, old skool original. Whether it's healing the sick, raising the dead, or befriending whores and homos and thieves and even murderers, he scams his way past two of the most dangerous (ancient) regimes in history...Jews and Romans...escapes death and finds himself a piece of paradise on the other side.

       You mean in the minds of anyone who actually took the time to read the 3 stories? Horus wasn't born of a virgin, and won his Dominion in a "boat race", and Mithra "was born, bearing a torch and armed with a knife, beside a sacred stream and under a sacred tree, a child of the earth itself. He soon rode, and later killed, the life-giving cosmic bull, whose blood fertilizes all vegetation"

       This isn't a debate. I'm simply parrying your unending string of ad-hominem attacks. If the future of man is atheist, then man has no future. The material world is simply the incarnation of the greater spiritual reality. Even the new agers know this. Where does that leave you?

      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at this world. Every decent new thing is made by scientists the vast bulk of whom are atheist. By far.
      </p>
      <p>
       Matter of fact almost every person with any post secondary education is, in fact, atheist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Because reasoning and intelligence, education and reality are all tied together.
      </p>
      <p>
       They say around the globe that "atheist numbers are growing"
      </p>
      <p>
       Well they aren't actually. What it is is that we are allowed to say it now without fear of losing our jobs or, quite frankly, our lives... as used to happen. And still happens in some crazy off the rails, fanatical countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it is coming to your turn. Your turn to be humiliated and ridiculed for your inane beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beliefs founded in fear and ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fear of death. Fear of your fellow man and ignorant of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a few generations ago a person dare not say they were atheist. The Christian "moral majority" would see you ruined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man is not in peril. We are in the dawning of a new era. Am era unhindered by pathetic superstition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like a primitive man scared of lightening, you people wallowing in fear. Fear of the unknown. The unknown that your predecessors tried to answer with superstitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like a baby with a security blanket humans will shed this archaic beliefs. And I welcome the new era

       1 For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves, but not aright, Our life is short and tedious, and in the death of a man there is no remedy: neither was there any man known to have returned from the grave.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 For we are born at all adventure: and we shall be hereafter as though we had never been: for the breath in our nostrils is as smoke, and a little spark in the moving of our heart:
      </p>
      <p>
       3 Which being extinguished, our body shall be turned into ashes, and our spirit shall vanish as the soft air,
      </p>
      <p>
       4 And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall have our works in remembrance, and our life shall pass away as the trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, that is driven away with the beams of the sun, and overcome with the heat thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 For our time is a very shadow that passeth away; and after our end there is no returning: for it is fast sealed, so that no man cometh again.
      </p>
      <p>
       6 Come on therefore, let us enjoy the good things that are present: and let us speedily use the creatures like as in youth.
      </p>
      <p>
       7 Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments: and let no flower of the spring pass by us:
      </p>
      <p>
       8 Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they be withered:
      </p>
      <p>
       9 Let none of us go without his part of our voluptuousness: let us leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place: for this is our portion, and our lot is this.
      </p>
      <p>
       10 Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged. 11 Let our strength be the law of justice: for that which is feeble is found to be nothing worth.
      </p>
      <p>
       12 Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous; because he is not for our turn, and he is clean contrary to our doings: he upbraideth us with our offending the law, and objecteth to our infamy the transgressings of our education.
      </p>
      <p>
       13 He professeth to have the knowledge of God: and he calleth himself the child of the Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
       14 He was made to reprove our thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       15 He is grievous unto us even to behold: for his life is not like other men's, his ways are of another fashion.
      </p>
      <p>
       16 We are esteemed of him as counterfeits: he abstaineth from our ways as from filthiness: he pronounceth the end of the just to be blessed, and maketh his boast that God is his father.
      </p>
      <p>
       17 Let us see if his words be true: and let us prove what shall happen in the end of him.
      </p>
      <p>
       18 For if the just man be the son of God, he will help him, and deliver him from the hand of his enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       19 Let us examine him with despitefulness and torture, that we may know his meekness, and prove his patience.
      </p>
      <p>
       20 Let us condemn him with a shameful death: for by his own saying he shall be respected.

       The point he is making is that the pagans literally changed Christianity 350 years after the fact to make it exactly like the sun worship religions you are talking about.  Yes the church is corrupt because of this.  That does not mean the source story is corrupt - in fact this kind of blatant attack against the source makes me more likely to believe someone is trying to cover it up.

       No. Pagans are typically polytheistic of any flavour. It was coined back when Rome turned Christian and therefore the world. It basically meant them not us. Divisive illogical and corrupt.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it funny when people say "pagan priestess" like it is a specific thing. That phrase runs the gammot from the Celts (mainly) to indigenous tribes across the globe.

       That's what I said.  All polytheistic deities are fallen angels, or their children.

       Humorous that people will recognize links between sumerian and babylonian deities or links between greek and roman deities but then we introduce the bible which nicely explains all 4 and they go a little crazy.

       Hope it works out for you.

       You live to toss your crap around. Like an irate monkey.  Like one of our distant cousins. Fitting.

       Ever notice how God always tells people that they are the chosen ones. Odds would have it at least once he would say "ya know... Those ones over there are my favorites"
