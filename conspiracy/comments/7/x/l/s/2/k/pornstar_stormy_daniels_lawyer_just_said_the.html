       Just like the Newtown false flag committed by Obama, Trump just created a distraction on the same day we found out Stormy can talk about her unprotected sex with the president.

       I'm not certain if I agree yet, but it's refreshing to hear someone suggest it, after 8 years of every shooting that happened being blamed on Obama distracting or a pretext for 'coming for our guns'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it doesn't matter who's in charge- terrible things happen, and sometimes they are 'very opportune' for a few people.

       I think it's done in the media to distract people from the horrible thing that happened and not necessarily because the horrible thing was some false flag operation. A less horrible news story that is still of big interests does really well after a tragedy because most people don't want to dwell on horrific events. Also If it was a false flag, you'd think
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       would want more coverage of it and have everyone talking about it and not cover it up immediately.

       No joke.  When the evidence countering the Russian narrative gets heavy and his approval rating is at 47% with midterms coming soon. They switch to a porn star who denied the affair but now says it happened.  Now some how it's tied to campaign shit and we have another long smear effort and anyone who disagrees is incompetent stupid or a sexist.

       Haha. She couldn't talk because of nda. Did Trump's lawyer just hand her $130k for nothing? The Russia shit is still here and in pretty much every election since Trump the Republicans have got their ass handed to them. What's it like in delusional land?

       The reason she's spilling the beans is because Trump's dumbass lawyer said yesterday that he paid her with his own money. It's amazing how incompetent these people are and how many people support this incompetence and think it's some kind game of master chess. No it's just stupid people doing stupid things.

       I read earlier today that since the payment happened during the campaign, and since it could be seen as benefiting trump's election bid, it could be construed as an illegal and unreported campaign contribution.  Before people go nuts, it does bear some similarities to John Edwards who abandoned his campaign and was later indicted on 5 charges.

       If Cohen is saying it, how is it fake news? Like I get he might be lying, but fake news would mean that the media made the entire thing up - his quote and everything.

       Coincidence. How could it be anything else? Like the government just has a bunch of shooters on the payroll they can call up with a few hours notice every time they want to distract from something? Also, there have been much bigger bombshells that have not been accompanied by shootings.

       School shootings happen every week in the US.  There are constant Trump scandals, so it isn't a coincidence that a shooting would happen right after a Trump scandal - it's expected.

       I read earlier today that since the payment happened during the campaign, and since it could be seen as benefiting trump's election bid, it could be construed as an illegal and unreported campaign contribution.  Before people go nuts, it does bear some similarities to John Edwards who abandoned his campaign and was later indicted on 5 charges.
