<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEHVR9Hj_b0">Dave Chappelle joked about that with Michael Jackson</a></p>

<p>I think it&#39;s done in the media to distract people from the horrible thing that happened and not necessarily because the horrible thing was some false flag operation. A less horrible news story that is still of big interests does really well after a tragedy because most people don&#39;t want to dwell on horrific events. Also If it was a false flag, you&#39;d think <em>they</em> would want more coverage of it and have everyone talking about it and not cover it up immediately. </p>

Before people go nuts, it does bear some similarities to John Edwards who abandoned his campaign and was later indicted on 5 charges.</p>
