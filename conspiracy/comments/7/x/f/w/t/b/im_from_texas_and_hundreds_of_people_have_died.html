       Whacking is natural, safe, and good for the ole prostate. You should see it the same as urinating or looking, it's gotta come out, pun intended. Just before bed time also outs you to sleep faster.

       Masturbation is safe it's porn addiction that causes problems. Hell even masturbating too much can be a problem. Porn is really stimulating for the brain and can lead people to need more and more of a fix as what once got them off before no longer does. It's all about balance. Always.

       So you're not doing really doing anything different down there than what many basement dwellers, like what I used to be, have been doing in the past. You've just added a prepper element to it (although that inconvinient nuclear fallout is less of a problem now) and become socially isolated to a greater extent than most people.

       The shot should be only for kids and the elderly. Those that desperately need some sort of protection due to a compromised immune system.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO teens and adults should be doing everything to stay healthy BEFORE it ravages their bodies. Staying hydrated and well rested are top priorities. Too many people are over worked and exhausted, eating like crap and not well hydrated. Bad combo during the flu season.

       A saline nasal spray also works similarly.  The sinuses harbor a lot of biological material that tends to get inhaled into the lungs.  Cleaning that out hastens recovery.

       Doesn't matter because apparently the vaccine is only about 10% effective this year. It's apparently due to how the vaccine is cultivated in chicken eggs, which makes the virus mutate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strange how it's getting less and less effective each year, yet there's a bigger push each year to get vaccinated.

        CDC conducts studies each year to determine how well the influenza (flu) vaccine protects against flu illness. While vaccine effectiveness can vary, recent studies show that flu vaccination reduces the risk of flu illness by between 40% and 60% among the overall population during seasons when most circulating flu viruses are well-matched to the flu vaccine.

       CDC study? Eh, face value not taken. I  need unbiased 3rd party data, just like NASA or any other goverment agency study.
      </p>

       And even considering the fudged data, a vaccine that's only effective half the time shouldn't be called a vaccine. Should call it something else, make it sound scientific...how about Hail Mary Flu Shot,  Flu Shot

       I don't know about that, I'm 51 and myself and almost all the children I grew up with caught measles, rubella, chicken pox and mumps (thankfully I missed that one!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Of my children's and grandchildren's generation the only thing I have heard of is chicken pox, of which I don't know of any vaccinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also my much younger sister had whooping cough at under a year old as she was refused the vaccination due to my other sister being epileptic. I remember the fear that we were going to lose her as she couldn't breathe for coughing and turning blue. That was the number one vaccination I made sure my kids were ok to have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where I am against them is having so many at the same time, not letting their young bodies have time to recoup. Unless of course you are wealthy enough to afford to have them done private, then you can elect for single vaccinations.

       I agree some vaccines are a great idea to get, but I think 50-70 or so is not good for kids, seems like a reasonable statement yet we're considered wackjobs at the pharmacy

       In my comment on this thread, I give a small example how mutation actually occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are right though, the additional bird DNA that may be left over may also be signs of the prevalence of "bird flu's" since the rise of flu vaccine use. The mutating virus requires a host, and a secondary infection/or a primary in the case with the flu shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to no vaccines, a person needs to become infected with 2 strains for them to mutate. There are some host pressures that may be exhibited that may cause mutation but nothing like the mutagenicity of multiple influenza infections.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to the vaccine, left over influenza components/proteinous structures and left over bird DNA/proteinous structures could lead to much higher mutagenicity if a person becomes infected with another influenza strain.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to the first example (No flu shot), there would be higher mutagenicity if both strains are lower or upper respiratory infections, if they are separate, one upper, one lower, the mutagenicity would be reduced.

       I have only my personal observations to add here and multiple other things could be effecting things but my family has horses and I have noticed a huge leap in the number of strangles outbreaks here in North East UK since the introduction of the strangles vaccine about a decade or so ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vaccine was put on hold for a while as a lot of horses vaccinated were still contracting it and becoming seriously ill.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was only for a short time though before it was available again and one of the problems with it is probably most horses are collectively kept in livery yards, sharing paddocks, buckets, tool etc. You get a few owners on the yard that vaccinate and the others don't follow suit and the unvaccinated horses contract it from the others (if that is not possible I'm happy to be corrected by someone with more knowledge).
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been around horses my entire life and actual strangles cases were almost unheard of but greatly feared as it is so contagious. Now it has been doing the rounds in my area for the last few years, thankfully our herd are kept on land we rent from farmers but the were several outbreaks within a few miles of us just this winter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Myself and family members have been mulling whether it is the very long wet but mild winters or if it is due to the vaccinations. Also whether the flu in the human population has similar patterns.

       I don’t know that there are more deaths than usual but it’s hard to ignore ones that hit close to home. I live in FtW, Tx and grew up in Parker county where the teacher died that couldn’t afford her copay to get her Rx meds. Given our current political atmosphere here in states everything is politicized and news will run with it to fit a narrative.

       Dude if this is a bio-weapon its a fucking terrible one.  More likely that it's just a bad flu year. The 1918 flu is thought to have killed 3-5% of the worlds pop, and that was certainly not engineered.

       I'm going to repeat this one more time, in case someone missed it. Sorry if you're seeing this for the second or third time.

       For anyone worried about this.

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling">
        Linus Pauling
       </a>
       , one of only 4 people to have ever been awarded 2 Nobel prizes (his scientific Nobel is in chemistry), spent a large part of his life studying
       <strong>
        the effects of Vitamin C
       </strong>
       , what he calls “megavitamin” therapy, and its near-miraculous healing power.
      </p>
      <p>
       See his 2004 book,
       <em>
        Healing Cancer: Complementary Vitamin &amp; Drug Treatments
       </em>
       , or his 1987 book
       <em>
        How to Live Longer and Feel Better
       </em>
       in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
       Per this particular thread, I can also mention his 1977 book
       <em>
        Vitamin C, the Common Cold and the Flu
       </em>
       .

       And again, realize who this man is.

      <p>
       Look also into
       <strong>
        liposomal vitamin C
       </strong>
       (a way to increase one’s intake of the nutrient).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is probably one of the biggest medical discoveries of our time. The reason nobody speaks about it (and indeed the reason it is suppressed) is because ascorbic acid cannot be patented and is extremely easy &amp; cheap to produce.

       That's true but there's no sense in being over-cautious with it, since, as you point out, the excess is harmless since the body filters it out.

       Better take too much and allow it to be effective, than too little and suffer for no reason.

       Actually not with lipo vitamin C and we open a capsule of 500 mg of niacin into the shot glass of lipo it’s called a cold bomb. And i have plenty of colloidal silver and a nebulizer on hand for pneumonia just in case.

       If they can't make money off of vitamin c (which is complete bullshit) then why is the supplement industry a multi billion dollar industry?

       Vitamin C is extremely low-margin because the barrier of entry to produce it is very low, i.e. there is a lot of competition.

       Anyway I don’t need to convince you (or anyone else). If you want to falsify Pauling’s findings please be my guest (link me to your book once it’s published, I’ll read it eagerly). As for me, I merely provide readily-available information people may not be aware of, and exclusively for those who are ready to consider it.

       Didn't the FDA recently restrict ascorbic acid as a cancer treatment....speculatively, because no big pharma could patent it?  I think that is very telling and personally, I know a guy who beat prostate cancer about 15 years ago with little more than routine vitamin C injections.
      </p>

       I also seem to remember that vitamin C only works on certain types of tumors, so there's that, too.

       Liposomal vitamin C is unnecessary and more expensive than ascorbic acid or mineral ascorbate forms.  Ascorbic acid works fine. Virtually all of what we know about supplemental vitamin C is derived from studies that used either plain old ascorbic acid or a mineral ascorbate like ester-c.

       Here is OP’s submission with better paragraphing:
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2017-18 flu season continues to take a toll in Dallas-Fort Worth, and officials say it's too soon to know whether the worst is over.
In North Texas, several counties have seen flu deaths. Below are the most up-to-date numbers:
      </p>
      <h3>
       Dallas County: 62
      </h3>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Two deaths were reported Friday in Dallas County, bringing the season's toll to 62.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        That's more than three times the 17 flu-related deaths reported in the entire 2016-17 season, health officials said.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        The most recent victims were 90 and 98-years-old and both were Dallas residents, officials said.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
       Collin County: 14
      </h3>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Collin County had reported 14 flu deaths as of Wednesday. All the victims were adults, chief epidemiologist Jawaid Asghar said.
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
       Tarrant County: 24
      </h3>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Tarrant County reported 24 flu deaths as of Wednesday. All of the victims were adults, a health department spokesman said.
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
       Denton County: 7
      </h3>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The sixth and seventh flu-related deaths were reported in Denton County on Wednesday, according to KXAS-TV (NBC5).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>
       Parker County: 1
      </h3>
      <ul>
       <li>
        One flu death has been reported in Parker County as of Wednesday, according to KXAS-TV (NBC5).
        <br/>

       "The issue is not with adjuvants when in regards to the flu vaccine, the issue is with the virology of influenza and its mutagenicity.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you give someone a flu vaccine for a strain that is dominant that year, it could lead to higher mutagenicity, especially if the strain within the vaccine is of a lower respiratory influenza, and you also get attacked by a secondary lower respiratory influenza infection from another strain (visa versa for upper), this will lead to high mutagenicity, especially considering you have introduced dead components of another influenza, that although may be dead by itself, some of the proteinous structures and components could still be salvagable by the secondary attacking influenza leading to much worse complications, pneumonia, etc. EDIT (BUT if you are given a vaccine for a lower respiratory flu, and develop a secondary upper resp. flu (or vise versa), it has a lower mutagenicity than if they are both localized to the same area of the respiratory system)
      </p>
      <p>
       This is becoming a consistent trend, I don't even need to talk about the adjuvants, I am all about the virology*."
