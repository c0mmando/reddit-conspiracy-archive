    <div class="md"><p>Copypasta from an earlier comment of mine tonight:</p>

<p>For those who still doubt Pgate, or even the potential for something of its scope- here are some places to start:</p>

<p>Conspiracy of Silence- banned documentary detailing US political Elite child abuse in the late 80&#39;s that ran all the way to the WH: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBSIDQt5Dwc&amp;amp;t=6s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBSIDQt5Dwc&amp;amp;t=6s</a>
Dutroux Affair- child abuse involving European political Elite and Nobility- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1cm0t3/original_research_the_mountain_of_evidence_for_a/</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s some more recent happenings- Dennis Hastert, former Speaker of the House, banned by a judge from being alone with children due to his degeneracy- <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/13/us/dennis-hastert-restrictions-children/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/13/us/dennis-hastert-restrictions-children/index.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what the major difference is between Pizzagate and what you posted? Evidence.</p>

<p>&quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot; details the whole Franklin ordeal - this actually went to court and while victims were silenced and persecuted for their willingness to testify, widespread evidence of criminal behavior was found. </p>

<p>&quot;Dutroux Affair&quot; also had mountains of evidence tying it to real people and real events. As did Hastert&#39;s crimes.</p>

<p>Pizzagate (or Pgate, a term which only came out because people started realizing that Pizzagate had no evidence and no basis in reality) has none of this - no victims, no identified crimes, no testimony, etc. The entire case consists of memes and images with arrows and lines on it that are supposed to somehow prove the existence of an occult-related group that sacrifices children. It&#39;s all &quot;supported&quot; by a bunch of &quot;suspicious&quot; images tied to an Instagram account - oh, and the fact that the players were closely associated with the Democratic party.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It IS a psyop in that it was meant to be a distraction from other things disclosed in the email hack to give them time to cover their tracks from internet research.  It backfired a bit because it actually hurt Clinton along with the related spirit cooking.</p>

<p>Then Q was made to direct internet investigations to both distract, test propagation of memes “he” instructed them to make, and to experiment with mind control in the form of extreme paranoid propaganda to create “alternate realities” I.e. to get people to believe utter nonsense.</p>

<p>The <em>Information War</em> is not a relatively benign thing like google or Facebook or twitter censoring posts, it is proving the limits of internet and social media based “mind control” (really influencing perceptions of reality).</p>

<p>&quot;Conspiracy of Silence&quot; details the whole Franklin ordeal - this actually went to court and while victims were silenced and persecuted for their willingness to testify, widespread evidence of criminal behavior was found. </p>

<p>&quot;Dutroux Affair&quot; also had mountains of evidence tying it to real people and real events. As did Hastert&#39;s crimes.</p>

<p>Pizzagate (or Pgate, a term which only came out because people started realizing that Pizzagate had no evidence and no basis in reality) has none of this - no victims, no identified crimes, no testimony, etc. The entire case consists of memes and images with arrows and lines on it that are supposed to somehow prove the existence of an occult-related group that sacrifices children. It&#39;s all &quot;supported&quot; by a bunch of &quot;suspicious&quot; images tied to an Instagram account - oh, and the fact that the players were closely associated with the Democratic party.</p>
