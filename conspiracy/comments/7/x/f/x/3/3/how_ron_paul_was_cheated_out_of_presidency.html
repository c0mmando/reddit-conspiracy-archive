       Ron Paul carried our flag in 2012...Unfortunately the MSM, Fox News included, colluded to suppress Ron Paul's candidacy during the 2012 Republican primaries due to his anti-establishment agenda. Policy objectives such as auditing the federal reserve, abandoning the Bush era policy of 'pre-emptive war,' while completely withdrawing from Iraq and Afghanistan and every other nation where we currently occupy militarily, cutting taxes defined the campaign of a true patriot, Ron Paul, and he garnered massive support for throughout the entire United States of America but the televised media colluded to suppress this and his message...Four years later...they willingly gave us Trump. Strange how things play out eh?

       Not necessarily, no. I've been here long enough and have talked to enough people to know, that, we have many Marxist normies here as of late, who would downvote how Ron Paul was cheated. It certainly wouldn't be conservatives or Libertarians downvoting it, now would it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a Voluntaryist these days, but, voted for Ron Paul when he ran. I think he was exactly the person we needed to truly downsize the federal government, and return power back to the States and then ultimately, we the people.

       I've noticed it too, but it's coming from polar opposites and all you seem to do is turn up the volume.  This has no longer become a bastion for free thinking, and you have taken a stance on one side of the hill doomed to cave in on itself by throwing around horse shit terms like, "normie", and "marxist".  It simply invites dispute, and turns away people that might have a place in r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       On topic, Ron Paul has been a check valve allowed to stay in power, because people are much less resistant to take action if they believe in their heart someone out there is speaking for them.  Rest assured, Ron has no power, is going no where, and will do nothing to stop the tidal wave of liquid shit being dumped on the average american.  He is required by design.  Stay comfortable enough to do nothing.

       There seems to be a great shift going on in many libertarian outlets towards totalitarianism. First Infowars, obviously. Then Zerohedge (it started with the Gatestone Institute articles, recently they even had an article promoting the fear porn of "automation" and blaming "late capitalism" instead of socialism for unemployment).
      </p>
      <p>
       Today I saw an article from the Mises Institute railing against the individual liberty and natural rights of children, by defending male genital mutilation in the name of a judeophiliac "freedom of religion".

      <p>
       A lot of people are being sucked in ;(
      </p>
      <p>
       It's difficult to believe those outlets may have been controlled opposition from the start, and are now operating their turn-around. But that may be the case.

       Wow. They are supporting child abuse via forced hormone treatments? Ans surgery?  No one under 18 should be subjected to any of this and the studies prove it that a majority of gender confused children normalize and embrafe their biology.  I think it's normal as a kid as we begin first to realize there are genders to questioning if and how we fit.

       By male genital mutilation I meant circumcision. It is child abuse, especially because it causes acute pain and because there are thousands of botched circumcisions every year that lead to handicapped or grotesquely disfigured sexual organs.

       I will disagree with you regarding Circumcision. It is not mutilation, at least when done properly. We watched it done on my son by a Rabbi in the traditional way. My son wasn't really hurt by the procedure, just annoyed we held him down. Not really much bleeding, and after a few days of being gentle, he was good to go.

       Well considering my son is well ahead of his age on all development fronts, I'd disagree.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I do realize there are numerous factors at work - vaccines for example, ruin kids' mental function, and we don't vaccinate - and that every person develops at their own pace, and rating people against each other isn't really that telling or beneficial.
      </p>

       I'll have to keep my eye out and do more research on this topic, but I have my doubts. Like I said, he was in little to no pain - however, the technique used was much different than the modern doctor's method.

       To be fair, socialism is in fact "late stage capitalism."  However, it would be a terrible mistake to miss the fact that it is socialism that is rotting out the heart of our society, while capitalism is what built it (and keeps it strong even with so much rot).

       Capitalism is a Marxist word, so I generally avoid it, because of its ambiguity. If the banker who bribes government to get a license to counterfeit money is a capitalist, then I agree that leads to socialism, as it

        is

       socialism.

       And indeed, if a "capitalist" country has a centrally-planned economy, ubiquitous corporate welfare, lobbyists in every corner of government, a plethoric military-industrial complex, negative interest rates, more regulation than anywhere in the world, the most undecipherable laws in human history, and is ruled in secrecy by an unaccountable oligarchy, then "capitalism" is bad. But then it has nothing to do with economic freedom.

       But I’ll agree with you on this: liberty leads to prosperity, prosperity produces complacency, and complacency causes tyranny. I’m not sure how to avoid this vicious cycle. Perhaps strong spiritual grounding, and placing
       <em>
        morality
       </em>
       always ahead of
       <em>
        utility

       So to me, the best answer I have found is to break the scale of the cycle down into the smallest possible components.  So instead of nationwide cycles, it's more localized.  Say state, or even city-wide at maximum.  This reduces the potential scope of damage, and makes it easier to recover because (presumably) your neighbors are at a different point in the cycle when you are in the dumps.
      </p>
      <p>
       This specifically is why I am an anarchist/voluntaryist.  I believe the answer to this problem is to break the units of government into the smallest possible pieces.  Ensure peace through universal armament
       <em>
        a la
       </em>
       Marx or the US 2nd Amendment.  Ensure justice with a combination of vuluntaryist courts and social insurance like the Xeer system.

       I wholly agree with you on the decentralization of power! Another word to describe it is
       <em>
        panarchism
       </em>
       . The end-goal of civilization is self-government, i.e. sovereign individuals. But you need internal monarchy in order to have external anarchy, and I agree we are not there yet (although, on a larger timescale, that’s the direction of History).

       Cool!
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like the only way to achieve internal monarchy is to give people room to expand their self-empowerment.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, a baby is born with the bare basics of neural function, unmyelinated throughout, nothing coordinated, primary sense is probably pain but unrefined.  Then, the baby through use and growth, puts all the connections together, myelinates the nerves, and becomes a functioning human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that are similar in philosophical frames as well.  Give people room to grow their personal philosophy to include the right of lethal force, and they will expand their functioning to include it.  But people will never grow into that power unless they have access to it: they are otherwise permanently stunted.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's dangerous and it takes growth.  You can't just give a child a gun.  You start with pocket knives, teach them about safety with small things, and it becomes a process of growth.  But the growth needs to happen, and it needs to with access to actual power.

       Just to follow-up, it made me think of this. Liberty and responsibility are reflections of the same underlying notion, projected from 2 different angles. Or, liberty and responsibility are two sides of the same coin; if you are infinitely free you are also infinitely responsible; conversely a slave is responsible for nothing, as he doesn’t decide anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can never be free if you can’t be responsible; and an ultimate form of responsibility is handling a firearm, as that has the potential of robbing a fellow human’s life from him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was in India once, asking my driver why he’d throw his plastic bottle out of the window
       <em>
        right after
       </em>
       he had lamented how dirty his country was. He seemed baffled by the question. He told me, as if it was utterly obvious, he wasn’t the one “responsible for making the streets clean.”
      </p>
      <p>
       It dawned on me as that point that the century-old caste system had deprived many people over there of any sense of personal/civic/individual responsibility, as they’d never been free.

       No I don’t; an increase in productivity generates an increase in prosperity. Similarly as the automobile, although it may have threatened the huge horse &amp; carriage industry, ultimately made everyone wealthier. Or the industrial revolution itself, or the digital age, etc.

       not true, he is one of many advocating it and warning about it. Also just because he gets MSM coverage or whatever you think makes him a shill, that doesn't mean everything he says is wrong.

       I voted for Ron in 2008 as a write in vote.  I was planning on doing the same in 2012, but somehow was unregistered to vote and didn't realize it until it was too late to do anything about it.  No clue how I got unregistered to vote.  I was going to vote for him again in 2016 but I really thought Hillary was going to win and didn't want to look back and say I didn't do my part to prevent her from being elected, so I voted for Trump and have been happy about it ever since.

       2011-2012 was a real big turning point for Reddit. Not just the Paul turn around, but there was the occupy movement that suddenly lost a lot of steam and got fragmented after its biggest posts on here. The Pao stuff, the Snowden stuff that changed the Internet into a much more gated place with https and encryption everywhere.  So much happened in such a small period of time.

       I've often wondered how much of Trump's campaign and eventual win was thanks to what was put in place to stop the Paulbots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both from the standpoint of new rules, and from the standpoint of having a lot of very angry Paulbots in the party rank-and-file who were more than happy to help pave the way for a big Fuck You! candidate like Trump.

       Nearly every time people talk about Ron Paul, they say “I don’t agree with everything he says, but I agree with him this time”... as a non-American, I don’t understand why this is so common. It seems like people feel a need not to agree with him, even if they do. But yes, the blatant censorship of Ron Paul was obvious, even to this non-American.

       For a lot of "left-leaning" people (at least before this election), they agreed with his strong and blunt anti-interventionist, anti-war stance at a time when almost all of the politicians of both parties were advocating increased foreign intervention and militarism, but at the same time, disagreed with his stance on cutting social welfare programs and overall reducing the scope of government.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a lot of "right-leaning" people, they agreed with his stance on reducing welfare, cutting taxes, and legalizing cannabis, but disagreed with his reducing the military, and many generally want government to do a lot of things that Paul didn't think it should do.

       If you look at the

       for the 2016 election (I have a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of issues with the PC, but the overall diagram is useful), Ron Paul would be even farther down on the lower right than Gary Johnson. On the positions he does hold, he's very passionate, genuine, and articulate, and that resonates with people. But he's so far out of the US Overton window that most people in the US have some things they completely disagree with.

       A lot of people also couldn’t distinguish between his desire to reduce the scope of the FEDERAL government while allowing the States to do whatever they wanted to. For example, just because the Federal government wouldn’t have Medicaid doesn’t mean that California couldn’t do it itself.

       True, I think the media is in large part to blame for that, and as far as I remember about Paul, he also personally believed that the States
       <em>
        shouldn't
       </em>
       be providing the same level of services that the federal government had been, but that the Constitution left that decision to the States, and as a Congressman or President he would do nothing to stop the States from doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, eliminating a lot of these programs at a federal level, especially if he did it over a short period of time like 4 years, would have meant that many or perhaps most States would be without these services, at least for some time. People who think government should provide the services he wanted to cut at the federal level would never have supported him.

       Ron Paul is dangerous because he thinks that corporations should have unlimited power and that if you sign a contract it should be enforced by the state as written with zero regards to human or civil rights.  It is called the right of contracting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ron Paul also doesn't think the Bill of Rights applies to the states and has explicitly stated that they could start official religions and have religious tests for office.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically he wants unlimited power for the powerful and zero power for everyone else.  Don't believe me?  Think I am over exaggerating?  He thinks the roads should be private and that the owners should be able to ban anyone they don't want on their property.  Now imagine if the road in front of your house could not be used by you unless you shopped at Store X.

       <em>
        The judges who made this unfortunate ruling simply do not understand the First amendment. It does not bar religious expression in public settings or anywhere else. In fact, it expressly prohibits federal interference in the free expression of religion. Far from mandating strict secularism in schools, *
       </em>
       it instead bars the federal government from prohibiting the pledge of allegiance, school prayer, or any other religious expression.** The politicians and judges pushing the removal of religion from public life are violating the First amendment, not upholding it.*
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        It’s important to recognize that the First amendment applies only to Congress. Remember, the first sentence starts with "Congress shall make no law..." **This means that matters of religious freedom and expression should be decided by the states, with disputes settled in state courts.
       </strong>
       The First amendment acts as a simple check on federal power, ensuring that the federal government has no jurisdiction or authority whatsoever over religious issues. The phony "incorporation" doctrine, dreamed up by activist judges to pervert the plain meaning of the Constitution, was used once again by a federal court to assume jurisdiction over a case that constitutionally was none of its business.**
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Similarly, the mythical separation of church and state doctrine has no historical or constitutional basis.
        </strong>
        Neither the language of the Constitution itself nor the legislative history reveals any mention of such separation. In fact, the authors of the First amendment- Fisher Ames and Elbridge Gerry- and the rest of the founders routinely referred to "Almighty God" in their writings, including the Declaration of Independence. It is only in the last 50 years that federal courts have perverted the meaning of the amendment and sought to unlawfully restrict religious expression. We cannot continue to permit our Constitution and our rich religious institutions to be degraded by profound misinterpretations of the Bill of Rights.*

       Did you read what I wrote? In this age of bought and sold politics, honesty and integrity are more important than platform. At least to some of us.

       I feel that a candidate attempting to work in the interest of the people will do better by us than one trying to work in the interest of themselves/their masters.  Left and right goals align more than the goals of humans and corporations.

       Even if we somehow had a propaganda-free election, Ron Paul wouldn't have won in 2008 or 2012. Most Democrats and even a fair number of Republicans want the government to do more than Ron Paul was advocating.

       Ron Paul had monumental backing up to the RNC - it was enough that everyone, including the news outlets, were thinking he was going to be getting the nomination. Then they changed the rules last minute so he couldn't even speak, preventing him from having a chance of accepting/fighting for the nomination. Cause a big fuss, pretty much split the party in half right then and there, there was a big ruckus (I recall around 40% of the RNC attendees) threw a big fit and eventually stormed out because of it.

       You're right, but he should have had a voice in the Convention.  By the rules, he should have been allowed to take part in setting up the Party platform.

      <p>
       He would not have won, but he would have influenced the GOP, and if they had let the young energy into the Convention, then it would not have turned on them with Trump.

       For sure. The GOP and the media did screw him over, but I think the idea that he ever had more than the remotest possibility of winning the general or even the primary had they not changed rule 40 is a stretch.

       I agree.  The Rule 40 change was just to keep him out of the convention altogether.  It was mean-spirited.  A gentlemen's court would have allowed him in, and allowed him to have his voice as was appropriate according to the rules.

       Back when I was in college he packed A&amp;M's campus...they had to set up TVs all over campus so people could see, we got to the auditorium (a massive one, mind you) 1.5 hours early, and still barely made it into the back rows.

       When they changed the rules at the RNC to screw him out of getting the nomination, I realized my vote didn't matter at all. Always had that feeling, but it set me on the path to confirming it all was just a big show.

       That's not the reality I witnessed. Every single moment of media coverage about Trump throughout the primary elections was downplaying his chances of being a serious candidate. Fox, along with the rest of MSM wanted an establishment candidate like Cruz, Rubio or Jeb to face off against Hillary. Saying that corporate media ever promoted Trump is flagrant horse shit. Can you produce even one example of MSM promoting Trump? It didn't happen. The only reason Fox pretends to support Trump now is because half the country wants that perspective and Fox is happy to take those ratings.

       His rallies were on TV every day. His every utterance was covered 24/7 and repeated by every serious media personality.  He was on television CONSTANTLY.  CNN showed empty podiums at his rallies before he would go on stage.

       Meanwhile Bernie was selling out 30,000 seat stadiums and not once was that shown on Television.

       The coverage was ALL negative. They weren't showing Trunp rallies in a positive light. There was a lot of "free media coverage" but it was all negative. If there was coverage of one of his rallies it was just to point out a sound bite of Trump antagonizing protesters or stoking his own ego. I challenge you to find a single MSM report from 2016 that paints Trump in a positive light. 99% of it was all anti-Trump hit jobs.

       Man I was wanting to make a post on this for a while. For all the people taking about the DNC and Hillary cheating Bernie out of the nomination I feel like the crazy person screaming and waving my arms saying the RNC did the same frickin thing to Ron Paul! The RNC made last minute illegal rule changes, the RNC TURNED OFF THE LIGHTS ON DELEGATES and some either wouldn’t let Ron Paul delegates inside or would lock them in and vote outside as in the case with the lights. It was terrible and should have been investigated.

       And the left is shocked because people on the right do not trust mainstream media anymore...it should not surprise anyone.
Is it not funny how the left distrusted the media soooo much during the Bush years and then after 8 years of Obama they suddenly started trusting them again?

       Ron Paul is an oligarch's wet dream with the exception of his anti-imperialist positions which is why he was ignored and attacked by the Corporate Media.

       The Ron Paul campaign was fun to watch as the media made it really damned obvious that they weren't going to give him fair treatment. It sucks for Ron Paul but it showed how the corporate networks on both sides work as protectionists for the establishment.

       You're absolutely right that his candidacy and message were suppressed (and often downright dismissed), but you're wrong about one thing here:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        he garnered massive support for throughout the entire United States of America
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This isn't true. In 2008, his polling numbers peaked in the
       <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/2008_republican_presidential_nomination-2741.html#polls">
        upper-single digits
       </a>
       ; in 2012, his polling numbers never reached above the
       <a href="https://realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/republican_presidential_nomination-1452.html">
        upper teens
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Certainly, he garnered a significant amount of momentum, and developed a passionate following among certain younger voters. But it's a bit of a stretch to say he had "massive support," especially since (in both years) GOP voters were generally happy with the Republican establishment (unlike in 2016).

       That's definitely not how I remember the coverage. During the primaries I don't remember seeing anything positive in MSM, even from right-leaning news sources who were hyping Cruz and Rubio. Only smaller sources and a few pundits had anything good to say about him.

       You're off your rocker if you think they "willingly gave us Trump". The media has been nothing but negative press about him since he said he was running. Read the first chapter of Art of the Deal where Trump specifically lays out how to use the media to your advantage to by saying controversial things in order to get free press. Ron Paul was blackouted by the media, Trump simply outplayed them.

       I like Rand paul, but are you really saying the media and GOP "willingly" gave us Trump. They fought him tooth and nail every single step of the way. Have you been living under a fucking rock?

       I've noticed it too, but it's coming from polar opposites and all you seem to do is turn up the volume.  This has no longer become a bastion for free thinking, and you have taken a stance on one side of the hill doomed to cave in on itself by throwing around horse shit terms like, "normie", and "marxist".  It simply invites dispute, and turns away people that might have a place in r/conspiracy.

       On topic, Ron Paul has been a check valve allowed to stay in power, because people are much less resistant to take action if they believe in their heart someone out there is speaking for them.  Rest assured, Ron has no power, is going no where, and will do nothing to stop the tidal wave of liquid shit being dumped on the average american.  He is required by design.  Stay comfortable enough to do nothing.

       Capitalism is a Marxist word, so I generally avoid it, because of its ambiguity. If the banker who bribes government to get a license to counterfeit money is a capitalist, then I agree that leads to socialism, as it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       socialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       And indeed, if a "capitalist" country has a centrally-planned economy, ubiquitous corporate welfare, lobbyists in every corner of government, a plethoric military-industrial complex, negative interest rates, more regulation than anywhere in the world, the most undecipherable laws in human history, and is ruled in secrecy by an unaccountable oligarchy, then "capitalism" is bad. But then it has nothing to do with economic freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I’ll agree with you on this: liberty leads to prosperity, prosperity produces complacency, and complacency causes tyranny. I’m not sure how to avoid this vicious cycle. Perhaps strong spiritual grounding, and placing
       <em>
        morality
       </em>
       always ahead of
       <em>
        utility
       </em>

       Do you watch Jordan Peterson at all?  He makes a similar argument, that "rights" are

       My first thought on reading this is the horror at how often I've heard the same sentiment right here in America.
