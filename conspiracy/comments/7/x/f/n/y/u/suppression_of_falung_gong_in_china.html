<p>However I do not buy into the East vs. West &quot;we were always at war with Eurasia&quot; dichotomy. Mao was put in power by secret societies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale-China_Association">at Yale</a>.

<p>Therefore, insofar as Falung Gong is persecuted in China, and inasmuch that persecution is totally occulted in the West (rather than decried, which would be a sign of controlled opposition), I place them in the camp of the <em>good guys</em>. </p>

<p>Nothing should be a matter of &quot;belief&quot; in my opinion. But to your point, the religion of modern pharmacology (especially for chronic ailments) does indeed involve a fair amount of belief.</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; in anything, but I <em>know</em> individuals should not be persecuted, imprisoned or killed - especially when they themselves coerce no one.</p>

<p>Fair enough. Sorry about that. But I did address the main point; even if they have unorthodox/wrong ideas on health, that doesn&#39;t justify the persecution, beatings, and killings.</p>

<p>Indeed I think this idea of &quot;they don&#39;t recognize medicine&quot; is a pretext. They are a threat because they contest the morbid collectivism, and empower individuals.</p>

Therefore, one should not doubt the Sujiatun affair.

<p>No, it&#39;s a threat because it&#39;s a cult that grew too big for its britches and attempted to challenge the CCP, resulting in China cracking down and the cult founder fleeing to the US. Today, it&#39;s a US-funded propaganda mouthpiece that literally celebrates natural disasters in China as &quot;bad karma&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Threatened&quot;, lol.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s rather sad that US anti-China propaganda has to rely on a religious cult that thinks science is an alien conspiracy, David Copperfield can fly in real life, and mixed race children can&#39;t go to heaven.</p>

<p>The fact that the Western media believes this cult on their bullshit without any fact-checking or background check whatsoever just makes it twice as pathetic.</p>

<p>Promoting anything is not a crime in my book; especially the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_revolution">overthrow of a totalitarian government</a>.

<p>Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it. (Abraham Lincoln)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. ‚Äî That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, ‚Äî That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. <strong>But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government</strong>, and to provide new Guards for their future security. (Declaration of Independence, part 2).</p>

<p>Still, ‚Äúpromoting‚Äù anything is elementary, self-obvious <strong>freedom of expression</strong>. Falung Gong has never endorsed or claimed responsibility for violence against innocent civilians (that I know of).</p>

<p>The fact is, the vast majority appreciate having running water, electricity, sewers, other work than manual labor. Women are now allowed to get education and arent treated as cattle anymore. Do you even know what the fuck you&#39;re talking about? Even those i met in india were pissed that they left because now their life is worse and they cannot go back as they crossed illegally (at the demand of the dalai lama).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve met tibetans that were sad their culture is eroding, but they werent angry at china for it because they see the benefits at the same time, especially for women. </p>

<p>Can you tell me what do you think about the goal of toppling the CCP with force by the falun gong? You think it&#39;s good? You think this should be encouraged in society? How is it in your country?</p>

<p>Sorry but they simply didnt. They didnt even have proper education system or hospitals. Tibetan society is feodal, if you&#39;re not the elite, you&#39;re garbage. So for MOST tibetans, the situation improved magnitudes. For the powerful tibetans though, they see their control erode. I suggest you open a book on how Tibetan society works traditionally. They&#39;re pretty much one of the worst sect of Buddhism when it comes to human rights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think suppressing non-majority religions and harvesting their organs is bad, you fucking shill?</p>

<p>As i explained in my comments. That research is paid for the falun gong and the guy who did the study did it from london. The author says so himself on his fucking blog. I bet you didn&#39;t even read that far because you&#39;re such an expert in falun gong.</p>

<p>I dare you to go to tibet and get your world perception crushed to pieces.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m a fervent defender of cultures and i think it&#39;s really sad to see tibetan culture get eroded because of the massive influx of chinese migrants. I think many tibetans are sad to see their heritage go. But i really dont believe they hate the chinese for it. The old see their kids have happier, easier lives than they had and figure it isnt so bad after all. Side note: Funny in the west saying you are against massive influx of migrants makes you a racist, but it&#39;s MANDATORY for tibet or it&#39;s a human right violation and genocide!</p>
