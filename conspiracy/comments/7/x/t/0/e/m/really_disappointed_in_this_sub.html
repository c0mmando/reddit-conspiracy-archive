I feel like, from the outside looking in, this sub has been hijacked by TD. I&#39;ve never seen so many people screaming THEYRE GOING TO TAKE OUR GUNS before. When did this sub  become obsessed with guns?
My father is a teacher in that community and there is no doubt this guy shot up the school and killed people. 
This guy did not have mental illness. What he did have was an ASSAULT RIFLE. </p>

<p>This guy shouldn&#39;t have been able to buy a gun. Period much less an assault rifle. Why are y&#39;all so obsessed with owning these weapons? </p>

<p>So sad man. I&#39;m seriously just so confused by everyone&#39;s stance on this. If you can offer prayers and thoughts to the victims - why isn&#39;t that good enough for you NOT owning a military style weapon?</p>

<p>Anyways - let the downvotes ensue. Just hurting for my home.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not calling you an idiot.  I&#39;m asking you to define &#39;assault rifle&#39; because you are confident that it means something and I&#39;m curious what it means to you.  AR-15 is basically a brand name or design characteristic like Gran Touring (GT) for cars.  What is the specific thing you would ban for AR-15 type rifles?  The semi-auto part of it?  The magazine?  The rifle barrel?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>^ this comment is exactly what I&#39;m talking about. You knew exactly what OP was talking about when they used assault riffle, but <strong>you played dumb</strong> and call you the idiot. &quot;Because if you ban AR-15s, your just banning the name of a gun.&quot; </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m the only one here that is willing to say that the cost of having the 2nd amendment as it is, is the cost of dead children and innocent people in the public. That&#39;s just where we are and there is no other pass.</p>

<p>If I say that long riffles should only be bolt action, you&#39;ll cry muh! tyranny! and then ramble on about mental health, but offer ZERO ideas on what that would even look like, and I never see any guns rights advocates also advocating for universal healthcare. </p>

<p>So how&#39;s that for a trade? You can have all the guns you want to build yourself a bullet box bunker, brick by brick if we can also have healthcare like every other first world country on this earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have one either.  I don&#39;t think its semantics tho.  He could have done this with a semi-auto pistol that held 10 rounds.  Talking about &quot;assault weapons&quot; is like saying you want to ban &quot;good guns&quot;. I think the only ban that would actually make a difference is to limit a gun to holding 3 bullets or to ban all semi-autos, which would basically outlaw every gun in existence.  I&#39;d certainly prefer it if states were allowed to regulate as they want without the federal government stopping them, but how does that work with the rest of the US constitution?  Honestly, repealing the 2nd amendment is the <em>only</em> solution.  Let states figure it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Extreme? Have you actually calculated the odds or are you just making shit up?</p>

<p>Say you lived in San Francisco and knew 100 people. You go for a walk for an hour. You would think your odds of meeting someone you know are 300/800,000... right?</p>

<p>Well, they are actually closer to 1/10. Most people do not understand odds like this. For example, if a person lived in the same Florida town, and was a huge country music fan, the odds that they would know someone who was in Vegas and another involved in this school shooting are <em>much</em> higher than the odds that someone from another town that hated country music.</p>

<p>Besides OP never claimed to know victims in both cases. He said his (her?) father was a teacher in the same <em>community</em>, and he knew someone that died in Vegas.</p>

<p>why isn&#39;t that good enough for you NOT owning a military style weapon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why should we ban weapons because they are military styled? Does that make the bullets more dangerous? Most gun homicides in the US are done with handguns and less than &lt;1000 of them are done with rifles of any kind. Mass shootings have been done with handguns and hunting rifles too. Most people who own guns, even assault rifles, don&#39;t commit gun crimes. Why should we ban them because a very small % of people commit crimes with them? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>this sub has been hijacked by TD. I&#39;ve never seen so many people screaming THEYRE GOING TO TAKE OUR GUNS before. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This simply isn&#39;t true. It&#39;s the constitutional infringement that people are fighting against. Don&#39;t conflate the issue. People here are as pissed about the attack on free speech as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When did this sub become obsessed with guns?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sub is NOT obsessed with guns. People here question the narrative because of the continuous lies from the government.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My father is a teacher in that community and there is no doubt this guy shot up the school and killed people. This guy did not have mental illness. What he did have was an ASSAULT RIFLE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ahhhh... the good old call to authority through personal connection. There is &quot;no doubt&quot; this kid shot up the school??? It seems pretty early to have unequivocally concluded this. The kid did &quot;not have mental illness&quot;??? Again... what are you talking about? One day later and you have it all figured out don&#39;t you? You seem damned set on removing mental illness from the equation and placing the blame solely on the inanimate object used in the shooting. </p>

<p>He allegedly used an AR-15 as well. A hand gun would have worked just as well and would have been easier to conceal. The weapon used is completely irrelevant here. Do you know the stats on weapons used in killings in the USA? Apparently you don&#39;t. Hand guns are overwhelmingly used. Over 80% of killings done with a firearm are committed with hand guns. Want to ban those as well?
There are a million hunting rifles that are the same size and shape and do the exact same thing as an AR-15 does. You didn&#39;t know that did you?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This guy shouldn&#39;t have been able to buy a gun. Period much less an assault rifle. Why are y&#39;all so obsessed with owning these weapons?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Y&#39;all&quot;... how quaint. Your assertion that gun ownership equates with obsession is ridiculous. It&#39;s part of the culture. You don&#39;t understand. That&#39;s fine... you don&#39;t need to understand but your obvious ability to conflate the issue speaks volumes. You are an ill informed individual trying to make ill informed points.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So sad man. I&#39;m seriously just so confused by everyone&#39;s stance on this. If you can offer prayers and thoughts to the victims - why isn&#39;t that good enough for you NOT owning a military style weapon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you realize how long semi auto weapons have been in existence? It doesn&#39;t require a &quot;military style&quot; weapon to kill someone. The internal workings of every single semi auto rifle is the same. You are being frightened of plastic hand guards. The fact you don&#39;t know this should disqualify you from even speaking on this topic. You don&#39;t get it because you simply haven&#39;t done any research. Yet here you are running your mouth about &quot;military style&quot; weapons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyways - let the downvotes ensue. Just hurting for my home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t start with that bullshit. This sub has always been about reason and people&#39;s rights. Things haven&#39;t changed here. I would sincerely love to see you openly argue to ban all firearms instead of this pussy approach you have going here.</p>

<p>You are uneducated about the stats AND you are uneducated about what a semi auto rifle is so... who the fuck should listen to you? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>America has 5% of the world&#39;s population but we produce 30% of the world&#39;s mass shooters. We&#39;re not high on the list in terms of % of population with mental illness when compared to other countries so that doesn&#39;t really explain why we account for so many more mass shooters than other places.  </p>

<p>Maybe the truth is we&#39;re just a violent country that produces a lot of violent people. Add to that we have more guns than any country in the world (we have 260 million <strong>more</strong> gun than the #2 country on the list) and it&#39;s a recipe for mass shooting violence. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t own a gun but the second they try to tell me i don&#39;t have the right to own one, that&#39;s when i&#39;ll be getting one. they are planning something and gun control is number one on a list of priorities somewhere. </p>

<p>oh and by the way this entire thing was a staged event and your dad working in a nearby school means absolutely nothing. they keep these drills under wraps for a reason, and they&#39;re also not stupid. the only people who actually know what happened were the people (the crisis actors) involved in the actual &quot;shooting&quot;. people from a couple towns over aren&#39;t privy to it. only the people who were there know what happened and everything else is complete hearsay. stop trying to make this sub look like a bunch of inconsiderate assholes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Parliament has approved a proposal to ban the long-standing Swiss tradition of keeping army ammunition at home.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They also said it was a question of safety, as experts claim around 300 deaths every year are caused by army weapons, which also play a role in domestic violence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/soldiers-can-keep-guns-at-home-but-not-ammo/970614">https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/soldiers-can-keep-guns-at-home-but-not-ammo/970614</a></p>

<p>That was in 2007.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The period 2009-2016 saw an almost two-fifths reduction in the annual homicide rate in Switzerland, the Federal Statistical Office (FSO) announced on Monday. Attempted murder is nevertheless on the rise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The OFS also reported that murders carried out using guns became rarer. They made up 20% of cases, compared to 34% previously. Knives were the most common murder weapons.</p>
</blockquote>
