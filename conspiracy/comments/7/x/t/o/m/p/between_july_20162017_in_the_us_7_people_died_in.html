       All of these deaths are senseless. All are avoidable. And all were committed by something that is easy to obtain whether it's illegal, banned, or or otherwise. It's just another thing that gets placed on America's "To Do" list, and unless it's in the daily news it's forgotten. Maybe if addicts start overdosing 20-30 at a time inside schools, it would get a closer look. It's so easy to cast blame at guns or Trump or race, but the real problem is that people are fed up and shit is boiling over in all kinds of ugly ways. THEY have happily awaited this war WE have created.

       If it were up to me I would have just said gun deaths in general. Including gun involved suicides. I think both drugs and guns are an issue in this country that the politicians won't touch as long as big companies are funding their campaigns.

       I would include all gun deaths, but intentional and unintentional, since we can also assume there are unintentional and intentional overdoses.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, as I mentioned, despite what is a misleading comparison, both gun makers and drug makers should have certain liabilities for the products they produce.

       Yeah I agree with that. I guess I just think both these things are a huge problem and we can't do anything about it because the politicians need that corporate money to get elected. It's a damn shame and needs to change. Or for a lot of people to grow some integrity.

       It depends for me. If they are only impacting their own lives then its their lives and they can do with it as they want.  But it becomes more of a problem/issue when they are impacting the lives of other people.

       should we consider others feelings for all our actions? personal suffering is way more important than people grieving.
      </p>
      <p>
       if people have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and they fill suicide would fill all those areas- I fully support them.

      <p>
       asking someone to suffer, whether emotionally, physically or any other way because it might upset others is immoral.

       it's not the suffers fault that others have unhealthy grieving habits. it would be no different, than an accidental death.

       I said it was my thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And your trading 1 sufferer into 2 or 10. So now we have let’s say 5 suffers after the first killed them self.  So out of those 5 we can say 2 will kill them selves. Then there might be 13 people that are suffering and out of those 13 people maybe 5 kill them selves.
      </p>
      <p>
       If suicide was legal and was not looked down on then you could have a run away issue where 1 could become 100’s.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am saying that suicide could be the answer for some people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also look at another thing that is really a solo thing. Why do we have seatbelt laws when the only person your hurting is yourself?

       except for all the municipalities in the world and all the suicides say that doesn't happen.

       seat belt laws are also immoral. there is no victim and it doesn't mean the criteria for a crime. it's just more policing for policings sake

       Sure but those are less effective. Women attempt suicide at a higher rate than men but more men die of suicide. Why do you think that happens? Probably because men use guns at a much higher rate which are much easier to kill yourself with and take much less effort to prepare.

       How is it valid? One is given to you by a dr after they were more than likely paid by the company that produces the product and kills you slowly. The other is purchased by an individual and used by them. One has really only one intended purpose and abuse of that is what leads to death. The other can be used for a multitude of things one of which is causing death.

       And let me back up. I think you are overthinking the comparison. OP was just making a point that more people die from drug overdoses than from gunshot wounds. We could perhaps have a bigger impact on overall death toll if we focus on a larger problem.  This is make any more sense?

       I totally agree. I'm a gun owner myself. I went through a long series of things to be able to own a handgun in CA, and eventually to concealed carry here in WA.  I can't imagine anyone getting around the system I had to go through (in CA and WA) any time I purchased a firearm through a dealer. That being said, if I wanted to obtain a firearm through the  black market for the purpose of committing a crime, I don't have to go through any checkpoints, nor any waiting periods.  I TOTALLY agree with waiting periods. If someone gets drunk, gets angry, and wants to kill...I don't want them to be able to buy a gun immediately. I agree with mental health checks against gun purchases...I mean, why the fuck wouldn't you check if someone is insane? Makes sense. But if sane people want to buy guns, there's nothing that's ever going to stop them completely. It's their Right.

       I am definitely not Morally Superior. I know a lot more people that have died from overdoses of oxycontin than people who were shot in a school though. And I wouldn't call it piggybacking, so much as wanting to start a discussion in a way that could possibly go a different direction than the previous posts have gone. I probably shouldn't point only at opiate manufacturers either, there are lots of drugs that can kill people. Personally I'd way rather go out on Benzos.

       He’s questioning the order of importance for these problems. School shootings are terrible. They are also terribly hyped by the media vying for attention. If death is the drug then focusing on school shootings is like taking down a street dealer while focusing on the opiate epidemic is like taking down a large scale supplier.

       As soon as people start killing others with drugs against their will then your argument will hold up. Somebody choosing to put drugs into their body despite the risks is not equal to somebody gunning down innocent bystanders.

       I still don't see how guns are in the same conversation as drugs. Drugs are used by people on themselves. Guns are used to do harm to others. If all the gunowners in the world only shot themselves I don't think people would be nearly as critical of gun ownership.

 a large percentage of (non suicide) gun deaths in America have to do with gangs fighting over control of illegal drug distribution/territories.

       No he's cherry picking his argument. I'm not going to get drawn into a pissing match of comparing crime statistics of other countries. Why? Because I don't really care that much. I don't live in your damaged country and I can walk down the street without worrying about being shot. Obviously there are a lot of people in the U.S. that are going to be against any form of gun control no matter how many school shootings or mass killings occur. I don't expect that to end with any comment I'm going to make on here. It just saddens me that people love their guns more than other people's kids.

       No I'm comparing countries in which a fair comparison can be made. Mexico and Brazil are not even first world countries for Pete's sake. Why don't you address the evidence I presented to you. Why are there SO much more gun violence in the U.S. than any developed country? Could it have something to do with the fact that there are more guns per capita than any other nation?

       Drug Overdoses are also overwhelimingly self inflicted, so I think it's 100% fair as a comparison in this case. Plenty of analysis has shown that access to a gun makes people much more likely to go through with killing themsleves too, so it's not like that number would just transition somewhere else if there were no guns.

       I'd like to point out that while it's certainly the most hyped up version of gun violence, comparing school shootings to every type of drug overdose seems dishonest. There are about 11,000 deaths to gun violence every year in the US (13,000 total, when accidents are included). Still not as many as there are drug overdoeses, but the number people should be concerned about is way higher than 7.

       Thank you re: discrimination of drug type. My anger comes at this. Only people who do not use guns think guns are the problem. If you are shoot skeet or hunt or have home protection &amp; you are trained then the last thing you think of when someone shoots up a school is "gun control." If you are trained then your thought is if ONLY there had been a HEALTHY WELL TRAINED PERSON THERE WITH A FIREARM TO STOP THE INSANE PERSON.  So too with the "opiate" crisis. Only people who live a healthy, happy life without pain or being crippled thinks DOCTORS, PAIN PILLS when they hear "overdose or opiate." If you yourself or someone you knows lives with chronic pain and takes their legitimate medications as prescribed thinks, "my God why would someone shoot an unknown substance into their body for fun?" I watched my old mother be forced off of 2 pills a day. a 7.5mg morning and a 7.5mg night dose of hydrocodone. She went from a high functioning, happy, babysitting granny to a bitter, depressed recluse. She has never watched television and she is now living her life by watching the lives of others on tv. She gets angry when I try to reason with her about going to a football game, "NO! LEAVE ME ALONE! I AM NOT GOING TO GO BECAUSE I WILL BE UP ALL NIGHT WITH MY BACK SCREAMING..." So I shush  my kids not to talk about the game until we are out the door. Now if one of you smarty pants with the doctors writing out prescriptions for 1000 pills a month can explain how my mother's 2 pills a day is HELPING A HEROIN ADDICT...i'll shut up and listen. The truth is that my mom's medication nor her doctor were harming anyone!!! LEAST OF ALL HER! She now lives with chronic pain and wishes to die. She tells me how all of her friends are dead so what is the point. 2 YEARS AGO SHE WOULD TELL ME ABOUT THE CAKE SHE WAS BAKING FOR HER BUNKO NIGHT!!!!! Dammit shame on all of you people! YOU HAVE CREATED AN UNTENABLE CONDITION FOR THOUSANDS OF PAIN PATIENTS AND FOR WHAT GOOD?!?!!? So you could proclaim loudly about those evil damn doctors and horrible monsters making pills? You are all idiots. YOU ARE ALL GLUED TO YOUR FUCKING TELEVISIONS EVERY NIGHT LISTENING TO THOSE TOOLS WHO MANIPULATE YOU INTO WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE BUYING NEXT MONTH OR NEXT YEAR AND ITS ALL A GAME TO ENRICH PEOPLE HELLA SMARTER THAN YOU!!!!! Just shut up. If you want to talk about the devastation of the true drug infestation then you should talk about the heroin of Appalachia or the crack/meth in the southern states or the cocain and ecstacy on the west coast BUT SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT PHYSICIANS AND THEIR EVIL LACKEY DRUG COMPANIES!!!! YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE FUCKING TALKING ABOUT!!!! Here is a little factoid for you... us veterans wth missing limbs suffer from excruciating phantom limb pain. With proper pain relief AND A DAY PROGRAM OF SPORTS AND SOCIAL INTERACTION they experience less pain AND THEY REBUILD PRODUCTIVE LIVES! For veterans receiving medication only they rebuild at high rates but in a much slower fashion. Veterans WITHOUT ACCESS TO PROPER PAIN RELIEF.....they have a dramatically higher use of ILLICIT DRUGS and rampant alcoholism and RARELY REBUILD and effective life. Do you guys ever think of those people as you scream your self important bullshit about "THOSE CRAZY DOCTORS AND CRAZY PILL MANUFACTERERS AND THEIR CRAZY PILL POPPING PATIENTS..." just shut the fuck up unless you have read the research, the government publications, and gone to a VA to see some of the great work that is now being done to help these guys. Programs like wounded warriors get them out into canoes and boats...4wheelers...setting up camp while sitting in their wheelchairs....AND YES! MANY OF THEM NEED THEIR PROPER DOSE OF MEDICATION SO THEY CAN DO THOSE THINGS!!!!!!!!! The goal is not "get them off of their medications." The goal is GET THEM INVOLVED AND FUNCTIONING AGAIN BECAUSE THE MORE ACTIVE THEY ARE THE LESS MEDICATION THEY WILL NATURALLY USE!!!! AND THOSE STATISTICS ARE ROCK SOLID GOLDEN IN PEER REVIEWED ARTICLES!!!!! People who have rewarding careers and happy families do not lay around and say, "Oh yay! Tomorrow I go to my crazy doctor and buy my pills from my crazy physician so I can be a crazy pill popping HAPPY PRODUCTIVE PARENT AND PROFESSIONAL!"

IN FACT WE ARE SWIMMING IN SO MANY LAWS THAT EVEN THE SUPREME COURT CANT FIGURE OUT IF OBAMACARE IS LEGAL BECAUSE IT IS A TAX OR IF IT IS LEGAL BECAUSE IT IS NOT A TAX!!!!!!!

       You want to know what would have saved those children &amp; 2 heroid men in Florida? I'll tell you. If that foster child's parent had not been using drugs or staying drunk during her pregnancy. I have a pretty good hypothesis he was  FES in addition to the autism. Because of ASD and FES he should have had a weekly meeting with a CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST biweekly and weekly contact with a counselor teaching social skills and coping behaviors. That should have been a regular part of elementary, junior, and high school. After the 2nd call to the police or the 1st evidence of animal mutilation HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MANDATED TO BIWEEKLY THERAPY WITH A LICENSED PSYCHOLOGIST...NOT A MASTER'S LEVEL THERAPIST BUT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL! That psychologist then develops an effective treatment clan to include LPCs, occupational therapy, anger management, work study training, and social activities that are in vivo social skills training and coping behaviors use. The psychologist refers and follows the mental health medical treatment with psychiatry and/or pediatrics. When he became a young adult OR WHEN HIS MOTHER DIED he should have been moved to RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT where he lives in a real house with rules, chores, boardgame nights, movie nights, Christmas trees, Sunday at church with a couple of house mothers who are trained by professional therapists/psychologists. A licensed psychologist would be made available 24hrs 7 days a week for any unexpected events. Nikolaus should have been protected from himself and from the society that he was not equipped to understand or navigate successfully. Had he been protected from himself and society those kids and those brave men WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY!!!! So why wasn't Nikolaus receiving that level of care that could have overcome the negatives of FAS and ASD and would have allowed him to be a contributing (but still odd ) and safe member of society??? WELL BECAUSE OF CONGRESS! BECAUSE THE LOBBYISTTS AND MSM DO NOT TELL YOU ABOUT THOSE SERVICES!!! THERE IS NO MONEY IN GETTING KIDS LEGITIMATE HELP. they say, "Hey! we send that kid a $700 check every month! why don't their parents take them for therapy? Weeeell mr smartpants politician wearing a sequined cowboy hat...that $700 pays for food and marijuana and beer for the fucked up, uneducated foster parent that you placed him with or let him be adopted by!!! BUT IF IT WAS RUN BY LICENSED PROFESSIONALS WITH KNOWLEDGE, ETHICS, CARE, AND INTELLIGENCE...and likely no sequined cowboy hats except at Halloween....THEN THE BOY MIGHT GROW UP TO BE MORE CAPABLE THAN THE FOSTER CARE/ADOPTIVE SYSTEM!!! The money is in something sexy or tragic. the money is freely given when what dies is a schoolful of potential rather than a little defenseless frog. AND YOU PEOPLE WITH ALL YOUR GOOD IDEAS ABOUT GUN LAWS...don't you think you sound more intelligent with rational common sense solutions that would parallel the way you run your own homes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Look...if your child wrecks the family car and kills the family dog when he does it.... 14 yrs old and DRUNK...then what is your response? Your previous rules were 1. Be where you say you are going to be. 2. Always tell the truth.  then junior comes home smelling of alcohol one night so rule 3 is added. 3. No drinking alcohol until you are 21. so then junior comes home reeking of alcohol AND has a new pair of $400 shoes you did not buy. So rule number 4 is born. 4. No stealing. And then Junior comes in reeking of alcohol with hickies all over his stomach and back... uhm are you gonna go to NEW RULE JUNIOR! 5. NO SEX UNTIL WITHOUT A CONDOM.... at what rule do you stop to say, "hmmmm y'know..I'm not sure junior even understands the concept of 'a rule.'" Because you have a whole shitload of RULEZ but not only is he BREAKING THE ESTABLISHED RULES BUT YOU HAVE TO ADD NEW RULES TO THE RULES HE IS ALREADY NOT FOLLOWING!!! At what point do you say, "JUNIOR! YOU AINT GOING NOWHERE BUCKO! YOU ARE GONNA SIT IN THIS HOUSE SO I CAN SEE YOU ARE NOT DRINKING OR STEALING OR LYING OR FUCKING.....and &lt;deep calming breath&gt; you will be going to therapy weekly until you can figure out a better life than the current lying, stealing, drinking, fucking course you are currently on." Will Junior get shut down and into therapy at Rule #5 or Rule #25??? Because let me tell you this....at Rule#5 I can PROBABLY help ur kid BUT...YOU BRING mr bigshot bigballs you aint stopping me from nothing bitch into my office at Rule #25 ... my advice to you will be, "strap in and get ready for a nightmare! Cause one way or the other this process is gonna be painful and long for ALL OF US!" A child who is continually allowed to break the rules and invent new ones is a kid who has had the worst of his behavior REWARD (inadvertently) and REINFORCED FOR A LONG LONG TIME. Bad behavior and poor choices has become a habit for your kid. A child who is brought to therapy who has been allowed to reach rule #25 is a FAMILY PROBLEM THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED BEFORE I can do anything with the individual child.

       And the OP created a thread to postulate on what he sees as an incongruity when it comes to the accountability of firearms manufacturers as opposed to pharmaceutical manufacturers. Why don't you share your thoughts on that rather than dismissing the discussion? This is after all a forum for discussing conspiracy and it seems the OP believes there is a conspiracy driving the incongruity in the application of accountability.

       Their point is this seems a lot less like a genuine attempt to discuss an issue, and more of a defense against another, being the huge gun problem. 
The more people want to avoid it by pointing at other problems like Op has done, the easier it is to not talk about it properly. 
Even just making the comparison, opiate ODs kill more people than guns, is incredibly misleading and doesn't help make the issue or its resolution clearer.
There are just a lot more people taking opiates than there are people wanting to shoot up schools.
 That doesn't make the school shootings less of a problem, but it does make it sound easier for people like OP to distract.

       What is the goal of preventing school shootings?
      </p>
      <p>
       To prevent pain and suffering, correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if I told you there was something out there that caused more overall pain and suffering than school shootings and we were ignoring it? What if I told you that we could probably make more progress with this other thing given the measly effort we put into fixing guns? Because we've had pretty common school shootings now for about ten years and every single time its the exact same public and political response. We aren't improving the quality of life on that front. We might be able to improve the quality of life for more people on the opiate/Big Pharma front.

       Personally, I think the as high as 400,000 deaths per year in this country caused by obesity is a measurably greater concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people put an equal or lopsided emphasis on one over the other when they are
       <em>

       unequal i think thats pretty insane and worrisome.

      <p>
       isn’t this more about the laws and or mental health?
      </p>
      <p>
       how many of the last shooters of these mass murders were not showing signs of mental illness?
      </p>
      <p>
       if not mental illness, they were the stereotypical profile such as the narrative about paddock.

      <p>
       either way the gun manufacturers and the pharmaceutical manufacturers are to blame.

       they have been producing over the demand for decades and even pushing their products through exposure on television and such.

       The laws on guns could be improved.

       These two separate things will decrease the amount of shootings.

       Gun manufacturers and pharma companies just make stuff that people use. Corporations are just groups of people trying to, in theory, legally make money. It's a fair system if the law is properly maintained.

       It's the people we elect to government who should oversee the law being justly applied instead of being bribed with a nice life to be complicit in a variety of circumstances that directly result in mass death and imprisonment.

       THANK YOU for some rational thought! I would upvote your comment 100x if I could. You are correct the problem is about mental health. You should expand your thoughts one step further. What has changed in the past 20 yrs that we see such a sharp decline in the overall general mental health of America now?

         Internet expanded sphere of influence to young people for early exposure to sexual content in addition to sexual content that is extreme and others would define as out of the norm!
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Television and Film aka Hollywood/NewYork ballooned into a vehicle for pushing and normalizing extreme behaviors. We are now in the midst of a push to make pedophilia "normal." or just another sexual preference....as if somehow the child being victimized is an object and not a real live human being who is learning and evolving every moment and every experience.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A rapid increase in the use of alcohol. It has become such a normal expected part of daily life that people are actually in SHOCK when I explain I do not drink...anything...ever...not a drop. They say, "oh you must be in recovery." And I say, "No, I saw a brain that had been physically damaged by the alcoholic body is lived in for 40 years and I was HORRIFIED." The college kids are being decimated...wiped out by alcoholism but Hollywood makes movies that glorify alcohol use. They treat it like its marshmallows and hotdogs for summer camp...and IT IS KILLING YOUR COLLEGE STUDENT PEOPLE! I PROMISE YOUR CHILD AT COLLEGE IS DOING THINGS THAT WOULD MAKE YOU VOMIT. Our latest abomination was to have 3 students brought into the ER who had used an enama bag to poor EVERCLEAR LIQUOR into their intestines! One of those boys will have several surgeries to correct the damage. STOP FUCKING DRINKING IN FRONT OF YOUR FUCKING LITTLE CHILDREN YOU EMBECILES!!!!
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Okay. My post is finished for now. I'm so furious by the insanity gripping this country. You idiots stay drunk and watch your insanity influences from Hollywood and then wonder why some poor foster kid (probably a drug baby) who was bullied horribly, fixated on the power of guns as portrayed in the movies, who was ridiculed because he asked for sex in the only way his autistic brain knew how to do it and had the only stable influence in his life die 3 months earlier BLOWS AWAY THE VERY PEOPLE HE BELIEVED CAUSED HIS PAIN!!!! Why did he think his pain originated in the school? Because he was AUTISTIC! If he was not experiencing it in the moment he did not think about it. At home with this mother he was happy with his guns and movies. At school he was laughed at and ridiculed, called names and his social confusion was excruciatingly painful. When his mother died his pain from that loss was conflated with the pain experienced in the school. In short...he held those kids responsible for ever bad thing in his life. AND THE FUCKING SHERIFF?!?!?! THAT IDIOT SHERIFF WHO IS SCREAMING POLITICAL SHIT ABOUT ELECTIONS AND GUN CONTROL?!?!!? ASK THAT BASTARD HOW MANY TIMES HIS OWN DEPUTIES WERE CALLED TO THAT HOUSE! ASK HOW MANY TIMES THE CITY POLICE WERE THERE! ASK IF THEY KNEW HE WAS MUTLATING ANIMALS!!!! AND THEN ASK THEM WHY THAT BOY WAS NOT TAKEN TO A RESIDENTIAL FACILITY FOR HIS OWN FUCKING SAFETY!!!!! WHY DONT YOU FUCKING PEOPLE ASK THOSE GODDAMNED QUESTIONS INSTEAD OF BITCHING ABOUT MORE FUCKING LAWS THAT DO NOTHING EXCEPT MAKE WASHINGTON RICHER AND MORE POWERFUL!!!!! DO THAT HOW ABOUT IT~!

        What incongruity? Gun manufactures are one of very few industries that have a legal exemption against being held responsible for the actions of their products.  By law, you're not allowed to hold firearm manufacturers accountable.

       Yes, there is some shady shit going on with opioid manufacturers and the Government, especially in the McKesson pharma case, and we need to fix that, but at least a case is allowed to be started.

       The government would like to have rights that you don't. They would like to have the right to weapons and distribution of opiates, whilst simultaneously promoting that you peon citizens should have access to neither - and if you do it'd better be heavily regulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point is to see the double standard and recognize that if you're scared of Joe Schmoe having access to either, you'd better  definitely be scared of your government having control of both. Cuz guess what? You're government is full of Joe
Schmoes who probably don't give a fuck about you.

       Likewise.  Such is the case with pretty much everyone I've met in my entire life.  Except somehow everyone in the government wants do all these bad things according to you.  You realize that the government is made of people just like you and me, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I said what I said to show that you haven't thought critically about your views on government.  You lack the necessary nuance required to come to meaningful conclusions about how government should operate and what powers they should and should not have.  To you, "they" (as if the government is a single entity) are the enemy and should be dismantled.  Maybe try finding some sort of middle-ground in your views so you can stop sounding like an angsty teenager mad at the world.  Like, I appreciate your passion and everything but you need to grow the fuck up and understand that issues such as governance are not nearly as black and white as you think.

       The government decides on what rights you have. And seems like gun control is much more beneficial to the society than your fear of government having the power over you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at gun violence statistics of Europe compared to USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's not even the point, the point is that OP compares two unrelated problems and dares to question why people try to solve the gun violence problem while there's some other unrelated problems that exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which, as I previously said, is just pointless.

       Eliminating a right? You don't have a 2nd amendment right to personally own a nuclear weapon, rocket launchers, etc. Why should the 2nd amendment be interpreted to mean you can have certain guns, high capacity mags, and lack of safety features that make it easier to have mass casualties?

       With regard to him being "radicalized" by a white supremacy group, the fact that he shot and killed indiscrimanately by color should suggest to you that having been "radicalized" wasn't the issue.

       I can't really get on board with gun control. There is no common sense baseline for advocates, and if there were, the next event would have everyone calling for more. It's not a fallacy, this has been a literal slippery slope for decades now. In my state, the gun show loophole was closed, but the push for more regulation has continued despite that being the last big "common sense gun control" push locally.

       Until you get a very firm stopping point, I'm not interested in having my rights infringed upon. You showed that you wouldn't want to infringe upon rights you care about by weaseling out of answering any first amendment questions, and so you should understand how I feel about giving up second amendment rights.

       Irresponsible patients do not equate to being murdered by a gunman.
      </p>
      <p>
       A quick search and personal experience shows that 1-5mg hydrocodone lasts 3-4 hours or longer.  If you are taking more than this, you are being irresponsible with your prescription or you need to reevaluate treatment with your doctor.  Read the printout the pharmacy supplies that explains usage, side effects, drug interactions, and warnings.  Also a search on drugs.com will tell you specifically what drugs you are taking will interact adversely.  It's not rocket science.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are the overdose stats?  What dosages were these patients on?  Were they taking legally prescribed opiates?  Were they ingesting alcohol?  Were they mixing prescriptions that could cause death if taken together?
      </p>
      <p>
       No one shoves medication down a person's throat.  On the other hand, school shooters don't give choices to their victims.  So that's a apples to oranges comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, manufacturers shouldn't be held responsible anyway.  Both guns and powerful prescription drugs should be regulated because they have the potential to have fatal effects if used incorrectly.  Hold consumers responsible by having them take a class.  God forbid people should be educated.

       except big pharma controls the drug studies and frequently markets these drugs (heroin, oxy, benzos) as safe and non addictive and give doctors incentives to prescribe these medications. not to mention the doctors themselves, who are the professionals and who supposedly take an oath to heal, are the ones over-prescribing.

       no i do not.  maybe i'm caught up in the semantics of this, but when you say "the drug studies" to me, it implies that pharmaceutical companies have a hand in all investigations of the drugs they produce.  there are thousands and thousands of articles published in the most prestigious scientific journals in the world that spell out plainly the negative consequences of all opioid classes of drugs, from the cellular level to the epidemiological level and everywhere in between.  no clinical trials data available refutes the widely held belief among the scientific and medical community that all opioids are addictive and should be prescribed sparingly.  the vast majority of medical practitioners know this and act accordingly.

       clinical trials are the final step before a drug trials acceptance and the NIH study linked shows they suppress negative studies and glamorize positive studies to suit their agenda.

       yes, and that's a bad thing.  but it doesn't change that fact that the efficacy and safety of new drugs on the market are constantly being evaluated -- using opiates as an example, the suspect studies published by pharmaceutical companies are dwarfed in comparison to the scores of studies out there today that plainly spell out their potential danger, resulting in opiate prescriptions being harder to obtain.
      </p>
      <p>
       you're pointing out a systemic failure of the drug dev process, but i still don't understand your point.  what do you propose to do to fix it?  or are you just gonna keep going "yeah man the pharma's control everything bro" and leave it at that?

       Anything you can get high off of or can cause euphoria is going to be addictive.  The human brain wants to feel good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schedule II drugs are so regulated now, at least in my state, that it is impossible to over-prescribe.  I would like to know where these doctors are that just throw pain pills at you.  Because even if they did, pharmacies carry the minimum quantity and sometimes you will need to drive from store to store just to find one that has them in stock.

       I have chronic jaw/neck/shoulder pain and went through the pain management hoops a couple years ago.  I just deal with it now because it was so hard getting help and I tried everything even med marijuana and cbd.  But I always wonder if anyone that is so against opiates has ever experienced chronic pain or had to deal with getting it treated... I know how it used to be but that was 4 years ago.

       Fortunately and unfortunately this is changing for opiates because they moved up a schedule.  It would be great if there was an in-between Motrin and Vicodin.

      <p>
       Diet and exercise has a huge effect on a lot of diseases but it doesn't seem to be part of the healthcare moneymaker so patients aren't pushed to make lifestyle changes like they should be.  They give everyone antidepressants and antibiotics for anything which is just as worrisome.

       Also, there has been A LOT of attention on the opioid crisis lately, an stricter regulations are in place at the federal level and in every state. Heck, even the manufacturers of the opioids are being called to task, not to mention the doctors who overprescribe. Regulations are making it harder and harder for people to get opioids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally none of those things have happened with guns. Guns continue to be further deregulated (see Obama expanding gun rights to national parks and trains, and Trump rescinding an Obama EO that would have restricted people access to guns for those who were adjudicated mentally ill). And if there's ever a peep that gun manufacturers or gun stores should be held accountable for gun deaths and school shootings, it is shut down faster than you can reload your 22-round high-capacity magazine.

       I agree with what you said about gun regulation  but there’s a lot more to the opioid crisis than holding manufacturers accountable and putting regulations in place to make them harder to get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Treatment is huge. I’d call state funded rehabs a JOKE if they weren’t actually a total nightmare. I’ve been to more than a few due to not having health insurance (and due to my stupid ass not staying clean, of course). They’re making it harder to get prescription opioids, that’s great, maybe that’ll prevent people from becoming addicts. What about all the people who are already addicted and desperately need help?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t think the two issues really can be compared so easily, it’s just not that simple.

       I agree completely. Treatment should be given more funding by the federal government and state governments. My only point was that in response to the opioid crisis, we've seen numerous regulations and crackdowns, whereas we've seen none of that with guns.

       Well the difference is that everyone agrees on the opioid crisis, whereas with guns half the country doesn't agree that there's a problem at all.  I think you are selectively seeing a lack of gun regulations and "numerous" opioid regulations.  The other half of the country probably sees it exactly opposite as you.

       For starters, there is a law saying you can't sue a gun manufacturer for legally selling a firearm to a dealer who then legally sold it to an individual.  What more do you want them to do?

       Physiological side effects of untreated pain hurt the body. In a crisis situation, pain would probably need to be treated adequately. I'm not defending "big pharma" they monetize care for patients which lead to more many for them and less care for patients, but making blanket statements about the medical industry without knowledge of how it actually works, leads to misinformation being spread about what is actually going on in the medical industry. We shouldn't sue a company for making a bunch of pain meds and selling to hospitals, that would just deter companies from wanting to make and distribute medication to hospitals and patients.

       To piggie back on this your number comparison is skewed. That may be school shooting deaths but total gun deaths this year is already 1800+ and this one incident yesterday more than doubled that 7 number. I agree something needs to be done about drugs but that does not discount the fact something needs to be done about the gun violence.

       You talk about skewed comparisons but use a skewed number yourself.  70% of those 1800 gun deaths are suicides, and another 20% are justifiable self defense shootings.  Actual gun homicide is nowhere near what you think it is.

       Agreed I was just simply trying to show the number wasn't 7. How many of those 66k overdoses are accidental versus intentional. I don't know but it doesn't mean any death regardless of the reason is less important.

       Please do
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       wean yourself off without some sort of medical/psychiatric supervision, or you're gonna have a bad time.  Even a good general practice / family doc might not know how to deal with this, so a specialist would be best.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm currently being weaned off of sertraline, and my family doc initially told me to just jump from 150mg/day to 100mg/day.  Needless to say, I had a bad time with the brain zaps. Currently going from 100 to 50, but this time I also got a script for the 25mg pills, which lets me bump things down by 12.5 every couple of weeks. It's going much much better.
      </p>
      <p>
       One other thing I would suggest is to ask about other drug-classes to help ease the transition. Mood stabilizers and NDRIs can be really helpful and induce less physical dependency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again,
       <em>
        do not do this without medical/psychiatric supervision
       </em>
       . If your primary care doc doesn't want to help, see a psychiatrist for a pharmacology consult. That's what they do, and they know their shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best of luck my dude(tte?).

       You're neglecting to talk about the guy who sells the opioids and distributes them... How many people does he kill? He offs a few dozen folks and didn't have to blow his brains out at the end of the day. Not to mention his lucrative pay out.

       Because the point you made ignores the point of this article. Opioids, meant to help and heal, kill more people than guns. Saying drugs are less dangerous because they only affect the individual taking them ignores a whole host of factors. If they were less dangerous, why do they kill more people? Somewhere along the line people are supplying those individuals on a massive scale, fully aware of the dangers they impose. That factor is what makes opioids so deadly and that is what is being ignored

       Hey man no need to get reeally angry. I reread my comment and I don't think it insinuates that I was trying to make a point? The comment even is even prefaced with "genuine question" to let the reader know that a question will be following.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was asking a question that I didn't know the answer to. I looked it up and
       <a href="/u/mindboglin">
        /u/mindboglin
       </a>
       was wrong; the shooter did not have an automatic weapon.

       I hope you have a blessed day and so sorry if my original comment made you angry.

       The question you asked ("was he using an automatic weapon?") is pretty much the exact point brought up to argue against anyone who is passionate about reducing gun deaths but happens to misuse terminology. Just because it's not an automatic weapon doesn't invalidate the point.

       The usage of the term automatic may vary according to context. Gun specialists point out that the word automatic is sometimes misunderstood to mean fully automatic fire when used to refer to a self-loading, semi-automatic firearm not capable of fully automatic fire. In this case, automatic refers to the loading mechanism, not the firing capability.

       Come on now.  As far as the general firearms community and public uses the terms, no.

       Semi-auto = 1round per trigger pull
  Auto = continuous fire while the trigger is pulled

       Maybe part of it is that in those rural areas the cops are neighbors and members of the communities they police. In a lot of cities the cops commute from the suburbs and have no personal stake whatsoever in the actual beats they walk.

       You do know gun stores exist, right? And they buy guns on the regular? And that they keep track of all guns bought and sold?

       Guns end up on the black market because of straw purchases (which is already a felony) and theft (which is also a felony)

      <ul>
       <li>
        Both drugs and guns are excellent tools, and can be used in a positive way, with moderation

       <li>
        Both can be dangerous when incorrectly used

       <li>
        Banning either will not stop abuse (As proven by the failed war on drugs, users (gun and drug) will find a way to get their hands on what they want whether its legal or not)

       You could've banned pomeranians and had the same effect on the overall murder total, that doesn't mean pomeranians have an effect on the murder rate.

       Yeah, let's look at Switzerland.
* About half as many guns per capita as the US
* Very different culture, people generally don't have guns "for protection"
* To buy a gun or ammunition you need a permit
* Carrying a loaded gun is illegal (both open and concealed carry)
      </p>
      <p>
       The Swiss gun laws are much more restrictive than the laws in most US states. Most people asking for more gun control would be pretty happy with these laws.

       erm, one is a necessary medication and the other is primarily a tool for fun. And, btw, one is mostly illegal and the other is mostly free - if guns were as regulated as opioids there would be no discussion about harsher gun laws.

       5,624 pills per person in ONE fuckin town in this country. I don't see the NRA flooding states and advertising their products on every platform.

       Only country in the world with an average of more than 1 gun per person. That's not per non-minor person, that's per any resident, including children. That's double the per-capita rate we had in 1968.

       Which shows only one thing, increased prosperity.   Not to mention the fact that there were almost no mass shooters before the last 20 years, yet access to guns was ubiquitous.  You could buy them in a hardware store no questions asked.  High schools had shooting teams and firing ranges.  You could borrow a gun AT school and bring your own whenever you felt like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If guns are the problem, why were they magically not a problem until the 21st century?
      </p>
      <p>
       Our per capita number of cars has gone way up since then too, is there an emotionally charged political dialogue surrounding fatal road accidents which kill orders of magnitude more people than murderers who chose to use guns?  Is there an evergreen political dialogue around heart disease and death caused by putting sugar and corn syrup into every product in the supermarket, killing orders of magnitude more people than the combined total of every mass murderer in the US that ever chose a gun as his weapon in the entirety of history?
      </p>
      <p>
       Homicide has declined significantly since 1968 alongside practically every other type of crime and the only underlying factor that correlates consistently with it is economic prosperity.  If guns are your target and statistics are your weapon, you've picked up a venomous snake by the tail in a swordfight.  The health of society and the economy is the factor determining how much violence is directed at said society by its own citizens, not access to guns.

       Everyone takes driver's ed, and many states require a number of supervisory hours under a learner's permit before a full license is granted. You have your vision checked and take a driver's test before you're licensed, and the state can revoke your license if you have certain mental conditions, which they can learn about in a number of ways that don't require your consent. Your license gets revoked when you get too many points or commit certain offenses. Cars are strictly titled and ownership of every car is recorded with the state. Cars themselves are inspected annually and must contain certain safety features, like airbags, seat belts, backup cameras (in recent years), etc., and there are constantly new regulations being put in place as new technology becomes available which may make them safer (again, see backup cameras as an example).
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention cars have significantly more utility than guns do. Most people commute with a car - I don't know of anyone who commutes with a gun. I can go get groceries with a car, but would starve to death in my city if I had to rely on a gun to hunt for my food. Those who do need guns for jobs generally do go through extensive checks, which I'm cool with, but 99% of people have no need for a gun in their day-to-day life. And if you intend to hunt with a gun, you don't need to be able to fire multiple rounds per second, so at the very least the sorts of guns people have access to should be limited to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       those that are basically only designed for warfare.

       No, I don't, and there's literally no reason we can't address both problems. If you read up the comment chain you'll see that

       This is also why multinational companies love libertarians. Libertarians basically advocate for very few rules if any, which allows companies to easily exploit people.

       So do vaccines count as an example of big pharma forcing us to use their product despite the risks? Or are you going to tell me that my kids have a personal choice to choose not to go to public schools? Or that it's a violation of the rights of others that I attempt to prevent my own rights from being violated?

       Most people trust their doctor to prescribe medication that is going to help them. So if a doctor is prescribing medication inappropriately that would absolutely be on the doctor and by extension the pharma lobby which is pushing the prescriptions so hard.

       so humans are unable to understand why opioid painkillers are so famous for destroying lives, and that's not their fault. that's the pharmaceutical lobbies fault.

       but they're totally able to take responsibility for the firearm deaths they cause, because "guns don't kill people, people kill people".

       seems legit. people are fucking morons in need of a nanny state to tell them what not to put in their body.. unless they have a gun in their hands, at which point they're a bastion of responsibility, because, lemme guess.. freedom?

       I never said anything about guns. That's a whole different issue that needs tackling in its own unique way. We are talking about over prescription of known dangerous drugs by people who are in a position of authority and respect because of their historical service.

       I won't argue that people are not regards but that does not excuse the people knowingly exploiting that.

       that said, i don't need to be, because if anything goes wrong, i'm the only person that dies, its a fundamentally victimless situation.

       compare that to being shot in the face by someone while you're minding your business.

       lets try a different perspective:

       i don't particularly mind if you take drugs and die. i've never met you and people die every day. I mean, i'm sure you're lovely, and i guess its sad, if i think about it, but i won't hear about it, because its between you and your god.

       The over all influence of big pharma and the impact it has on the health, safety, culture, economics, and quality of of life is the issue. The odds either one of us get shot in face is low as shit. But big pharma is impacting us both daily. The net effect is the issue, not the one off potential effect of guns.

       It's just funny how some people can only conceptualize tangable visable threats, and block out the threats that undermine them slowly and steadily. But hey this isn't your problem do why are you worried about your kids being killed or your sciatica?

       That's already done.  Car companies are held responsible if a car malfunctions and someone dies.  Gun companies are held responsible if a gun malfunctions and someone dies.

       Car companies are
       <strong>
        not
       </strong>
       held responsible if some berserker drives over a bunch of schoolkids, nor if a drunk kills someone driving home late at night.  Nor should gun companies be held responsible for mass shootings or accidental discharges.

       Yeah because people can't be misinformed by massive wealthy industries that purposely spread misinformation.

       I mean, if you don't want to die in a shooting, you can always carry a firearm of your own.  The odds of surviving a violent attack go up if you defend yourself, and go up even more if you defend yourself with a firearm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted, there are situations like Las Vegas where having your own gun would do jack shit.  But that is not how most of these events happen.

       I know this predates the years you mention, but this shows a lot higher of a number in previous years, 16 of them can be considered mass shootings in over 200 school related shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went looking for gun related deaths in the years you mentioned, and came across this article

       I wouldn't doubt it. it seems like a forced meme, just like "virtue signalling" "cultural marxism" and other buzz words.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have any evidence but the general fuckery and haze surrounding all information put out can't help but invoke imagery of how other coups have been performed by the CIA and with the repeal of the Smith-mundt sct., it just furthers the speculation

       Because it's a diversion... ANY comparison can be met with "that's whataboutism". Trying to compare trumps first 100 days in office with any other president? That's whataboutism. Comparing gun deaths to pill deaths? That's whataboutism. See my point?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the term fake news got implemented. It's to soften the tone of propaganda, which is literally fake news. Propaganda should be illegal, but since the average citizen is softened to "fake news" when they hear that anything is propaganda, they shrug it off. See my point?

       A comparison alone is not whataboutism. The reason OP is getting called out is because he's literally going "What about this..." instead of actually making an argument.

       A school year is generally August to June, so to make it a full year, OP added a month on each side.
      </p>
      <p>
       And gun deaths is misleading. In 2016(?) there were 30,000 gun deaths, but 20,000 of those were suicides. Also, op is only talking about school shootings b/c of yesterday. So no, its not cherry picking to exclude mass shootings outside of schools if you are talking about schools shootings.

       Yes. It is cherry picking. People don’t get upset after school shootings, people get upset about mass shootings and the general amount of deaths caused by guns in our country.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be relevant if OP compares deaths from school shootings to death from overdoses on campus.

       No... people are agitated to be upset about it by MSM coverage for juicy shooting ratings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people would never even hear about a shooting in their area because there aren't any.  Compared to deaths from stuff like drugs, road accidents, sugar/corn syrup induced diabetes/heart disease, deaths from mass murderers are tiny, yet they receive outsized coverage because they're exciting.

       It's still cherry picking. Mass Shootings to overdoses. A specific type of act to a broad type of act. Compare mass shootings to mass suicides/overdoses or compare all shootings to all overdoses. If you did it like that, your numbers fall apart

       No the point is not valid. Even if you tried a better comparison which would be the amount of drug related deaths in schools versus gun related deaths in schools you still miss the most important factor. Gun deaths involve innocent bystanders, While drug overdoses involved participants who made a choice and by making that choice excepted a certain amount of risk.

       That’s school shootings. It is cherry picking. So shootings don’t matter when it’s not a school? How about movie theaters? Concerts? Churches? Gun violence is a real threat, but the person that made this post has a specific agenda and is basically saying gun control isn’t a priority in the US

       Your claiming there is 15 deaths TOTAL, from ALL shootings that took place on a school. ANY school, elementary-college?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no source, but i just find that so hard to believe, just in sheer numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the census report for 2017 there were 74.6 MILLION students across america!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean there wete probably 15 deaths from students tripping and hitting there head in schools...
      </p>
      <p>
       Shootings dont always hit MSM. just local news if small, 1 or 2 deaths.

       Kind of a bad analogy since ut is suicide, not mass murder, and if every few weeks someone new used the building to jump to his death landing on and killing others,  the building owner sure as heck going to be sued. You can sue an owner for slippery floors!

       The AG in MA unilaterally banned AR-15s after pulse nightclub, citing the 7 deaths by rifle in the previous decade. Meanwhile around that maybe people die of opiate overdoses every few days here and nothing is being done about it other than shoveling more tax dollars toward bloated rehab programs that don't do shit to begin with. All this while every hospital in the state pumps everyone full of painkillers and antidepressants for every little fucking thing and then we gasp and wonder why everyone's on heroin.

       Im in CT and the gun laws are crazy. I am currently getting my pistol permit and had to pay $150 for a 10 hr class, $15 for finger prints, $75 to the town, $150 for my permit and I think there were some other fees too. Oh I also have to wait 8 weeks to get my background check done. I have already waited 3 weeks and I have to go get my fingerprints done again because they fucked them up. Meanwhile, my friend got prescribed adderall by literally filling out a self evaluation for circling the amount you are effected by symptoms. It just pisses me off how easy these drugs are to get meanwhile an upstanding citizen and student has to fucking dish money out just for the FREEdom to buy a gun.

       You sound appropriately inconvenienced to me. Waiting less the 3 months and spending $400 to pay for the process is crazy to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that you probably don't literally mean that but c'mon dude, you should be happy to do your part in maintaining national security by going through the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making it harder for mentally unwell people to get guns will decrease the likelyhood of a shooting. A mentally unwell person is less likely than a person who is responsible enough to own a gun to be able to go through the process you described.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comparing guns and drugs how you are is not useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should be pissed of that potentially dangerous medication is prescribed at a criminally negligent level. And you should advocate for gun laws similar to yours.

       I can just imagine who you voted for - to have such a cavalier authoritarian attitude. You don't seem to understand - no you don't seem capable of understanding, that all the law is doing is making it harder and longer for a good person to protect their family. Any person not wanting to go through that simply won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I don't think there should be no laws - yes I think they should be regulated. But the buck has been passed too far towards the law abiding citizen precisely BECAUSE it hasn't been done towards mental health.

       I think you're right that in some places gun rights are unjustly restricted as a result of politicians taking the easy route of throwing out some "feel good" ineffective and inconvenience.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the fact that tackling the mental health aspect is ignored doesn't logically imply that more restrictive gun laws will reduce avoidable gun deaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you don't get to say what the effect of a law will be. You don't know because no one does. We can only make reasonable changes and see what happens. It's way too complex of a system to talk about how you are.

Yeah, alright. How is that going to work? Imagine an insane person.

       They can either get the gun legally and easily for a fair cost or have to find a criminal contact who would sell them a gun for a big price increase.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guns are not drugs. There is not nearly enough willing illegal gun users to support this idea that some random crazy guy could buy a gun as easily as some weed.

       Sorry to burst your bubble, but I live in a bad neighborhood, I have "criminal contacts", I can buy an unmarked (no SN) glock for less than 400 FROM the fucking guy I buy weed from. And he's making a profit, so clearly he's getting them for less.

       I believe that to be unusual. I live in Chicago, know many drug dealers (not just weed either, hard stuff). None of them sell guns.

       I can definitely drive a half hour over the border into Indiana and, even with a head full of acid, could buy an AK off one of the many private sellers walking around with them. They won't even ask me for ID. Just cash.

       As for being blacked out drunk, I’m surprised they let you in.  But if they actually did, then that’s illegal.  Private-party transfers between states still legally require background check.  That’s on them for not checking your ID.

At my renewal time they had contracted out the printing of permits to the private sector. It cost me $72 and it was 6 weeks to receive my new card.  Way to go on the privatizing to make government more efficient and cheaper Georgia!

       Ever heard of making well thought out and well researched decisions in the context of your current situation rather than relying on a law that was made for people 300 years ago when guns were dramatically weaker than today?

       Maybe this makes me a bad person but if I went to buy a gun and they told me they thought that I shouldn’t be allowed to own one, I would have one by that evening. And I’m not a criminal. Imagine it’s even easier for criminals to find guns.

       most of the criminally-used guns in MA come from NH, which to me demonstrates the incredible bad-faith and bad logic of the "states rights" arguments on both of these issues.

       I disagree with adding laws that prevent people from getting the medication they need. Perhaps stricter control around manufacturing or something, but mental health already carries a huge stigma that causes people who could use the help to shy away from getting it, and making it harder to get help will make the problem worse

       Phoning in from Maine here, they're really playing down how severe the crisis is here. I'm pretty sure my area has more junkies than dogs. I saw two guys carrying a passed out woman through the center of town at noon on a sunday, and nobody batted an eye. There are so many used needles on my street that I've considered bring a broom while walking my dog.

       I'm not saying we don't have a problem, but with the same rationale let's ban cars, they're dangerous. Didn't a terrorist ram people with their car in France? And knives, they're dangerous. Wasn't there a recent stabbing in France too? And baseball bats too, they're dangerous. Lots of people get beaten with those.

       You can own things and be a responsible adult. The people who do this are not responsible adults. I advocate for strict background checks, mental health checks, a national firearm registry, and strict fines for selling guns illegally / obtaining guns illegally. Also I'm down with banning the AR-15 and I own one of those too. They're enjoyable to shoot. I've never shot one anywhere but a range and I never plan to.

       Mental health checks would entail if a person has ever had a medical history of it. Yes I am aware that not everyone reports it but lots of people have been diagnosed with mental illnesses and don't get treatment and yet buy firearms.

       A national firearm registry already sort-of exists with the Federal Firearms Lisence that the federal government has. My father has one. These have extensive background checks as well as a monetary hurdle. I think we should instate a FOID card like system that Illinois has with Mandatory waiting periods for both firearms, ammunitio, and accessories. Make gun sellers hand over their buyers list and start soliciting people to enroll, fine them when they don't. Increase the fines stupidly, and garnish wages. They'll comply eventually. You're not removing their rights to own guns so they can't bitch about the second amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not perfect but I believe that we as a nation need to be more accountable and responsible when it comes to firearms. Mandatory education classes, education on fines and penalties for law breaking to everyone who purchases them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also we need better accountability to parents and their children. Obviously something was mentality wrong with the Florida shooter. Was anything done about it? We know he was reported multiple times to law enforcement and yet had guns. How did that happen? Where is HIS accountability as a person? As an adult, who votes in this country? How did he end up that way? Was he unable to afford care because sickness = bankruptcy in this country?

      <p>
       What purpose does a waiting period serve?  At best, maybe someone is delayed long enough to change their mind about a shooting (though most of them plan it for months) and at worst, someone who needs it now will not be able to protect themselves because they were waiting.

      <p>
       Removing and infringing are two different words.  To infringe is to act so as to limit or undermine.  Waiting periods, mandatory registration and fines for non compliance wouldn't be an infringement?

       I agree.  Something was up and someone should have been able to see the signs.  I think it would be helpful for people to figure out what the signs are, so everyone knows what to look for.

       Those items you have listed have other purposes, guns do not, unless you're talking about a Galil bottle opener or something. Guns shoot bullets out that harm fleshy beings, nothing else. Cars have a purpose of transporting you to a location, sure they can be used for bad purposes but that is not their only purpose.

       Harming fleshy beings is a legitimate reason. Some fleshy beings decide they want to come harm you. Maybe they're some tweaker looking for their next fix or maybe they want to oppress you via a totalitarian regime. Or maybe those fleshy beings are deer out in the woods and you need to feed your family.

       I don't think somebody is coming to murder me, but statistically, at least one person is coming to murder somebody else right now. I don't even have a gun, but I'm not about to tell people that they can't protect themselves from the violence that we all know exists out there in the world. People have a natural right to defend themselves from aggression. There are also some good arguments that the social contract with government can only be assured if people can hold their government to its promises, which would ultimately need to be backed by the threat of force in extreme circumstances.

       Let them man pretend that violence just doesn't happen and having means of defending yourself is stupid. He probably thinks we're both gun nuts when in reality I'm just a collector who's not even shot half of my collection (one had its 100th birthday last year!) and you sound like a reasonable dude.

       Also I know several people who hunt for their own meat because it's cheaper that way. Would we ban hunting rifles and shot guns as well? This is America where low income assistance is a joke and some people "make too much money" to get help. What about those people? Just no meat? No food for them?

       "Kill" doesn't mean "murder". Actually, I would prefer not to maim or kill. I don't like violence. However, if someone is going to harm me or other innocent people, I would prefer to stop the threat in whatever way requires the least risk to innocent people. That's usually killing.

       Advertising for any medicine is illegal in many European countries, and for a good reason. Why do should you have the need to watch ads if Doctors already know what's good for you?

       This moves the problem to the doctors, that's why there are strict rules for doctors receiving gifts from Pharma companies and such as well.

       Blame the doctors too. They push drugs all the time people dont even need. I watched my dad fight opium addiction for 10 years. I think it even had something to do with his passing. He would go to pain doctor after pain doctor giving him oxycontins and oxycodone. Its an awful cycle, even my dad used them right at first but it caught him and my mom for a little while. Watching my dad break his ribs on purpose and calling the ambulance and telling them he fell was just heartbreaking. It turned him into a nother person. He didnt take them to get high, he actualy needed them at first ,He was burried in a ditch that collapesd in on him and ge was bed riddrn for a year. But it spiraled into something more. Its just an awful thing to deal with weather it be the user or the people around them.

       It's not just the withered up addict in a dark corner that people often imagine. It's our fucking Grandmas and our brothers and everyone in between feels the pain. And you're right, it starts with drug companies rewarding doctors for writing more prescriptions. Who's accountable for that?

       This is a disgusting use of cherry picking data. Sure only 7 people died in schools in 2016-2017, but you completely ignore the other 15094 people who died via firearms in 2016 and 15590 in 2017.

       Seriously, you guys need gun control. Why can you not accept this? This is completely mental to me. I live in Australia and my brother owns a shotgun and a few lower caliber rifles for pest control. All it took was time and patience to get these weapons, none of which you idiots seem to have. I've also never bore witness to a shooting in public (or private), ever... How many Americans can claim the same? I'd love to see those stats.

       America is literally ranked the 10th worst country in the world for gun violence homicides and is literally the only developed country in that top 10. But all the statistics are out of date, so it could be worse or better.

       So you think the UK and USA gun violence statistics cannot be compared because the UK has gun control? What a bullshit argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       The UK, Australia have guns in the hands of the public, just less of them, because you need a reason to own a gun in these countries. Unlike in America, you can literally walk into a store and buy a gun, a lethal weapon, over the counter, no questions asked, no license required (driving a car, which is also a weapon, requires a license, why not a gun?). Guns in the hands of unstable people who might be angry at someone for petty reasons, or brainwashed with dangerous ideology (like the guy in this shooting).
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't just keep allowing the public to so easily acquire lethal weapons.

       Because the majority of homicides are gang related or drug related and confined to a few highly populated areas.  It makes no sense to impose huge regulations on such a massive country in hopes that it will stop criminals in a few urban areas.

       Well I think we have a few issues.  First, high homicide rates coincide almost perfectly with racial minority concentrations and very well with poverty.  As a start, most of those countries are almost entirely European.  Blacks make up 3.5% of the population in the UK, 1.6% in Australia, 1.42% in Ireland, 1% in Sweden and Finland, vs 13% in the US.  So considering the violence is centered around these groups, and most other countries don't have these groups, that explains enough of the violence to get the US on par or below the rest of the world.

       Yeah, you've got a violence/gun problem on top of a racism problem on top of the social problem - doesn't really change the fact that you've got a gun problem. Because e.g. mass shootings ain't a racial minority problem and those also mostly happen in the US.

       Maybe this doesn't apply to the US, but here in Australia our last mass shooting was in the 90s. Then the government passed extremely strict laws on firearms.

      <p>
       And since the law’s passage, there has not been a single mass shooting in Australia.

       Before all this we had a mass shooting about every two years or so.

       The amendment doesn't say take away, it says infringe.  Americans have the constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms, the government is specifically restricted from doing anything that would act so as to limit or undermine that.

       Jim Crow laws were overturned in 1964 by the Civil Rights act.

       And I guess you’re right about the wording of the second amendment. Still though, how people can care more about that then the fact that lives are being lost is beyond me.

       The lives being lost are damn few, and there are many solutions that are being ignored, because they don't meet the goal, which is restrictions on guns.  The conversation is never "How can we improve this." its "When will we be allowed to restrict guns."  I have a plan that I think would help, at the very least, make a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       End gun free zones.  All they do is disarm law abiding concealed carriers, who are statistically more law abiding than police, who are allowed to carry.  Force any school shooter to confront the idea that someone might very well shoot back.
      </p>
      <p>
       Decriminalize drugs.  The war on drugs helps no one.  Addiction is a disease, not a crime.  Legalize marijuana and tax it, funnel the money into healthcare (of all kinds, not just mental health, people need help).  This will also hit gangs hard since drug sales are usually their main source of income.
      </p>
      <p>
       Start outreach programs for students who are struggling.  They need to know someone is there to help, and that they aren't at it all alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seal records of most felons.  When they get out of prison, they have served their time and repayed their debt to society.  As long as their crime was non-violent (and a few others), we gain nothing by making them report it when trying to get a job, and then they end up either right back in crime, or right back in jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Encourage media outlets to stop sensationalizing mass murder.  We know there are individuals out there with the necessary conditions to commit mass murder.  Research suggests the media reports (some of them like a damn scoreboard) inspire more shooters, as well as teach them how to carry our their shooting better.
      </p>
      <p>
       All options that I would be good money would cost significantly less, wouldn't violate anyone's rights, and solve multiple problems at a time, instead of just making one of the tools harder to get.

       I agree with ending gun free zones and decriminalizing drugs, but for different reasons. Gun free zones are only ineffective because you can leave the area and just bring a gun back, they really are a complete waste of time. And a persons drug use won’t directly kill or harm other people around him, so I don’t see why that isn’t just a personal choice, albeit a harmful one. All we can do is offer help, and if they decide that they wanna kill themselves and keep using drugs, that’s their choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outreach programs are a good idea, but they don’t necessarily work unless the student tells someone that they need help, or they ask for it themselves, and although I guess they might still be useful, they require the student of their parents to request the help first.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also agree with the fact that the media should stop sensationalizing mass murder, but there isn’t really anything we can do to legally prevent that without infringing on the first amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sealing the records of felons is a very touchy thing, but assuming that the crime or situation which caused it (at the discretion of a court), was of good reason, I wouldn’t be against it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing with all of these is, as smart and useful as they are, is that it’s still possible that one traumatized kid might get through all of these things, buy a gun, and kill someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gun restrictions have been proven to work in almost every other first world country, and the only reason America can’t move forward with them, is the Second Amendment. People like to compare guns to cars and knives and other stuff, but the thing is that those things serve other important purposes. They weren’t intended for killing. A gun does one thing, and that is kill, so why people are so determined to defend their right to kill is beyond me.

       nah. there's a reason your country is the one with all the fucked up school shootings and shit. the rest of us are quite happy with having reasonable restrictions on assault rifles and such. then again, we're all big fans of our universal health care systems too, which you seem not to be into. you guys are kinda on your own on the guns and the health thing. so i guess.. uh... good luck?

       If you use the definition for mass shootings that the US likes to, you have had several mass shootings since.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why wouldn't these same laws be applicable to the US in order to reduce the number of mass shootings?

       For starters, there is scale.  It would require confiscation of 60-80 million guns here which would either cost a fortune we don't have, or require repealing 2 constitutional amendments.  They can't possibly get the votes, and the Supreme Court has several rulings stating the same laws would be unconstitutional here.  Not sure if you know how our laws work, but if the Supreme Court says they are not constitutional, they are null and void.

       They confiscated them.  I guarantee they didn't pay full value, and it wasn't optional.  That's not a buyback.

       I agree. The accountability from any manufacturer is non existent. Now they're going after doctors who prescribe too much and patients who need their meds and the manufacturers get off scot free, if anything they'll be fined a couple of million dollars while raking in hundreds of billions per year. They win. Ethics clearly doesn't exist in the corporate world anymore.

       I believe this is a bigger issue than guns. Walk around any metro area and tell me what you see more of? In Brooklyn it's flooded with drug addicts looking for a way to get their pills, most of them don't have guns, they would hock it immediately.

       A few kids were killed yesterday, how many people died from an overdose or accidental overdose? The only reason everyone is up in arms about this shit is because it's muh children so they try to guilt you into feeling bad. Watch what is going to happen now. Schools are going to have cameras everywhere, police in and around schools, students arrested for "acting out" just look at this sub crying like bitches to further the police state, now imagine the rest of the docile country.

       Quite the opposite. Gun laws were very strict in Germany before Hitler rose to power, and he loosened regulations for "good, law-abiding citizens" (Nazis), while still banning Jews from owning guns.

       Michigan and other states and municipalities are in a lawsuit against a few pharmaceutical companies for their pushing opioids on the general public. So yes. They very well may be legally held responsible.

       Do u know how legal precedent works? If they successfully sue the companies and hold them liable, then if the companies continue the practice, they'd be liable for any other damages that result from those practices. Once you say "you can't do that" it behooves the company to change their practices.

       Because opiate manufacturers aren’t producing illicit Fentanyl. In addition to the CDC double counting numbers (and coming clean which hasn’t been published mind you as commonly known) as a result contradicts lower script writing, and an overall decline in overdoses attributable to pharmaceutical narcotics since about 2009. Big Pharma knows this and is fighting tooth and nail because they actually tried to fix this problem after the Florida, Kentucky, and West Virginia Pill Mill issues came about. The charts show a completely different story when you compare real numbers vs propaganda to finance Medicaid paid rehab and drug court mandated programs of course created by big PHARMA with drugs like Vivitrol. Look no further than Indiana’s new law. The company actually drafted the laws for the state lol. It’s ridiculous. So now instead of making mills off pills, they’re making $1,000 per shot on the tax payers dime (Medicaid approved rehab drugs), vs what was happening on the insurer’s dime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course deaths reported by medical examiners and labs during this period of time wasn’t specific in the type of narcotic most overdose from outside of a morphine equivalent. When samples have been retested and specific to the drug moving forward they’re finding the typical culprit as an illicit Fentanyl or a mix of alcohol, benzodiazepines, and other drugs where labels specifically say not to mix with the drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point you have to blame the largest supplier of street narcotics, the drug cartels, CIA, and of course China - as well as human citizens of the USA, I mean our appetite for drugs is extreme. Meanwhile the DEA, CDC, and Federal Government are blaming the Pharma industry when analysts who study Afghanistan have proven our military involvement was like pouring fertilizer on the illicit Heroin trade, shaking up drug markets - if not the entire reason we where there to start with?
      </p>
      <p>
       Islamic hardliners (now called ISIS) had actually banned the production of illicit poppy which showed a massive decline in street heroin (forcing a new more powerful drug to take its place) until we showed up relinquishing control back to the farmers actually allowing them to produce even more heroin. When the ideal solution would have been offering a white market for big Pharma, but that’s controlled through countries west of the Middle East - so the black market raged back, and then some, combining Fentanyl, thus a much higher number of overdoses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drug cartels realized early on when we fucked up the heroin market is was easier and much more profitable to just mix Fentanyl in with the slighter flow of heroin in turning a profit. Then, realized it was easier to just produce illicit Fentanyl inside the US after shipping from China, through Canada, and down into Chicago for distribution across the US vs the southern border - directly into their market the Midwest and East Coast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they produce Fentanyl based - Xanax, Hydrocodone, Oxy, Roxy, whatevs you want in millions of pills daily right here in the US. About two years ago the DEA noticed an alarming trend. At the border less and less narcotics were coming through, replaced by pill presses and mixing/stepping chemicals to produce dark Pharma lookalikes. Most of the illegal pills going around now are simply Fentanyl look-a-likes as most of the Pharma loose control and slip through narcotics have dried up for the most part outside of Classic markets where it’s distributed via foreign markets and redistributed back to the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why.

       Yes! Right now there are ever-tightening controls on pain medication and legit cancer patients can't find treatment for their pain and ppl with pain conditions are being left to suffer. 
Meanwhile, the propaganda machine keeps saying the problem is prescription opiates. The main problem in 2018 illicit heroin/fentanyl, NOT prescription opiates.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Between 2010-2015 opioid overdose deaths in the US increased by 65%, roughly 13,000. And even a cursory examination of Figure 2 shows that increase was entirely due to injectable drugs like heroin or fentanyl."

       Yup. Check out Pharmacist Steve’s blog. He’s the one that called out the CDC. They actually responded and said it was flawed. Which I couldn’t believe. I have an entire database full of research on this topic and working on a book, but you know how that goes;)

       I did once and here’s what happened: And I’m not a paranoid weirdo.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was down voted to oblivion even with tons of research linked, quoted, and cited. One of the websites even sent me a DMCA notice of copy-write for quoting their statements and I did so within the bounds of the law at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got tons of hate mail in my inbox from families who’s children died from overdoses. And it was well written with zero accusations or mean spirited. It was just the truth, backed up with morgue and medical examiner statements and facts about what is tested and when they started actually deciphering drugs, but still to this day only about 1/3 of the largest cities do it, and zero rural communities. It costs too much is always the complaint, but that’s not always true.
      </p>
      <p>
       My links were then redirected to an Amazon ad virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly the sub deleted my post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two weeks later I started getting downvotes to every single thing I posted from pics of my dog, to random comments on things that just don’t even matter. So, I deleted that UN and am starting over basically.

       Well of course it is, but we’re not getting the entire story. I can’t deny it wasn’t fueled early on and yes they’re guilty, but at some point you have to see what’s going on now that controls are almost to the point you couldn’t get pain pills if your cancer diagnosis required it.

       The pont that everyone omits and/or misses is that guns, shootings, and drugs are just symptoms, and not the real issue at play here.

       Until we stop telling people to suck it up, and start tackling emotional/psycological issues as seriously as they deserve, all of this will keep happening.

      <p>
       Gun manufacturers are legally BARRED from any lawsuits against them for the use of their products.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pharmaceutical companies SHOULD be culpable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get your framing at all, and your misuse of the numbers (narrowed down to school shootings alone) is bizarre.

       Look nobody is denying that drug addiction kills, cancer kills, knives kill. These are valid discussions to have. It just looks like a desperate attempt to change the subject. People want to talk about guns right now. For very good reasons.

       Gun manufacturers shouldn’t be blamed in the first place, they do sell a product that is needed by a lot of people (hunting etc). But people who aren’t directly affected but want to seem like they care don’t have anyone to blame so they pick the next thing they haven’t, and thus why gun manufacturers are blamed.

       My state forestry service says without hunting, deer populations would quickly overwhelm most forests leading to ecological collapse, and that without that population control, we could expect between 5 and 10 times as many animal related traffic fatalities.

       You are actually correct I did forget about that. But it will just amend my statement instead of change it because whenever our local parks have deer problems they have hunters kill deer but they are limited to bows only. So my statement is now very few people actually need to hunt with guns.

       Drug users kill themselves. Gun users kill other people. And besides that, opioids actually serve another purpose besides killing things. Guns are for one thing only, and that is to shoot and kill things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, gun manufacturers shouldn’t be held responsible, the person who shot should. All we need to do is create stricter gun laws and regulation. Almost every first world country has them, and almost every first world country that has them, has no where near as many problems. The problem is clear, the answer is clear, and the only thing standing in the way is people who stand by a 230 year old amendment.

       Ar15s aren't a common murder weapon either, but that doesn't stop us from pouring millions of dollars into trying to ban them.

       Idk, we only have so much time and energy to put towards activism. What do we prioritize on changing as a society? The gun issue is right up there w/abortion, gay rights, and immigration as a political issue. Liberals won the gay rights thing mostly, maybe reforming Big Pharma can b the focus over that now.

       I think big pharma takes in more money then guns, oil and military combined. At least its something like that. Please though, i mean did you ever hear about Bayer producing a blood specifically for children that they knowingly put on the market then when it was proven tainted and law suits occured they pulled the drug, eventually selling it to 7 other countries. This was for children. The president of the company "we did nothing ethically wrong" not a single person went to jail. And, most likely, you never heard about this.  Untouchable

       In people's minds the 7 were innocent and the 66,000 were drug addicts who deserved it. Could also count how many gang killings there were, but again those are people that deserved it. Suburbia is only concerned with things that could happen to "me."

       The Pharm Companies are up there with the top contenders that run this country. They’ll only get slapped with a fine, that the govt gets and nothing will change. The same company that made hundreds of millions of dollars off of a fentanyl spray that created thousands of addicts also mass produces narcan for when they overdose. This companies make money on both sides!

       Well one has to overdose to die so...I reckon if the overdose happened.. via another person.. forcing the pills down the persons mouth. Might have some ground to stand on and it would be different. I would blame the doctors more than the drug company. These "doctors" are the real drug dealers. They stuff kill way more than illegal drug dealers...other than it being illegal.. Any weak ass punk can pull a trigger. One bullet can hit two targets..  pretty sure there aren't any pills that will kill a fool with one pill.... as far as I'm concerned these people lettin the Internet raise they kids. Are major part of the problem. All these little assholes running around...are not getting an upbringing.

       Take a karate class or stand up for your fellow classmates. When they getting picked on. Sure my 8 and 12 year old been pcmasterrace since they could use a mouse and keyboard. And would rather play pc games... but they gonna learn how to treat other humans.

       Explain exactly how gun manufacturers are being held responsible for the actions of their 'products'? Keeping in mind that these products aren't designed for a certain purpose and then being misused, they are designed specifically with no other purpose than to kill and destroy at the highest rate possible. Opiates are actually still to this day the most effective relief for acute pain, the problem isn't with the product, it is with the distribution and lack of regulations in place to provide the drugs to those who truely need it. This is the paradoxical nature of the first amendment right in full view, in that its fine to want access to military grade weapons and hospital grade narcotics but without regulatory bodies in place to limit the access to these things, they are always going be exploited and misused by certain elements of the popultion. Im neither American nor religious, but divine intervention is possibly the only thing that can save the U.S from itself currently...

       the reality is neither is completely correct. Gun manufactures are not responsible for what people do with their firearms, but they are responsible for lobbying against gun control.

       It all needs to be regulated better. But the big difference here is nobody walks into a classroom and forces 17 people to take opiates til they are dead. You don't get to choose to be shot, somebody makes that decision for you.

       That’s why they’re being sued out the ass by governmental organizations and large classes of individuals.  They’ll take a hit, one that they can weather, but enough to piss them off, if not make them remember.  The wheels of justice grind slowly, especially in the American legal system.

       I'm sorry, but who is holding gun manufacturers responsible? That's the dumbest thing I've heard yet. People make guns to make money, and they shouldnt be responsible for what happens to them any more than cigarette manufacturers to their customers. I'm not sure where this post is coming from. Was this said somewhere in the media?

       I think in order to compare the death from overdoses, then you have to compare them to the death due to guns overall, which would include homicide and suicide outside of school. Unless you compare the stats for school shootings vs school overdosing. 
It's not cool to portray the data to take the heat off guns.
But you are right, the pharma companies also have lots of explaining to do about overdosing, but that doesn't mean we neglect gun usage

       The difference is that opioid deaths are self inflicted.  The person takes the drugs and they die, not other people.

       Since you seen to not have experience with opioids (bless you), addiction is extremely, extremely quick. Which is a huge part of the problem. I had an massive arm injury mountain biking and was prescribed heavy pain killers post surgery/reconstruction. My wife, knowing the dangers only let me take them for about a week. Coming off the drugs was worse than the pain, crazy mood swings, depression, and irritability borderline rage(I'm a super chill guy). That shit is scary. I cant imagine what it would have been like had I taken the 3 weeks worth and then had to come off cold turkey.
      </p>
      <p>
       Granted I'd rather do that than be shot in the face, but too many people blow off just how fucking scary addiction can be and how hard and fast it can hit you with these strong prescriptions even when not abused.

       That's my point though. I wasn't abusing it. I was actively wary of it and it still fucked me up. I was chemically addicted at 3 days of appropriate use, and my prescription called for 3 weeks and I could have gotten refills no sweat. I WANTED more of it but I had a strong support system who kept me in check. My point being, when it comes to these heavy pain killers, people need to be more aware. Most opioid abusers do so, or at least started, on a legit prescription.

       it's an idiotic analogy. opioid overdoses are analogous to smokers dying from lung cancer or obese people dying from shoveling too much fried food into their mouths. in those examples at least you're only killing yourself with your choices - in the case of guns you are taking wholly innocent people out with you.

       Opiate addiction isn’t a divisive enough problem to garner attention for votes yet. Everyone is affected by addiction. Almost everyone knows someone that suffers from some form of drug addiction.

       That and the money. The left doesn’t want to take guns away. They still want those weapons to be made and sold to people. Just not the people in their serfdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are both extremely big industries. I guess what it boils down to is people are more comfortable watching a loved one die slowly and painfully through addiction than instantly at the end of a gun.

       be held responsible, people who make a tool are not responsible for how it's used or misused. Why are you trying to sneak anti-gun rhetoric into the title?
      </p>
      <p>
       Drug makers should not be held responsible for addiction/ODs either, any substance can be abused, a bottle of tylenol could take a few people out if they took handfuls of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they should be held accountable for lobbying to keep alternative treatments like marijuana illegal or restricted. The issue is people with mental illness rely on big pharma drugs, and big pharma and the government are working hard to keep it that way and disallow any viable alternative treatments.

       They’re not mutually exclusive. Plus there’s a pretty important distinction to be made between a person being killed by a prescription drug overdose and a person being killed by an assault rifle. The first is an instance of abuse of a product. The second is an instance of a product doing exactly what it was designed and manufactured for.

       Most opiate deaths are not from prescription drugs.  Even the ones that are from prescription drugs are related to the use of benzodiazepines.

       I know that. The OP is talking about opiate manufacturers being held responsible though. The manufacture of recreational opiates is illegal and anyone caught doing so will most certainly be held responsible. It stands to reason he wasn't talking about opium farmers.

       Just my point of view but I feel as though this comparison is completely irrelevant? 
Yes pharmaceutical manufacturers need to be dealt with but I am certain that all these drug overdoses are not from junkies running around stabbing people with drugs. The difference is people who die from drugs are the ones who of drugs. Random people don’t just get a prescription and overdose (not majority of the time at least). The difference is that innocent children going to school getting an education and psychopaths and people with other mental illnesses have access to weapons they shouldn’t. How can you compare drug addicts to innocent kids getting shot for no reason?

       Around 1.4 million Americans have died to firearms in the last 50 years, since 1968. That averages out at around 20,000 a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) You tend to shoot other people against their will when killing them. It's incredibly rare for someone to OD via doing drugs against their will. Comparing the two is pretty simple.

       Don’t forget, Philly is opening a “safe space” to shoot up so you won’t OD instead of enforcing laws against drugs.

       Unrelated, they’ve also mentioned making safety glass in convenience stores (the kind that protects cashiers from robberies, etc) because it makes people “feel discriminated”

Pharmaceutical companies have so much money that fighting them is damned near impossible.  And, I know I've heard of a couple of lawsuits like this.

       While these are all great arguments might I add one that is oh so true yet so ugly and without solution that is a real threat to all humanity? That fact that there are people who along with their partners married or not should by the very maligned genes that make up their existence have no business whatsoever creating children. Children who grow as copies of both bad genes, who in turn continue the genetic line only worse through no fault of their own. We all no people like this, we see them and say, please for the sake of our humanity do not have any more!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is extreme and vile and of course impossible to imagine in any way correcting right. My God it brings up visions of the worst memories of history.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet when you step back and se it objectively, it's true.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's true at its most palatable form as mental illness or in another form as racial hatred, depression, sociopathic behavior, or even straight stupidity.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the answer to this since it is inevitably  apart of the equation to all arguments here. And no, kindness or putting the children into a good home never changes the genes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure there will be a viscous hatred toward me for even mentioning it, but nonetheless this truth is part of all the evolutionary perils we face.

       Not a paid commenter, just a sensible gun owner that believe in sensible gun regulations, universal background checks, closing the gun show loop hole and outlawing bump stocks.  If you love the second amendment and your guns, you would be wise to get on board with moderate gun reform because the alternative is that the millennial generation that is growing up terrified of being murdered in school will eventually repeal the 2nd amendment and take your guns.  The public outcry is growing and while it won't happen tomorrow it will eventually happen if something isn't done to stop these mass shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, school shootings are absolutely real there are hundreds of victims and thousands of witnesses.  Furthermore, if you are honest with yourselves you know that owning an a couple of ARs and 10,000 rounds of ammo is no deterrent to the Federal Government.  Gun owners like to act like they are the final check and balance for a corrupt government.  A few thousand nut jobs with MOAN ABE tattoos who can't agree if 9/11 was perpetrated by the government, the Illuminati, or international Jewish conspiracy aren't capable of uniting to become any kind of armed fighting force.  Gun owners are fed NRA propaganda until it runs down their leg and you guys regurgitate it on these forums right on cue.  Our government is so incredibly incompetent and inefficient that they can't even keep the Federal Government funded.  You guys like to get on these forums and talk big about how you are the only ones who see the danger and the government is trying pacify and disarm you so that they can take advantage of the people.  They don't need guns to do that, they are already doing that by funnelling your tax dollars to their rich friends and engaging in dirty business practices and deregulating big banks.  The gap between the richest and poorest is wider than ever and everyone still has their guns.   They keep you distracted by telling you that libtards are coming for your Bibles and guns while they are cashing out.  Your votes are more powerful than your guns, but first you have to realize you been had.

       There seems to be a lot of misinformation here, and unfortunately the title just adds to it.
      </p>

       Opiate manufactures have faced more legal accountability than gun manufacturers. Multiple major cities (most recent is NYC) have sued Purdue for damages and misleading advertising about their dangerous product related to the opioid epidemic. Chicago won their lawsuit. More could be done to help the opioid epidemic, but it should be noted that gun companies have not yet faced this same level of legal accountability. As of this week Purdue declared they no longer will advertise directly to doctors. Currently gun manufactures give millions of dollars to the NRA for advertising and lobbying. Stopping this and holding them legally accountable for the damages they've caused with the mass shooting epidemic is absolutely a good start to making change. It's better than doing nothing, which has been the current solution.

       It's the user, not the maker of the product. If that was the case, then every accident in a vehicle would result in a lawsuit to the auto manufacturer.  Just like any drug, if taken in enough quantities, can kill you. It's not the manufacturer of the product that's at fault. Too many doctors hand them out like candy. Although stricter laws should be in place, the people who really need the pain killers would suffer greatly.

       . Since the start of February many Dutch institutions (doctors, universities, cities and NGOs) are collaborating on sueing the tobacco industry for being responsible on making people addicted to tobacco. Depending on what the outcome of this case is, this example may be followed up by other countries and on other industries 😄

       But gun manufactures have never been held accountable. People have tried to sue them but the cases never even went to trial as far as I know. It'd be like trying to see Toyota if a drunk driver killed a family member using a Toyota.

       Umm that 66,972 number is ALL deaths be it illegal drugs and other prescription drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people who OD have other substances, (up to six different drugs) in their system including alcohol yet you push these numbers as if it is only prescription opioids.........just like the government wants you to since they like to pile up these numbers and really don't want dissect the difference and causes....
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW a whopping 92% of people don't finish their prescribed pain medication and chronic pain sufferers are even less likely to abuse their medication......I know I was one of them.

       In the 2011 censes there was 17 million students that were attending high school during that year between 9th through 12th grades.  We can assume that those numbers are higher today.  Out of all these millions of people only a handful have committed these terrible crimes by bringing weapons to school and shooting other students.  Although these are very tragic events, the odds of having more of these type of crimes committed as per the population that attends school show that we can not blame video games, guns, nor administration as the cause.  We have to understand that our schools are safer than we believe and publicizing these tragic events so strongly and then using them as examples to push gun control is irresponsible.  We are very lucky there hasn't been a whole lot more of these incidences in comparison to the school population in our nation.  If we keep putting out into the public domain all this shock and awe we are encouraging another broken person to commit the same monstrosity.

       Ok, but pills hijack the chemical processes in your brain to make you want more. School shootings are sick scum that take advantage of a system to allow them to commit their acts. You see less because they’re WIILDLY different and your post is why I can’t take this subreddit seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you’re going to talk about shootings, include mass shootings and not just school shootings in your statistics. Pretty sure more than 7 people died in Vegas in October and the same arguments are being brought up.

       They both should be held accountable. Just because one isn’t doesn’t mean the other shouldn’t. I can never understand this reasoning. There’s always going to problems. You can’t not fix problems because other problems exist. That’s just juvenile.

       are you claiming no one has ever suggested that Pharmas are to blame for the opioid epidemic? dont try to make this a one or the other situation. neither thing has to do with each other. You know what is common about both though, we complain about the sources of these problems, and the government never does anything about it. Elected politicians are not looking out for their constituents, they are looking at that Pharma and NRA money that will come their way if they vote against the interests of the people that voted for them.

       Gun manufacturers should not be responsible for what people do with their products. If someone uses a gun inappropriately they need to be held responsible. You will never stop random acts of violence and you will never stop killers and criminals from doing their deeds. Its a shame people want to take guns from responsible people and not worry about the real problem: illegally acquired high powered fire arms. Get off the bandwagon and educate yourselves.

       Money makes the world go round, and big Business has way more money and influence then most of us realize unfortunately. In the US at least..
Pot is a great example of this, once big pharmaceutical companies figure out a way to profit off pot whether it be via patents for certain genetics (like Monsanto did with soy), cutting out the little guys buy basically “lobbying” for new laws/regulations, or artificially increase land prices to push out anyone smaller and eliminate competition, then I promise pot would be legal nation wide in no time. 
Same thing with these politicians speaking in favor of an oil company that has in some form or another, given them something of monetary value.  Probably a good time to clean house and start fresh..

       Because everyone who’s against it is going to continue doing their best to stop it. Gun restrictions don’t take away the right to own guns, and I have no clue why people seem to think they do. Just like Jim Crow laws and other voting restrictions didn’t violate the 15th, they just made the process harder.

       Of course just using them is a risk factor, I'm not arguing that, but legitimate prescriptions are way lower on abuse and addiction than people buying them on the street, which is happening more and more because of the drug war. I just think we should be treating addiction as a public health issue rather than a criminal one.

       The over all influence of big pharma and the impact it has on the health, safety, culture, economics, and quality of of life is the issue. The odds either one of us get shot in face is low as shit. But big pharma is impacting us both daily. The net effect is the issue, not the one off potential effect of guns.

       You're not going to like this either but I voted for Jill Stein. I know, she's the image of authority.

       I think you're right that in some places gun rights are unjustly restricted as a result of politicians taking the easy route of throwing out some "feel good" ineffective and inconvenience.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the fact that tackling the mental health aspect is ignored doesn't logically imply that more restrictive gun laws will reduce avoidable gun deaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you don't get to say what the effect of a law will be. You don't know because no one does. We can only make reasonable changes and see what happens. It's way too complex of a system to talk about how you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       "But they'll still get what they want"
Yeah, alright. How is that going to work? Imagine an insane person.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can either get the gun legally and easily for a fair cost or have to find a criminal contact who would sell them a gun for a big price increase.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guns are not drugs. There is not nearly enough willing illegal gun users to support this idea that some random crazy guy could buy a gun as easily as some weed.
