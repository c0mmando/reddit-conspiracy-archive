       Itâ€™s confirmed via the militia itself that the killer trained with them, so not sure how itâ€™s a shill thing to post, unless you are referencing the source only. The fact is this guy was a member trained by and radicalized white supremacy nut job. Or is that not the case?

       White Supremacists do not like Hispanics. Just because the government conflates the two, does not mean they are the same or accepted as the same in those groups. Thinking so, just shows your massive ignorance in regards to the topic.

       There were Jews who worked for Hitler. White supremacists also hate Slavs, but there are tons of Slav neo-nazis. What's your point? Is this the best comeback you got? White supremacists don't like Hispanics? Except for the light skinned ones who work with them. Are you this childish that the world is so black and white (no pun intended)?

       Those two words are wrongfully conflated. In Slavic countries, there are White Slavic Supremacist who unite under the flag. It really has nothing to do with "neo-nazis" or Nazism. That's just the word given to them. It's really about White Slavic National/Power.

       In America, there are Slavic neo-Nazis. Regular Nazis. "White ethnostate" this and "gas these people" that. I'm sure there are some in Slavic countries as well, because here's a secret: Nazis are fucking idiots. They are not bright. So no, I'm not talking about "Slavic supremacists."

       You've conceded already that someone whom the Nazis hate can work with them. Sure, "business is business." But it completely invalidates the base of your argument. Which was, Nazis hate Hispanics so that makes it impossible to "join" them. Yet we have tons of proof of groups of people the Nazis hated "working with" them. At this point it seems like you who are moving the goal posts. You admit a Jewish or Hispanic person can work with a Nazi in achieving their goals, but...it's different. They don't get the secret handshake? Or maybe they're too dumb/gullible to realize the Nazis may/will probably turn on them at a certain point?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, what does the Nazi lose by convincing a Hispanic kid to ruin his life and that of many others? It furthers the Nazis goal, doesn't it? I'm sorry but your point is childish and lacks a deeper understanding of the grey areas in the real world.

      <p>
       No it doesn't. Doing business !== joining or accepting them in their group(s). A more realistic example of this, would be the Italian mafia. They work with the Jewish mafias, but if you are Jewish, you will never be allowed into the "family". It's a strict, Italian only. Same thing applies to White Supremacist groups.

       You're trying so hard to prove me wrong and it's quite laughable. You keep making strawmen, in order to prove your point. You are the one moving goal posts, and shifting, here. Not me...

       Dude you're trying to argue in circles cause you don't really have an argument. Why wouldn't a white supremacist co-opt a young impressionable kid full of confusion and hatred just because he's not white? That only makes it better to the Nazi. White supremacists aren't ALLERGIC to non white people you dingus. They don't consider them human or "as human." So they have no qualms using them like tools to further their ends. I don't know how this is such a hard concept for you to understand. It's happened before, will happen again.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Uhh but a Jewish person or Hispanic person or whatever wouldn't because they know Nazis hate them duh checkmate"
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah if only people who were, I dunno, dumb and/or gullible didn't exist that might be a fucking argument. In reality it's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you so naive to think a Nazi couldn't shake hands with a Jew and smile and say welcome to the club, just to use him and later murder him? Are you really? Are you skipping third period right now? Get back to class.

       Well the leader of said white nationalist group says different. Hereâ€™s a link, if you donâ€™t like it google it and youâ€™ll find dozens of other sources to corroborate.
