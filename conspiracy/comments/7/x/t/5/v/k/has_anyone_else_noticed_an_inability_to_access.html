        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed that i am not getting access to the same information that i was just 3-4 months ago. My searches yeild different results. Results that are not even close to what I&#39;m looking for. I feel like information is already being blocked from your average citizen. (Way faster then i though all the net neutrality changes would take) </p>

<p>One example is i live in Florida and i didn&#39;t hear anything about the school shooting until today. Granted i don&#39;t want television but yesterday i was on reddit a lot and i am subscribed to subreddits like news and worldnews etc. I was also on youtube a lot and nothing came up on trending. I&#39;m so confused. Usually when something like this happens (I&#39;m sad to say &quot;usually&quot;) there is a live thread right on the front page or tons of posts about it. I&#39;m not saying there -wasn&#39;t- , I&#39;m just saying that i didn&#39;t see any of them! Which I&#39;m very confused and concerned about. Also i actively had to search for information on the school shooting. </p>

<p>Has anyone else experienced anything like this??</p>

<p>First page result is paid ads then a page of ads that pay people to make them associated to any given topic. Then you start to find actual information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also in Florida, checked Reddit yesterday after someone texted me about the shooting. No sticky, no posts about the shooting on the front page as far as I could scroll. Same with other apps like Google. I had to actually google &quot;school shooting Florida&quot; to find anything. Even later in the day yesterday, last night, and even this morning I saw nothing about the shooting on the front page, until tonight. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a bit of a stretch but relatable. I used to be a frequent r/collapse users because I am fascinated by the data coming out of the arctic / other carbon related changes etc. ever since the Trump moratorium on climate scientists speaking to the press, which happened Jan last year, the flow of information has slowed to a crawl and the sub is much less active. </p>

<p>To this day it is much much harder to find relevant climate change info. Any other r/collapse users notice this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What search engine do you use?  Sometimes you might use Google and leave yourself signed in so getting to gmail or YouTube is easier.  Google creates a profile by putting tracking cookies on your computer and monitoring your online (as do lots of websites), and your search results are then affected by that profile.  Sign out and delete all your cookies, and/or open a private browsing window in Firefox if you use it. See if you get different search results.  This is way oversimplified, but it could help somewhat.  Good, effective VPNs are expensive....</p>

<p>I look on eBay to buy things, and just by signing out and searching in a private browsing window I saw just how much eBay was limiting my search results before I did that.  It pissed me off, but now I know how to get more complete results.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>google is geolocking search as well. </p>

<p>When I posted something like that I get downvoted. Google FB etc they have a monopoly on their slice of the internet and they can squeeze it at will as there is no regulation on the internet. Worse yet if the corporate run US gov takes control of their internet, goodbye any real oversight on that matter. </p>

<p>But going forwards, the US based current political, economical resource conflict with the east. Means this corporate elitists are putting pressure on the world through the web and are squeezing that monopoly. </p>

<p>You arent going crazy OP, I have such a hard time googling now its almost impossible for me to find things that I want. I google specific term like &quot;watching movies on a smartwatch&quot; instead of getting forum posts or discussion the entire 2 pages of google search is ad placement and articles relating to google wear, galaxy smart watches, occasional apple watch post. Nothing NOTHING relating to the actual search term. </p>

<p>Thats the future, where adds pay revenue, information that isnt/cant be monetized, is nto information worth our time. They dictate what is and isnt. This, at its core is defended by people saying its private corporation they can do what they want. WHat kind of world have we created where such ideologies are stated with pride?</p>
