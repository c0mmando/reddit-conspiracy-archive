       I’ll try to keep this short and sweet.
      </p>
      <p>
       In almost every single thread, no matter the conspiracy, the discussion always seems to end up with one group calling another group out, slurring, etc. baseless attacks to derail the thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s been awhile since I’ve browsed this sub and actually found substance. It’s now a toxic breeding ground for arguments somewhat similar to Facebook or r/politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an avid conspiracy theorist, I’m formally requesting that the mods step up and begin seriously moderating the threads and comments for things that are obviously biased to one group, or political party.
      </p>
      <p>
       With conspiracy’s we need to have a birds eye perspective. What is best for everyone. How to tell the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was one of my favorite subreddits when I came to Reddit years ago. Let’s get back to that. If there’s a better way than what I’ve brought up, let’s please find it. Whatever we can do, we need to do it.

       I can see how at first glance it can be taken that way. I’m just looking for ways to get politics out of our discussions, even if it is a topic. We should be able to communicate thought without having to attack one another
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking on the attacks it just seems like 99% of the time it’s people bashing red/blue, left/right, etc, and no matter what it derails whatever the conversation was about

       Ehh I get the idea, but it would be so hard to differentiate between overly partisan views, and someone saying something like "Senator X, Democrat from Minnesota caught in bribery scheme" or something along those lines.

       Do you have an idea of how they would tell the difference between when someone was speaking objectively or if they're pushing an agenda?

       I mean you can almost tell just by the “tone” of the comments or the threads. Like when something is being discussed and all of a sudden trump or Hillary gets mentioned when the conversation had nothing to do with either of them. From there the thread gets turned into Facebook garbage

       I think about this a lot, it may make it more conspiracy oriented, but the ends don't justify the means.  I can't think of any efficient or fair way to determine what is partisan and what isn't, and if I could I still would be reluctant.  I have seen some partisan posts make good points.  Censorship is never the answer, regardless of the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree, it gets toxic on occasion, but the new button and the post title helps me navigate to the conspiracy posts and avoid the political ones.

       Perhaps the biggest conspiracy theory of our time is that Trump colluded with Russia in the 2016 election. I think it's strange that people wouldn't want to talk about that in a conspiracy sub. It's even more strange that people don't really think of it as a conspiracy theory. They think it's proven.
      </p>

       We get enough censorship here from the /politics/ gang running rampant with the downvotes, which hides posts and comments from people who disagree with their echo chamber, so we don't need any more censorship from you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if you're not interested in politics... but this is the big one right now. This would be like showing up after 9/11 and telling people "let's not talk about planes and buildings and whatnot".

       No that’s not what I’m saying. I understand and actually do believe in the election corruption. BUT, to look at it and discuss one sided is a problem. As long as facts are being brought up, and there isn’t a bias, that is more than worthy for discussion

       I mean we absolutely could, we just don’t have to have a partisan take to it. We had these discussions years ago, now it seems as though it’s almost impossible, because the community seems to think it can’t happen. It has happened and r/conspiracy was a much more thought provoking society. Like I said in my original post, it’s almost down to r/politics levels of just whatever fucking side people are on.

       To make myself clear I believe the two party system is broken and that we need a clear wash of our current judicial elites

       Yea, I mostly agree with you. I think maybe the best solution might be some sort of "good faith participation rule."

       Personally, I think the shills goal has always been to divide and conquer this sub. I see how they did it, and its really not that surprising to me that it worked. And now they've got their votebots going on many threads and they've pretty much hijacked the sub. I know they want to silence regular users and I hate to potentially let them win, but there are so many other forums that aren't nearly as shilled out as this one has become. I find myself coming here far less often than I used to.

       Censorship on things that OBVIOUSLY don’t bring anything to the conversation at hand. Lobbying involves money. I believe that I’m just simply seeing if there are others out there who think the same way I do. Now, if you’d like to add something meaningful to the post, that’d be great!

       You’re really gonna nitpick? If you read any of the other comments I’ve stated my opinion on this. I don’t wish to censor those who want to bring the truth. Those who derail conversations with their partisan trash comments need to be stopped. Also people who don’t fucking add anything to discussions and just bullshit around need to get out of here (you)

       I made a simple observation devoid of anything personal or political.  Anything else you read into that was manufactured in your own head.

       You're the one making this personal for some reason and turning this into some kind of pissing match.  Personally I dont care, I think its hilarious that you want to censor people and then scream at them for pointing it out.

       It added a lot:  it showed the hypocrisy of such a request.

       Your request adds nothing.  Its a request for censorship in a subreddit about conspiracies, which ironically, seem to be taking place within both major political parties.

       It is fucking mind numbing how colossally ignorant your request is.  Whats even more fucking mind numbing is you keep trying to browbeat people who dont agree with you just like the totalitarian you say you arent.

       There is nothing to add to this discussion that is a request for censorship.  Pointing out the hypocrisy is indeed adding something.  It's been so thought provoking you apparently cant seem to shut up.  All you've got is personal insults and attacks on character because at some point even you realize the ridiculousness of your request.

       I don't think so. In my experience, people's perception of what's "not contributing" or "bullshitting" or "shilling" is heavily biased by their own political persuasion.

       I don’t think I agree with that. I can tell when someone is bsing. There are threads that have no mention of politics, then someone brings up trump or Clinton and the whole thread goes to shit and no one decides to comment anymore because they’re tired of seeing the same shit I am. It’s just fucking lame r/conspiracy has fallen so far. This place used to be an internet research pinnacle. Now it’s a toxic breeding ground similar to Facebook.

       This is akin to asking government to limit the free speech of those that disagree with you. It is tyrannical and disgusts me.  I unsubscribe from all over moderated subs.

       Careful, you're sounding like a true tyrant there. It is tyranny to limit debate. Everyone has an equal voice in this world. To limit a voice even under good intentions
       <strong>
        ALWAYS
       </strong>
       leads to censorship.

       Good point.

      <p>
       However, that’s not what I’m trying to accomplish and if it is coming off as tyrannical I guess I need to study tone more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not asking for censorship. I’m asking for the mods to do what they’re supposed to, and clean up the bullshit that has infested this sub. Everything is an argument.

       Like I said in another comment, it used to be about the information. The truth. The outcome. The answers. Not it seems like it’s about “whose side you’re on”

      <p>
       It shouldn’t be that way. I want to get rid of that toxic energy in this community. However it seems like it is a futile effort

       Tyranny has nothing to do with tone. If you are asking the MODs to delete undesireable comments, that is censorship and it doesn't matter if you do it nicely or like an asshole.  Why don't you be more specific? Give us an example and tell us how the MODs should handle it.

       Literally just explained that even though I used the word censor in my OP, that is not my goal. I’ve spelled this out many times. It’s like talking to a brick wall.

       Still, you’ve added nothing. But keep trying! I’ll reply when I get the chance to.
