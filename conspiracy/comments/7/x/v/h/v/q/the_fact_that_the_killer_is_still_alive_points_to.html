    <div class="md"><p>I know the likelihood of this is probably very slim to none, but this is r/conspiracy, so..</p>

<p>I&#39;m wondering if he wasn&#39;t even the one who did it. I know it doesn&#39;t make much sense for him to be at the school when (I&#39;m pretty sure I saw somewhere that) he was expelled. In the article about the History teacher who saved a group of kids, he said the shooter had a helmet on and he didn&#39;t know who it was. Another article said he was found mixed in with a group of evacuating students. I wonder if there&#39;s any chance that he happened to be there and, because of how many people had gone on about how weird he was and how people joked about him doing it.</p>

<p>Again, probably not likely, but definitely something weird happening, as per usual with these things.</p>

<p>The way kids were leaving the building, some lines of kids casually walking out, some kids having there hands on the person&#39;s and shoulders front of them like they are coached and then the next line of kids all having their hands up in the air. Just weird </p>

<p>So they&#39;re okay with killing the patsy but not okay with killing anyone else? That just leaves a lot of loose ends as all the students will know none of their classmates were killed despite the news claiming they were!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just going with the <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> mindset. Check out YouTube. There is a conspiracy about every major killing. Especially Newtown. The Las Vegas shooting has a lot of talk about it as well. Newtown is supposedly a completely fake event with all actors. It helps when the victims are children because they can keep the details out of the public citing that it was a minor. Also in Vegas there was something about no obituary of the victims. Like they just didn&#39;t really kill anyone. And no one showed up at the hospital. Stuff like that. I have no real idea. But that&#39;s the sort of thing that you see here. </p>

<p>This is EXACTLY the sort of person who historically -- whether a major media event at the time (mass shooting) or a similarly tragic event spread over time that doesn&#39;t get media attention until the end (serial killer) -- does this sort of thing.</p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t a person who snapped and then killed.

    <div class="md"><p>Just try to force that red pill down the throat of a normie and watch how they react. A number of years ago I was speaking to a woman who was about 8 years older than myself. I wasn’t interested in her romantically but I could have definitely hooked up. We discussed a variety of topics and somehow, someway Sandy Hook came up. At the time I wasn’t interested in pursuing her so I felt the need to freely speak my mind. Well I pretty much let her have in terms of how deep that rabbit hole really goes. Needless to say her reaction was so negative that the conversation pretty much ended and we never spoke to each other again. So much of this world revolves around a term I coined called “facade management”. Essentially it’s blending into the mainstream solely for survival purposes. It’s unfortunate that this society not only encourages but rewards those that remain blissfully naive/unaware while harshly punishing those that expose the truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Data can be misleading and is often intended to mislead. Who is doing the defining of mass shooting will often indicate their motive/perspective. There are distinctions between spree killers, mass killers, and serial killers, for instance. Some operative lump them into one group, others look at them separately. Motive matters if we&#39;re going to examine causes and solutions. </p>

<p>That mass shootings have increased in frequency has been backed up by several studies. And this is despite a general downward trend in crime, which indicates to me that they should have done the opposite. Furthermore we can see the change in motive pretty easily when we look at the individuals involved in these sorts of events. In the 20th Century, the shooters were most often effected by workplace stress, where that only occasionally has played a role in the spate of killings occurring after 2007. It is a new phenomenon.</p>

It is a wonder that this comment was even left—that&#39;s how bad it is. No one is thinking very deep whatsoever regarding this shooting. I have been studying these shootings for almost a decade, and it again has all the hallmarks as the last major events. It&#39;s almost as if this is peoples first shooting to dissect. </p>

<p>Yet, no one else is posting the obvious: This is part of their agenda—to implement control over the people through the guise of security. This has been going on for many years, and is a concerted effort. This is a culmination of years of preparation by those in power to bring about their vision of world government. It is an effort to teach children that they are inherent criminals and to brainwash them into respecting and obeying unlawful authority. </p>

<p>The school becomes the parent, and the government their shepard. Through these events, they are able to justify and coerce the American people into giving up their rights in the name of security. Through these events, they are slowly implementing the totalitarian police state of the New World Order. Shooter drills have become merely another form of conditioning and control over the young. Eventually, they will succeed in their plan, for the American people have abdicated their freedom, and looked to the media and government to do their thinking for them, thus rendering them fruitless slaves and unable to ascertain what is true, and not true. </p>

<p>I pay no attention to the emotional diatribes laced on this forum and on other channels. I deal in the facts that present themselves and can be proven through research and evidence. I have been through all of these shootings, and am fed up with the people&#39;s sheer willingness to believe whatever they are told. The American people must wake up to the truth before long, or this country will be no more. It&#39;s that simple. The people are losing their rights and freedoms, and they are being misled and indoctrinated into a very dangerous place.  </p>

<p>The very fact that this forum has lost it&#39;s ability to think , is a dire sign that things are spreading to the far reaches, and that is the point of no return. It is to the point now where we begin to very quickly lose our rights and freedoms, because the people can not come to a grasp about the truth. This is the age of deception. Trust no one or nothing, unless you can verify it and prove it in your own research and evidence. That includes the official story line being given. </p>

<p>Cruz sounds like just another frustrated, violent, isolated person, like almost all the mass shooters before him (Paddock excluded, for now). Why do you feel it is unlikely that these people want to essentially end their own lives to lash out at society?</p>

<p>Have you considered that Americans really love guns and that the NRA pays off a lot of politicians? Is it possible that mass shootings leading to gun control would have to be a series of cumulative events? If there was a mass shooting every week for the next 30 years, would the people eventually demand gun control? Every day?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Gun control keeps getting defeated on a federal level, so it&#39;s not working.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s not true. Gun laws are being passed all the time that limit access to guns. They are trying to make it impossible to purchase a firearm. So while they haven&#39;t banned guns outright at this point, they are trying to severely limited people&#39;s access. After Sandy Hook, there were around 40+ gun laws passed by the Obama Administration, adding to the thousands already in place. Gun laws in Florida are now being looked at by Governor Rick Scott, &quot;Everything is on the table&quot; he says. </p>

<p>Hallmarks are the following: </p>

<p>Anti-gun legislation aspect. Parents, teachers, and facility take up the cause of gun control. In past events, they were working hand in hand with the Obama administration to bring this about. They quit their so-called jobs and worked full time going around the country giving speeches on gun control, and what we need to do to as Americans to stop gun violence ie: repeal the 2nd Amendment.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hero aspect. These contrived story lines always contain heroes or multiple heroes. Angel Colon in the Pulse Shooting. These are done to validate and legitimize the story. There is always a hero that is present in these story lines. It is present in all of them. Again, this validates the event in the minds of the people, and pulls upon the heart strings.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple story aspect. They inject story-lines within the story to validate it in the minds of the people, and further confound the truth of what happened in the process. Those adept in symbolism and numerology, will see that they often embed symbols into their designed events for the purposes of communication. This is another indicator of a false happening. Also, there are always multiple angles being played upon in these events. They play both the left right paradigm. Go take a look on the mainstream news videos that are posted on YouTube about this shooting, and just peruse the comments. </p></li>
<li><p>We also have the account of the young girl who claims to have witnessed Cruz in the hallway after the supposed shooting, and yet she claims to have heard shooting at the same time. This indicates something else is going on, and a possible sectioned off part of the school was being used to perpetrate all of this. To add to this, it is possible that this girl is lying as well. Remember, they plant false narratives in the story line to lead people astray. They also like to toy with conspiracy theorists, to lead them on wild goose chases—creating so many story lines that it becomes impossible to ascertain the truth of the matter.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Cruz sounds like just another frustrated, violent, isolated person, like almost all the mass shooters before him.&quot; </p>

<p>Yes, if you believe the story-line that regular people turn violent and go out to kill people in this same fashion., which simply isn&#39;t the case. There is usually a hidden agenda which reveals itself in these events. One must look at all the evidence present, and use past events to see the common thread and repeating themes. That includes interviews, pictures of the supposed shooter, news stories from multiple sources. There is always an agenda embedded within those articles and reports. </p>

<p>As stated in previous comments—The goal is to disarm, coerce, and disillusion the American people. They are doing this through mass shootings, which are being carried out by groups of adepts in psychological warfare. Their goal: neutralize their opponents, and render them futile—bring about the disillusionment of mankind so that they are hopeless in the face of danger, thereby abdicating their freedom in the guise of heightened security, which is only designed to strip the people from their inherent rights as human beings. The American people will then hand over their remaining freedom to stop gun violence, and yet throughout this process, the police will have become militarized through the implementation of measures being carried out after these events occur. The ultimate goal is to foster and bring about a New World Order; a totalitarian police state where the rule of law no longer exists, and we the &#39;cattle&#39; ruled over by the small few. </p>

<p>Guns are the last resort in the face of tyranny. They know they must remove or limit firearms. They can do this through coercion, or outright force. They prefer coercion, because they know that there are millions of Americans willing to die for their freedom if they attempt to take their firearms. All one has to do is look around at the ever-growing police state, and verify what I am telling you with your own eyes. What I am saying will come to pass if the American people do not rise up as a whole and take by their country from. If it is not done now, it will be too late in the future. Those behind the New World Order never stop, and while you sleep, they work behind the veil of secrecy to bring about their vision. Their vision might have been noble, had it not been for how they want to implement and bring it about. Instead of a real world order, it is a world order based on those at the top controlling the bottom feeders.</p>

Break up the family through rampant sexualization and gender confusion and presto - disarm your citizens and they are your slaves. You pay taxes to keep the land you already bought (serfdom anyone?) and taxes to keep the money you already earned. If the mob was extorting you for protection the way local/state/and governments do via police and taxes it would be a crime but..... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s been a slow burn.</p>

<p>Over the last couple years and most recently with the CTR campaigns, we’ve seen a steady rise in IDF groups that use all the tactics, right out of the book, to forum slide. Shill used to be a dirty word in here, now it’s a forgotten one. </p>

<p>They’ve managed to generate enough interest in conspiracy to bring newer “low information” users to the forum while carefully controlling the atmosphere of the content and comment sections here so as to make the new readers “useful idiots” in their agenda.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the content is virtually mainstream news and when it isn’t most comment sections have 1 or 2 users saying something provocative, while 90% of the comments tend to favor the mainstream narrative.</p>

<p>Honestly the fact that they’ve had such a long term, vested interest in co-opting this sub is one of the best conspiracies out there right now.</p>

<p>But don’t dare mention the great architecture of the grand conspiracy in here or you’ll be down voted to oblivion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all over any remotely political or news subreddit now.  It stems from the admins refusal to permit doxxing in certain rare instances.  Nobody would do what OP did here and invent blatant lies and circulate them as true if they thought there was a chance their real name would be tied to it.  Doxxing is dangerous and risky, but it needs to be available as a nuclear option.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Given the guys background and his age, a very disturbed young man with no real guidance or maybe even hope... It&#39;s extremely sad for all the families that lost their children, I have not seen any evidence to suggest this is this a hoax, nor do I believe it to be false flag. But that&#39;s not to say that people wont use this as an opportunity to push an agenda</p>

<p>I think Jordan Peterson explains very well (can&#39;t find original video) what could make a person do something like this and if I&#39;m honest I think it does apply very well to the shooter here. But since he&#39;s alive, possibly we will have more answers eventually <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HKFiH4jhnw&amp;amp;t=109s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HKFiH4jhnw&amp;amp;t=109s</a></p>
