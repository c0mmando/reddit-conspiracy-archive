       Scientists getting paid by governments to study climate change say it is humans.  I happen to believe its the giant ball of fire in the sky thats been around before humans were burning fossil fuels.  What do you believe?

       Actually, when you finally corner the climate scientists, they all admit that they have no idea to what extent humans are the cause of climate change. Many scientists also agree with you that the sun has a much greater impact.

       Blasphemy! The science is settled! Anyone who says otherwise kills baby seals in their spare time.

       Seriously you are correct. The ice core data that shows climate change statistics over thousands of years shows the real story.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have gone through ice ages and much hotter periods than now and that is without carbon emissions from industrialization.

       According to history? Believe it or not, Egypt used to be green and fertile, hence the ancient name "Kemet", which means "Black Soil". Furthermore, the little ice age, in "modern history". The climate is always changing. I don't think humans are actually responsible, for it, though, unless you consider HAARP and Geo-Engineering.

       How long have we been lied to &amp; to what extent?  Completely valid.  There is what there is still a "war" between science &amp; religion.  B/c science can't 100% debunk religion.  Aspects of it sure.  But not 100%.  I am agnostic for this reason.  It's the only logical conclusion between the two in my opinion.

       He gets triggered anytime anyone challenges him on any of his claims. He isn't pushing any envelopes, he is repeating "evidence" like a 3 year old playing the Y game.

       Ask him if he doesn't believe in flat earth and he doesn't believe in a round earth orbiting the sun then what does he believe in?

       Most of it is because he does not understand basic science or history. His argument for why gravity is fake is that cavendish's first experimental measurement of G was done with a simple experiment in a shed... therefore the entire theory of gravity must be wrong... that is like saying early surgery was done with a bottle of alcohol, a mouth gag and some dirty instruments and many people died... so modern surgery is fake... his argument is inane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or why missiles do not fly? He just cannot understand a basic force diagram or understand how flight control surfaces and vectored thrust works... does he admit being wrong? No he gets triggered and doubles down.
      </p>
      <p>
       He won't tell you anything he actually believes in... probably because he wants to sell you a subscription to his $20+/mo website or send you to his youtube videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       The man has proclaimed himself to be the world's leading skeptic but I would posit he is the world's leading ignoramus or best example of the Dunning Kruger effect...

       The person who replied to you, step2thejep is here posting his own links shilling his paid website.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is here to shill his paid website as he is john le bon who made the video below. He has already been banned from the cryptocurrency sites. He was told to stop doing this by the mods. He is not acting in good faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       He claims to be the world's leading skeptic. Most of his claims are rooted in that he does not understand basic scientific concepts and his standard of proof is he has to see something with his own eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       He moves goal posts, attacks people on this sub, all the while never actually elucidating what he believes because that would be giving away for free the genius he offers on his website for $20+ month.
      </p>
      <p>
       He simply is not acting in good faith.

      <p>
       Our collective history (actual history, not the propaganda they teach in "schools")? I mean, the geological evidence of erosion on the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx shows that, it must have been built prior to the desert climate that it is now, hence the name Kemet - Black soil. There had to been a time when Egypt was fertile, wet, and green - which explains the water erosion (ie. amount of rain fall).

       I have looked at the MS academia sources, and alternative academia sources, yes... There is far more evidence in the latter, than the former. For more, check out:

       There are other form of pollution &amp; others ways humans are having a significant impact on the environment that we should all care about and can control more.

Just because i believe we are being lied to about greenhouse gasses doesnt mean i do not care about this planet.  I'm just discussing what really controls the temperature of the earth.

       A better question is:
      </p>
      <p>
       What is a more desirable outcome?  Doing nothing about fossil fuel consumption because you think man-made climate change is false and potentially causing a global extinction event, or moving to stop consuming fossil fuels because you think man-made climate change might be true and cleaning up the environment in the process?
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like only a greedy jerk would support the first idea when you frame the issue around the consequences.  I'm not saying people denying climate change are greedy jerks, I just think if you are against cleaning up the environment for any reason, you probably are one.

       I believe the theory with the most evidence, that comes from the people in the best position to collect that evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't feasibly go out and collect thousands of data readings from all over the globe to even tell whether or not the Earth is warming, or cooling, or if Japan even still exists, as I've never been there.  I have to assess the facts I have available based on their source.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        So from that perspective
       </strong>
       , I think it's most likely that humans are making large, drastic changes to the environment that could cause some discomfort for us in the near and far future,  such as making the climate generally more unpredictable.  This is being done via the burning of petroleum based fuels, unsustainable farming techniques and other human-related activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you're welcome to believe whatever you want, so long as you don't get in the way of evidence-based, scientific observations and reasonable laws that minimize the damage that human activity can cause.

       Present your evidence.  I'll review it &amp; share my concerns where i have them &amp; agree with you where i agree with you.  Keep in mind that this post what controls the temperature of the earth.  Not humans impact on the environment for thinks like overfishing &amp; deforestation which are completely legit concerns.

       You asked what I believe, and I told you where I get my beliefs.  I am not an authority on the weather, I leave that to those I mentioned that are in a position to be authorities.  I don't know what affects the temperature more, but I do know it's dangerous to come to your own conclusions without an appropriate amount of evidence.

       First, humans build tools and machines which both outlive us and never sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, humans have built oil pumps which need an energy supply and maintenance, but otherwise pump much more oil than humans or horses.  When the mechanic who built the pump dies, the pump keeps running.  A mechanic can maintain hundreds of oil wells.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans alone have limited power, but our machines multiply our force.
      </p>
      <p>
       An extreme example of this is the global nuclear bomb arsenal.  If unleashed, even the people with the dumbest belief system agree that the climate would be changed for a long time.  This is an example of how easily humans can quickly change the climate by using machines we have made.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human activity has pumped a known amount of oil, and burned 60% of it.  This directly matches the increase of CO2 from 280ppm to 400ppm.  Humans have increased the CO2 in the troposphere.  In turn, the CO2 is reradiating a measurable amount of infrared that previously radiated away into space.  This is adding energy to the weather, causing more extreme winds, storms, currents, and temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans have greatly changed the climate, and done so in a way that has a positive feedback, or runaway, tendency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, the Sun hasn't changed very much.  The tiny variation due to the more extreme solar minimum is nothing compared to what humans have done to the atmosphere.  Also, the variation in the Sun is cyclic over relatively short (20 yearsish) time periods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously if the Sun changed in an extreme way, that would affect the climate more than human emissions.  For example, if the Sun actually went out, we would freeze to death.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Sun isn't doing anything extreme at all.  Meanwhile, humans have done something very extreme to the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that explains the flaw in the bogus question comparing the relative influence of human industry vs. The Sun on climate.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Are humans more powerful than the sun?" is a dumb question that is nevertheless very popular among certain belief systems, which in turn are full of stupid ideas.  If your thoughts are troubled by this kind of question, your best bet is to start completely over with new parents and kindergarten.  If it's too late for you to start over, try reading and understanding, "Metaphors We Live By," and "On the Structure of Scientific Recolutions."
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it is ridiculously lame that you reposted this question a second time in under 24 hours.  It reeks of polemic intent.
