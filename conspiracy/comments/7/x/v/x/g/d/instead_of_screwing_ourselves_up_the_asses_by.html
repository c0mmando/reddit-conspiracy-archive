       Not only will this require schools to be more picky about the background and quality of person their teachers are, it will stop this bullshit game!! You can't STOP anyone from deciding to go on a mass shooting spree, but you sure as hell can be prepared.

       Most schools have key card access for all exterior doors. Giving every student one may actually make a school shooting more likely to happen.

       Didn't know this was a thing, I've attended classes at two junior colleges and am at a University right now at all three places the doors are unlocked during regular hours and those keycards are for getting into places like the library after hours. Was that way at the University my wife attended too.

       No.. I don't have any interest in guns. I have always wanted to be a teacher, although I never will be at a public school because I disagree with the generic learning system they use. But I would gladly keep a gun in my room to keep my kids safe. Why argue that..? I'm a young lady.. I am getting a gun to keep in my home as soon as possible. It doesnt take a fucking "red neck" to value life and safety.

       Really, all it would take is to maybe have one, two, or three teachers trained and armed, and have a sign saying: "Notice: This school is secure by TWCFC - Teachers with concealed firearm carry". Kind of like how putting an ADT sign outside your house would prevent people from robbing it. I mean the signs saying: "This is a gun free zone" is like putting a sign up at your house saying: "No one is home and the back window doesn't lock".

       Good call. I'd imagine one would build up quite the appetite robbing someone's house. Better add a monster or redbull next to the milk, or better yet... on the unlocked window sill. Give them that extra boost prior to stealing all your shit.

       in addition to being overworked and underpaid, do you think teachers are keen to pick up grave law enforcement responsibilities as well?

       Not to mention all the supplies, programs and curriculums gutted from public schools to save budget- so now we're going to use tax money to arm and train teachers instead of educating the youth... Sounds like a step in the wrong direction on an already sinking ship.

       They were trying to do this here in Colorado but I don't think it passed. They wanted to arm every teacher. I personally believe this is a great idea.

       So we can’t afford to pay our teachers living wages, we can’t let them actually teach the children of our nation anything worthwhile, we can’t give them enough money to get supplies ( most teachers end up using their own money to buy supplies for their classes), we can’t update the textbooks in most schools, we can’t provide more nutritional lunches, yet it makes sense that somehow we could afford to get guns and expensive safes in every teachers classroom in America give me a fucking break with this bullshit.

       Yea I know, my words will always fall upon deaf ears. The war and fear and death machine will always be fed.  I just get infuriated often with the status of the  country, and then I rant.

       It would be pretty amazing but it would never happen, TPTB make to much money on the violence, and the southerners are to stubborn to stubborn to see that maybe just maybe guns are the problem. I get it I mean I really get it, having a fun to defend yourself but I only really get it because we live in a country where everyone has guns so it’s scary as fuck but if no one had guns to begin with there wouldn’t really be a need for them in the first place.... I have had many encounters with guns being from the great city of Chicago and guns are fucking scary. They need to be way way way better regulated and honestly the automatic ones just need to fucking go. The closest I’ve ever come to a dangerous gun situation was when my ex tried to blow his brains out because I wanted to leave him and I had to deescalate the situation it was terrifying, he was mentally unstable and abusive, he shouldn’t have been able to buy the gun but he walked in the shop and he bought the gun easy as pie. That is a problem and it’s persistent and it won’t stop.
