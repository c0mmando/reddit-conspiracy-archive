        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>To begin, start by regularly and coherently expressing skepticism of Israel or the Trump/Russia conspiracy theory</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x17v0/more_breathless_antitrump_hysteria_at_the_top_of/du4r5e5/">This post of mine today got double dipped!</a></p>

<p>A number of years ago, my vaccine skeptic posts would be the ones that got targeted. Now that all their energy is spent attacking political posts, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x1fli/diseases_with_unknown_etiology_trace_back_to_mass/">my vaccine submissions are consistently hitting the front page</a>. <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has generally been looking much more conspiracyey as of late, and I find it really refreshing.</p>

<p>These political posts of mine are essentially bait for the TMOR crowd...they simply can&#39;t resist as they salivate from across the aisle.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7x17v0/more_breathless_antitrump_hysteria_at_the_top_of/">This thread</a> should serve as an example of what the voting looks like after a brigade. </p>

<p>Brigade you say?</p>

<p>Well, the aforementioned vaccine post has been on the front page of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> for almost 4 hours, and it&#39;s been viewed 127 times.</p>

<p>The TMOR brigaded post, however, was immediately downvoted to 0, yet has <em>over 500</em> views.</p>

<p>For comparison, the post immediately following mine on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> received only <em>24</em> views. That means <em>more than 20 times</em> more people viewed my post than the surrounding posts.</p>

<p>So yes, I&#39;m calling it a brigade because that&#39;s what it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But: when you get brigaded, and a post of yours is chosen and cross-posted to TMOR, do you ever think to yourself that maybe you&#39;re kind of dumb, and these people, vastly more numerous than you and with access to the same information and more besides, are possibly correct? Does that ever cross your mind? Asking honestly here, because, mate, I think you&#39;re pretty dumb, and your history of posting makes me certain that my assessment is absolutely spot-on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey AP, are you actually going to address the content of the post you were mocking in your &quot;bait&quot; thread? You were posting about a r/worldnews thread that was discussing a Russian oligarch&#39;s purchase of a Trump mansion in the middle of the 2008 housing crash for 2.5x the purchase value that Trump paid for in 2004.</p>

<p>I would love for you, a r/conspiracy mod, to actually address the context of the conspiracy that you consider &quot;toothless&quot;. Why do you think the purchase made in the middle of a housing crisis at a time that Trump needed a sudden injection of cash to pay off immediate debts on his Deutsche Bank loans is &quot;toothless&quot;?</p>

<p>I mean, everybody knows that down votes at Reddit are <em>THE</em> optimal way to completely silence dissenting views! As you can plainly see, Axolotl has been rendered entirely unable to talk about the things he wishes to talk about, because TPTB find his posts so profoundly threatening. </p>

<p>Fact is TMoR is small and not ver well known at Reddit whilst r/conspiracy is super-famous and gets mentioned in an eyeroll-y way many times a day on a huge array of subreddits. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hope this doesn&#39;t get me into any trouble because I&#39;m just trying to discuss this and I think it really does need discussing.  I&#39;m not trying to start problems, just explore other perspectives of what&#39;s going on here.</p>

<p>If I look at your posts organically as a non-robot user, your example posts show what I would have upvoted/downvoted.  </p>

<p>For one example, you have a vaccine post that&#39;s fine, upvoted.  I&#39;ll even throw you a bone and bring up one of your posts about how the partisan issues are meant to divide - great, upvote.</p>

<p>Then, you have a mod posted political post that is one of many that seem to be more about discrediting an actual conspiracy, and seems pretty similar to what TMoR is doing to you, but you aimed it at the sub in general.  I would&#39;ve downvoted that.  </p>

<p>And sometimes, when a supposed brigade happens, you react by putting it into contest mode or stickying your post, ignoring reports, etc.  This not only encourages TMoR to do this more because of the attention/reaction, but I&#39;m seriously starting to entertain a conspiracy theory that you&#39;re somehow involved and using this to your advantage.  I doubt you&#39;d go that far, but who is benefiting from the brigading in the end?  It seems like you with all the visibility you get from it.  If not to benefit you, you&#39;re giving visibility to that sub and leading banned users there.  </p>

<p>And now you&#39;re making posts for brigading bait?  To what end?  Obviously the admins aren&#39;t doing anything about it.  So what&#39;s the point besides giving them more of what they want?  Why even post things to get brigaded since it seems like it&#39;s only your political ones now?  </p>

Breaking an arm jerking yourself off about how much smarter you are than everyone else doesn&#39;t really endear you to other.

Yeah, we are. We are down voting you because you make the whole sub look foolish like this.

I have this wacky idea that mods should try to curtail drama and remain as unbiased as possible and almost every time I see a post of yours I roll my eyes, shake my head and think you are a big part of the problem - definitely not the solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your political post was a cack-handed attempt to stir up some subreddit drama while ignoring the meat of the post; a quite-possibly dodgy real estate deal involving someone who would go on to become President and entities who would try and influence him later on in his career. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting topic and one most conspiracy minded folk are keen to deliver into - even if it&#39;s just to see how a possibly-dodgy-but-no-long-relevant real estate deal can be used as a propaganda tool. At the heart of it is something nice and suspicious. </p>

<p>You, however, mostly wanted to ignore the real meat of the topic in favor of trying to - yet again - stir up some more subreddit drama. And here you are again, doing the same thing.  </p>

<p>Even if your posts are being brigaded, that&#39;s not a conspiracy. That&#39;s just people who think if they do it, they&#39;ll get a histrionic reaction out of you. Which, y&#39;know... <em>here we are</em>. </p>
