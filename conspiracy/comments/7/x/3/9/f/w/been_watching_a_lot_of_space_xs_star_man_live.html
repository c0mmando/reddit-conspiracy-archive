       I could go in my backyard and photograph stars with a shutter speed far less than 20 seconds. Probably with my phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       And anyway, fast exposure speed is a plausible explanation for why bright lights wouldn't be visible. What it isn't, is a legitimate explanation for why, starting with Apollo and continuing into every "space mission" to the present, no one has taken a photo to include the star scape.

       Assuming it’s all fake, why do you think they’d be unable to fake a “star scape”? Everything else is apparently faked, including sending actual rockets up into the air (where do those go anyways if not to space), but the one thing they can’t fake is the stars, which are just white dots?

       Back in 1969 they could not fake a star canopy. Not only was it an impossible technical challenge, but amateur astronomers would have been able to, triangulating their location, blow the whistle if it didn't add up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nowadays they could probably use computer graphics to make a decent star scape. Elon Musk even said, "if it were fake we would use better CGI than that." But, they still would run into a lot of difficulty with the "live feed" making sure everything in the sky is where it is supposed to be. But most of all, they have already established with prior faked space missions like Apollo that stars can't be seen in space because of exposure times. So that's their story and they're sticking to it, as they say.

       That video is obviously fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Usually any “proof” video with a catchy soundtrack is fake, but I’m not even going to point that out in this case. This video is obviously fake because you can clearly see it’s fake with your eyes.

       It doesn't matter. The footage is clearly not edited as you can see the flight paths uninterrupted in most of the shots. I also provided photographic images showing the same arc flight patterns.

       Rockets have to fly in an arc to break orbit. Flying straight up would require an insane and uneccasary increase in fuel and power. Go download any kind of simulator, hell go download kerbel, you might learn something.

       I know why they say they do it, however I don't buy that explanation. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line, correct? In any case, video and photographic evidence show the rocket's trajectory and how they do not leave Earth's orbit. I'd believe my eyes before anything NASA says.

       No one said it was the shortest distance though, its the path of least resistance. And the whole "shortest distance is a straight line" gets a bit thrown off when everything involved is in constant, asynchronous motion.

       I asked for the relevance of your question. You stated the footage was fake and I shared other images showing you rockets flying in an arc. If you are not questioning the arc flight paths depicted in the vid I linked, then what were you calling out as fake 2 minutes after I posted a 6 minute vid you obviously didn't watch?

       I already answered your question when I said that I'm not denying that rockets fly in an arc. Here's why, which I posted in another comment, and by the way which you never actually asked me:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       To summarize, it's because it would be harder to fly straight up, and because they actually need to be "parallel" to the ground because they intend to get into orbit around the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video is fake because it claims to prove rockets are a hoax but it doesn't prove shit. It claims to be the truth and it is not, it's fake. It takes advantage of people who don't understand how rockets work in order to trick them into believing something that isn't real because it "looks funny". It's a dishonest and

       Your argument does not prove it's fake. That is real footage genius. You can say the vid is misleading if you want (it isn't) but to say it's fake is disingenious and misleading on your part.

       A statement explaining your position would be ideal. So what we’re doing now, typing text into the comment box, but instead of discussing our discussion we’d be discussing why rockets don’t actually fly into space (or only briefly and then fall back down) and why the earth is flat and there is no horizon.

       Not sure I completely understand what you are asking but my position is this: none of us, outside of the space agencies of the world, have been to outer space to see what our world looks like. NASA, as well as other space agencies, have been repeatedly caught faking things and changing their answers as to what happens in space, therefore everything these space agencies do is suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea if the Earth is flat, but I do believe it is not a sphere. If it was, NASA wouldn't have to doctor up the Blue Marble images with CGI artists. We should be able to get one single photograph of Earth in full color that isn't a composite of multiple shots from different color spectrums with the atmosphere removed. As I have seen countless instances of NASA lies and fakery, everything they stand for and produce is extremely suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, my eyes tell me that the world does not have curvature. I can see that the trajectory of the rockets do not extend beyond Earth's atmosphere. I do not believe we are being told the truth about our world, therefore I will continue to question everything.

       Yes, the curvature is fake as you can clearly see that they used a fisheye lens which massively distorts curvature.
      </p>

       Here is how the Earth looks without fisheye lens.

       These are clearly different altitudes. How do you know it’s a fisheye lens? If it were then wouldn’t the bottom of the video also be distorted? It doesn’t appear to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the curvature is visible in the video you posted, although less apparent. Paste a screenshot into paint and draw a straight line across it.

       You need to research fisheye lenses if you couldn't tell that the vid you linked didn't use one. Not only was the Earth's curvature greatly exaggerated both ways, the string was curving as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a link that explains the difference between fisheye and wide-angle lenses as well as providing plenty of photographic reference so you can see the differences.

       Looks like you’re right, and it used a go pro fisheye lens. I thought it looked a bit exaggerated.

       I’ll post a screenshot of the curvature I’m referring to in the video you linked when I get on the computer later. Or if you’d like, screenshot it and paste it into paint and draw a straight line across the horizon.

       Go Pro's are regularly used for these and NASA vids which is a big part of why it's hard to take them seriously. They could easily film without fisheyes and present a more accurate representation of the Earth and the fact that they don't is very suspicious.

       I don't have access to a computer so I am unable to do so. I watched it again and failed to see curvature so very curious to see where you see it.

       Of course they fly in a fucking arc... the earth is a sphere and they are trying to get into orbit around it. That means they not only have to go
       <em>
        up
       </em>
       , they have to gain enough lateral speed to stay there..
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is these videos prove the complete opposite of what you think. If they flew
       <em>
        straight up
       </em>
       , they would never gain enough lateral speed to not fall straight back down.

       Sure, but you take it that the Earth is a sphere. That is unproven. If you use your eyes and logic, you would realize to get out of Earth's orbit, minus the lies of the sphere, rotation, gravity, etc., the rocket should go straight up, not an arc that falls back down to Earth.

       I just realized you also never answered my first question. Jeeze dude you don't seem to be interested in honest conversation. Why would they be unable to fake a star scape?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, here's why they don't fly straight up:
       <br/>
       <a href="https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/4085/does-the-space-shuttle-fly-straight-up-when-leaving-earth">
        https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/4085/does-the-space-shuttle-fly-straight-up-when-leaving-earth
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll summarize too. Think about it, if the rocket flew straight up then it would be flying directly away from earth, but that isn't the goal. They get into orbit first and then if they are leaving orbit they proceed from there. There are multiple reasons for doing this, which are outlined in the above link.
      </p>
      <p>
       The crazy thing is, you say it's "fake" because the video looks funny. In reality though, you just don't understand why it looks the way it does, the same way you don't understand why the star man footage looks the way it does. Do you see how crazy this is?

       I completely understand why NASA (proven liars) say that the rockets need to fly in an arc to leave Earth's orbit. However, I believe it to be BS as you never actually see any rocket leave Earth's orbit. We do, however, see a beautiful arc of smoke showing that they travel right back down.

       Why would you expect to see a rocket leave earth's orbit though? These rockets are launching into orbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's full footage of a rocket launching into orbit:
       <br/>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The arc you see is because the rocket is turning so that it can actually be into orbit with the earth. If it went straight then it would leave orbit and fly away. This would be inefficient and probably dangerous, and also pointless.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rocket looks like it's traveling "back down" because of the curvature of the earth, ironically.

       The first clip is NASA and I won't trust anything coming from proven liars. The Earth looks like the painted backdrop you'd see in the old sci-fi movies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second clip shows an obvious cgi glitch as the pieces fly off the rocket at about 3:15 seconds in. What is interesting is the fire doesn't line up with either shot throughout much of the vid and the color doesn't match either. Also, the source is ESA and all world space agencies are questionable sources at best. I can't say they lie as much as NASA as I haven't seen enough material but I remain skeptical of any of them as they never call NASA out for obvious fakery.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 3rd vid is a Go-Pro vid with fisheye lens which creates exaggerated curvature.

       The 4th is NASA and again they get discounted as they have been caught lying too many times to keep track.

But you think that in 6 moon missions, and every ensuing space mission undertaken by SpaceX and NASA, no one would think that taking a photo of the stars from space would be a good idea?

       They could at least take
       <em>
        one photo
       </em>
       of stars in any space mission from anywhere in space. Then they could adjust the settings back to continue photographing the space car. But, I guess that's too much to ask with a $52 million budget.

       the earth is not a perfect circle, but the atmosphere is. You cant see the rockey mountain range from this pics in this thread, but you know they are there. the way the asmosphere bends the light around the earth makes it appear to be a perfect cirlce. A physicist would be able to explain it better. Try r/askscience

       "Pear shaped" i.e. not a perfect sphere, but a "oblate spheroid" - so it's larger around "the middle" than from pole to pole due to the spin.

       You can measure their earth pictures precisely. If you have an image 4000 pictures wide, then that's two miles per pixel. Anyone can measure the circle in photoshop. According to them, the earth should measure 6 pixels wider than taller, and flattened poles. But you'll measure a perfect circle, no bulge, no pear shape, in any of their earth "images" (never called photographs for a reason), Apollo 17, etc.. Like NASA says, iearth
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       Photoshopped, because it has to be.

       The glare from the Sun would blind you in an instant out there. It is very very bright. To get the exposure right for the car means cutting out almost all of the light coming into the camera, so the stars just aren't bright enough to even show any more.
