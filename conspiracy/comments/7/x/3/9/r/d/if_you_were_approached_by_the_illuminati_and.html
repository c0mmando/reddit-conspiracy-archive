       Let's say you were contacted and for some reason, someone thought you were the right stuff. A no pressure offer is made. They don't care if you don't join because no one will believe you anyway, but no explanation of what you'd be doing would be given, either.

       It’s more of a possibility then trying as an outsider. Honestly highly doubt anything changes but if done correctly and quietly you may be able to do something, even if it’s minimal

       OP hypothesized that you’d be given no information on what you’d be doing. This is a deal breaker for me. You might end up being the “butt wiper” for some old, bed ridden high roller.

       Even as a spy, I could not do it. In the end, all we have is our name, our word, our honor. It takes a lifetime to cultivate a good name and a moment to shatter it. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. I am a flawed human, just as susceptible to the world's vices. "He that lieth down with dogs shall rise up with fleas." 
In the words of John Proctor: "Because it is my name! Because I cannot have another in my life! How may I live without my name?"

       Your honour to whom?
The easy answer is that I am attempting to honour that highest part of me (or us) because it is the right thing to do. At the end of the day, I ask myself "have I been loving - or at the least - not harmful to any soul with whom I came in contact." Most nights, I can say "yes." On those nights when I cannot say yes, I review that interaction, being mindful as to what triggered me. Hopefully, there's a lesson in there for me to learn. 
The hard answer is that I try do the right thing for mercenary reasons. I've found that, on the whole, if you do good works, good things come back to you. I try to do good things because it makes my life better.
      </p>
      <p>
       How much time do you spend giving to the greater good?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I look deeply within, I do not spend as much time giving to the greater good as I "should". My greatest sins are those of omission, not commission. I was taught at young age, that the things you AREN'T doing can be just as offensive as the negative things you do. Thus, a long history of "shoulding" on myself began. How much "should" I do, while still living a life that is growing me in a healthy way? Do I give away all my possessions? Do I follow "The Year of Living Biblically? Whose rules and standards of the ideal life are ideal for me? Ultimately, I believe those individual answers lie uniquely in our own selves. The trick is to turn up that inner volume, LISTEN, and DO. Not easy. 
I work for mere shelkels (social work) because I feel good about my work day. If I do not pay my own bills, and take care of myself, it is very difficult to be in a place where you can help others in a helpful, useful way. I have turned down jobs that would most likely pay in the six figures by this point because I could not find an honorable purpose in them. Honestly, if I had taken them, I'd have even more useless shit that I don't need - and need to dust.
      </p>
      <p>
       I certainly could volunteer more often, but I've become a bit more disillusioned by the state of the world (not individual people.) I throw myself into my work, giving my energy freely... but my work can be tiring. I binge-watch something useless on the weekend, usually taking very little permanent positivity from it - telling myself that I deserve to decompress and unwind. To a certain extent, this is true, however, the "shoulds" still find their way into my thought patterns. I just pray that my less than desirable traits lessen, and I improve as a person. I have no need to leave behind great monuments (could the builder of the gorgeous Detroit train station imagine it being neglected.) I find my monuments in acts - these are the things that remain and unlike gold, they cannot be stolen away.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's probably a much longer answer than you were looking for, but I got on a roll.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for asking questions that caused me to reflect, and remember things that I "shouldn't" have forgotten. Blessings and all good things...

       if everyone took care of themselves by taking personal responsibility for their actions, getting their own "house" in order, and speaking/acting truthfully, it's already contributing more to the greater good than most people.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's too many people trying to act in the name of greater good, outside of themselves, when they can't even keep their own house in order. This kind of ignorance is actually more of a detriment to society than people believe, with the worst being people that are intentionally causing suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're doing more than great if you're as self reflective as you say you are because you're aiming to be a better self rather than trying to change things outside of your control before you can even take care of yourself. Kudos.

       I took them up on the offer. Turns out they just wanted to fuck me in the ass every night. It's a really crappy job. I don't even know the guys that turn up, they are all old white weirdos. They don't even pay well despite all clearly being billionaires. I had to pay for my own lube yesterday, which they said they would reimburse me for but when I asked for it and the end of my shift they just all laughed :( and now I can't even leave because they'll send videos of me getting butt fucked to everyone I know.. And I'm not gay so that'd be super awkward(it's a job guys, doesn't mean I'm gay OK??!)

       Hell yeah I would, and I won't even pretend like I'd be doing it to expose them. Everyone like being part of a club and the illuminati is the tippy top of the social order. As much as I like to think I'd absorb their plots and expose them like a real deal Qanon, I know there'd be way too much sex, drugs, and manipulation of the masses for me to not lose sight of the goal.

       If my soul is not my ticket in, then yes. If I don't have to join the Epstein book, then yes. As a witness to the evil, I would never turn down the opportunity. But if I was forced to damage the lives of others, I would not join.

       I know just about nothing about it, so I'd probably sign up.  It would lead to some weird weekend of shenanigans like most of my real-life equivalents to such a situation tend to do.  Eventually, some unexpected yet inevitable arrangement would result in things getting halfway back to normal (c'est mon vie), and I would be stuck trying to figure out if I want to list them on my resume and LinkedIn.

       I don't know about the "Illuminati" but a fair number of ambitious business people are certainly invited to join the Freemasons every year and do so because of the contacts and preferential treatment they expect other members of the brotherhood to provide for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also all kinds of University fraternities in addition to Skull and Bones that offer the same kind of networks and preferential treatment throughout their members careers by other well placed members that have come before them.
