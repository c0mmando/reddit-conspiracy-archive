<p>Your honour to whom?</p>

<p>How much of your life, your day-to-day time, do you spend giving to the greater good?</p>

<p>No, working for shekels is not giving to the greater good.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="comment mb-3 ml-2" data-depth="2" data-id="du5iutu">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/MultipleEeyoregasms.html">MultipleEeyoregasms</a> 2018-02-12</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Your honour to whom?
The easy answer is that I am attempting to honour that highest part of me (or us) because it is the right thing to do. At the end of the day, I ask myself &quot;have I been loving - or at the least - not harmful to any soul with whom I came in contact.&quot; Most nights, I can say &quot;yes.&quot; On those nights when I cannot say yes, I review that interaction, being mindful as to what triggered me. Hopefully, there&#39;s a lesson in there for me to learn. 
The hard answer is that I try do the right thing for mercenary reasons. I&#39;ve found that, on the whole, if you do good works, good things come back to you. I try to do good things because it makes my life better.</p>

<p>How much time do you spend giving to the greater good? </p>

<p>If I look deeply within, I do not spend as much time giving to the greater good as I &quot;should&quot;. My greatest sins are those of omission, not commission. I was taught at young age, that the things you AREN&#39;T doing can be just as offensive as the negative things you do. Thus, a long history of &quot;shoulding&quot; on myself began. How much &quot;should&quot; I do, while still living a life that is growing me in a healthy way? Do I give away all my possessions? Do I follow &quot;The Year of Living Biblically? Whose rules and standards of the ideal life are ideal for me? Ultimately, I believe those individual answers lie uniquely in our own selves. The trick is to turn up that inner volume, LISTEN, and DO. Not easy. 
I work for mere shelkels (social work) because I feel good about my work day. If I do not pay my own bills, and take care of myself, it is very difficult to be in a place where you can help others in a helpful, useful way. I have turned down jobs that would most likely pay in the six figures by this point because I could not find an honorable purpose in them. Honestly, if I had taken them, I&#39;d have even more useless shit that I don&#39;t need - and need to dust. </p>

<p>I certainly could volunteer more often, but I&#39;ve become a bit more disillusioned by the state of the world (not individual people.) I throw myself into my work, giving my energy freely... but my work can be tiring. I binge-watch something useless on the weekend, usually taking very little permanent positivity from it - telling myself that I deserve to decompress and unwind. To a certain extent, this is true, however, the &quot;shoulds&quot; still find their way into my thought patterns. I just pray that my less than desirable traits lessen, and I improve as a person. I have no need to leave behind great monuments (could the builder of the gorgeous Detroit train station imagine it being neglected.) I find my monuments in acts - these are the things that remain and unlike gold, they cannot be stolen away.</p>

<p>That&#39;s probably a much longer answer than you were looking for, but I got on a roll. </p>

<p>Thank you for asking questions that caused me to reflect, and remember things that I &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot; have forgotten. Blessings and all good things...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if everyone took care of themselves by taking personal responsibility for their actions, getting their own &quot;house&quot; in order, and speaking/acting truthfully, it&#39;s already contributing more to the greater good than most people.</p>

<p>There&#39;s too many people trying to act in the name of greater good, outside of themselves, when they can&#39;t even keep their own house in order. This kind of ignorance is actually more of a detriment to society than people believe, with the worst being people that are intentionally causing suffering.</p>

<p>You&#39;re doing more than great if you&#39;re as self reflective as you say you are because you&#39;re aiming to be a better self rather than trying to change things outside of your control before you can even take care of yourself. Kudos.</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s just human nature and the way the world works. Nobody gets to be in charge or gain power by giving away more than they get in return.</p>

<p>If someone is offering you a big shiny present, you can bet there&#39;s going to be some strings attached because that&#39;s just the way things work.</p>

<p>no explanation of what you&#39;d be doing would be given, either.</p>

I don&#39;t even know the guys that turn up, they are all old white weirdos. They don&#39;t even pay well despite all clearly being billionaires. I had to pay for my own lube yesterday, which they said they would reimburse me for but when I asked for it and the end of my shift they just all laughed :( and now I can&#39;t even leave because they&#39;ll send videos of me getting butt fucked to everyone I know.. And I&#39;m not gay so that&#39;d be super awkward(it&#39;s a job guys, doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m gay OK??!) </p>
