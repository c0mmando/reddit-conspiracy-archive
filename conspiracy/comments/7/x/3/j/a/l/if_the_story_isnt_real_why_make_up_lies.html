<p>If there is no merit to this theory then why make up lies? Why does Nunes have a fake site? Why all the secrecy in hiding all the info behind &quot;public safety&quot;?</p>

<p>Imagine if Podesta was receiving this type of help from users here during the pizzagate stuff. They would be run out of here for making up lies and trying to get others to not look into this stuff.</p>

<p>Idk it all seems weird to me, we were told people could believe in pizzagate because  it had evidence, suddenly something has evidence and people trying to mislead and it should be ignored?</p>

<p>Odd.</p>

<p>Edit: Will you look at that! The downvotes start trickling in despite no conversation or disputing the facts. And getting strawmaned by users trolling my post history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean to be fair prior to the Male-1=UCE-1 theory was a thing, I had users telling me that Page wore a wire for the FBI and was a Russian Spy that had to snitch to avoid charges. Then the theory comes out and the same types of users switch to he wasn’t working directly with the FBI he wasn’t the guy who planted the binders.</p>

<p>The fake news stuff is out on both sides because either
1) Everyone wants to be the first to break the huge story so they basically risk the backlash from jumping the factual gun so to speak, or
2) Accuracy doesn’t matter, clicks do</p>

<p>People generally seem to have already decided what happened re: Trump Russia. Sites know that people are going to gobble up anything that fits with what they think happened.</p>

<p>More traditionally credible sites that screw up do so cuz of 1 above (they want to be the ones to break the “big one”). Most sketchy sites that push ridiculous stories do so cuz of 2 above (just want that click $$).</p>

<p>“Fake News” is a spectrum. Just my opinion.</p>

<p>You know for a fact that he never worked for the FBI? I know you can&#39;t show proof, because it&#39;s almost impossible to prove a negative in this case, but you&#39;re asserting that he didn&#39;t work for FBI.</p>

I, too, find the claims that he definitely is the person referred to as UCE-1 to be pretty annoying as it&#39;s anything but conclusive, but I don&#39;t think it can be ruled out at this point either.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As most of the theories go, he was either a willing participant (in which case he&#39;ll be compensated in some way), working off another charge as a part of  deal (which would be invalidated if he spoke up), or under a gag order for some other reason. I don&#39;t find any of these theories particularly convincing at this point, but I think they&#39;re within the realm of possibility. </p>
