       And I've seen every type of attack against Tesla and SpaceX. They've had mystery explosions, attack legislation, and bot armies on the constant attack. He's a target.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see some posts here attacking him, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       His next step in making NASA look like fools is when he tries to get healthy people across the Van Allen belts. He'll be forced to either use an advanced composite, or to surround the living quarters with a liquid (such as the liquid CH4 or O3). Both of these options will make it seem silly that you could just send people through with a tiny shell of aluminum.

       I no longer believe in the fabled existence of the "Van Allen radiation belts." They are, in my opinion, a pseudo-explanation for why it's "hard" to go to space. There are simply too many inconsistencies in their description.

       Hard to explain. I would say, now I'm not so sure we can actually go to what we call space.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to use the VA belts as an argument that the moon landings were fake. Of course I still think they are fake. But, there seems to be so much confusion and dissonance about the belts that they seem more like a fictional construct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at this clip from Alan Bean, the supposed 4th man to walk on the moon. Here, he proves the moon landings were fake simply by not knowing that his mission would have traversed the belts. But, the more I watch this and think about it, it makes more sense that the belts are just bullshit and he hasn't yet prepared himself to talk about them from their accompanying script.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, if you ask someone who believes in Apollo they say things like, the missions just went through the belts really fast so there were no health hazards. It just all seems like bullshit, to be honest. Bringing them into a debate about the moon missions only causes more headaches because one side insists that they are deadly and another side insists that it's no big deal if you go through them really fast, or go through at the poles, or whatever. But the fact is, both sides are sort of full of it. They don't know about these belts because no human has ever traveled that high.

       I totally get your skepticism about the belts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I generally believe they exist because it fits my full model of how the solar system works. My views on the subject are far from mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe that the sun is mostly hydrogen. I don't think Jupiter is gas, either. I think that light may lower its wavelength over immense distances, so I don't even believe the universe is expanding.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe that the corona of the sun is undergoing reactions that send positively charged particles our way, and it makes sense to me that they would form a belt around the planet, and as they slow, they would tend to fall into the poles...
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I have no reason to distrust Van Allen himself... I just distrust generally =P

       When a proton hits a metal lattice, it creates high energy ionized particles, x-rays and gamma rays. Useful in moderation, for things like treating cancer. It's kinda bad for electronics and devastating for life.

       You are aware that they knew the risks and that their day job was testing new war planes. Going to space was a safer job path!

       Even with the radiation risk.

       All of this was incredibly unsafe. Yes. I imagine most test pilots would love the chance to walk on the moon, regardless of the difference in safety, better or worse. Walking on the moon would be f***ing awesome.

       It would. But it's not like you can go "ok I am done" and walk back out a door to your livingroom.

       I would have signed up for the moon thing. To me, that's worth the risk. Test pilot for terrestrial stuff... not so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       OMG... to walk on the moon. I'm just giddy thinking about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, back to physics, a field of positively charged nuclei travelling near light speed, hitting the metal shell of the capsule as it was reportedly built, would have exposed the crew to lots of radiation. The best case scenario would be radiation sickness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not believe they missed the belts through a polar exit, because their inclination was quite low. I think they faked it in 69, and maybe went back later, with different technology.

       Nah. They signed up to do it knowing the risks.  Best I have ever found is one astronaut dying of cancer. But they also pick the healthiest strongest people too. Or at least back then.

       Military personel that were testing nukes in Nevada wee exposed to far greater radiation than astronauts. Even killed John Wayne!

       I'm pretty sure most people agree that Armstrong strode across the moon in '69... and I'm not trying to convince anyone. I don't think we could convince each other, here, anyways...
      </p>
      <p>
       But, since I'm in the "Earth is round, most of science is valid, but the... um... moon landing was a hoax" camp, part of the objection is "How'd ya get through the belts"
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they're there. I think it makes perfect sense that they are there, and I think they would eviscerate human tissue. As a policy, we don't send people into the belt. Other than the moon landings, humans have stayed in low earth orbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely they would have sent SOMEONE further out... but they can't, because it's horrible proton death soup out there. Anyways, that's my opinion :p.
      </p>
      <p>
       They may have gone later, but I think they just faked in in 69 to poke the commies in the eye. =P Sputnik and all that. I used to be... a... I guess, "Neo-conservative". Back then, I totally would have faked it to save us from commies, and my dad would have, too. Patriotism... yay.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could pull this off with far fewer insiders than the manhattan project, so... yeah. We controlled all the info going into mission control, and we just faked the feeds for all the people back in Houston.
      </p>
      <p>
       We built miniature scale models of every piece we were going to encounter, and we filmed them for use in the simulations the astronauts used for landing. The only parts they didn't actually simulate as part of the confirmed, above board operations... was the actual walking around and stuff on the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I think they faked it... but since I've only covered about 3% of the "Why", I don't expect you to be convinced.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took me about six years to go from "Moon Hoaxers are idiots" to "Oh, shit... maybe we did fake it." I encourage space enthusiasts to spend that kind of time... but it's not really a hot issue for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Central banking is my hot issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just like it when Musk does things at 50% the price of NASA, and then goes even lower. I LIKE space exploration, and I've always wanted the private sector to kick it up a notch and make the bloated behemoth, NASA look bad. Have a wonderful day :)

       One died from cancer. And it would stand to reasons others battled cancer but they were also the fittest men.

       Many who have this fake space mentality are just unable to grasp how freaking huge it all is.

       There is no math for the alternate view. Our commonly held system has so much scientific work standing behind it that it is ludicrous for a layman to pogh pooh it because they don't understand.
