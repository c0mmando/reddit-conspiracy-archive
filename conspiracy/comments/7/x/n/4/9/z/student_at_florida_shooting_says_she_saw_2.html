        here
       </a>
       says she saw 2 shooters run by (at 4 minutes 30 seconds)? Also she says the school had been doing school shooter drills recently (at 4 minutes 10 seconds), is this common nowadays (nvm, apparently it's common)?
      </p>
      <p>
       edit:
       <a href="https://twitter.com/KHOUSportsMatt/status/963972590258806785?">
        here's
       </a>
       another interview of a student claiming she was with Cruz while another shooter was on the other side of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also check out the
       <em>

       </a>
       that sounds like the shots are coming from 2 different places.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit:  I'm not saying the government sent fbi agents in to shoot all these kids, but maybe they manipulated some already unstable people for their own purposes, or they have an agenda they're trying to push in the media by changing the story.

       This doesn’t strike me as that odd because now AR-15 is essentially “Kleenex”:  a blanket term for any semi-auto, tacticool black, magazine fed rifle.

       More likely that the AR-15 is the most commonly purchased semi-auto rifle in the US so a ton of people have them. You don’t see a lot of crimes committed with Sig-552s or Remington 700s because they’re generally more expensive and more rare.

       That is also true.  But if someone
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       use a Sig, do you think any witnesses would correctly identify it?  Or would they just say it was an AR?  Also meaning that you can pretty easily tell by sound and speed of shots that someone is shooting a semi-auto .223, and again, that would be labeled “AR”.

       All these shootings are fake. People need to realize that the American gov't can and will lie to it's people to push an agenda. They think that the gov't can never do that. I hope people realize that most of these "victims" are the same people from the other school shootings in the past.

       You need to understand that there is no shooter. There is no death certificates from any of these shooting. most of the victims or relatives reappear in other shootings. I think you may be getting is that they might be a false flag. That could be the case but once again most hospitals in the area don't report a surplus of gunshot victims from the same location.

       meh. Not really, it is pretty revealing and hard to miss. Sure, I started to believe this after the FBI declared Sandy Hook was a drill and no deaths occurred. If you research orlando shooting as well as sandy hook. There is a mother of one of the "kids" that got killed and she is in multiple staged events.

       Cool, but in case you glimpse through articles I’ll copy and paste the portion that explicitly addresses your concern:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Although the state’s murder total was 146 that year, only 110 of those deaths were assigned to specific local jurisdictions in the FBI report. The statewide tally of 146 includes the 27 victims of the Sandy Hook massacre.”
      </p>
      <p>
       I can not speak for the remaining 9 statewide murders in 2012, but I’m sure you can find out and enlighten me.

       The idea that someone could co-opt such a horrific event  enacted on children - actual children - for their own personal political ideology is abhorrent to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed that within minutes of the story breaking, people were already declaring it a joke and a hoax. Without a single piece of evidence being revealed, they had already so confidently declared it as an illusion. It was disgusting to see that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate to think you’re someone who would so callously disregard the actual pain and bodily harm these children experienced in order to gloat and karmawhore about some fantastic and baseless conspiracy theory. But I guess you are.

       Not at all. The FBI declared Sandy Hook as a drill and no deaths occurred. I just find it astonishing that people don't see that it is obviously a hoax. You think kids smile and laugh after seeing their peers gunned down? Or police officers laugh after a high school shooting? They had a fire drill and the media capitalizes on this event. I really hope you open your eyes to this.

       ya that's your opinion. No ones saying the government sent fbi agents in to shoot all these kids, but maybe they manipulated some already unstable people for their own purposes. Like how they got the terrorists to fly planes into the world trade center. Who knows, but the news is not reporting the truth, and the government is known to influence the news. Put the pieces together however you see it, but you could be wrong.

       Get lost bruh, you're on a conspiracy subreddit. Everyone has different levels of evidence based reason, and some levels of paranoia. You don't know what this guy knows, and where he learned it from. He could've been at the shooting for all you know. You're ignorant for going a conspiracy subreddit just to be a arragont dunce.

       So thankful someone is gatekeeping who is and isn’t allowed on this sub. And who is and who isn’t allowed to critique or criticize a conspiracy theory. I’d ask you the same question - do you realize where you’re posting? If you want a mindless circle jerk, /politics and /T_D is over there...

       Levels of paranoia? That’s where you’re setting the bar for evidence? Christ.

       lol gatekeeping, I said get lost meaning fuck off with your negativity and doubt. This is a subreddit for truth, not haters. You didn't provide any critique, only insults. Is that how you think a conversation works? You must be a really fun person to hang out with. If you have evidence or an opinion that helps the conversation feel free to post it. If not get lost.

       Heard  a girl being interviewed on the radio saying that she heard shits coming from the 1st and 2nd floor. The interviewer quickly asked if she meant the 1st floor, and when the girl clarified again saying both floors the interviewer interrupted again saying " it must had been chaotic for you" and then moved on to another question

       Sorry but the interview of the girl in this video said nothing about how she saw two shooters and that they practiced mock shooting drills. She heard 5-6 shots and that it was a weird time to do fake FIRE DRILLS, there was no mention of a second shooter in this interview. I’m not sayin that it’s not possible, it very much could be, but this video neither proves nor disproves that fact. So idk where you guys heard about this in the context of this interview.

       These drills have nothing to do with safety imo, much like “TSA screenings” in airports. They are meant to train kids so they learn to fear, to be submissive, and to trust the big daddy government.

       Check out the video of the SWAT team clearing that classroom today if you haven’t seen it. All the kids out their arms up, they were probably taught in the drills, and a pair of small hands were shaking. It just tore me up thinking our little brothers, little sisters, and children experience days like today.

       Which state were you in back in the 90s? I don't remember any drills, or even any talk of school shootings at all in upstate NY back then. Maybe we were just sheltered from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just curious. I'm not doubting that it's normal to have school shooting drills, and I don't think there's a connection to be made between drills and "false flag" incidents like some people try to make.

       We had drills for shooters at my school in PA after Columbine.  Our first drill was a couple month's after Columbine.  Our school's plan was ridiculous too.  We were supposed to evacuate to the baseball field.  The field was completely surrounded by a fence so basically the entire school was herded into a cage.  If there was a shooter and he was a student who also knew that was the schools evacuation procedure all he'd have to do is wait for everyone to get into the baseball field.

       I graduated in 93 (pa), no shooter drills.  However last month a police officer came to my church and spoke to us after the service regarding how to respond to an active shooter.  Pretty simple answer, shoot back (kid you not, he said if your armed shoot, you probably won’t hit but the shooter will become completely distracted).

       Well the training now (we have active shooter training at work once a year) is to Run if you can to get out.. if you can't safely run then hide.. if you have no place to hide then as a last resort grab whatever you can and fight.

       This is my experience:
      </p>
      <p>
       high school in NYC 1993-1997 no drills
      </p>
      <p>
       Boston University 1997-2001 no drills
      </p>
      <p>
       MIT 2002-2004 (I worked there), no drills and no training, which I thought was very strange, since this was well past Columbine and several MIT students would commit suicide every year due to the pressure. My boss mentioned that she thought about what to do if there was a shooter, but there was no plan in place. There was a "hazardous materials" drill one year, which MIT spent a ridiculous amount of money on.
      </p>
      <p>
       University of Chicago 2012-2017 (I worked there), no drills. "Active shooters" are mentioned on the last day of HR new employee training, but there are absolutely no drills. Post VTech shooting, this seems very odd. There are also a number of shootings on and around campus every year (just local crime) and still no drills.

       Interesting. Like I said, there was no talk of school shootings where I went to school in upstate NY (just before the Columbine shooting happened in 1999). I didn't expect there would have been much talk about it anywhere in the US before 1999.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any training you would get now seems to be very basic. I think it's still the "Run, Hide, Fight" strategy like this from DHS:

       I don't find it weird at all. In the confusion of this kind of thing, there will always be people who get confused about what was really happening. Frankly, it would much more weird if literally everyone there agreed on exactly what happened, the number of shooters, etc.

       Honestly, I think the Sandy Hook conspiracy is one of the stupidest ones, so no, it doesn't bother me in the slightest if people think it was a hoax, because I don't think very highly of people who fell for that lie (it happened, the hoax is the lie).
      </p>
      <p>
       I also don't live in the US so your gun laws don't concern me, personally. It would be nice if Americans stopped shooting each other, just on a human level, but I'm certainly not mad because I don't have a dog in this fight.

       I'm not American. America has had guns since its founding, these mass shootings are a relatively recent phenomenon. It's obvious there are other factors involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much like once Americas so called war on terror was declared terrorist events increased. Strange but true. It's more like a war OF terror was declared on the citizens of earth.

       Relatively - being the operative word. And I was meaning in terms of school shootings etc not gang shootings. You can see the from the graphs how it shoots up in the more recent times, I'm not sure how you are disputing what I said or why.

       You said something that I disagree with; it isn't personal, I just don't think you're correct.

      <p>
       In terms of why you don't understand, it's because you're moving the goal posts. You said mass shooting were relatively new, and when I show you some data you say "I was meaning in terms of school shootings etc not gang shootings".

       No goal posts are being moved. Regardless of whether I meant gang shootings or not you can see the graph shooting up to unprecedented levels and I did say relatively all along.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/las-vegas-shooting-university-of-texas-tower">
        "According to one recent history of mass murder in the United States, there had been just 25 mass shootings in the previous 50 years. In the half-century since, there have been more than 150."
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is the guns have always been available and gun laws even more lax in the past, yet the mass shootings are rising in number. Is that not telling, that perhaps guns are not the issue but something else... agendas perhaps, not to mention media influence and mental health. Every criminal seems to become a celebrity of sorts in the media.

       Sounds to me that the shooter is just on the move, maybe moving from classroom to classroom? Or even moving throughout the halls.. 
Never in that video are there any shots being fired out of sync with what single shooter would sound like.

       Why is nobody on here talking about the fact that this Alexa girl said she walked down the hall with Nicolas AFTER they heard shots, then they separated. That means he's not the first shooter. So, wtf?! Thats the biggest thing about this story. Everyone is on this post talking about random nonsense.

      <p>
       Its a way bigger find that this girl is walking down the hall with the suspect and she reported (paraphrasing) "we heard shots and split up". Thats nuts. That freaks me out.

       He could've ran away after shooting the first 16 people and blended in with the part of the school that didn't see him shoot up the other part of the school. Also op there's another video I saw on Twitter if a sophomore boy saying he thought there was two shooters. I'm not sure where though.

       working in a school.  it is very very common nowadays to do both "shelter-in-place" (threat is outside of school) and "lockdown" (threat is inside of school) drills.  Most districts require all schools to do these a couple times a year.

       It was essentially same message, but he made it clear the reason churches aren’t major targets (to date) is because it’s unknown who’s carrying.  He emphasized that point several times.  At fight back point he didn’t mince words, shoot if you’re carrying.

       Get lost bruh, you're on a conspiracy subreddit. Everyone has different levels of evidence based reason, and some levels of paranoia. You don't know what this guy knows, and where he learned it from. He could've been at the shooting for all you know. You're ignorant for going a conspiracy subreddit just to be a arragont dunce.

       No - America is just so fucked right now that schools have to drill kids on what to do when one of them brings a fucking assault rifle in to shoot up the place.

       Well the training now (we have active shooter training at work once a year) is to Run if you can to get out.. if you can't safely run then hide.. if you have no place to hide then as a last resort grab whatever you can and fight.
