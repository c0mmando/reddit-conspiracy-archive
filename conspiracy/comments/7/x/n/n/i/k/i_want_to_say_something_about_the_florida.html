<p>You are talking about people that are looking closely at and archiving the available evidence of a horrifying event- whether it happened or was staged. If you care about truth, you should be grateful that these people are willing to volunteer their efforts to do so. If you think these people are just playing make believe detective, let them have their fantasy the way you do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very well said.  People are spouting out conspiracies because they fit their world view or political views.  And they are doing it with little basis and solely because it benefits them..  They will find any kind of sliver of information (a codeword, a number multiplied, a hidden meaning) no matter how ridiculous as a way to use it to either confirm their worldview or to benefit an agenda they like.</p>

<p>This stuff isn&#39;t supposed to be easy or convenient.  If you are doing this right you should be challenging your worldview often.  It takes a lot of courage to do that.  This isn&#39;t about reinforcing your agenda, it&#39;s about the truth. Only the truth.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely agree with this comment and the preceding comment. Replacing a narrative with another narrative is not challenging it. Questioning a narrative is just that--questioning it. </p>

<p>To immediately discount every single event like this as a false flag strengthens the surface of the events and creates an additional wall between us and the truth that lies beneath.</p>

They put up fake/suspicious interviewees 4 something else HUGE was in the news the same day...  SO with that the dust needs to settle then we can find the truth.

<p>In the case of school shootings, even shootings in general- you only hear about the ones that the media promotes. Therefore when the media stops everything to focus on a situation, it must be orchestrated with a narrative in mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the way the burden of proof works.  The person claiming the false flag conspiracy has to present evidence to neutral observers such as myself in order to be taken seriously.  You can&#39;t prove a negative.  Especially when one of the parties has a preconceived notion and calls any evidence to the contrary fake.  Now is this particular shooting a false flag? I&#39;ve no idea.  I&#39;ve been continuing my life, and haven&#39;t had time to research at all.  I do think that calling something a false flag before there has even been time to collect and review evidence is a little ridiculous </p>

<p>Your&#39;re right, and it goes both ways.  Some will say &quot;don&#39;t investigate xyz event, it&#39;s disrespectful to the families of the dead&quot;</p>

<p>Well, until you investigate, you don&#39;t know if there really are any families of the dead.  And if there are, they deserve to know the true circumstances of what happened.</p>

<p>Not everything is a conspiracy, but there are genuine conspiracies, so we should always look for the full story, and not believe everything we are told.</p>

<p>eg</p>

<p>1964:  The north vietnamese attacked the USS maddox, let&#39;s go to war  (never happened)</p>

<p>1991: Iraqi soldiers are taking babies out of incubators and killing them, we have to invade Iraq to save everybody.  (completely false testimony by someone from the PR firm hired to &#39;sell&#39; the war to the public.</p>
