    <div class="md"><p>That as much as it could have been planned or not; that I subscribe very much to something Terrence McKenna once said in a talk, and that is that the population would much rather have an alien invasion of all things to unite them in a one world government rather than every admit they&#39;re selfish pigs and simultaneously care take each moment to cultivate the future that all our ancestors past and present would have envisioned for their offspring. Along with that he adds that there&#39;s the potential for the human race to ascend into the next dimension, almost a death-realm, or better put a realm of infinite potential where all our past relatives reside. Call this rapture, or the Tibetan Buddhist term of a bardo can be used but he heavily reinforces this with DMT, and as a psychedelic being a boundary breaking tool and the biggest boundary being life and death, caught in this Bs matrix of existence experiencing itself, again the population would much rather usher in a world of absolute domination rather then deny themselves of all their vices than ever aspire to all the saintly humans that have come before us and still live amongst us. </p>

<p>Yes it&#39;s planned in my opinion, but if you would rather a bigger more pure event in life I can only ever say purify your mind within this mentality-materiality complex; see the pure you and kiss the infinite for what else were we born for? Certainly not to be energy/wage slaves to some lower life forms delusional concept of the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Neat and all, but I wish people would stop acting like the plot of “Watchmen” is their own “profound” insight.  Also, psychedelics are neat, but after much exploration with them, they don’t really tell you as much as you think they do.  They are a good way to understand <em>yourself</em> andyou can extrapolate that to understanding others.  I think the greatest thing they teach you is how much <em>the same</em> we are, far more than our narcissistic egos want to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just to clarify that this (my opinion) isn&#39;t something drug induced or even a psychosis-philosophy; but rather something that I&#39;ve worked on over the years doing several Buddhist meditation retreats to ensure a proper foundation of right view. 
My faith is unshakable, and psychedelics can paint a pretty picture for a short time but an individuals level of immersion through their perspective and paradigms of existence is something we live with daily. We&#39;re only as narcissistic as we let ourselves be, I&#39;m a work in progress and I&#39;ll admit my faults (hell I&#39;m writing this while drinking a frozen coke from McDonald&#39;s) but mind you our biggest thing we have is our relationship with life, if we judge and condemn the universe it&#39;s merely a reflection of ourselves, if we have gratitude for everything as it is, seeing it as impersonal, ethereal and temporary, not clinging to it and allowing no tensions or cravings to arise in the body it&#39;s the beginning of a liberation that I choose to dedicate my life too. 
Reality and fantasy are all in our heads, and I only wish happiness to all beings despite my shortcomings in being human and succumbing to habitual tendencies. Our reactions uncontested are the rebirths into this world, and it&#39;s a long process that can be achieved in one week if you have the will power but in the mean time <em>slurps</em>, I&#39;m young and still have some vices to attend to.  </p>

    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Occams-shaving-cream.html">Occams-shaving-cream</a> 2018-02-15</p>
    <div class="md"><p>Awesomely written, I entirely agree!  In fact my statements are intended to agree fully with this exact thought, maybe they just sounded too terse.</p>

<p>I greatly respect Buddhist philosophy on self and thought and knowledge, etc.  One of the most important parts is do attempt to dispense with “self” or “ego” and this is done in the earlier steps (where most people are) but giving up illusions and desires.  And, those which are most persistent, that one isn’t either able or ready to be willing to give up, at least be aware of them and acknowledge them for what they are.  (Like personal bias, this is mostly inescapable but can be noted and understood.)</p>

<p>That is what I am referencing.  When I first ever tripped, I thought I had some link to incredible universal truth!  It isn’t that I didn’t learn from the experiences, there is much about empathy, perspective, joy, sadness, etc. that is valuable to learn.  But as I learned more, I realized that the knowledge is <em>within</em> us, not some external wisdom that we have to tune in to to learn these things.  <em>Everything one learn’s, they already knew.  Most people just don’t know how to listen</em>. That is what I mean, psychedelics just make it easier to “listen” to one’s own knowledge.</p>

<p>There is no external, alien, magical savior.  That is fantasy and it is not productive because it makes people lose a degree of responsibility for themselves and for all life.  The only savior is ourselves, and if we want to be saved, we must realize this.</p>

<p>That isn’t to even say there is no God of any nature, but if there is a God, <em>it is that voice that we don’t normally tune into</em>, the universal experience that leads people to think they tapped into something else.  That is the reason I say here, and to friends interested in psychedelics, it only shows you what is already there.  The reason so many people have such similar experiences isn’t because they reach some astral plane that is accessed by the act, it is because we all have the same brains, the same intrinsic knowledge.  This is no less amazing.</p>

<p>I think that the most accurate theory of all of his is Jung’s ideas about the “collective unconscious”.  I will wager you are aware of it due to your knowledge and interest in this area, but if you are not, I think you would greatly enjoy reading his work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After researching UFOs and &quot;Aliens&quot; for 3+ years now I feel pretty confident in saying that a false flag alien invasion is more likely than not in the works but I must stress that I DONT FUCKING KNOW. That leads to a million other questions though. I don&#39;t know if it will happen in our lifetime but TPTB have been programming us essentially since birth, to speculate about the existence of extraterrestrial life and the possibility of invasion through movies, tv, novels etc. It could go many different ways.. Would it be an attack on a first world country to unite the world through a singular government/organization to fight a common enemy? Or would it be a peaceful landing, forcing the world into a one world government through more diplomatic means. I think the endgame is a more singular worldwide government and ultimate control over the mind, body, and spirit through means of advanced technology, spiritual warfare, and the deception of our perception. </p>

<p>As for aliens themselves, I&#39;m actually less convinced of their existence now than I was when I started going down the rabbit hole years ago because I was absolutely convinced that little green men were flying around in spaceships but now I&#39;m not so sure. Most people believe in &quot;aliens&quot; as they appear in the mainstream but I think it&#39;s way more complicated than that. The hidden hand WANTS you to believe in aliens but I think the truth of the situation could be too much for our sleeping brains to comprehend. </p>
