       Really don't get why people always think these mass shootings are faked so we can get more gun control. America doesn't give a fuck. Someone could murder 500 kids tomorrow morning and we still wouldn't change our gun laws. Nobody is faking this shit. People are crazy and we have more than enough guns in this country for a crazy person to use them like this. Faking it would be co pletley pointless.

       That's not the way it works, buddy. When an extraordinary claim is made (deadliest mass shooting in US history), extraordinary evidence is then required of that party, the one making said claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've already asked for visual proof of shots being fired and
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7jbmcn/complete_this_sentence_or_meet_your_doom_the/">
        no one could even do that
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       If no extraordinary evidence accompanies the extraordinary claims, the rest of us are free to think the claims are bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention, there is certainly evidence that the event was faked. I just have no obligation to present it (even though I already have, in my post history) until there's at least proof that shots were really fired, which there is not.

       That's exactly how it works because you have nothing. You can't provide proof. Just like every other bullshit conspiracy theory you idiots believe, you can't come up with a single piece of solid evidence.

       No, that's not how it works. Someone makes a claim and then they have evidence to back it up. You don't have evidence that a shooting happened so I get to say that you're full of shit.

       The evidence is that it happened. Simple as that. You're full of shit purely based on your inability to provide any shred of evidence that it didn't happen.

       So come on...Where's your mind changing evidence? Oh yeah...you don't have anything. Nothing. This is why you idiots get laughed at. You can't back up your claims.

      <p>
       Answer me this... Has the US government ever lied to the American people about a false flag attack?
      </p>
      <p>
       You and I both know the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second question... if they have... why do you think they would never do it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you aware that the US gov repealed the law preventing them from weaponizing propaganda against its own citizens in 2013?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you aren't aware - now you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they've gone to the trouble of making it legal - why do you think they wouldn't use their new available provisions?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument has as much depth as a car park puddle.

       The official (ever changing narrative) has yet to be proven. There is ZERO hard evidence and ZERO answers to the discrepancies that are so god damned blatant.

       There was one interview where they were talking to a parent and he said "My daughter texted me saying that there was an 'active shooter' at the school"

       For some reason that just sounded very odd to me. Unless there was an announcement over the PA saying exactly that, what 14 year old fearing for their life, hiding in a broom closet, is using the term "Active Shooter".

       Well it’s pretty possible the daughter texted “Mom there’s a kid shooting up the school” and the mom in relaying the story didn’t verbatim quote her daughter and instead used the term “active shooter” on her own.
      </p>
      <p>
       She’s not a court reporter, she’s a mom who just spent an hour of her life thinking there’s a chance her daughter might be murdered. The last thing she’s concerned about is accurately quoting her daughter.

       If you follow the thread I think it comes down to the fact that I haven't set foot in a school in over 20 years and didn't know that they have "Active Shooter" drills.

      <p>
       So "Active Shooter" is exactly what they are told to say.

       No worries, just I kind of attacked a little bit and read too much into the post cuz I’m upset over the shooting. Wanted to be clear I didn’t intend to be adversarial or insult you.

       I watched the news unravel with my girlfriends aunt who has a son in middle school (we’re in Miami so close) and she was shaken up so I’m shaken up.

       I’ve noticed that too. I think it has more to do with the desensitization these mass shootings are causing and I’m sure technology and the overload of immediate information and influence plays a part in their reactions as well.

       I worked with kids in the area some years ago. The neighborhood is upper middle class privileged. The kids were surprisingly sophisticated for their the ages. I don't find the the LGTBQ references far-fetched at all. And I was working there in a traditional religious environment.

       I noticed the topics as well. I have to say, the kids were definitely directed, spoken to, and possibly scripted before going on air. Are we able to say, without reasonable doubt, that this is real/fake? What all should be looked over in order to come to either conclusion? What are some discrepancies that you are noticing?

       Queer has been "taken back" and now means, more or less, "non-standard sexuality and/or gender." It's the sort of no-labels anti-label.

       The evidence is that it happened. Simple as that. You're full of shit purely based on your inability to provide any shred of evidence that it didn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       So come on...Where's your mind changing evidence? Oh yeah...you don't have anything. Nothing. This is why you idiots get laughed at. You can't back up your claims.

       I'll ask you again. Show me solid evidence of your claims. Real proof. Present it to me. Change my mind. Take your time.

       Answer me this... Has the US government ever lied to the American people about a false flag attack?
      </p>
      <p>
       You and I both know the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second question... if they have... why do you think they would never do it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you aware that the US gov repealed the law preventing them from weaponizing propaganda against its own citizens in 2013?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you aren't aware - now you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they've gone to the trouble of making it legal - why do you think they wouldn't use their new available provisions?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument has as much depth as a car park puddle.
