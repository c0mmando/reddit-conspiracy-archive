    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Will we ever know the truth about the Vegas shooting?&quot;</p>

<p>Sorry to say, but no. There is  obviously very sensitive information in the midst of all of this. I could understand if there was info regarding national security.  Like, real national security - ok, keep us safe. I get it. </p>

<p>However, it certainly seems like there is a lot of fuckery going on &amp; that is concerning.  The whole vegas thing was a like a movie. Just everything that had went down. The videos,  the eye witness interviews,  the PRESS CONFERENCES. The FBI dude starring at him. That was weird! </p>

<p>The whole thing is heart breaking &amp; maddening! It seems like big money is using it&#39;s leverage against the government &amp; I do NOT like this. At all. I hope I&#39;m wrong!!!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s doubtful, but maybe something will come out that provides some explanation besides Paddock&#39;s own weird internal narrative.  I was kind of surprised at how long the NY Times story was on the brain autopsy results.   </p>

<p>There was no neurological smoking gun besides evidence of high levels of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpora_amylacea">corpora amylacea</a>, a kind of buildup seen in neurodegenerative diseases and aging brains.  Supposedly Paddock had more of these than is typical or expected, but the phenomenon isn&#39;t well understood and it&#39;s not seen as a direct cause.</p>

<p>They did go on to say that he was suspected of being bipolar and had refused antidepressant medication but had accepted anti-anxiety medication.</p>

<p>While it seems like something isn&#39;t being told to us, I suspect that most of the conspiracy vibe around this isn&#39;t an actual conspiracy related to the shooting, it&#39;s just big money casino interests and local political pressure to protect casino and Vegas images clean.</p>

<p>I kind of suspect that Paddock long-term was a guy who always marched to the beat of his own drum and didn&#39;t want or care for being compliant to ordinary social rules.  The people I&#39;ve known who have bootstrapped their way to financial independence like Paddock tend to be differently motivated than most people.  It&#39;s certainly not impossible that Paddock was always slightly unusual and that both life circumstances and some inevitable neurological/psychological aspect of aging caused him to go off the rails.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like the way the case has been handled or how unsatisfactory it feels, but I suspect Paddock may have just been driven by an inner narrative we won&#39;t understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no conspiracy to cover it up. Americans are short-sighted drama addicts who can&#39;t pay attention to a single issue for more than one newscycle.</p>

<p>A culture that has thrived on reality TV presenting fake drama every week is not likely to ever give a s*** about depth or truth.</p>

<p>On his website he charges $20/month for a subscription which is just videos of a guy in black t shirt and rasta hat spewing nonsense in a nassally monotone and inane blogs that best can be summed up as if he does not understand a concept, therefore it must be fake.</p>

<p>He is not very bright so much is fake to him. As far as I can tell his a mixture of asshole and duuning krugger effect. Its not really worth arguing with him since his not acting in good faith. </p>
