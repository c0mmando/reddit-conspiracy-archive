       It is so much closer and cheaper to put one on the moon. You would get amazing shots of earth without stitching them together. We could zoom in on little comets heading toward earth and hitting the atmosphere. It would be amazing don't you think? We have one on mars! Why not the moon?

      <p>
       For people that are talking about the Himawari-8 that is great and all but again. It tell you there is a rendering process going on. If the Apollo 17 picture of earth was just a simple photo and that was 238,000 miles away then why would there need to be rendering if you are so much closer at 22,000 miles away? My mind is not understanding. Is there a timelapse from Him-8 that shows zero rendering going on? Just a raw time lapse of earth?

       What do you mean “raw”?
      </p>
      <p>
       High end slr cameras shoot in raw format but you can’t look at the images until you convert them. Why? Because the camera captures a huge range of color and tone so that when you go to edit it you have tons of data to work with. But in its “raw” state you can’t view it.

       Its pretty easy. You just put a fold up 4wd thing in the moon to space ship thingy that looks like its made from cellophane, duck tape and cardboard then unpack it.  If the mudflap (/moons and) breaks you can use a map of the moon to fix it.

      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a completely different generational sensibility to think, “Let’s send a camera into space so we can take pictures of ourselves from space!”

       The reason is downvotes is because it dismisses the entirety of modern science, while throwing arrogant insults and not providing any legitimate points.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the experiment is old is meaningless, the Newtonian mechanics used in all modern mechanics and construction came from Newton in the 1600s. Saying it was done without electricity is moronic, there’s no reason why electricity would be required, it’s also ironic because the scientist they are trying to discredit discovered many of the properties of electricity.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s also dishonest, Cavendish’s work is not the lynchpin of modern astrophysics, all the laws and constants in use have been verified independently throughout the centuries and around the world. Cavendish’s work is just impressive because his measurements allow the gravitation constant to be calculated within 1% of its currently accepted value.

       Step2thejep is here posting his own links shilling his paid website.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is here to shill his paid website as he is john le bon who wrote the article below. He has already been banned from the cryptocurrency sites. He was told to stop doing this by the mods. He is not acting in good faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       He claims to be the world's leading skeptic. Most of his claims are rooted in that he does not understand basic scientific concepts and his standard of proof is he has to see something with his own eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       He moves goal posts, attacks people on this sub, all the while never actually elucidating what he believes because that would be giving away for free the genius he offers on his website for $20+ month.
      </p>
      <p>
       He simply is not acting in good faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       He does not believe in atoms, dinosaurs, space, planets, the sun, gravity, a spherical (or almost) earth, missiles, that anyone died on 9/11 etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would think it blow his mind every time GPS works on his phone but that would be expecting too much from him...

       For example for gravity.  You claim gravity is actually just dense objects sinking. But the lighter objects rise and denser objects sink because they are under the force of gravity.

       The gravitational could be relatively accurately measured  with a simple experiment. The gravitational constant was experimentally devised and since more exact measurements have helped confirm and refine the original figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       From there knowing the earth's radius, which people as far as 3000 years ago could approximate using simple trigonometry and the force of gravity at the surface, we can estimate the mass of the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       From there we can estimate the mass of the sun using earth's orbit and G. Once we know the suns approximate mass, we can use G to approximate the mass of Mars based on its orbit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the fact that the experiment was done is a shed such an issue? It was a clever experiment that was a bit crude, and later we refined the experimentally derived number, but from their we can estimate the masses of planetary bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is science. The rules of the universe are derived, and verified and tested and then applied. People for thousands of years realized that our natural environment follows certain rules and science is about empirically and rigorously documenting and applying these rules.

      <p>
       What does a shed have to do with? Can you prove why his experiment was flawed?

       a) I checked the math when I did these calculations in highschool physics. I have not done my own experiment any more than I have checked every scientific discovery ever. But the experiment makes sense even if I have not personally demonstrated the exact value myself. But I trust it works because modern satellites, navigation systems etc all rely on that number and they seem to work... You haven't tested every antibiotic but if you got pneumonia I am sure you take the medications.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for how erasthosenes calculated the earth's radius?
       <a href="http://www.earth.northwestern.edu/public/seth/107/Time/erathos.htm">
        http://www.earth.northwestern.edu/public/seth/107/Time/erathos.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't as me if I personally knew erasthosenes or any other unreasonable request because it does not matter, his calculations have been supported by people repeating his experiment and with space flight being able to actually see the earth and measure it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I know you don't believe earth is round, so take some of your website money that you con people out of, by a ballon and camera, send it up and then recover the camera to see the curvature of the eearth... you can convince yourself, I don't need to prove it to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your approach can only say you do not know anything. A negative conjecture just like a 2 sided statistical test requires proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot say you don't believe Cavendish's experiment therefore our calculations of G are wrong. You can only say you are ignorant and don't understand so you don't know if the estimate of mars' mass is  accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       To say the estimate is wrong you need to show proof that his calculations, approach or implementation and increasingly complex experiments that validated his work to be wrong.

       Why does it matter. His math holds up. He is noted in texts that wer preserved by scholars through different civilizations and we have an idea that Greeks new trigonometry and could make this calculations. If erasthosenes was not the person that first discovered this and just wrote it down or was a compilation of scholars it’s not serribky important. His math holds up, the civilization he was a part of existed because of archeological remains (I have been to Greece) and that knowledge was preserved and confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t see the same massive problem that you see because I accept nothing will be known with certainty but human progress must go on. Not every techcnilgy or scientific principle needs to be rediscovered from the wheel on up.

       Here you go again. So knowing the radius of earth is not dependent on if erastosthenes was the one who discovered it or not. It has been confirmed with repeated measurements snd experiments. Same with G, cavendish discovered its experimentally derived value in a shed. Who cares it’s been checked and confirmed. As for history. We do our best given the remoteness of events and accept some uncertainty. To the best of our knowledge based on multiple sources erasthosenes codified using the sun and trigonometry to estimate the earth’s radius.

       Gravitational attraction has inverse square power, force exerted decays with quadratically with distance. The telescope is far away enough to not exert any appreciable force, thus his use of the telescope. Similarly he is observing the experiment through a telescope precisely to avoid having a gravitational effect on the sensible environment.

       The walls will either have a negligible effect if they are far enough away or if the experiment is close enough to the centre of the room. The planets do not exert force in the plane of movement of the experimental masses and therefore do not affect the outcome.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cavendish's experiment wasn't perfect, but later improved, independent experiments found a consensus value within 1% of what could be calculated from Cavendish's experiment.

       Nope, Newton's formulas show that Cavendish only needs to be 10-15m away from the shed to exert &lt;1% of the force the balls do on each other. He does not specify this in his paper but since later experiments that do properly account for all of this show results almost identical it can be assumed he was at the necessary distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, it's all written in clear English in the papers that you refuse to read properly. You're wilfully ignorant, you refuse to believe the results others produce but you also refuse to reproduce the experiments and produce your own results. Your entirely argument is based on your own faith as you have produced zero evidence for anyone else to scrutinise.

       Good god that website is utter shite. Just because you can't understand something doesn't make it fake. The experiment isn't even explained anywhere in on your page, there's a video that's supposed to explain it but it only talks about why it is sooo impossible to do this without ever saying what the cavendish experiment actually is. Then it goes of on a tangent rant about scientism with some weak memes in the background. Jesus fuck, either you are a braindead bot or this is your site and your shilling. Get a life mate.

       My friend, I spent a few hours back and forth with that dude talking about how his website ridicules something without actually providing any counters, any information of how it’s wrong or any information on what would make it right. It’s just a long rant making fun of something they don’t understand. He, of course, is just trolling and trying to get traffic to his site. Better to ignore him.

       I couldn't have come up with the experiment myself, not smart enough. I am however just smart enough to look at what Cavendish did and trace his steps, and you can too. The method, calculations and setup are all on the wiki. Can YOU point out one flaw in his reasoning or calculus? Or do I need to get a 20$ subscription before you can tell me?

       Yes, I can. That's the beauty of science, you can replicate an experiment. Also. You are cancer, monsieur John Le Bon. I hope no human that loves you ever has to read your idiocy because it would hurt them tremendously to see a person they probably thought of as a good and intelligent person being such a piece of shit shilling ignorance for 20$ a month subscriptions. What would your mother say to see her son abusing the gullible and easily fooled. Get fucked.

       It is used to paint you as lunatics...because if something quacks like a duck. There are dozens of experiments you can do yourself to prove the earth isn't flat, but alas, not a single "flatearther" will do them. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it their ignorance? Are they simply LARPing?
Are they shills? Are they simply unable to understand the science and instead of getting it better explained, give up and go back to YouTube videos as "research"?

       Back on usenet before the www days there was a flat earth society filled with some damn good debaters. I always thought it was just that, a debating club using a clearly false argument to hone their skills. Now I'm thinking the popularisation of the flat earth conspiracy is itself a conspiracy, pushing arguments on the credulous honed in places like that.

       It just got more popular over time, and the quality went down. I also believe that there are plenty of trolls; especially here.

       The person who replied to you, step2thejep is here posting his own links shilling his paid website.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is here to shill his paid website as he is john le bon who wrote the article below. He has already been banned from the cryptocurrency sites. He was told to stop doing this by the mods. He is not acting in good faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       He claims to be the world's leading skeptic. Most of his claims are rooted in that he does not understand basic scientific concepts and his standard of proof is he has to see something with his own eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       He moves goal posts, attacks people on this sub, all the while never actually elucidating what he believes because that would be giving away for free the genius he offers on his website for $20+ month.
      </p>
      <p>
       He simply is not acting in good faith.

       I believe that the general majority of users here recognise that the flat earth conspiracy theory seems to be a bit of a psyop. Both to mock conspiracy theorists by attributing other conspiracies with it ("what, you believe in X? What else do you believe? Flat earth?!"), but also as a distraction from other alternative theories (hollow earth, growing earth, the vast array of Antarctica/polar theories etc). Also there's been the attributing of criticising Nasa and certain information they've put out with flat earth theory and their respective complete denial of everything Nasa puts out.
       <br/>
       It seems like a smart thing to preface legitimate criticisms with space agencies with so that those who don't think before they speak don't immediately attribute your criticisms with you being a flat earther or something like that. Obviously a legitimate critical thinker wouldn't naturally do that, but not everyone does think critically all the time.

       I'm very much generalising, and it is my opinion, yes. But I'm simply offering one particular perspective I see with users here. By no means take what I'm saying as absolute truth. There's plenty of perspectives that I haven't even begin to touch on.

       There is just as much evidence for a flat earth as there is for the moon landing hoax. In fact, the Flat Earth Society is largely responsible for reviving the moon landing conspiracy back in the 80s (since going to the moon immediately debunks FE)

       Because it really isn’t that much cheaper...  the main cost of rovers is launching out of earth orbit... once there, the moon or mars have little difference in cost.

       OK... so we have enough budget to put a few rovers on Mars in different locations... or we can send some or all of them back to the moon where we already had several manned landings...

       For one thing, if you’re considering prospects for future extraterrestrial colonies, Mars is a much more suitable candidate than the moon. Additionally, Mars is much more similar to Earth than the moon, and is able to provide insights to early formation of the Earth. There’s really just so much more to be learned from Mars than from the moon.

       That’s just not true. We have been able to analyze the composition of both the Moon and Mars and the moon is essentially a glorified meteor. It does not have the potential for sustaining life like Mars does and it is objectively of more interest than the Moon.

       That's how photography works. The light from stars if fairly dim so you need a longer exposure time in order for it to be captured. That means you would need to eliminate the brighter light sources (i.e. the Earth) from the frame otherwise it would wash everything out. There are plenty of photos of stars taken from space on the night side of earth, but they look even more fake because the long exposure time causes the atmosphere to glow
      </p>

       There are literally hundreds of space photos showing land mass as well as multiple 24/7 satellite streams. NASA has multiple streams going 24/7 including one from the ISS:
       <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html#public">
        https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html#public
       </a>
       . Even if you distrust NASA, the ISS represents the coordination of 5 separate space agencies. There's also a stream of still images from the geostationary Himawari-8 satellite:
       <a href="http://himawari8.nict.go.jp/">
        http://himawari8.nict.go.jp/
       </a>
       . Are you proposing that these views are being faked in real time 24/7? Do you know exactly what goes into faking HD video?

      <p>
       They have never once said that they faked images. They admitted to using photoshop to highlight certain features that can be difficult to see from space and to stitch together composite images. The Earth is fucking big. An LEO satellite can't possibly get a photo of the entire earth at once.

       GPS is a one way system - basically it is a bunch of atomic clocks and math on the receiving end determining location due to the different arrival times from the various satellites.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system they are talking about is a global ADS-B receiving system using satellites.  I run, and you can too, a ADS-B receiving station on a Raspberry Pi with a Software Defined Radio (SDR)

      </p>
      <p>
       Nearly every plane transmits ADS-B but it has to be received by something.  My receiver routinely detects traffic 200+ miles away.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always try to be nice with such things.  I would rather teach then argue but that sometimes upset people.  I appreciate you having this discussion with me and will respond when I can.  I sometimes don't have much time / forget and for that I apologize in advance.

       But it doesn't have to be satellites. You can do the same trick with local ground station like LORAN, or the new one E-LORAN. Also, wouldn't it be a good feature to have on the plane (even though it's one way) for plane to track itself instead of relying on the tower to feed it that information?  I'm sorry, It doesn't make sense.

       The planes do track themselves and they do broadcast this information via ADS-B right now.  However they are just now getting the space based ADS-B detection systems up and running which is why they can't detect them over the oceans yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please read up on ADS-B and GPS to see how it works - it works nothing like LORAN or E-LORAN.  E-LORAN is only accurate to +/- 8 meters as well.

       So, let me get this straight. You're telling me North korea can put up satellites in space, but in 2018, we still don't have a satellite based ADS-B system so we can keep track of planes over ocean? It seems like that would be the very first thing we should be using satellites for after taking pictures of enemy territory.  We can watch HD video from satellites but they can't send 10 bytes of fucking data win 2018 to planes carrying hundreds of people over the ocean? dude! come ON!

       you linked earlier it says "Though accurate at the time of publication, it is no longer being updated.". So it was true in 2012 and now it's not true anymore. The Deep Space Climate Observatory was lauched in 2015.

       Not fundamentally any more of a composite than any digital photograph. The sensor on a digital camera is made up of sensels, each of which has a different color filter, one for blue, green, and red. The camera then weights each of these intensity values to come up with an RGB value for each pixel in the image.

       We'd have to see if these are publicly available, but the satellite sends back the single channel images as well. These would appear to be black and white, but would actually correspond to a single narrow band of light frequencies.

       No, but it explains why it takes 10 images instead of 1. OP might not like it, but the camera was designed to capture data for scientists to analyze not to meet some arbitrary standard of "raw" in order to prove that NASA isn't a big conspiracy.

       You keep saying “stitching them together” like it’s a bad thing. Have you ever heard of that gigapic website? I’ll look it up for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here is the basic premise and I think you will understand. If you are taking a high res photo of something really big and you want to capture as much detail as possible instead of zooming your lens out and taking one photo, you zoom in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that make sense? Say your camera can capture 10,000 pixels of information across the width of the pic. Now if you zoom out and take one photo of earth you are now left with a photo of an incredibly detailed object but only 10,000 pixels to convey that complexity. Now if you zoom your lens all the way in and take 1000 photos and stitch them together now you have 1000 x 10,000 pixels of information and a much much more detailed image.

       Things like this are the problem for me. There is too much fantasy in space companies to take them seriously all the time. At least show all the raw footage before compiling it together. Things done like this is the reason why people don't believe. They are not transparent when they release any kind of pictures. It is always doctored up and multiple pictures taken with filters. At least be completely transparent about the entire process.

       I think you are being misled by varying definitions of "composite". Previously NASA would photograph portions of the Earth and combine them to form a single image. With DSCOVER, they are photographing the entire Earth through filters of different wavelengths, then "stitching together" the three different color channels of what is essentially one photograph. 
     The reason there is no new image of the Earth like the Apollo 17 photo is because digital imaging is a fundamentally different process from film photography. The DSCOVER satellite can provide much more useful climate information because of its filters than if you were to just point a consumer camera at the Earth, pretty pictures for civilians is more of a byproduct and not the main consideration when designing a multi-million dollar satellite.
       <br/>
       SpaceX can show footage of the Earth with their car (supposedly - ask some people in this sub) in frame because it is a marketing stunt, not a climate research camera built in 2001 with a 2kbps uplink. 
     NASA is fairly forthright about the processing they do in the user's manual for the EPIC (available at the bottom of
       <a href="https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/epic">
        https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/epic
       </a>
       ) and I believe you can download or order raw data from the camera at
       <a href="https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/project/dscovr/dscovr_table">
        https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/project/dscovr/dscovr_table
       </a>
       (writing this on a phone so I can't tell).
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;Dr "unprocessed" is a misnomer when it comes to digital imaging, which is about interpreting and filtering data in a way such that we can make something of it with our eyes.

       You don't have to pay for it, all you need is a free Earthdata login (available through the 2nd link), enough room to store the files (the batch I tried to pull was 4.7TB), and the know-how to visualize the data.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, what you mean by "raw" is ambiguous. With digital cameras, "raw" files are sensor data that has not been processed (i.e. filtered) into an image. If you are looking for a full-color shot of Earth taken with a single exposure, EPIC is literally incapable of that. "All" (exception I know is Foveon X3) digital camera sensors, whether CCD or CMOS, only "see" in black and white. The color capability on consumer cameras is from the Bayer filter placed in front of the sensor. NASA has no use for a Bayer filter in front of their sensor because their filter wheel arrangement enables a much wider range of data related to the satellite's purpose to be gathered. Because the subject distance is so far away relative to its speed and the camera's angle of view, there is no resolvable difference between if NASA were to use a Bayer filter for a single exposure versus their current method of compositing filtered exposures taken seconds apart (except the Bayer image would be lower resolution due to how the filter works).

       Possibly because the satellite wasn't sent up there to take pretty pictures of earth for you, it was sent up there for scientific research purposes. The fact that they can use the many different specialized cameras on board to stitch together a picture of earth is a bonus.

       Okay so the iss is 220miles away from earth and the Himawari 8 is over 22,000 miles away. I can see how it could take a picture of the entire earth. I am watching

        But the story behind the much-admired image that introduced the world to the iPhone—known as the “Blue Marble”— is worth telling in its own right. Simmon, a data-visualizer and designer at NASA’s Earth Observatory, created the image in 2002. He told Quartz it’s not a photograph, but a sophisticated visualization.

       One thing I could think of off the top of my head is that mars has an atmosphere, while the moon pretty much has a negligible atmosphere. I would assume a rover on the moon(vs Mars) would actually have a pretty short lifespan considering the fact that a tiny meteorite would gontheough it like a bb through styrofoam. That’s the only thing I could think of.

       I'm not sure where you're seeing it say that the new blue marble is a composite. The article says that the three pictures from 2002, 2007, and 2012 are composites, which is necessary from an image taken in low Earth orbit. It would be like taking a bunch of pictures of your car from six inches away versus taking one from a hundred feet away with a telephoto lense.

       Yes I understand but there still is not one raw picture that I can find. I only find things like this  - "The image was generated by combining three separate images to create a photographic-quality image. The camera takes a series of 10 images using different narrowband filters -- from ultraviolet to near infrared -- to produce a variety of science products. The red, green and blue channel images are used in these color images."

       They try to pass things like this off has it is real. If Spacex can take a raw video of the earth and it shows you almost exactly what these images show you then why are they taking 10 different pictures through filters and compiling them together?

       The earth is very very large. The things taking pictures of it are very very close. Therefore, due to the size of the earth and the proximity of the camera, they cannot take a picture of the entire earth. It's very similar to how you or I are unable to take a picture of the entire earth. What these satellites are able to do though is take several very detailed pictures of the earth from close up which are then stitched together. This is not fake pictures any more than taking a picture of a road every five feet and then stitching them together wouldn't be a picture of a road. Please just think about this logically.

       They didn't. What you are seeing is a 360 degree horizon line just like all ISS photos. One of the biggest misconceptions of space photography.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google Earth can represent it better than anything. Zoom in and zoom out and notice the entire earth isn't in view at low altitude, but, there's still a 360 degree horizon (curvature) and continents of course appear larger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most "space" (high orbit) photography is not taking a full picture of the earth but a very small cross section. Even if it appears as a sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can be modelled both as a sphere
       <a href="http://www.ringbell.co.uk/info/hdist.htm">
        with horizon lines

       , or as a flat plane with vanishing points. It's fascinating.

       I don't believe the earth is flat but yes I am not sure that we have actually been to space apart from satellites and robots. The problem that I cannot rap my brain around is the simple fact that NASA and other space companies always choose to show us graphic renderings and pretty much pretend that what we are looking at is actual photos. Instead why not simply show us raw footage and leave it at that. There is too much fantasy in the space companies for me to actually take them seriously.

       But like, high school kids float balloons with gopros/raspberry pis into the upper atmosphere on a regular basis and get pictures. Hell you can do it yourself. We have toooooons of amateur photography of the earth showing that it's round. What would stop companies or agencies with billions of dollars from firing a rocket with a payload far enough out to take a picture? Like, is the conspiracy that we don't have the technology? because I think a more logical conspiracy would be that private government contractors have even more advanced technology.

       This has nothing to do with what shape the earth is. Look if spacex can show us a live video that is completely unrendered of the earth with a car next to it then why does the DSCOVR which claims to take pictures of the entire earth without stitching them together say things like this "This color image of Earth was taken by NASA’s Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC), a four megapixel CCD camera and telescope. The image was generated by combining three separate images to create a photographic-quality image. The camera takes a series of 10 images using different narrowband filters -- from ultraviolet to near infrared -- to produce a variety of science products. The red, green and blue channel images are used in these color images"
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do they have to take 10 different images? And even if that is what they do why not show the raw images before any of them are rendered together. At least be more transparent instead of making us live in in this fantasy world where everything that comes out of the Hubble is accepted like that is exactly what is really looks like.

       It's simple really. Nobody wants to spend the money to take a picture of the earth from that distance just to prove that they're not lying for people like yourself who won't believe them anyway. SpaceX basically just pulled off the best marketing in history. Like putting a giant neon coke sign on the moon or something. The whole purpose of their mission was to test a dummy payload and take those pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most missions are designed around more scientifically interesting things. They're not going to increase the payload or risk deploying an instrument early just to do something that has already been done multiple times. On top of that, like I said, there are daily images of the earth from LEO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about this logically for a second. If they had to be stitched together or compiled from multiple instruments, that still means they had to actually be in the position to take the image like DSCOVR was from a distance far enough to compile it. It's either that or you think they straight up faked it and if that's what you believe the only way to convince you would be to shoot you into space in Elon's Tesla.

       Why it would take 10 different images of earth? Plenty of reasons. From the camera being too close to earth (launching things outside of low earth orbit doesn't happen every day), or even just making the pictures look really good by adding more than the human eye can see.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the Hubble... If they showed only things the human eye could see then space would look pretty boring.

       The camera takes 10 different images because they are using the data for other things. It's a scientific instrument that lets them measure how much light and heat the earth is reflecting, cloud movements, seasonal variations of land and water, ozone, volcanic ash, etc. They even have a handy chart on the site showing the primary functions of each wavelength:

       NASA doesn't exactly have a lot of money. I imagine the budget for updating minor (and old) parts of their web presence probably isn't very high on the totem pole.

      <p>
       We could probably shave the military budget (by a lot) and give some more to NASA but I have a hard time seeing this administration or Republicans in general every agreeing to more money for a government agency.

       Because full photos of Earth aren’t beneficial to any study. It’s like taking a photo of an ant farm from 50ft away. Sure, you got the picture, now what?

       a) satellites take much better, more detailed photos, more often

       I'm a flat earther, you are thinking critically about something you are programmed and conditioned to suspend your disbelief about, that's the first step to becoming a flat earther so be careful... It's the same reason there aren't hundreds of pictures and video feeds from the satellites that are purported to be orbiting the earth, and why the classic blue marble image was ribbons stitched together in photoshop. Because space is a hoax. People who pride themselves on being logical and scientifically literate will still buy the story that the US went from being solidly inferior to the Soviets in space technology to nearly flawlessly performing the greatest feat of all time multiple times and then destroying or losing, taping over, etc. all that technology and documentation of it, and not leaving low earth orbit for the next 50 years.

       Just thinking logically... if it isn’t round then wouldn’t there be a massive cliff at some point falling off earth?   It appears all other planets are a sphere from what we see visually. Why would ours be any different?

       The only people who mention an edge are non flat earthers. Why should flat earthers have to explain something they never brought up? You explain it, its your assumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other planets are spheres. Are they? Also what are they? They're all different to earth. When a dog is raised in a house full of cats it will sometimes believe it is a cat. Just because there is a thing in the sky that is round doesn't mean the thing you're standing on is round as well.

       Not sure why that guy is being so hostile. But if you do even 10 minutes of research on why people are starting to question the globe model. You'll realize that the "edge" isn't a cliff that you can fall off of. Honestly you'll be surprised at how logical FE research is.

       Even if you don’t have a cliff... the daylight makes zero sense to me how you could have daylight at different.  I saw the diagram where the sun revolves around the disk shape but in that instance you have 24 hours of daylight in the center (North Pole) but we know that’s only true for half of the year. Then the southern hemisphere has daylight of greater than 12 hours to 24 hours.  In the flat earth theory that’s just not possible because it’s on the outside of the circle.  You are never able to explain the long hours of daylight south of the equator in flat earth

       It would be too awkward.

      <p>
       If there was a rover on the moon, countless people would be asking it to take pictures of the 6 lunar landing sites and remnants.  Of course there would be nothing to see.  Easier not to have one in the first place.

       Honestly it'd be more difficult to fake the moon landing than just to actually do it. The conspiracy would have to involve more than 400,000 people who worked on the Apollo project for nearly ten years, the 12 men who walked on the Moon, the six others who flew with them as Command Module pilots, and another six astronauts who orbited the Moon.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The first successful tests were carried out in 1962 when a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology succeeded in observing laser pulses reflected from the Moon's surface using a laser with a millisecond pulse length.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I guess the big question is how they did the laser reflection tests years prior to leaving the laser arrays that the Apollo missions did.

       Lol it’s not hard. If you look at my top comments I’m basically just telling Trump to “fuck off” over and over again based on different subjects. Plus I work a lot of wired  hours so it means I get to jump into a lot of threads early.

       Since I have worked for the civilian government in the past and currently work for the military I find it laughable when people suggest grand conspiracies that would require thousands of people lying every day. But I still find them interesting to read about, thats where my initial comment was coming from.

       I think a more realistic scenario is one that has at least been threatened: foreign governments flying low lunar satellites to scan for evidence of Apollo.  Rovers on the moon don't make as much sense as extremely low orbit satellites of the moon.  And I believe that has already happened.

       seriously though, there are. all of the theories that we didnt go to the moon are based on the idea that the nasa film was doctored. The reason is was doctored was to hide the bases n shit.

       But the same radar that can track launches would be able to track the nuke making re-entry into the earth’s atmosphere. So that plan might be able to cut some of the warning time down, maybe from 30 min to 5, ok. But wouldn’t we be able to achieve the same effect from a satellite? And wouldn’t that be cheeper/ faster because the missile wouldn’t have to travel all the way from the moon? And we wouldn’t need to launch all the supplies necessary to sustain multiple people in a moon base? Was there any other purposes the moon base might serve?

       Most satellites point in looking at us, not so much the other way around. Some pretty large rocks have zoomed past the planet and were not been seen till they past. That meteor that exploded over russia wasn't spotted at all till it entered the atmosphere. As for supplies, the X-37b that's always coming and going doing "classified mission" along with all supposed government satellites could also be doing the trip. It only took the new horizons probe less than 9 hours from launch to fly by the moon.

       One theory is their are alien bases or even our own secret bases on the dark side of the moon.. or maybe even remnants of an ancient earth civilization.

       I've mentioned before my own research has been halted. If this "quarantine" is ever lifted, one of the things I'd like to look into is the connection between the maze in Kubrick's
       <em>
        The Shining
       </em>
       (1989) and the more recent
       <em>
        The Maze Runner
       </em>
       franchise (2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the interesting lines in
       <em>
        TMR
       </em>
       talks about the maze shifting its configuration every night...which then ties into your comments about Transformers, Dark Side of the Moon, and ancient civilizations/intelligence.
      </p>

       (There's also tons of underground structure symbolism in
       <em>

       We have enough satellites giving us plenty of data of the Earth, why need a rover that far out only to look back at the Earth in lesser detail while having to deal with the light exposure from the moons surface? You must seem to think that comets or asteroids have tracking devices in them for us to see them. The truth is they aren't all that big and are only currently spotted when they are near enough to have enough light reflected to be seen, a lunar rover won't change that. And the moon isn't really all that interesting to planetary science to warrant the high cost of developing and launching these rovers. The last ones were a Russian one, the Apollo rovers and a Chinese rover that had mechanical issues on the first day. India is planning on launching one this year, but don't expect to get your wish about rovers just zipping around on the lunar surface until private entities like SpaceX can considerably reduce launch costs to make it worth it.

       Because the aliens that live on the dark side told us to stay the fuck off of the Moon. That's why we haven't been back and that's why the US president always toes the line as soon as he gets in the office because he is told by the deep state what is really going on.

       Really? 
1. Did you watch the original lunar wave video, that has been reproduced by many others?
2. Did you watch the video you just posted?
3. Have you not noticed, the clip does not really debunk anything it is an amateur photoshop attempt to reproduce visually the effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many have validated the lunar wave posted by crow777 as being not equipment related and not created by a graphic editor.

       If you want bad photoshops my friend I would have to direct you to space-x vids.

       On this subject, anyone know any good theory sites, papers, videos, etc. on NASA conspiracies that have nothing to do with Flat Earth? I feel like two of the conspiracies I was really interested in (NASA and Antarctica) were absolutely buried by all the flat earth crap.

       The solar model is no longer relevant but hasn't been changed, the sun is a magnet not a ball of burning gas. The solar system model is also laughably inconsistent, the planets didn't form from a disc of gas and debris, Venus spins the wrong way for that to have happened. There is no such thing as a normal planet, literally every other planet has anomalies the warrant further study but are ignored. The Van Allen belt suggests man could never reach space without being killed. The moon is hollow according to seismic data collected by the impact resulting from the Saturn V lander, it's also older than the Earth according to some samples brought back. Red shift is not suitable to measure the distance of stars according to the author of the paper that introduced red shift, quasars further cement that notion by being impossible celestial anomalies. Black holes are only a mathematical theory.

       I build things for a living, and have built infrastructure both on land and at sea. Probably not a great analogy, but building things on land is infinitely easier than building things at sea, even if the land you're building on is very remote and far from amenities. Plus I'm just going by history proving how difficult it must be to maintain and update space based infrastructure, which is usually just abandoned and replaced.

       Building something on the moon would require the rocket, additional fuel for a lunar transfer orbit, plus a lander.
      </p>
      <p>
       Using the Delta IV heavy for example, the payload to low Earth orbit is 28,790 kg, while with a lunar transfer orbit, the payload is reduced to 10,000 kg. Then you have to factor in the weight of the lander, reducing your payload even further, while increasing the chance of malfunction.

       I think you're wrong. The tv would be just on that station while people entertained guests. It's a great idea for a mood setter. Mad people would watch it just to look for weird stuff.  If it's a live feed, it prolongs the novelty.

       I see these posts all the time. "why does Nasa lie? Why does SpaceX lie? What's there motive? Where exactly do the lies begin?" And then there is always the "im not a flat earther" to avoid the online backlask. When are you people gonna realize, they LIE because its ALL FAKE. They LIE because the EARTH IS FLAT and space is NON-EXISTENT. Cut the "I'm not a FEr" garbage and you'll find some answer. r/ourflatworld

       The rover on Mars is for taking detailed pictures of Mars. Apparently "close" satellite pictures of the Earth's surface are plenty good enough. The ISS is in higher orbit and is capable of photographing the entire globe, but it doesn't do that too often because there is no demand for it. By that reasoning, pictures taken from the Moon have even less practical value.

       The moon is definitely a huge clue in any sort of potential cover-up, not of the earths shape, but space and our spacefaring capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spend so much money firing rockets into space year round, when countries could invest a fraction of the long term cost to setup a launchpad from the moon requiring TONS less more fuel. It's tidally locked as well. Could this be because any entity, govt or shadow organization who's in a situation they might need a moon launchpad for has other, more efficient means of travel?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have a, at least public face-wise, private company launching something to orbit MARS for basically ever. I guarantee there's more equipment on the tesla car/setup than reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact we went to the moon as essentially space cavemen in 1969 and haven't been able to now, when we are clearly capable, leads me to believe it's got some answers on it

       There are plans to have a station in lunar orbit for this purpose. But you seem to not understand the energy required to get to the Moon with mass amounts of dead weight, in this case fuel to resupply this base. In case you aren't aware, there's no oil on the moon for us to use, we have to bring our own.

       First of all, thanks for the enormous contribution to the conversation. Yes. I am aware it takes tons of fuel to escape the atmosphere in general, including to get to the moon. Go distract from the meaning of others comments now, check mine off the list. Thanks

       You claimed it'll be a fraction of the cost long term to launch from the moon, which with our current technology, is completely wrong. The cost of launch is enormous enough, now you need fuel to land on the moon with fuel not meant to used by the rocket to resupply this station then the fuel on the rocket to get back if it's meant to be reusable in any capacity. Second, the car isn't going to orbit Mars, it's going to Mars orbit, completely different but understandable mistake. They used the fuel to get into space and left it. It's just drifting now, the battery lasted 12 hours and they didn't add any solar panels to replenish it.

       This is a conspiracy forum. If you want me to completely spell it the fuck out for you I'm talking hidden and suppressed technologies. Conventional fuel reliance and subsequent limitations remains at large for a reason. And yeah, go ahead and believe there's no unlisted instruments and no methods to power them on the car setup, lol.

       Their logic: We went to the moon a dozen times 50 years ago, with less technology than your iphone. We saw all there was to see. Literally no reason to go back.

         Theres a  difference between pulling the trigger on a President and Launching massive rockets into outer space. It’s entirely possible that Oswald was acting alone. It is absolutely impossible for even a small group of people to have “faked” the moon landings or to have hidden it for decades.

       They didn't. What you are seeing is a 360 degree horizon line just like all ISS photos. One of the biggest misconceptions of space photography.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google Earth can represent it better than anything. Zoom in and zoom out and notice the entire earth isn't in view at low altitude, but, there's still a 360 degree horizon (curvature) and continents of course appear larger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most "space" (high orbit) photography is not taking a full picture of the earth but a very small cross section. Even if it appears as a sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can be modelled both as a sphere
       <a href="http://www.ringbell.co.uk/info/hdist.htm">
        with horizon lines
       </a>
       , or as a flat plane with vanishing points. It's fascinating.

You're telling me North korea can put up satellites in space, but in 2018, we still don't have a satellite based ADS-B system so we can keep track of planes over ocean? It seems like that would be the very first thing we should be using satellites for after taking pictures of enemy territory.  We can watch HD video from satellites but they can't send 10 bytes of fucking data win 2018 to planes carrying hundreds of people over the ocean? dude! come ON!

       a) I checked the math when I did these calculations in highschool physics. I have not done my own experiment any more than I have checked every scientific discovery ever. But the experiment makes sense even if I have not personally demonstrated the exact value myself. But I trust it works because modern satellites, navigation systems etc all rely on that number and they seem to work... You haven't tested every antibiotic but if you got pneumonia I am sure you take the medications.

       As for how erasthosenes calculated the earth's radius?

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't as me if I personally knew erasthosenes or any other unreasonable request because it does not matter, his calculations have been supported by people repeating his experiment and with space flight being able to actually see the earth and measure it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I know you don't believe earth is round, so take some of your website money that you con people out of, by a ballon and camera, send it up and then recover the camera to see the curvature of the eearth... you can convince yourself, I don't need to prove it to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your approach can only say you do not know anything. A negative conjecture just like a 2 sided statistical test requires proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       You cannot say you don't believe Cavendish's experiment therefore our calculations of G are wrong. You can only say you are ignorant and don't understand so you don't know if the estimate of mars' mass is  accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       To say the estimate is wrong you need to show proof that his calculations, approach or implementation and increasingly complex experiments that validated his work to be wrong.
