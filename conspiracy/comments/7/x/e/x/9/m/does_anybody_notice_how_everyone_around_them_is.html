       I believe that we are indoctrinated into simplifying things and accepting them as fact rather than using critical thinking to form our own opinions and that they may be trying to keep us docile through manipulation. I feel we're conditioned to only believe in what the mind can make itself understand and what it can't understand, it just rejects and by teaching us in schools to follow the rules and take the information that we find at face value, The less intelligent and more reliant you make people the easier it is for them to not question what you say. we're made to search for convenience instead of answers. This makes us easily manipulated. Whether there is a sinister group hiding waiting to do harm to everyone I don't know.

       I also notice more and more people kinda shrug their shoulders when their is injustice or fucked up shit happening or they get mad and forget about it very soon after. Idk if it's fatigue from outrage culture or what

       I wish that were true, but sadly it is not.  My favorite flavor of anything (sno-cones, ice cream, coffee, food, etc.) is giant pussy.  The world would be much more palatable if people had, in fact, become giant pussies.

       I look back on my comment and still laugh.  I appreciate your kind words.  It should probably make me feel better that so few found this funny, because everybody is in butt-hurt mode (euphemistically AKA, "giant pussies").  I just wish there were more people with senses of humor, like us.

       Haha, I didn't know if that was countrywide or just something in my area. I assistant-coached for a couple seasons for a relative's team, and I was surprised how meek players were. No-one standing up for their goalie, afraid to take risks to make the play, not holding the point, etc. In High School, the gloves and helmets very likely won't come off, so it's not like you're going to even get in a real "fight". Wayyyy different from when I played in the mid-2000's even, when headshots and late hits didn't even draw trips to the box.

       The libertarian right has been "pussified" for the most part. There are a few legit principled libertarians like Ron Paul left. Far too many have sold out to worship their neocon and crony capitalst master Trump.

       Just go to the mall for an hour when you have no reason to go there. Just people walking around looking to spend their hard earned money on whatever they find interesting. Shit is a disease.

       I go to the mall quite often to see movies and just peruse if I get there early. It's sad to see. (Though the Apple store gave me a free cable for my Beats after the piece of shit fell apart. This is no hail corporate... Fuck Apple.)

       Too many people seem to currently think that nihilistic, material-reductionist atheism is the absolute truth to reality. They think consciousness arises out of material connections and not the other way around. They think this life is the only one we get and when we die we just stop all existence so it doesn't matter.
       <br/>
       This mindset breeds an apathetic response to evil actions in the world and consequently results in effective permission of evil, as opposed to encouraging conscious action against evil and promoting love and unity. It makes people depressed and lacking of any motivation or incentive to strive to their ultimate potential. If more people came to realise that their thoughts and subsequent actions literally affect and change reality, and that this life isn't the only one we get but that it's just one of infinite, then more people would be taking part in conscious, positive action to bring about positive change in this world.
       <br/>
       The elite minority who hold the most power at the moment don't want the masses to realise this, so they promote nihilistic atheism, and where people do wish to believe in something more than that they co-opt religion in a move to gatekeep truth and redirect focus away from ones own true potential and toward a hierarchical power structure system.

       I'd kindly like to disagree.  I would call myself the above descriptor but I am in no way apathetic to the state of the world.

       THAT SAID, I see why Materialism is less than appealing.  It's scary.  No one wants to figure out they're an automaton.  However, I believe that EXISTENTIALISM is directly a consequence of nihilist materialism.

       I came to a point in my life a few years ago where I believe I had that exact mindset. That yes, we're just carbon and it doesn't mean anything, but that that shouldn't mean we do nothing, rather that we make our own difference and make it positive. Around about this time I also started getting into Buddhism (mainly because I liked the philosophy and I was interested in meditation purely for the medical benefits, as I didn't think it did anything more than that). Then I saw a ufo and it kinda shook my world up. I saw physics in action that scientists say is impossible. Then I started looking into ufos and ufo tech, aliens etc, and I kept arriving at everyone talking about consciousness in relation to it. Then that started my research into consciousness, and thankfully because quantum mechanics was my favourite subject in my last couple years of schooling I already had something to go on. Then I dived deep and did loads more research into physics, universe theories, consciousness theories, religion, ufos - I experienced an astral projection somewhere in the middle of all that - and a few years later I've come to the point in my life where I'm at now with my current mindset and ideas.

       I get it. You went down the rabbit hole and now you're full on holofractal. Doesn't discount hard materialism though. My biggest issue with this mindset is its all a "personal journey." Nothing quantifiable, provable. Its always very general information. No one ever has any details or processes or really any explanation for a non-materialist universe. All they ever do is bark out, "but quantum mechanics!" I find that inevitably most of the people pushing this are "new age" spiritualist that couldn't accept religion but still couldn't handle atheism. Atheism is a scary thing. I get it.

       It depends on the definition of 'materialist' you are looking for.

      <p>
       But if you are really looking for info on how 'but quantum mechanics' could engender a Universe that is learning, growing, and primed to create complex systems of awareness (i.e. consciousness) whilst allowing for what could be considered 'spiritual' or 'paranormal' (even though it's clearly just yet to be understood physics) checkout

       He never uses scientifically reviewed publications.  He doesn't even really assert any claims.  It's not science, it's philosophy.  And some of the stuff in it is cool and interesting, but NONE of it is verifiable.  And that's really the issue.  Thanks for trying, but you have unwittingly proven my point.  Have fun in the rabbit hole, but there's nothing down there.

       The thing is, you are experiencing "feeling the experience" through dulling the analytical mind.  Harness the analytical mind for the same effects. The same cant be said about the class of drugs I mentioned; its not that simple (a suppression of capability) for they

       I think it mostly has to do with our school system. There is an emphasis on respecting authority and we are trained from a young age that respecting authority leads to reward, and the opposite leads to punishment.

       Americans, don't respect authority, the environment, family or other people. Everything is about me, selfish desires. No manners or consideration. Watch how some entitled assholes talks to a police officer or some customer service person. It's all about stuff, the next fix and getting caught up in some image, status BS.

       The problem is there is no culture here, aside from consumer culture. That object or look you have is your only sense of identity. Shallow and vain and an illusion.

       Our culture is manipulated and controlled to push authoritarianism regardless. Public schools indoctrinate children to this mindset, yes, but private schools push authoritarianism too by virtue of being part of the same American culture that we all receive. Not to mention that the wealthy are the ones who benefit most from authoritarianism, or the fact that private schools are elite and only allow wealthy students. That's a form of artificial authority that re-inforces the idea that the wealthy have some kind of authority over others just because they have money.

       The person who replied to you, step2thejep is here posting his own links shilling his paid website.

      <p>
       He is here to shill his paid website as he is john le bon who made the video below. He has already been banned from the cryptocurrency sites. He was told to stop doing this by the mods. He is not acting in good faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       He claims to be the world's leading skeptic. Most of his claims are rooted in that he does not understand basic scientific concepts and his standard of proof is he has to see something with his own eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       He moves goal posts, attacks people on this sub, all the while never actually elucidating what he believes because that would be giving away for free the genius he offers on his website for $20+ month.
      </p>
      <p>
       He simply is not acting in good faith.

       IMO, we need to go back to private schools. If you want to use tax money to pay for schooling, have the government cut a check for what their budget would have been for that student, but they suck at running actual schools and use it to indoctrinate children.

       How far up or down the line, I do not know, but IMHO video games have made our society increasingly less physically active (docile) and less socially adept, which leads to a lot of different problems in trying to relate in the physical world.

       We have studies that confirm the complete opposite of your claims, I can point you towards them via DM if you'd like to research the subject more. In short "Compared to non-gamers, recreational gaming boys were no more likely to use alcohol or drugs, be overweight, or show symptoms of depression than non-gaming boys. They were also less likely to report being a regular smoker" The only real issue with gaming comes with if someone has an addictive personality, which really isn't the fault of the entertainment. Again far-far-far-far down on the list of valid issue of the topic at hand.

       Sure. Devil is in the details and methodology â€” long-term studies, large sample sizes, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iâ€™d like to know how they identify â€˜gamersâ€™ â€” someone who plays every third weekend for a couple of hours, sure; but I woudnâ€™t consider someone who has played a game to necessarily be a â€˜gamer.â€™
      </p>
      <p>
       Iâ€™ve played a few in my time, have a Wii and used to have a PS. Twenty-odd years ago Iâ€™d play some of the sports games for a few hours here and there but compared to some of my friends, no way was I a â€˜gamer.â€™
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take out the people who play for hours on end (the ones you say are â€˜addictedâ€™) you could make the same case for heroin and cocaine â€” people who donâ€™t use it often or in great quantity probably donâ€™t have problems. Itâ€™s only those darned addicts. I know a lot of people are into gaming and thus would tend to embrace anything that says â€˜no harm in this activity.â€™
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be no doubt that our society (in the U.S. at least) is becoming more docile and more obese. Iâ€™m not saying gaming is the only cause, the root cause or even one of the two or three major causes. But what are those major causes in your opinion?

       Thanks for adding so much to the discussion /s 
Use to play them, like anyone in this generation, but now I just play them socially when at a friends or at a party. I do think entertainment of any kind can be abused, and I do think if we don't change things up we are going to as a species entertain into extinction.  But as far as issues concerning this topic at hand, I'd even say it's extremely far down on the list of issues. If you have anything to add to the discussion, I'm all ears.

       I agree with you.  To an extent.  Games like World of Warcraft (and many more) have literally ruined the chance of success of many young individuals in the generations surrounding us.  Just look at it.  The time spent in place of reading a book, figuring out new hobbies...getting sun and exercise.  Its a real shame and we tend to need the males for action against the thugs.

       Can you really determine that as the reason though? Your entire argument clinches on a belief that gaming has less value then apparently learning to play a musical instrument or becoming a world-class swimmer, which isn't necessarily true. In other words, opinion. Now I certainly think reading and creating is super important for personal growth, but at the same time I think there is a real danger in thinking that 'we' have it right and they have it wrong type of mentality.  Who's to say if they weren't gaming, positive activities would fill the void in replacement? It's nice to think that if we removed gaming, we'd suddenly have more fit males who read more often and create a better society, but that really isn't based in reality.

       You're exactly right. I used to have time to be fully informed, and go out and try to "be the change" or whatever. But now, most of my time is spent at work, or commuting, or trying to make ends meet and get my car fixed and a million other things. And, when I do have a rare free moment to do something, I sure don't want to spend it on something difficult like deciphering current events.

       I was just thinking about this earlier today -- people are attributing this to laziness, ignorance, etc., but there's something else less unflattering that's probably a factor for a LOT of people: people's dreams/ambition.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been on medical leave from my PhD program (in earth science), and since going on leave, I've gone down all kinds of rabbit holes researching topics I was always vaguely interested in but didn't have time for. Stuff like geopolitics, the financial system, etc... I think I understand how the world really works
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       better now than I used to, and that's great. But at the same time, it's really taken focus away from my career. I've realized I need to stop obsessively scrutinizing current events so much and start focusing on my own area of research again if I ever want to go back and finish my PhD. Plus, it makes me nervous about being too loud about the more controversial opinions I've developed -- what if that affects my future career prospects? The ambitions I've been following my whole life deflect me away from this stuff. Only when all of that has been put on pause for an extended period of time have I done all this digging and built up all this outrage against the exploitative and deceptive status quo... people never having this sort of opportunity to take a step back probably accounts for a lot of the docility and complicity you note.

       There's nothing I can do as an individual to stop those crimes. I can use my voice to speak against it, but for example, I can't keep the president from killing children with drones. I tried to vote for an anti-war presidential candidate in the 2016 primaries, then again in the general, and I even actively directed everyone I could toward the anti-war candidates I liked. We even ended up with a president who campaigned as if he was anti-intervention, he criticized Bush and Obama's illegal wars, and yet he's still committed the same kinds of crimes against humanity regardless. What more can I do than use my voice to speak out against it where ever possible? What action can I take?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll use my voice where ever I can, because I know that my voice might change the minds of those it reaches. That's a place where I know I can make a difference. But no matter what I do, Trump is president and will be for a few years at least. No matter what I do, he'll use drones to kill innocent civilians. The same was true of Obama when he was president, the same is true of any president in modern history. There is no action I can take which might stop those horrible things from happening. So I use my voice to speak against it, but I might "kinda shrug my shoulders" when there is injustice. What more can I do than constantly use my voice to agree that it's fucked up when "fucked up shit is happening"?

       I think we all just need to be better at practicing collectivism. We need to collectively move toward rejecting the manufactured consent forced on us by the manipulative media. We need a collectivist revolution to overcome these problems, kind of like how they needed a revolution in the 1850s to end the legal system of chattel slavery. No amount of individual speach or individual protests could have put an end to that, but a collectivist movement got a third party president elected, and that independent president led us through the Civil War to make for real progress.

       I understand that it's pretty hard to stop decisions of what presidents do, but that's not what I had in mind while writing that paragraph . I was thinking more of police killings or the new anti boycott Israel law taking effect in a few states. Those kinds of stuff you can protest or go to city councils and participate. Spread your voice and let others aware of what's going on.

       I know it's not easy and it's hard to make a change, that's why most people give up or just don't care. I think the best way to deal with this is to take it step by step. Not everything is going to be solved instantly. Thank god we have the internet and knowledge so we can know about these sorts of things, even though the internet is going to be monitored in a few years..

       Dude I understand exactly where you're coming from and I agree, there really isn't anything we can do. People have been protesting drone strikes and missile launches for years. The government doesn't give a shit and don't listen to the people. I also don't think people are going to participate in a revolution, a lot of people are on "duck you I got mine" mentality. Why would they risk their safety and comfortability for other people besides themselves?

       The longer I go through out life, the more I realize that I can't really do anything to wake anyone up unless they are actually ready to be awake. It was the same for me. I had a friend who dabbled in this kind of thought process, but always looked with the fluoride stare. Now I know that he was right about alot of the things he talked about. But more or less I try to uplift my friends as much as possible and create a sort of family unit for all of us. I believe the fastest and easiest way to make waves is locally. So I'm here if their thought process drifts in that direction, and I'm also there to help when it's just every day friend stuff, not forcing that way of thinking on people who aren't open to it yet.

       It seems to me that we have a psychological need to shield ourselves from certain realities.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you start going outside of that people get very angry because you're challenging the things they feel like they NEED to believe to be happy and feel safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put forth the notion that democracy doesn't really exist in any meaningful way, the authorities that you have to trust to protect and inform you are largely corrupt and ruthless and that the material wealth we enjoy comes at the expense of essentially enslaving the population of other nations and you know what's going to happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're going to get labeled as crazy because that way no one has to take anything you say seriously and can go back to their fantasy life.

       There's a lot of control mechanisms at work trying to keep people docile and controllable.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Fluoride.  Is a Mind Control drug.  It's hard to opt out when they just put it in your water.
       </li>
       <li>
        School System conditioning people to submit to authority and experts
       </li>
       <li>
        ADHD drugs
       </li>
       <li>
        Jobs.  You get further conditioned by having bosses.  Barriers to entry for entrepreneurship are very high.
       </li>
       <li>
        Poor quality food is subsidized.  Chemical fertilizers lead to lack of nutrients in the soil.  Human bodies don't have the proper building blocks to thrive.
       </li>
       <li>
        EMF and mind control waves.  All of the radio frequencies we've chosen for our major power and communication needs resonate and entrain the human body.  There are a lot of patents and stories in the media about our mind control capabilities.
       </li>
       <li>
        Archon implants.  Not going to rule this out as a possibility.
       </li>
       <li>
        Fungus, Yeast, Candida, Parasite infections, bad bacteria.  Your body is an ecosystem.  The critters in you also have consciousness, which affects your consciousness.  Do you crave sugar or do your critters crave sugar?  Look into parasites that control the hosts.
       </li>
       <li>
        Religion.  You're supposed to trust someone else or a book rather than yourself.
       </li>
       <li>
        Science as a Religion.  Most people who don't believe in "religion" seem to have the religion of science, where they don't use the scientific method or anything, but rather just have faith that someone else or a book is correct.  They are not thinking for themselves.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Expertism.  You're constantly told that you need to specialize (like in economics) and that only experts can be trusted.  Be your own lawyer?  You'll get laughed out the courtroom?  Self Doctoring for your family?  That could be negligence, bring in CPS to take your kid.  Doctors that don't agree with government agencies get suicided.  Homeschooling?  You're not a teacher, what about socializing?  You'll screw your kid up.  Don't trust yourself.  Alternative news sources?  You can only trust a guy in a suit that works for a billion dollar company.
       </li>
       <li>
        Passive Media like TV.  TV conditions you to just sit there while the story happens.  At least with video games, you are the person making choices and doing the acting.
       </li>
       <li>
        Debt.  Our debt levels are managed so that we are always under stress to make ends meet.  Who has the time to fix the world, when you are working a full time job just to keep the lights on and to pay your mortgage.  House prices rise to meet the maximum that people can afford to pay monthly.  Our money is debt based.  There is never enough money in circulation to pay off the debt + interest, so as time goes on, our debt load has to go up in order to pay off our old debts.  It's why each generation struggles more with debt.  The debt gets bigger and can't be reduced.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Badly managed workloads.  Most people have BS jobs that aren't worth doing.  We could eliminate a large chunk of our collective workload just by eliminating middle men and work that isn't actually productive.
       </li>
      </ul>

       Only disagree there. That's been one of the long-term hoaxes - telling people you are teaching the actual religion as given, when you're actually slightly (or blatantly) manipulating it to both control those who follow you, and drive others away.

       You can thank trump and his deplorables for it. People have rightfully come to the conclusion that he and his followers are sick in the head and are finally standing up and saying 'no more of this bullshit'.

       Still blaming Trump are we? When Obama raised our war count from 2 to 7? Let's keep waking up, or we will get more trumps or God forbid an Obama who smiles at the people while bombing endless amounts of countries and cracking the skulls of whistleblowers.

       Most people who use reddit are ahead of the bell curve, of those, people who frequent this sub and sites beyond reddit are even further ahead. Your average person requires government, they require a structure that tells them what is what, what would they do without it? Roam around in packs and eat eachother?

       There is surely a theme about normalizing degenarate things in pop culture. Such as the use of foul language and making people too scared of being ridiculed like to defend their own ideas. That's without touching the truly nasty stuffs like people accepting all kinds of violence. I have experimented a lot about this myself and yeah, when I talk about a disturbing thing to a normie in a serious manner, they actually realize how fucked up it was and come to their senses. The constant manipulation of semiotics and the media can make people go truly insane.

       Recently, the only thing that has resonated with anyone in my life (including people who are strictly anti-conspiracy) is the Vegas shooting. I know a woman who, although she loves me like family, thinks I'm a little wackado for my interest in conspiracies. Even she says something's fucky with Vegas and refuses to believe the official narrative. It's the only time I've ever seen her wake up.

       It has a lot to do with culture change. Going from ancient cultures that prized war and battle to "don't go outside there's a coyote" (society of pleasure and security rather than merit) doesn't really surprise me that no one feels motivated to change things. Fighting the system is a full time job and most people aren't going to compromise their 401k's or tenure to go try to change the world. The world is far more complex than it was 500 years ago, so it's daunting for most. It's gonna take a lot more than information to change things.

       Can you really determine that as the reason though? Your entire argument clinches on a belief that gaming has less value then apparently learning to play a musical instrument or becoming a world-class swimmer, which isn't necessarily true. In other words, opinion. Now I certainly think reading and creating is super important for personal growth, but at the same time I think there is a real danger in thinking that 'we' have it right and they have it wrong type of mentality.  Who's to say if they weren't gaming, positive activities would fill the void in replacement? It's nice to think that if we removed gaming, we'd suddenly have more fit males who read more often and create a better society, but that really isn't based in reality.

       I came to a point in my life a few years ago where I believe I had that exact mindset. That yes, we're just carbon and it doesn't mean anything, but that that shouldn't mean we do nothing, rather that we make our own difference and make it positive. Around about this time I also started getting into Buddhism (mainly because I liked the philosophy and I was interested in meditation purely for the medical benefits, as I didn't think it did anything more than that). Then I saw a ufo and it kinda shook my world up. I saw physics in action that scientists say is impossible. Then I started looking into ufos and ufo tech, aliens etc, and I kept arriving at everyone talking about consciousness in relation to it. Then that started my research into consciousness, and thankfully because quantum mechanics was my favourite subject in my last couple years of schooling I already had something to go on. Then I dived deep and did loads more research into physics, universe theories, consciousness theories, religion, ufos - I experienced an astral projection somewhere in the middle of all that - and a few years later I've come to the point in my life where I'm at now with my current mindset and ideas.

       He never uses scientifically reviewed publications.  He doesn't even really assert any claims.  It's not science, it's philosophy.  And some of the stuff in it is cool and interesting, but NONE of it is verifiable.  And that's really the issue.  Thanks for trying, but you have unwittingly proven my point.  Have fun in the rabbit hole, but there's nothing down there.
