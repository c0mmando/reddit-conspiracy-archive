I feel we&#39;re conditioned to only believe in what the mind can make itself understand and what it can&#39;t understand, it just rejects and by teaching us in schools to follow the rules and take the information that we find at face value, The less intelligent and more reliant you make people the easier it is for them to not question what you say. we&#39;re made to search for convenience instead of answers. This makes us easily manipulated. Whether there is a sinister group hiding waiting to do harm to everyone I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>I also notice more and more people kinda shrug their shoulders when their is injustice or fucked up shit happening or they get mad and forget about it very soon after. Idk if it&#39;s fatigue from outrage culture or what </p>

I assistant-coached for a couple seasons for a relative&#39;s team, and I was surprised how meek players were. No-one standing up for their goalie, afraid to take risks to make the play, not holding the point, etc. In High School, the gloves and helmets very likely won&#39;t come off, so it&#39;s not like you&#39;re going to even get in a real &quot;fight&quot;. Wayyyy different from when I played in the mid-2000&#39;s even, when headshots and late hits didn&#39;t even draw trips to the box. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too many people seem to currently think that nihilistic, material-reductionist atheism is the absolute truth to reality. They think consciousness arises out of material connections and not the other way around. They think this life is the only one we get and when we die we just stop all existence so it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
This mindset breeds an apathetic response to evil actions in the world and consequently results in effective permission of evil, as opposed to encouraging conscious action against evil and promoting love and unity. It makes people depressed and lacking of any motivation or incentive to strive to their ultimate potential. If more people came to realise that their thoughts and subsequent actions literally affect and change reality, and that this life isn&#39;t the only one we get but that it&#39;s just one of infinite, then more people would be taking part in conscious, positive action to bring about positive change in this world.<br/>
The elite minority who hold the most power at the moment don&#39;t want the masses to realise this, so they promote nihilistic atheism, and where people do wish to believe in something more than that they co-opt religion in a move to gatekeep truth and redirect focus away from ones own true potential and toward a hierarchical power structure system. </p>

<p>I&#39;d kindly like to disagree.  I would call myself the above descriptor but I am in no way apathetic to the state of the world.  </p>

<p>THAT SAID, I see why Materialism is less than appealing.  It&#39;s scary.  No one wants to figure out they&#39;re an automaton.  However, I believe that EXISTENTIALISM is directly a consequence of nihilist materialism.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I came to a point in my life a few years ago where I believe I had that exact mindset. That yes, we&#39;re just carbon and it doesn&#39;t mean anything, but that that shouldn&#39;t mean we do nothing, rather that we make our own difference and make it positive. Around about this time I also started getting into Buddhism (mainly because I liked the philosophy and I was interested in meditation purely for the medical benefits, as I didn&#39;t think it did anything more than that). Then I saw a ufo and it kinda shook my world up. I saw physics in action that scientists say is impossible. Then I started looking into ufos and ufo tech, aliens etc, and I kept arriving at everyone talking about consciousness in relation to it. Then that started my research into consciousness, and thankfully because quantum mechanics was my favourite subject in my last couple years of schooling I already had something to go on. Then I dived deep and did loads more research into physics, universe theories, consciousness theories, religion, ufos - I experienced an astral projection somewhere in the middle of all that - and a few years later I&#39;ve come to the point in my life where I&#39;m at now with my current mindset and ideas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get it. You went down the rabbit hole and now you&#39;re full on holofractal. Doesn&#39;t discount hard materialism though. My biggest issue with this mindset is its all a &quot;personal journey.&quot; Nothing quantifiable, provable. Its always very general information. No one ever has any details or processes or really any explanation for a non-materialist universe. All they ever do is bark out, &quot;but quantum mechanics!&quot; I find that inevitably most of the people pushing this are &quot;new age&quot; spiritualist that couldn&#39;t accept religion but still couldn&#39;t handle atheism. Atheism is a scary thing. I get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our culture is manipulated and controlled to push authoritarianism regardless. Public schools indoctrinate children to this mindset, yes, but private schools push authoritarianism too by virtue of being part of the same American culture that we all receive. Not to mention that the wealthy are the ones who benefit most from authoritarianism, or the fact that private schools are elite and only allow wealthy students.

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Devil is in the details and methodology — long-term studies, large sample sizes, etc.</p>

<p>I’d like to know how they identify ‘gamers’ — someone who plays every third weekend for a couple of hours, sure; but I woudn’t consider someone who has played a game to necessarily be a ‘gamer.’</p>

<p>I’ve played a few in my time, have a Wii and used to have a PS. Twenty-odd years ago I’d play some of the sports games for a few hours here and there but compared to some of my friends, no way was I a ‘gamer.’</p>

<p>If you take out the people who play for hours on end (the ones you say are ‘addicted’) you could make the same case for heroin and cocaine — people who don’t use it often or in great quantity probably don’t have problems. It’s only those darned addicts. I know a lot of people are into gaming and thus would tend to embrace anything that says ‘no harm in this activity.’</p>

<p>There seems to be no doubt that our society (in the U.S. at least) is becoming more docile and more obese. I’m not saying gaming is the only cause, the root cause or even one of the two or three major causes. But what are those major causes in your opinion?</p>

Games like World of Warcraft (and many more) have literally ruined the chance of success of many young individuals in the generations surrounding us.  Just look at it.  The time spent in place of reading a book, figuring out new hobbies...getting sun and exercise.  Its a real shame and we tend to need the males for action against the thugs.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you really determine that as the reason though? Your entire argument clinches on a belief that gaming has less value then apparently learning to play a musical instrument or becoming a world-class swimmer, which isn&#39;t necessarily true. In other words, opinion. Now I certainly think reading and creating is super important for personal growth, but at the same time I think there is a real danger in thinking that &#39;we&#39; have it right and they have it wrong type of mentality.  Who&#39;s to say if they weren&#39;t gaming, positive activities would fill the void in replacement? It&#39;s nice to think that if we removed gaming, we&#39;d suddenly have more fit males who read more often and create a better society, but that really isn&#39;t based in reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just thinking about this earlier today -- people are attributing this to laziness, ignorance, etc., but there&#39;s something else less unflattering that&#39;s probably a factor for a LOT of people: people&#39;s dreams/ambition.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been on medical leave from my PhD program (in earth science), and since going on leave, I&#39;ve gone down all kinds of rabbit holes researching topics I was always vaguely interested in but didn&#39;t have time for. Stuff like geopolitics, the financial system, etc... I think I understand how the world really works <em>much</em> better now than I used to, and that&#39;s great. But at the same time, it&#39;s really taken focus away from my career. I&#39;ve realized I need to stop obsessively scrutinizing current events so much and start focusing on my own area of research again if I ever want to go back and finish my PhD. Plus, it makes me nervous about being too loud about the more controversial opinions I&#39;ve developed -- what if that affects my future career prospects? The ambitions I&#39;ve been following my whole life deflect me away from this stuff. Only when all of that has been put on pause for an extended period of time have I done all this digging and built up all this outrage against the exploitative and deceptive status quo... people never having this sort of opportunity to take a step back probably accounts for a lot of the docility and complicity you note.</p>

<p>I also notice more and more people kinda shrug their shoulders when their is injustice or fucked up shit happening or they get mad and forget about it very soon after. Idk if it&#39;s fatigue from outrage culture or what</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s nothing I can do as an individual to stop those crimes. I can use my voice to speak against it, but for example, I can&#39;t keep the president from killing children with drones. I tried to vote for an anti-war presidential candidate in the 2016 primaries, then again in the general, and I even actively directed everyone I could toward the anti-war candidates I liked. We even ended up with a president who campaigned as if he was anti-intervention, he criticized Bush and Obama&#39;s illegal wars, and yet he&#39;s still committed the same kinds of crimes against humanity regardless. What more can I do than use my voice to speak out against it where ever possible? What action can I take? </p>

<p>I&#39;ll use my voice where ever I can, because I know that my voice might change the minds of those it reaches. That&#39;s a place where I know I can make a difference. But no matter what I do, Trump is president and will be for a few years at least. No matter what I do, he&#39;ll use drones to kill innocent civilians. The same was true of Obama when he was president, the same is true of any president in modern history. There is no action I can take which might stop those horrible things from happening. So I use my voice to speak against it, but I might &quot;kinda shrug my shoulders&quot; when there is injustice. What more can I do than constantly use my voice to agree that it&#39;s fucked up when &quot;fucked up shit is happening&quot;? </p>

<p>I think we all just need to be better at practicing collectivism. We need to collectively move toward rejecting the manufactured consent forced on us by the manipulative media. We need a collectivist revolution to overcome these problems, kind of like how they needed a revolution in the 1850s to end the legal system of chattel slavery. No amount of individual speach or individual protests could have put an end to that, but a collectivist movement got a third party president elected, and that independent president led us through the Civil War to make for real progress. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that it&#39;s pretty hard to stop decisions of what presidents do, but that&#39;s not what I had in mind while writing that paragraph . I was thinking more of police killings or the new anti boycott Israel law taking effect in a few states. Those kinds of stuff you can protest or go to city councils and participate. Spread your voice and let others aware of what&#39;s going on. </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s not easy and it&#39;s hard to make a change, that&#39;s why most people give up or just don&#39;t care. I think the best way to deal with this is to take it step by step.

<p>Dude I understand exactly where you&#39;re coming from and I agree, there really isn&#39;t anything we can do. People have been protesting drone strikes and missile launches for years. The government doesn&#39;t give a shit and don&#39;t listen to the people. I also don&#39;t think people are going to participate in a revolution, a lot of people are on &quot;duck you I got mine&quot; mentality. Why would they risk their safety and comfortability for other people besides themselves?</p>

<li> Poor quality food is subsidized.  Chemical fertilizers lead to lack of nutrients in the soil.  Human bodies don&#39;t have the proper building blocks to thrive.</li>
<li> EMF and mind control waves.  All of the radio frequencies we&#39;ve chosen for our major power and communication needs resonate and entrain the human body.  There are a lot of patents and stories in the media about our mind control capabilities.</li>
<li> Archon implants.  Not going to rule this out as a possibility.</li>
<li> Fungus, Yeast, Candida, Parasite infections, bad bacteria.  Your body is an ecosystem.  The critters in you also have consciousness, which affects your consciousness.  Do you crave sugar or do your critters crave sugar?  Look into parasites that control the hosts.</li>
<li> Religion.  You&#39;re supposed to trust someone else or a book rather than yourself.</li>
<li> Science as a Religion.  Most people who don&#39;t believe in &quot;religion&quot; seem to have the religion of science, where they don&#39;t use the scientific method or anything, but rather just have faith that someone else or a book is correct.  They are not thinking for themselves.<br/></li>
<li> Expertism.  You&#39;re constantly told that you need to specialize (like in economics) and that only experts can be trusted.  Be your own lawyer?  You&#39;ll get laughed out the courtroom?  Self Doctoring for your family?  That could be negligence, bring in CPS to take your kid.  Doctors that don&#39;t agree with government agencies get suicided.  Homeschooling?  You&#39;re not a teacher, what about socializing?  You&#39;ll screw your kid up.  Don&#39;t trust yourself.  Alternative news sources?  You can only trust a guy in a suit that works for a billion dollar company.</li>
<li> Passive Media like TV.  TV conditions you to just sit there while the story happens.  At least with video games, you are the person making choices and doing the acting.</li>
<li> Debt.  Our debt levels are managed so that we are always under stress to make ends meet.  Who has the time to fix the world, when you are working a full time job just to keep the lights on and to pay your mortgage.  House prices rise to meet the maximum that people can afford to pay monthly.  Our money is debt based.  There is never enough money in circulation to pay off the debt + interest, so as time goes on, our debt load has to go up in order to pay off our old debts.  It&#39;s why each generation struggles more with debt.  The debt gets bigger and can&#39;t be reduced.<br/></li>
<li> Badly managed workloads.  Most people have BS jobs that aren&#39;t worth doing.  We could eliminate a large chunk of our collective workload just by eliminating middle men and work that isn&#39;t actually productive.</li>
</ul>

<p>Only disagree there. That&#39;s been one of the long-term hoaxes - telling people you are teaching the actual religion as given, when you&#39;re actually slightly (or blatantly) manipulating it to both control those who follow you, and drive others away. </p>

Such as the use of foul language and making people too scared of being ridiculed like to defend their own ideas. That&#39;s without touching the truly nasty stuffs like people accepting all kinds of violence. I have experimented a lot about this myself and yeah, when I talk about a disturbing thing to a normie in a serious manner, they actually realize how fucked up it was and come to their senses. The constant manipulation of semiotics and the media can make people go truly insane.</p>

Going from ancient cultures that prized war and battle to &quot;don&#39;t go outside there&#39;s a coyote&quot; (society of pleasure and security rather than merit) doesn&#39;t really surprise me that no one feels motivated to change things. Fighting the system is a full time job and most people aren&#39;t going to compromise their 401k&#39;s or tenure to go try to change the world. The world is far more complex than it was 500 years ago, so it&#39;s daunting for most. It&#39;s gonna take a lot more than information to change things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you really determine that as the reason though? Your entire argument clinches on a belief that gaming has less value then apparently learning to play a musical instrument or becoming a world-class swimmer, which isn&#39;t necessarily true. In other words, opinion. Now I certainly think reading and creating is super important for personal growth, but at the same time I think there is a real danger in thinking that &#39;we&#39; have it right and they have it wrong type of mentality.  Who&#39;s to say if they weren&#39;t gaming, positive activities would fill the void in replacement? It&#39;s nice to think that if we removed gaming, we&#39;d suddenly have more fit males who read more often and create a better society, but that really isn&#39;t based in reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I came to a point in my life a few years ago where I believe I had that exact mindset. That yes, we&#39;re just carbon and it doesn&#39;t mean anything, but that that shouldn&#39;t mean we do nothing, rather that we make our own difference and make it positive. Around about this time I also started getting into Buddhism (mainly because I liked the philosophy and I was interested in meditation purely for the medical benefits, as I didn&#39;t think it did anything more than that). Then I saw a ufo and it kinda shook my world up. I saw physics in action that scientists say is impossible. Then I started looking into ufos and ufo tech, aliens etc, and I kept arriving at everyone talking about consciousness in relation to it. Then that started my research into consciousness, and thankfully because quantum mechanics was my favourite subject in my last couple years of schooling I already had something to go on. Then I dived deep and did loads more research into physics, universe theories, consciousness theories, religion, ufos - I experienced an astral projection somewhere in the middle of all that - and a few years later I&#39;ve come to the point in my life where I&#39;m at now with my current mindset and ideas. </p>
