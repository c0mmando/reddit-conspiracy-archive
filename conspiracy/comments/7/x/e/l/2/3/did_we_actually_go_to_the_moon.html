    <div class="md"><p>The idea that a major enemy, which is what Soviet Union was considered to be, had a serious technological superiority as was revealed with the launching of Sputnik, especially when it came to having far bigger missiles capable of lifting much bigger payloads and carrying them over far greater distances had to be countered in some way. </p>

<p>After all the US had been positioning itself as being ready to fully engage in all out nuclear war with the Soviets as if it could be handily won when that advanced capability on their part came to light. How the Soviets had managed what the US couldn&#39;t and still can&#39;t in many instances is still something of a mystery even today. </p>

<p>The only exception to that seemed to be the Saturn rocket that presumably took the US to the Moon, but was it really as powerful as they claimed it was and did it really do that?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Specifically I&#39;m thinking of a scene where one of the astronauts says something about getting a drink of cold water for a second and he gets a water bottle, then the camera goes off of him, and when it comes back he throws the bottle literally into the air. Littering on the moon. And it makes you wonder how he drank it through his space suit. For some reason I can&#39;t find the specific clip. But when I locate the time stamp from the Apollo 17 mission I&#39;ll probably make it a post. It&#39;s that goofy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually interviewed a guy that worked for Northrop Grumman on the Gemini and Apollo program. He had way more to say about the Gemini days when it came to details. His work with the Apollo program was all from the control room, with no hands on work with the rockets, capsules, anything. He told me that it was pretty compartmentalized, you worked with your team and that was it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s really interesting to me. </p>

<p>The most common rationale I hear about debunking the moon landing is that so many people would have to be in on it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true. </p>

<p>If what mr Chaffee said about fitting in being the most important aspect was true, and the man you spoke to was correct in saying it was all about teamwork, I doubt you&#39;d have much questioning of the narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, we did. It&#39;s entirely plausible that we told some lies early on, but we definitely went there. People get hung up on the idea that we lost the technology. It&#39;s really not that simple. The biggest thing we are missing today is the heavy launch power of the Saturn V. This is mostly a political issue since NASA gets their mandate and funding at the whims of Congress. Their budget goes almost entirely to climate science and LEO activities. The planetary science  and exploration budgets are so small. Robotic missions are so much cheaper and easier, by several orders of magnitude.  </p>

<p>The moon missions could be rebuilt, but the manufacturing world has changed so much that it would be prohibitively expensive to recreate everything the way it was, and stupid to do because we could do so much better with a fresh design using modern electronics and precision engineering that wasn&#39;t conceivable in the 1960s. All it would take is the political will to make it happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wish I could give this more upvotes, I lose it inside when I see people going off about &quot;how did we lose the technology&quot;...we didn&#39;t lose it, you ignoramus, the personnel who ran the programs and built the equipment are probably long dead, the design itself is more than 60 years outdated and behind 40+ years on manufacturing standards, it&#39;s not that we CAN&#39;T make it again we would just have to completely rebuilt the old assembly materials to do it. Honestly it&#39;s easier to just design a new updated one, and soon it&#39;ll just be easiest to pay for a spot on a SpaceX BFR</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Afaik ESA does, NASA does too and of Course Space X.</p>

<p>We have PROTON for Russia, Fslcon Heavy for SpaceX, Arriane 6 for ESA, and one for NASA which I can&#39;t remember right now. All Heavy Lift Rockets used to bring satellites into Geostationary Orbits. And with some adjustment probably also capable of bringing people to the moon.</p>

<p>Currently astronauts really only need to feach the ISS. And for that you can use weaker rockets since it&#39;s on a LEO.</p>

<p>Musk is developing reusable rockets, or rocket boosters and stages. Quite a big step in making space travel more affordable.</p>

<p>Also, the Tesla launch wasn&#39;t a waste of money. It was for one a test to see if the Falcon Heavy was capable of lifting a payload, normally concrete weights are used as a dummy payload when testing new rockets. On the other hand it was also a publicity stunt. I mean, what gets more attention than saying &quot;Hey, we&#39;re gonna launch a car towards Mars, stuffed full with little jokes and a mannequin wearing a fancy spacesuit.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, we did.  </p>

<p>We left a mirror at the lunar landing site that we bounce a laser off of daily to measure the speed at which the moon is moving away from us.  You can see the flag and the base of the landing module with a strong enough telescope, and the technology to fake the shadows didn&#39;t exist in the 60&#39;s so we&#39;d either have to actually go to the moon, or put a very powerful light source miles away from the set for the shadows to appear parallel.</p>

<p>There is so much supporting documentation for what we did in the form of maintenance requirement cards or computer code that it would have been easier to actually go to the moon than fake it.</p>
