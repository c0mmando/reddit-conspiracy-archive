        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s pretty amazing how this timeline is filling itself in as each day unfolds. I think we can all agree by now with most of the upper echelons of the DOJ and FBI gutted and the Senate Intel committees in the House and Senate now focusing on the State Department and the Executive Branch that RussiaGate is a farce.</p>

<p>Now it seems Grassley and Graham have questions for Susan Rice about an unusual e-mail she sent to herself on inauguration day. She just wanted to remind herself that in a meeting on January 5th, Obama told Comey, Biden, and Yates, that he wanted everything done &quot;by the books&quot; in the Trump Russia Investigation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sens-grassley-graham-have-questions-for-susan-rice-on-email-sent-on-inauguration-day/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sens-grassley-graham-have-questions-for-susan-rice-on-email-sent-on-inauguration-day/</a></p>

<p>What else happened around January 5th?</p>

<p>Obama passed EO 12333</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/01/13/obama-opens-nsas-vast-trove-of-warrantless-data-to-entire-intelligence-community-just-in-time-for-trump/">https://theintercept.com/2017/01/13/obama-opens-nsas-vast-trove-of-warrantless-data-to-entire-intelligence-community-just-in-time-for-trump/</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s kind of an unusual move for a sitting duck President who is on his way out of office in just a few weeks and it certainly helps the FBI get their hands on all of the unmasked wiretaps that the NSA and any other agency has.</p>

<p>Does that sound &quot;by the book&quot; to you?</p>

<p>edit: As a few wiseasses have pointed out, Obama made changes to an existing EO so now they think they &quot;Got me!!!&quot; They know god damn well what I&#39;m referring to and here is yet another article confirming Obama&#39;s actions. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/obama-expanding-nsa-powers/513041/">https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/01/obama-expanding-nsa-powers/513041/</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree this is possible. I did another post theorizing the email was because Rice unmasked Flynn in his Kislyak call the week before and the Jan 5 meeting was discussing what action to take since Comey and Yates were both involved with the Flynn interview issue/fallout.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that it&#39;s something people do. However you can&#39;t deny it looks highly suspect that she decided to memorialize something that took place 15 days prior, on the day Trump was sworn in. Add that to Rice&#39;s history of bullshitting the public and people are left with questions. Can&#39;t blame them.</p>
