       The news is pretty misleading on this.  It has nothing to do with mental illness. It’s about people on social security that are mentally incompetent to run their household finances.  Grandpa a little too scatterbrained to pay his bills kinda thing.

       It has everything to do with mental illness. Restricting mentally ill people who collect SSI benefits due to mental illness disability from buying guns. That's the entire point of the original bill.

       That’s not accurate. The executive order restored due process which was removed with the Omaha EO.  Either the 2nd amendment is a right or it’s not. Either we have a right to due process or we don’t. Read the original EO and the Trump EO to get a true understanding. Don’t rely on me or anyone else to be your source of news when you can read the docs yourself.

       This.  People are so quick to say "mentally ill" and "no flight list" people shouldnt have access to guns.  But what you're really saying is people shouldn't have a right to due process and that we should allow government officials to determine arbitrarily who belongs on the "mental concern" or "no fly" lists, sometimes without your knowledge.

       Exactly. Anyone saying the government is actively trying to ban gun ownership isnt paying attention. It all starts with marginalized citizens and the margins of marginalization get wider and wider until it is nearly impossible to legally own a gun.

       Alcohol use is fine, a prescription for opiods is fine, MAOI inhibitors are fine,

       That is absolutely insane. People who regularly consume alcohol (which actually causes unpredictable behavior) still have unrestricted access to weapons, but cannabis users can’t? Ridiculous.

       When you realize that guns are not the problem, I think you might change this sentiment.  Define crazy. Legally crazy. If crazy people use cars to mow down people on a sidewalk, do we attack cars?  If they use fertilizer to blow up federal buildings, do attack Scott’s Turfbuilder?  Guns are not the problem. Crazy people are the problem. Whether they kill with guns, cars, or fertilizer doesn’t change the fact that they are crazy and will use whatever method they deem most useful to accomplish their task. Hard to solve this problem of the focus is the weapon of choice rather than the motive or the actor.

       Or here's a thought.  Perhaps as a society we stop encouraging "crazy"?
90 % of school shootings involved a shooter with a history of phsych med use.  Instead of tossing pills down kids throats for not "conforming" to a ridiculous adult standard of behavior every time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe we stop telling kids that its NORMAL to be confused about what gender they are because they caught Johnny playing with dolls one day.  So to be the "progressive parent" they rush them into hormone therapy.

       Guns and the 2nd amendment have existed for years.  When I was in high school it was not uncommon for several trucks to have guns in the back window.  Kids fought with their fists and never thought once about grabbing their rifle.

       It wasn't stated as a blanket order. It applied only to a class of individuals who were defined in the EO as having been deemed incompetent in other proceedings.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the same, I agree that it was a poorly-thought-out EO that had due process issues inherent. I wish that the Trump administration would have recrafted it instead of eliminating it altogether.

       Correct. The prohibition against gun sales to certain SSA disability recipients was limited to those who had not only been determined mentally disabled, but also were determined unable to handle their benefits in what is usually a separate process. These people had their rights adjudicated and they were given appeals rights.

       That flies in the face of the point of the bill of rights. They are absolutes, they are the most basic and important of our country. It's easy to say free speech isn't absolute, but that is a completely different thing than gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       People censure others speech. But the government is not allowed to. People are not allowed to reduce your right to bare arms. And the government was never supposed to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You say it's about nuance. But the nuance behind gun rights was exactly the situation we are in now where the common people stand no chance if they have to rise up and overthrow their government. This was the entire point of the right to bare arms.
      </p>
      <p>
       By limiting that in any way you violate the purpose of the law. This isn't like letting people create a digital safe space. It is about ensuring that the people have the ability to overthrow an oppressive government. Which can't be done when they drop bombs from drones but won't let you have a fully auto AR.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bill of rights was not meant to be nuanced it was meant, like our constitution, to be a plane direct statement of law. We have made it nuanced because neither is very well written for the modern age.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your right to bare arms is never supposed to be touched and all changes to that are unconstitutional. There is nothing in our constitution that removes those rights from felons, or mentally unhealthy people. That is all bull shit added later. It was meant to be an absolute. Because otherwise when we got where we are now we have no chance of restoring our freedom.

       In the last 18 years 126 people in the UK have died in terror attacks. 1438 have been killed with a gun in America since the beginning of 2018. I’m not saying there isn’t a terrorist problem in Europe but those figures put things in to perspective.

       The right to your property (Your body included)

       It's as Whoareyou559 said, what you're saying is ultimately erroneous as it won't do anything but hurt law abiding citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Criminals don't obey the law and will find ways to attain weapons regardless.
Anything can be used to kill a person. Are you going to ban everything and live in a bubble? Perhaps you should learn self-defense instead of hurting other peoples chances are self-preservation.

       "Cool, don't live in America. Because what we see as Rights, are the foundation of this nation." was the comment i originally replied to. This discussion veered off some since then. My point is that the right of unrestricted access to firearms has a cost, and that cost is mass shootings and a higher gun violence rate. My point is also that while people fake being shocked, they are well aware of this trade off, and think it's a good deal. Im not advocating gun control. Spin this question however you want, there is a real cost to this right. You want to push some kind of moses tablet version of the second amendment, im fine with that. But im not fine with everybody acting shocked and surprised when this happens over and over again. Its dishonest.

       Law of freedom:
Freedom and morality are directly proportional.
As morality increases, Freedom increases. As morality declines, freedom declines.
True freedom CAN NEVER exist in a society that embraces moral relativism (the idea that there is no inherent and objective difference between right and wrong, so humanity may arbitrarily 'create' or 'decide' right and wrong for themselves).
Morality:
It's not right versus left. It's right versus wrong
A deep understanding of morality, principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong behavior, lies at the very heart of natural law.
RIGHT VS WRONG:
Correct Based on Truth
Moral Based in Natural Law
Actions based in it do not result in harm to sovereign beings.
VS
Incorrect Not based in Truth
Immoral Not based in Natural Law
Actions based in it result in harm to other Sovereign beings.

       You are taking the concept of Natural Law too far. The concept of natural rights is simply a recognition of free will. You have a natural right to try to do anything at all, including harming or enslaving other people. Of course, other people carry that same natural right against you. Everyone also has the natural right to try to stop others from harming or enslaving them. But nobody has the natural right to succeed at any of these activities. Your natural rights end when somebody else successfully takes them from you. The social structures of government may either protect these natural rights or destroy them through physical force.

       Not really though.  It is a made up social construct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Monkeys do not have a concept of natural rights, it is based on might makes right.  If Natural rights are not man made, then why do other animals not apply them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong... I agree with the concept of Natural Rights, it is just that it is not some universal binding thing.  It is, and always will be might makes right.  If you have the power to enforce what you perceive to be your rights, then you have them, if you do not then you will just get thrown in prison or killed.  That is how it always has been, and that is how it is today.

       And that is why were stuck where we are today.
Try to attack a monkey or take away it's young. You will be attacked and it is justified in doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
       So then you don't believe you are born free? Or have a right to owning yourself? You don't believe killing another without it being justified is a wrong action that results in harm to another?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's universally understood by most of the world already that it's a wrong action. We'll never be free or grow as a collective when we view the world through the lens of "Survival of the fittest"
      </p>
      <p>
       People only have the power to throw you in a cage or kill others because people ultimately allow it to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if everyone said that it was wrong to send armed thugs (the police) to kick down your door and shoot your dogs for smoking a plant peacefully in your home. If everyone understood right vs wrong instead of right vs left, we'd be closer to world peace than the 'dog eats dog' world we live in today.

       To me it sounds like a slippery-slope. I believe in people being innocent until they commit a wrong action. Everyone having the same rights; this includes having a right to stockpile weapons for self-defense. I can see how it would worry you, but ultimately disabled people should have the same rights as everyone else.

       There is no reason for you to lobby against schizophrenic firearm ownership without the educational pedigree for such endeavors, but here you are, and here we all are.  I am disinclined to believe that everyone with schizophrenia is a homicidal maniac waiting for their chance to grab a firearm and create the next mass shooting, but if you have subsequent studies and evidence of such an occurrence, hit us with that juicy knowledge post, bro;-).

       Again you demonstrate a complete lack of knowledge of why you have your rights. Go watch a documentary about the revolution and come back. Your right to bare arms has little to nothing to do with personal protection.

       And we know through basic economics that regulation hurts the free-market. Prices for goods increase and quality goes down. 
Also your regulations wont stop the black-market. You can't stop the sales of chemicals, animals, fuel ect; so why hurt everyone else that wants to buy them without the use of a black-market?

       No, I'm saying if people wanted to; there would be a means to. If enough people wanted to stockpile chemicals and fuel; the demand for said materials would arise.

       Why have laws? Good question. If people just understood morality and right vs wrong action; we wouldn't need laws.

       Than you don't belong in this discussion. If you as rent even aware of why you have the right to bare arms you have no right to argue either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The right to bare arms did not have a damn thing to do with protecting yourself from your neighbor. It is about protecting your freedom from your government.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire point of the right to bare arms is so we can overthrow an oppressive government. It has nothing to do with you feeling unsafe because some redneck has a stock pile of arms.  That feeling is not relevant. His right to those guns is.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't fight off a government using drone warfare with semi auto pistols or rifles. With half the mag capacity, no body armor, no grenades. No anti air weaponry.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of that is supposed to be limited because of why we have the right to bare arms. Which is to fight back against an oppressive government.
      </p>
      <p>
       It frankly does not matter if you don't think a person needs them for self defense. If that makes you uncomfortable so be it. That isn't relavent either.

       It feels like you're making a straw-man argument. You're being unreasonable. Why would anyone recommend a blind person should drive a car? Perhaps there isn't a worry since there will be fully-automated vehicles in the future.

       Because youre making the argument that there are rights like owning a gun that apply universally, absolutely, to everyone when clearly that also is unreasonable. Dude if you have manic depression I hope someone stops you from buying a gun.

       It's not unreasonable. It's quite simple. If no harm was done, then there is no victim. Everyone is entitled to the same human rights. What victim did the manic depression with a gun produce? None, until he shoots someone. What you are saying is that we should stop people before a crime happens. Sounds like pre-crime and treating people like criminals before they commit a wrong action. 
In the real world I would like to assume that the manic depression guy has friends and family that recommend he gets help before purchasing a weapon.

       No youre just being willfully ignorant. Of course her life is affecting her children's. Or at least it's reasonable to assume. And to respond to your other comment of course it's a preventative measure. After someone is shot it's too late. The same people who make these argment I often here talk about restricting immigration from dangerous countries. But if they didnt commit a crime why should their chances of getting a visa be any less than some else? Should we treat someone in the middle of ISIS occupied Syria the same as Norway. No bc we have common sense. Why can we never do the same with gun control. Just fucking common sense.

       I think you can make an individualized case, that a particular person who suffers from schizophrenia and has shown a willingness to resort to violence should have that right restricted.

       Youre literally talking out of your ass. Due process has nothing to do with this. That's after youve already been charged with a crime. This is like saying you cant operate heavy machinery while on certain medication or people with certain visual impairments cant drive or sex offenders living next to schools. No right is absolutely universal. All freedoms pose risk or infringe on others even in very minute ways and therefor open to being regulated.

       What if I want to protect myself with a tactical nuclear weapon I built in my backyard?  Obviously I'm being absurd but my point is that there are always going to be certain restrictions on which means we can use to protect ourselves.

       Who is a threat for you to get a nuclear weapon? I highly doubt you even know how to construct one, nor have the funds and means to acquire the materials. 
I also doubt you took into consideration the amount of collateral damage you'd do which wouldn't justify in using it.

      <p>
       Guns can cause considerable collateral damage, especially when proper safety measures aren't taken.  For example I leave a loaded gun beside my bed in case of a home intruder.  One day when I'm not home somebody breaks in and steals my gun.  They use that gun to murder somebody else and boom that's collateral damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how much collateral damage is enough to warrant banning a particular form of self-defense/self-preservation?

       So you're going to nuke the invading army? Or the invading army's country? I assume you took into account the crazy amount of innocent people that would die and the amount of damage you'd do to the Earth?

       I never said the person who had their gun stolen was guilty of murder (we can both agree they were probably guilty of negligence though).

      <p>
       Your argument was that I can't have a nuke because of collateral damage.  My point was that letting guns be so easily accessible causes collateral damage as well?  At what point does the benefit of having a gun for "self defence" outweigh the collateral damage of people being murdered by legally and illegally obtained guns?

       Guns are easily obtained where I live.  And (surprise) we have very little gun violence.  In fact nobody I know owns a gun, I've never talked to someone who said they owned a gun, I've probably never even seen a gun (I know cops have them but still never seen one).

       I have two dogs so and live beside a police station so not too worried about my house being invaded.  Also home invasions with guns are way less common here than in the US.  I've never actually heard of one happening, I'm sure it does, but it's not very common.

       Nope, if somebody really wants a gun then let them have it.  But they should have a required safety course, minimum waiting period, background check and an in person interview.  Where I live these are all requirements to get a gun.  This is a fair balance between the people who want guns and the people who don't want guns flooding the streets like in the US.

       Do I think they should have the right to? Yes. For simply having a nuke doesn't mean you killed or hurt anyone.
Do I think they should have one? No. I think it's an excessive means of force and I think most communities or maybe even most of the world would outlaw them/ have rules against them.

       I believe there is a fundamental difference between states and individuals yes. I don't think the purpose of nuclear warhead is ever to harm an individual, so an individual does not need similar firepower for their own protection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say we followed your policy of letting all citizens have nuclear warheads, how long do you think it would be before the first nuclear terrorist attack?

       I didn't say I'd want all citizens to have nuclear warheads. I said I respect peoples right to do anything, as long as no one was harmed. This includes having a nuke but not using it. 
My policy would be to live in a place where nukes are not allowed through rules put in place by communities. After all you choose to live their and live by their rules voluntarily. I don't have a problem with that.

       According to you, wouldn't that be a human rights violation? If not, why can't the American community decide that it wants to limit the ownership of certain other classes of weapons?

       Because simply owning other classes of weapons doesn't mean it's an immoral action and you've hurt no one in doing so.
The American community can't decide limiting others because to enforce your limiting of peaceful people; you'll have to send men with guns to make sure they comply. You are wishing violence on innocent people.

       I am not against rules, I'm against immoral laws or people making up rights with power they didn't have to begin. Like forcefully taking my money through taxation to fund things like wars or taking peoples weapons away. I have no real way to resist that without having violence on me or leaving my home. A community you can choose based on your views. I'm sure in a government/stateless world; communities would have a variety of rules and people that fit within those rules would gravity voluntarily to those communities.

       I believe people consenting to rules in a community voluntarily to be okay.
I disagree with rules/law from a government that I didn't consent to. Show me this mystical social contract that I signed that says I'm okay with giving my money away to fund programs that I didn't agree with or wars?

       Yes, I can be viewed as an anarchist. If you go by it's proper definition.
Anarchy from the Greek Prefix:
An- : Without; the absence of
&amp; the Greek noun:
Archon: Master;ruler
      </p>
      <p>
       Anarchy does not mean "without rules" it literally means "without rulers"

      <p>
       No rulers and no masters. I like to call myself a 'voluntarist' since anarchy nowadays has been conditioned to people to mean destruction or chaos.

       They can leave and join another. I'm sure there would be a demand for a community that shares your particular beliefs. The problem currently is that if people wanted to have a community with their own rules; government would eventually crack down on them and ultimately use violence.

       I see where you're coming from. It's a good argument. Though it's still the difference between the whole country and small communities that are in close proximity or at least reasonably close. You could still visit your family and friends. Though I see where you're coming from. I'll definitely think about that more.

       Basic human rights are not determined by natural law. They are based on a collective view of the rights of the individual - a product of social and moral norms.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it would make sense, that if you are more likely to cause harm to that collective, that some rights have certain limitations for the individual.

       I respectfully disagree. The truth is not subjective. Actions that result in physical harm to others is wrong. Period. There is no alternate way to view it. Taking someones life or stealing are acting that harm others. It's not really opinion, but truth. Claiming that taking an innocent life can be anything but wrong; is immoral and incorrect. Immoral actions will result in less freedoms for everyone.

       Here's a classic philosophical question:
      </p>
      <p>
       You're standing on a bridge with a very fat man.  Below the bridge a car wreck has trapped two families on the train tracks, in the path of an oncoming train.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming this guy is really fat (ya, it's only hypothetical) and we're 100% sure that we could push him into the path of the train, slowing it down enough to save the two families, is it wrong to push him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people might say we are obligated to push him in order to save the lives of the two innocent families below.  The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people say the fat man has an unalienable right to not be pushed off the bridge.  It would be wrong to push him off even if it would save the lives of the families below.
      </p>

       Yes, it's wrong to push him; even if it would save lives. Even if one person's life could save thousands; it's still morally wrong to take an innocent persons life.

       If I was the fat man I certainly wouldn’t want to get pushed off the bridge.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if it was me and my family in the car I would desperately hope the person pushed the fat guy off.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if instead of a fat guy it’s an old man?  He’s 100 years old, he can’t have more than a few years left.  Wouldn’t you want to him to get pushed off the bridge if it was you and your family in the car?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody has the right to form their own opinions on questions like this.  There are many valid answers and we can’t say which one is absolutely correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       It depends on our definition of what is “morally wrong” or “morally right”.

       No I wouldn't kill anyone even if they were on their death-bed. If someone had to die to save those people; I would choose myself instead. Taking an innocent life has no justification. That is murder; and murder is murder regardless of good intentions.

       Ok how about this situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're standing at a junction for some train tracks.  Beside you is a lever, if you pull the lever the train goes left.  If you don't touch the lever the train goes right.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the right said of the tracks a villain has tied up an entire family and left them in the path of the train.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the left side of the tracks the villain has tied up an old man and left him in the path of the train.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't touch the lever the family dies.  If you pull the lever the old man dies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have the right to pull the lever?
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember what you said earlier:
      </p>

       Damned if you and damned if you don't touch the lever. It's a tragedy regardless of what you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Morally speaking, not touching the lever is the moral option. You don't stain your hands in blood by not getting involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can understand why this would be viewed negatively considering one side is guaranteed to die. But saving one side you kill another. Maybe some would choose an immoral action to save more lives. Very interesting to think about.

       Truth isn't subjective - determining what truth is, is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believing to know what the truth is, is a dangerous assumption because it removes you from considering the validity of the so-called truth.

       Rights, morals and norms are the product of a social and cultural context. What you consider to be basic human rights, might not be the same as my view - or the view of the society I live in (not american), or someone living in china - etc.

       Yes - that's what I said.
But you can never be certain of what's true, it's your perception of said truth. So to claim that you know what truth is, is to attempt to exempt yourself from the subjective lens that it is being human.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everyone claimed the earth was flat, it would not be (what we perceive to be) true - but it would appear as truth to them. Just as saying that the cited basic human rights are truth.

       Natural law is basically the same as the law of cause and effect (Effect invariably follows cause.) "For every action, there exists an equal and opposing reaction.
Karma or moral law (You reap what you sow)
Golden rule (Do unto others as you would have done to yourself)
      </p>
      <p>
       Doing an immoral action or an action that causes harm to another will almost always result in a negative outcome for you. Once we understand that wronging other people has negative outcomes, then it's easy to understand that doing positive or good things to people results in good reactions/outcomes. Hense doing good will result in more freedom and less pain/death/suffering.

       Again - moral is still subjective - a convergence of collective norms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cultures all across the planet have sacrificed families for what they believed to be true, for a greater good - and they didn't deem it immoral because they were doing it for whatever deity they believed in. Believing it to be true that he/she wanted that sacrifice. So to them, killing and harming another was not immoral - quite the contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Harming others has been done to ensure safety of others, through torture, imprisonment, psychiatric treatments etc. - and they weren't deemed immoral - until fairly recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Morality and perceived truth are not static. They change - and are extremely subjective, within the collective. So yes - they are indeed up for interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course those who're the victim of either might not feel it to be moral or true - but in the greater scope of things, it appears so to the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Karma is an idea - a very nice one at that. But if the only thing keeping people from harming others, is the odds that it will hurt themselves, you're dealing with a scary bunch of people.

       That's what a slave says, whom doesn't realize that you are born owning yourself and like in all of nature; you have a right to self-preservation regardless of what your god or idol the State says.

       what are you talking about? nothing you are saying makes any sense. self preservation is a fucking instinct not a right. If there is no God, no government, there is no one to tell you what is or isnt a right. Just because you have said something, absofuckinglutely does not make it true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will certainly practice my own self preservation, but most certainly not because anyone else tells me I do or do not have the right to do so. It has nothing to do with rights. Rights are man made, they are not real.

       What I'm saying ultimately is if you want the human race to move forward and towards freedom, there has to be an objective understanding of right and wrong behavior. There is a direct correlation between freedom and morality. Actions that cause physical harm to others will result in negative reactions or actions. If you don't want to risk me being you half to death because you steal from me, then don't attempt to cause harm to me by attempting to take something from me that doesn't belong to you. Apply that concept to everything else.

       none of that has anything to do with "rights". The world is filled with an infinite amount of physical harm done to others that is not a negative or immoral action. Do you think that animals eating other animals is considered negative physical harm?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a direct correlation between morality and promoting freedom, but not the other way around. There are many that are "free" but not moral. And those that are moral typically have no influence over your "freedom"

       You are comparing and bringing together so many different ideas I dont even know what point you are trying to make anymore.

       ok so again two completely different things. You only have the "right" to earn what you make from your job because of this system that we as humans have set up. Do women have the "right" to make less then men? This is a system that has been set up for us. Call it rights, call it whatever you want but it was created by man and has been dictated to you, not inherently part of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what you mean by "owning my own body".
      </p>
      <p>
       If we were living alongside the dinosaurs right now, and one came by, scooped me up in its mouth and swallowed me. Would that mean my rights were violated? Or that a common scene in nature played out? we really only define these rights as how we interact with each other, man to man, human to human.
      </p>
      <p>
       what if you think it is your right that you are free. But someone else, a king, a ruler, something like that, thinks that it is his right to enslave you for the greater good?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are two humans with different beliefs. We agree that it would be immoral for the latter to happen, but that is just our beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where do these rights come from, if not dictated by religion or law? The universe applies these rights living things? Have they always been the same rights?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that living things are programmed to survive and reproduce. Not because it is defined that it is their right to do so, but because their DNA has been programmed to do this. Did the single cell organisms that we all evolved from, have rights?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I feel that the "rights" that are applied to us are important and should be maintained, but I don't believe that these "rights" are a natural component of the universe. I believe that they were born out of compassion that some humans had towards other humans. I believe this is very important, but still created by man.

       Women don't make less than men. It's a myth. Those statistics that the myth is based off don't take into consideration different variables like 'Frequency of asking for promotions' 'types of jobs women gravitate towards' and other things I don't feel like getting into.
      </p>
      <p>
       If women made less than men, they would be cheaper to hire and thus they would have more jobs then men because employers would simply hire them over men.

       Am I allowed to tell you what you can do with your body? Can I sell your body parts to others? Owning yourself means that only you can decide what happens with your body; since no one owns it except you.

       They would be wrong and immoral. Just because someone in a position of authority thinks it's the right thing, doesn't make it so. It's not about what you think is right, but what actually IS based on TRUTH. 
If you don't believe in gravity, you can jump off a building and find out that it's real. If you don't believe the sun is hot, you would still be wrong. We find the truth and discover it and try our best to align ourselves with it as close as possible.

        I believe that living things are programmed to survive and reproduce. Not because it is defined that it is their right to do so, but because their DNA has been programmed to do this. Did the single cell organisms that we all evolved from, have rights?

      <p>
       Not sure exactly what you mean, everything has a right to survival. It's what I mean with universal Laws that exist already through nature and the universe.

       <p>
        Personally, I feel that the "rights" that are applied to us are important and should be maintained, but I don't believe that these "rights" are a natural component of the universe.

      <p>
       You are entitled to your opinion and maybe you are right, who knows; but I do know that actions that cause harm to others are wrong; and if an action doesn't hurt anyone then you should be allowed to do it. Regardless of what someone tells you like a king, president, group of people ect.

       There is definitely an argument with animals eating other animals. The main argument for that is that we are intelligent enough to recognize wrong behavior or when were doing harm to others. 
Good argument tho.

       It was February of last year. Wasn’t a fan of it then, either. I’m of the small, mostly silent, group of people that thinks folks should be able to own whatever kind of gun (not getting into stupid arguments with trolls asking if I think an individual should own a nuke - the answer is no) but that the vetting process should be MUCH, MUCH more thorough. Fruitcakes and people with a criminal history of VIOLENCE don’t need ‘em.

       I fucking hate tRump but the last I remember was the republican controlled gov. blocked (before he became president) a requirement that doctors who thought a patient was too mentally unstable own a gun (mostly via ss disability) were not allowed to weigh in on this. as in those records not be allowed to be part of the normal background check during the purchasing of a gun. I haven't attempted to look this up for times and details, but i do remember the NRA ads about how the dems were trying to stop hundreds of thousands  of (US CITIZENS) on SS from being allowed to own a gun that got a lot of attention. The problem of course was nobody corrected the left out fact that those were only mentally unstable recipients that doctors felt very strongly should not be allowed to have access to a firearm.

       Voluntarily gave up my guns last year. I have mental health issues. I don't need a court to tell me I might be crazy enough to put a bullet in someone's head. Sad part is a lot of us are unaware. I almost did kill someone and it was enough to snap me back to reality. I don't know how to fix it but someone needs to. I'm a good person. I don't want to hurt anyone but damn if I'm not capable. No more guns for me. That's my choice. I didn't want someone taking my right but there is a line that has to be drawn. Can the sane gun owners please step up and draw the line already.

       I believe there is a fundamental difference between states and individuals yes. I don't think the purpose of nuclear warhead is ever to harm an individual, so an individual does not need similar firepower for their own protection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say we followed your policy of letting all citizens have nuclear warheads, how long do you think it would be before the first nuclear terrorist attack?

       If I was the fat man I certainly wouldn’t want to get pushed off the bridge.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if it was me and my family in the car I would desperately hope the person pushed the fat guy off.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if instead of a fat guy it’s an old man?  He’s 100 years old, he can’t have more than a few years left.  Wouldn’t you want to him to get pushed off the bridge if it was you and your family in the car?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody has the right to form their own opinions on questions like this.  There are many valid answers and we can’t say which one is absolutely correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       It depends on our definition of what is “morally wrong” or “morally right”.

       Guns have plenty of uses besides murder. Thinking they dont, shows you have no understanding about Firearms.

       Yes - that's what I said.
But you can never be certain of what's true, it's your perception of said truth. So to claim that you know what truth is, is to attempt to exempt yourself from the subjective lens that it is being human.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everyone claimed the earth was flat, it would not be (what we perceive to be) true - but it would appear as truth to them. Just as saying that the cited basic human rights are truth.
