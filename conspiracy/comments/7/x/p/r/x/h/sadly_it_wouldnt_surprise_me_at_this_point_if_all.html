The other option is to believe the narrative the news pushes but the News lies so much anyway that how could you really? Maybe there are just a lot of angry crazy people that want to kill people or maybe the Powers that be find these people &amp; motivate them to kill, just for their agenda.</p>

<p>The best evidence I have found for this being planned is the interview of the girl saying there was a rumor that they were going to have a fake shooting for the last month. The video is on a post below this one somewhere. I’m just ranting, but that’s what I think. Undecided, obviously. Not that it matters what I decide, What actually happened happened &amp; i could be wrong either way. So it doesn’t matter what we think. I think they want us to be afraid. I think they, in a way, glorify this type of behavior by giving it so much attention. I think there is deception going on.</p>

I don’t think there is any logic in this type of thinking because Criminals would get guns anyway. That doesn’t make what I’m saying bullshit, though. I hope people do buy more guns to protect themselves.</p>

I just said gun cuz i can’t be entirely punctual &amp; correct 100% of the time cuz that would make me human. Obviously people still get shot when they get mugged or when the police shoot them.

But whenever there is a “mass shooting” that gets non-stop media attention, with very sketchy background details to support it, and things like the student saying they were planning it, it’s a good idea to look at everything with a very skeptical eye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly, it doesn’t surprise me that people still think this way. Consistently, what we’ve seen is a mass shooting happens, there’s outrage, guns sales rise, nothing is done.</p>

<p>I rarely hear talk of banning all guns, but initiating stricter control, licenses being required, limits on the types of guns. What I constantly hear is that we need guns to protect ourselves. We already live in a society where the government can gun you down and face no repercussions.</p>

<p>More people die. Gun sales rise as soon as there’s talk of control or legislations. Sounds to me like if there’s anyone with a motive, it’d be those selling the guns. Of course you’d rather stay convinced that’s it’s just the big bad authoritarians trying to take your guns. This country is fucked because shooting after shooting happens, and half the countries concern isn’t the lives lost, but their guns. Meanwhile the NRA pumps money into politicians pockets and guns sales spike. Gross</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When did i say I was convinced? I specifically said I was undecided. But you def. can’t believe everything you hear on the news, &amp; every time there is a shooting the democratic party talks about gun control an hour later. I think the lives lost is the most important thing, but all i can do is pray for them. It would do no good to post on reddit about the Poor children that lost their lives. Only prayer would help them. One thing i can do on reddit is kick around the idea that some group is actually planning these shootings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can’t stop them all. There will be another prob be another one. Lets say they banned all guns in the US. Well, someone who is deranged enough to shoot up a school does not care. Gets gun illegally, shoots up school.

Maybe not in the case of a school shooting, but you could in almost any other circumstance like a church shooting or a robbery for example.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You obviously can’t stop them all, but with decreased access to guns, there’s hopefully be less incidents. Yes, someone who’s going to kill doesn’t care about the law as is, but if there are more stringent limitations on what type of guns can be purchases, maybe it can make a difference. The argument that criminals don’t listen to the laws, just sounds like an argument against all laws.</p>

<p>Are you really arguing that it’s better to have more guns and just hope you can blast your way out of the problem if your life is threatened? What should the limitations on guns be? Or should there be none and everyone can just buy whatever guns they want? Auto, semi, doesn’t matter?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>isn&#39;t the actual case that no real and substantial gun legislation gets passed over these things? And don&#39;t sales of firearms go through the roof after almost every attack?</p>

<p>But it&#39;s the anti-gun guys, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was my first thought as well, prior to the shooting actually happening, I read a few articles about how Remington had to file bankruptcy.  Specifically this article was intersting from 2-13 : 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/remington-bankruptcy-guns-trump-slump-sales">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/13/remington-bankruptcy-guns-trump-slump-sales</a>  </p>

<p>Specifically this bit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The surge of gun purchases under Obama was largely driven by sales to existing gun owners. Sales spiked on Obama’s re-election and after his calls for new laws in the wake of tragedies like the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, which claimed the lives of 20 children and six adults.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then... the Florida shooting happens.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to form a theory or lead anyone to conclusions.</p>

<p>Many articles seemed to think it was a big deal that Remington was filing for bankruptcy and even referenced sales booms related to mass shootings.  Then a mass shooting occurs.  It&#39;s odd timing.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m the same as far as not usually formulating any crazy theories or whatever.  I honestly just thought the timing was odd...  But I agree, people usually try to theorize these things happen to force gun control but rarely do people take the opposite view point.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>because no serious gun control has EVER come from one of these in the states. Every other country has some retarded mass shooting and just bans alll guns. But with gun culture/hunting etc etc and just being a part of milliions of people in the states it just insn&#39;t viable. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also not saying that these are FF carried out by gun manfactures or w/e just the idea they are carried out by the anti-gun lobby is ludicris to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the only ones I believe was a FF was the bomb that went off about 2 hours b4 rush hour and only killed the bomber. The timing (Some bill had been passed the night b4 cant remember what) and the lack of dmg actually done compared to how much COULD of been done with the place of the attack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao. I’m insane for thinking outside the box? It’s just speculation. I’m not saying it Def was the government. I never said that. I said it could be &amp; it very well could be. It also could very well be a crazy person who’s very angry &amp; mentality ill. Good thing you don’t control the posts, because you’d be really bad at running a thread about CONSPIRACIES.</p>
