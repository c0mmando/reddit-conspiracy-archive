        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Human beings only have two ways to deal with one another: reason and force. If you want me to do something for you, you have a choice of either convincing me via argument, or force me to do your bidding under threat of violence. Every human interaction falls into one of those two categories, without exception. Reason or force, <em>that’s it.</em></p>

<p>In a truly moral and civilized society, people exclusively interact through persuasion. Force has no place as a valid method of social interaction, and the only thing that removes force from the menu is the personal firearm, as paradoxical as it may sound to some.</p>

<p>When I carry a gun, you cannot deal with me by force. You have to use reason and try to persuade me, because I have a way to negate your threat or employment of force. The gun is the only personal weapon that puts a 100-pound woman on equal footing with a 220-pound mugger, a 75-year old retiree on equal footing with a 19-year old gangbanger, and a single gay guy on equal footing with a carload of drunk guys with baseball bats. The gun removes the disparity in physical strength, size, or numbers between a potential attacker and a defender.</p>

<p>There are plenty of people who consider the gun as the source of bad force equations. These are the people who think that we’d be more civilized if all guns were removed from society, because a firearm makes it easier for a mugger to do his job. That, of course, is only true if the mugger’s potential victims are mostly disarmed either by choice or by legislative fiat–it has no validity when most of a mugger’s potential marks are armed. <strong>People who argue for the banning of arms ask for automatic rule by force and that’s the exact opposite of a civilized society</strong>. A mugger, even an armed one, can only make a successful living in a society where the state has granted him a force monopoly.</p>

<p>Then there’s the argument that the gun makes confrontations lethal that otherwise would only result in injury. This argument is fallacious in several ways. Without guns involved, confrontations are won by the physically superior party inflicting overwhelming injury on the loser. People who think that fists, bats, sticks, or stones don’t constitute lethal force watch too much TV, where people take beatings and come out of it with a bloody lip at worst. The fact that the gun makes lethal force easier works solely in favor of the weaker defender, not the stronger attacker. If both are armed, the field is level. The gun is the only weapon that’s as lethal in the hands of an octogenarian as it is in the hands of a weightlifter. It simply wouldn’t work as well as a force equalizer if it wasn’t both lethal and easily employable.</p>

<p>When I carry a gun, I don’t do so because I am looking for a fight, but because I’m looking to be left alone. The gun at my side means that I cannot be forced, only persuaded. I don’t carry it because I’m afraid, but because it enables me to be unafraid. It doesn’t limit the actions of those who would interact with me through reason, only the actions of those who would do so by force. It removes force from the equation and that’s why carrying a gun is a civilized act.</p>

<p>“I was not born to be forced. I will breathe after my own fashion. Let us see who is the strongest.” - Henry David Thoreau, On the Duty of Civil Disobedience </p>

<p>No one in our society watches movies that favor the worm in a coalition of sheep, or the collectivist mobs in form of revolution, over the lone-revolutionary with personal reasons to fight. People like strong people because its strong people they hope to save them. Cut out the middle man, or support the better ones.</p>

<p>“If you truly want to be respected by people you love, you must prove to them that you can survive without them.”
― Michael Bassey Johnson, The Infinity Sign </p>

<p>The reason most women I know are not being called continually by their parents for living alone for the first three years in a new suburb, is the gifted handgun. The reason they also submit to reason over the possible fear of home invasion: &quot;well, I do have a gun&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Reason or force&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;God Created Man and Sam Colt Made Them Equal&quot;</p>

<p>Only aspect perhaps needing scope, to make this masterpiece of reasoning a bit more digestible to the &#39;progressive&#39; rawlsian thinker:</p>

<p>Individual responsibility to firearms use and continual betterment is a constant necessary, given their dangerous value, is the real issue in personal safety no matter what weapon system is employed. This is a matter of individuals forming society and not society forming them, if it as a phenomena is to improve in perceptual outcomes of peace (commonality of projected violence and restraint). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why it&#39;s a tough issue. People should definitely be able to defend themselves. Most people who don&#39;t like guns aren&#39;t out there saying we should take them all away. But the idea that civilians can roll up to a public place with an AR15 and start blasting away is terrifying. Sure you can kill people other ways. You could set a place on fire or make a bomb at home or run people over with your car. But most of the time, these mass killings are carried out with these high powered guns. I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s cool at all and I wish people weren&#39;t even allowed to get those particular guns. Or a bump stock. Seems absurd to me. </p>

<p>Other countries don&#39;t seem to have this problem. Lots of modern societies where the public doesn&#39;t have a bunch of guns and they aren&#39;t paranoid about the government or each other. It just seems infinitely sad that we have to live this way. That there are so many guns around that we all need one in order to protect ourselves from the other dudes who have them. Just sucks and I wish we weren&#39;t in a situation like this.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean here&#39;s what I propose for school. It might seem costly to set up this infrastructure but basically schools should be fenced. students are required to swipe their ID card to enter through gates so that school security systems can keep track of each student entering and exiting the school as well as permitting entry based on reputation. The latest Florida shooter was expelled from campus and barred from bringing a backpack yet he was able to still freely enter campus anyways. If he tried to enter, he would be denied and if he tried shooting up the entrance, he&#39;d be quickly detained, with fewer casualties. Just a thought, I know there&#39;s probably some flaws with this.</p>

<p>Of all the things I&#39;ve read about the Florida shooting, this is the one that perfectly shows American obsession with guns.  </p>

<p>&quot;We don&#39;t have a problem with guns, that&#39;s fake news. It&#39;s all done by the government to take away our guns.&quot;  </p>

<p>After every school shooting, it&#39;s the same thing. Either pretending there isn&#39;t a problem or saying more guns would fix the issue. These shootings will keep happening under Democrat and Rebuplican but that doesn&#39;t matter since it&#39;s actually the (((deep state))) that&#39;s doing it when in reality this shit is going to keep happening until the US stops pretending there isn&#39;t a problem and actually fucking starts fixing the issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>americans are taught from birth to be scared of any and every possible catastrophe. especially since 9/11. fear keeps the populace distracted. most americans dont realize there is a combination of reason and force called non-lethal force. that (and systemic racism) is why there are so many police shootings that end in civilian deaths. just cuz youre being attacked doesnt mean you have to kill your attacker. of course if your attacker has a gun itd be a lot harder to subdue them without a firearm of your own but even a fire arm of your own doesnt completely negate any threat. only an immature goon gets a gun and thinks theyre invincible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think having a large magazine is dangerous.<br/>
For once it is honestly safer to train youngsters with larger magazines, it means the gun has to lifted up and can be fixed in place for longer.<br/>
For hunting with shotguns in Canada you will be limited to only 2 shots in a mag, this is not enough especially when dealling with large groups of pigeons.<br/>
For AR-15 I do not see a benefit of limiting magazine capacity, trained people, the ones doing the school shootings, can reloud in a matter of seconds, mag limits to not matter to them.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t wrong. The US has throughout its history been dangerous. Our population and government simply can&#39;t be compared to that of New Zealand or Singapore. European nations are less violent.....for now. This will change with more multiculturalism and a breakdown of values. That is his point. Fists, bats, and knives (along with illegal guns) are enough to terrorize an unarmed population. </p>

<p>In America, we are more afraid of these mass shootings than street crime unless you live in a big city. The goal is stopping young, angry people from obtaining something like the AR-15 or semi-automatic pistols. There has to be a way of maintaining the Second Amendment but also not letting anybody obtain mass casualty weapons. The powerful guns that hardliners view as a bulwark against tyranny must be held by the most trustworthy members of the community NOT children. And I&#39;m sorry but most young people in this country should be considered children until 30. Social media and narcissism has made us less mature than previous generations. Previous generations were bad too but I don&#39;t feel that they were as narcissistic as we are. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>These are the people who think that we’d be more civilized if all guns were removed from society,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That will never happen because it would mean disarming the military as well. I don&#39;t see that being very successful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I carry a gun, you cannot deal with me by force.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not true. I can deal with you by applying equal or greater force. You got a pistol, I&#39;ll get a rifle. Simply having a firearm doesn&#39;t stop violence ( though it can be a deterrent).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A mugger, even an armed one, can only make a successful living in a society where the state has granted him a force monopoly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The key term here is &quot;force monopoly&quot;. Disarming law-abiding citizens is a tacit endorsement of a <strong>government</strong> monopoly on violence. This is the real intent behind the second amendment.</p>

<p>I feel I must point this out: having a weapon doesn&#39;t make one safe or unassailable, <strong>skills</strong> are what determines the effectiveness of a weapon (regardless of what that weapon is). Pay more attention to developing your skills and don&#39;t get caught up in a thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If both are armed, the field is level.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong. The field is only level if both people are armed the same <strong>and</strong> have the same skill level. Don&#39;t make the mistake of thinking simply having a firearm makes a person dangerous. One more time for the cheap seats: <strong>Skills are the determining factor.</strong> A mugger who has never shot anyone vs. a Marine both armed the same, which is more likely to survive? I would put money on the Marine every time. And what is the difference? Training and skill.</p>

<p><strong>Don&#39;t just have a weapon, learn how to use it and be proficient!</strong> </p>

<p>Well because the drug cartels point guns at them or shooting them first with guns, or do you really believe the cartels are terrorizing the people only equipped with machetes or knifes?
I mean the ISIS also beheaded many people, do they carried guns? Or might guns helped a lot to get those people captured and tied up?
Ever thought that the beheading is a way of killing offering a special message? Simply just because most people tend to find beheading more cruel and terrifying as a simple deadly shot, no matter that you would end up dead in both cases?</p>

<p>One last question, were do you think the majority of those guns in Mexico come from? USA perhaps?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve been laughing my ass off to this post, it’s very well written, don’t get me wrong. Instead of force or reason, let’s say with “being a total dick” or “resolving stuff with a positive or neutral outcome for both parties”. That is the only idea akin to “reason”, all other methods of forcefully imposing your will, being blackmail, persuasion, deceit or anything on those lines is just plainly being a dick.
The problem I have with your argument is that it focuses on you. You being a great guy, will not use it to force people to do stuff they don’t want to, that’s fair.  No one messes with you and you don’t mess with anyone, cool. But you have an uncle, Sam, and man that guy is a dick. He cuts in line, leaves without paying, touches the ass of every wife in town, and every time you want to say anything, he pulls up his shirt and shows you that shiny god given right. So I know you and the way you think and say, “gosh, i want my rights to be respected too, fuck the judicial system, or law enforcement- those guys are crooked and suck” so next time your god damn Uncle Sam cuts in line, i’ll Let him have a problem piece of my mind. So you see, I want to be left alone as well, didn’t need any guns until your Uncle Sam forced a conflict by being a dick. Had there been another non lethal way of resolving this matter, maybe he would not impose his scumbag attitude with a gun and I would not need one to stop him, but by god I will not back out of this now, even if we are in a public place, they’ll all see that this is the only way to make right. This will certainly end well, right? The fact that you need a gun to be left alone means you are certainly not living in a civilised envieronment. The gun itself is nothing, just like any other weapon, its made to enforce dickish ideas on other people and get greater benefit for the owner, like banks, church, pyramid schemes, whatever. Your Uncle Sam would still be a dick without a gun, but a proper civilised environment would have non lethal ways to manage him that don’t involve me having to a pull trigger.</p>
