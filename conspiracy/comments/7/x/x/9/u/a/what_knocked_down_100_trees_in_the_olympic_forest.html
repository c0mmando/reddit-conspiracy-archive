        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">166</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-02-16 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/VitaVonLuak88.html">VitaVonLuak88</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi reddit, 
Disclaimer: I&#39;m pretty knew to this, but have the best of intent. Go easy on a girl...</p>

<p>That said, this is a local issue that has to do with a very precious resource - old growth forest.</p>

<p>I live in the PNW and recently stumbled upon reports of a &quot;microburst&quot; in the area, which caught my eye. You see, having grown up in the desert, I&#39;ve lived through several &quot;microbursts&quot; that come with the monsoon season. And what I can say is, radar will pick up the lightning/wind activity with ease...to say the least. </p>

<p>Recently, +100 old growth trees were knocked down in the Olympic Forest. The event is being called a &quot;microburst&quot;, not per a meterologist or even arborist or park ranger, but per Nan and Steve (locals allegedly) and that&#39;s enough to make it true per the Daily World. Nan and Steve also make it sound as if we&#39;re talking a couple trees, which is common after major storms rip through the forest. But that&#39;s not what happened. Note: there is no editor, author, or journalist credited with the piece either. And initial searches using google turn up nothing.</p>

<p>Link below
<a href="http://www.thedailyworld.com/news/microburst-flattens-trees-near-july-creek-picnic-area/">www.thedailyworld.com/news/microburst-flattens-trees-near-july-creek-picnic-area/</a></p>

<p>When reading the next piece describing the event (now running with the &quot;microburst&quot; theory and citing the Daily World) it&#39;s mentioned no radar or weather stations picked up any signs of wind or weather that would cause 110 trees to blow down. (So, we went from a couple trees, to an entire forest knocking down with such force, the National Park Service was able to make a seismic record of it?) The article also casually demeans thoughts of looking any further for answers with a strange turn of phrase mentioning Sherlock Holmes.</p>

<p>My attempts to share information with the Olympian (my local newspaper) were marked as spam.</p>

<p>Mannnmmmmn, did these loggers just up their tech game?! *kidding, kinda. </p>

<p>Your thoughts?</p>

<p>EDIT (update): the Olympian picked up the story as of 2/14/18 <a href="http://www.theolympian.com/news/local/article200047574.html">www.theolympian.com/news/local/article200047574.html</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Years ago we lived in north Texas and one afternoon I had to drive to the next county to pick up some hay. Warm sunny day.</p>

<p>By the time I got to the farm where the hay was it was pitch black, cold, and hailing like crazy.</p>

<p>That evening I watched the news and weather to see what kind of damage the storm had wreaked. No record or mention of any storm much less a major hail event. Just nothing, like it hadn&#39;t happened.</p>

<p>I guess the only people who knew it about were me and the hay farmer. Very strange.</p>

<p>Shit happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a thought, but could the lack of radar coverage of the event possibly be caused by the fact that this part of the forest is at a higher elevation and/or in a remote location, and possibly out of the line of sight for doppler radar? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know much about the geography or radar in general, but it seems that you&#39;d be able to pick up more data on low altitude weather events in a desert with relatively flat land than in a mountainous region.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, for what it&#39;s worth, weather radar works by bouncing specifically tuned radio waves off of water droplets. Generally, if a microburst is a wind-only event related to altitude temperature and pressure shearing; it would not be visible on any kind of radar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything around here is hilly in those areas and forested, so there is geography that can break things up before it gets to a monitoring station.  Also, the lake was right next to this, giving falling air a clear path to the trees.

Why is the Daily World being cited at all when there is no credible reference to an author of the piece, and not one professional (again) in any relevant field referenced? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, it&#39;s a local issue involving unidentified activity in a forest with precious old growth trees worth a fortune, and sterdy enough (with bases wider than your shoulders) to make snapping them at the base nearly impossible. I believe it was a military exercise or something meant to level healthy trees for the taking, or both. The spotty reporting seems to stink is all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen trees snap at the base before.  That&#39;s not unheard of, besides whatever the outside force is that pushed them over wouldn&#39;t change where they broke. Maybe spotty reporting, I don&#39;t know. What is your reasoning for military? And if it&#39;s military then what does the value of the trees have to do with that? Certainly they could have done it somewhere that didn&#39;t block a road and potentially knock out power lines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I also live on in the PNW we&#39;ve had lots of winds storms, but never seen or heard of that many trees going down in one area.</p>

<p>The article says Jan 27, I know on the weekend of the 19th we had a pretty bad wind storm coming across the PNW. We we&#39;re camping at sequim state park and our tent came down at 1:30 in the morning. And I thought the weekend after was pretty crappy as well. But 100+ trees in a localized area is odd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK so I live not too far from here and visit nearby quite often (several times a year).</p>

<p>IMO, this is natural. We have had alternating freezing and wet weather this winter and I think this could be an example of bad weather killing old trees.</p>

<p>Fun story: I got lost in these woods once while mushrooming and I screamed as loud as I could “help” at the top of my lungs “HELP ME!”</p>

<p>I got no response and was scared and walked 2-3 minutes and found the rest of my group.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for saying its natural, I live here too and feel the same way.  From what I saw of the pics some of the trees were right next to the road, which i think I could see was right next to the lake.  That is an incredible amount of moisture from run off and what not, given it rains here like crazy.  The ground is saturated, the trees are saturated, and all these people saying its abnormal for trees that large to fall over fail to recognize that those ones have the greatest amount of leverage on them when pushed by wind.  Also, it can be seen in the pictures that not every tree was knocked over, several smaller trees that would flex easier are still upright, which to me would not indicate some energy released from a military exercise.  </p>
