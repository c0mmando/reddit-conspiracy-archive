       Project MKULTRA
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA convinced the Allan Memorial Institute to allow a series of mind control tests on nine patients in the Montreal school, as part of their ongoing Project MKULTRA.[7]
      </p>
      <p>
       The experiments were exported to Canada when the CIA recruited Scottish psychiatrist Donald Ewen Cameron, creator of the "psychic driving" concept, which the CIA found particularly interesting. Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche. He commuted from Albany, New York to Montreal every week and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 to carry out MKULTRA experiments there. In addition to LSD, Cameron also experimented with various paralytic drugs as well as electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal power. His "driving" experiments consisted of putting subjects into drug-induced coma for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple repetitive statements. His experiments were typically carried out on patients who had entered the institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, many of whom suffered permanently from his actions.[8] His treatments resulted in victims' incontinence, amnesia, forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents, and thinking their interrogators were their parents.[9][10]
      </p>
      <p>
       When lawsuits commenced in 1986, the Canadian government denied having any knowledge that Cameron was being sponsored by the CIA.[11]

       Just throwing out a little more info, don't even know if it has relevance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cell phones were originally analog.  The switch over to digital was very gradual.  Digital signals allow for much greater distance to be covered on much less power (thus miniaturization of phones) because of the nature of square (digital) waves.  Much more effective at filtering noise and interference.
      </p>
      <p>
       This inherently means that the phones of today are going to be square wave signals and very low power.  If that alone were enough, Q would not exist.  They would simply shut him (them) and/or us down.  So they may act as a trigger but are not enough by themselves to completely program a human.  And Parkland would suggest that you really need somebody who is largely predisposed toward moving in the desired direction to begin with.  You can't just flip a switch and a born pacifist suddenly becomes Rambo.  Talk to me, Johnny!

Yes.

       You're going to have to go find that for yourself. I say this, so that if you're legitimately interested, you will. This isn't a fucking game any more, it's an information war. Places where this is being seriously discussed will be destroyed the fucking second they become too popular. I watched it happen here.

       Q is top secret information. The only way to access it is with a google search. The first rule of Q club is you do not talk about Q club, only make vague references to Q club so that curious parties can follow the breadcrumbs and uncover the mystery for themselves once they are ready to accept the wisdom of Q. Interlopers must not be allowed access to the glass temple of Q where they might cast doubt upon the veracity of his teachings.

       Most people don't appreciate being patronized with movie quotes. Odd choice of movie though, all things considered. I'm certain most people reading know how it ended. A power structure fell.

       Hopefully you’re intelligent enough to see what a crock this Q thing is, at least. If you had your doubts before then this should make it pretty clear that even the strongest Q supporters are unable to provide anything, even a shred of evidence to support the notion that Q is anything but a clever hoax utilizing cold reading, leading questions, overly vague predictions, and an excessive volume of content to ensure that for every popular happening, there’s a relevant Q post to read into.
      </p>
      <p>
       And with each vague prediction there will always be supporting statements which are in fact the true message of Q’s posts, informing you who the good guys are and who the bad guys are; who to trust and who to distrust; who to loathe and who to love.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s quite a bit of interesting stuff to read from Q, just remember to think for yourself. Ask for evidence that you can see and evaluate for yourself. If someone attempts to deflect your question with an invitation to do again what so many others have claimed to do already, see it for what it is. Double down, ask for evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you find any, I’m sure many of us would be excited to see it! So far we haven’t found anything more than the type of conversation you see here.

       To everyone reading, I'm following this new information not based off of a whim. I'm following it because I was told it would come up. I was told this by someone who cares very deeply for me, and cares very deeply for all for you, and all of us. Someone who doesn't care what you have done in your past, someone who doesn't care what your politics are, someone who simply accepts you exactly as you are, right now, all of it, and wants nothing but the best for you to happen. Someone who would want that even if you hated them. And no, I'm not talking about fucking Jesus, or Buddha, or some magic religious figure. I'm talking about an actual person who was once in my life, and told me what was going to happen, and what to watch for. And what they told me to watch for is now unfolding.

       We approached a stop light, and a car swerved in front of us trying to make the yellow. She stopped abruptly, causing the car behind us to slam on it's breaks, honking it's horn. The driver got out shouting obscenities. I watched her with her hands on the wheel, staring straight ahead. I watched her. I watched the things boiling inside her. I repeated in my mind "Don't. Don't. Don't. We don't need this. Don't. Don't." She didn't move. I kept repeating that word in my head like a mantra. "Don't. Don't. Don't."
      </p>
      <p>
       The driver of the car behind us approached the side door, screaming, and she slammed it into him. Hard. Harder than he deserved. She could have driven away but she didn't. As she got out, he turned around and swung at her. Moving in away that I don't understand, his face met the door frame, and he crumpled on the street. She got back in and closed the door, and just drove. There was blood on the car when we got back. She hosed it off. We didn't talk for three days. We were around each other but we didn't talk. When I felt I could, I just said to her, "why."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Because I'm fucking sick of this bullshit."
      </p>
      <p>
       She was. More than I'll ever understand.

       Understand friends that there are very big things which come into our lives sometimes. Big things which we think could never happen to a small person like us. When those big things happen though, we realize that we were never a small person. We had only convinced ourselves that we were.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of you are small people. Regardless of where you are right now. Regardless of how many friends you have, how much money you make, whether you have a girlfriend, a wife, or are single. None of you are small people. You're as big as anyone else is. You're as big, as anyone, else is. And your time, is right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe in you. You're here for a reason.

       And remember friends, this is the best proof the Q camp has to offer. This is it. Does it make sense to you? Pick any conspiracy on the sub and imagine these are the kind of responses you got when you asked to see the evidence yourself.

       The difference is, my claim requires you to post nothing and continue on. Your claim requires you to explain why Q’s information has been verified, confirmed, or accredited. You’re apparently going to keep deflecting, no doubt because you can’t support your claim, because none of the information Q has released has been confirmed.

       Of course you aren’t. You’re making baseless claims and I’m pointing out the fact that they are baseless. Every reply you post without showing anything to support your claims further proves my point, which is that none of Q’s information has been verified or confirmed or accredited.

       Here's the thing everyone. The comments this poster is making aren't directed at me. They're directed at you. This is damage control. You might be a reader who is new to this. Maybe you really don't know what this whole thread is about. And you have to rely on the comment section to make sense of it. You're busy, you're scrolling through this on the toilet, and don't have time to sit down and start digging into the information provided.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I'm saying that plenty of information has been verified. Lots of it in fact. To the point where it's actually unsettling, deeply, when you begin to understand what is actually happening in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another poster says, none of it is verified, at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we can't both be right, and we can't both be wrong. In fact it's probably even a little more complex than that. It's likely more grey. Some of the assertions I've made I might be overzealous in. And some of the assertions this poster has made, they might be overzealous in.
      </p>
      <p>
       You get to decide that for yourself though. And I'd ask you to come to a conclusion not based on what either of our anonymous dumbasses have to say in a comment section, but what you ascertain is true and not true based on your own research.
      </p>

       No surprise that Q is now moving to discredit SecureDrop as Trump initially worked to discredit the media in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       SecureDrop is in possession of direct evidence supporting the Russian hacking narrative, one of the core tenets of the Russian meddling narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course he’s said nothing to actually discredit them, as usual, but to supporters this mention will be all they need to see to dismiss any upcoming evidence outright.

       Brilliant play by Q, a proper execution of the fake news strategy.

       Dear everyone reading, now is the time for us to divorce ourselves from politics. Fuck who you voted for, fuck you you didn't vote for. There are way bigger things going on that we need to start paying attention to. This is no longer a war of red vs blue. This is a war of top vs bottom. And from where I'm standing, all of you, regardless of whether you signed up to be on the red team or the blue team, are on team bottom, along with me. We're in this shit together, on this planet together, and things are changing really quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have hope. Good can win. Use your eyes. Your real eyes. Begin to allow yourself to determine what you are seeing, and begin to stop letting other people tell you what you are seeing.

       Q is clearly politicized and in favor of one team, and though it might appear to be the bottom team, it is not. Q has never done anything to benefit the bottom team. One of the other teams though? For sure. And most of Q’s attacks? Squarely aimed at one team. Thankfully that is not yet the bottom team, at least.

       I guess we’re going to continue until you support your claim. Until then, why should anyone believe Q is anything but a hoax? None of the information has been confirmed or verified. Q has never been accredited in any way. Why should anyone really think it’s anything but a LARP? Even flat earthers will provide a picture of a flat horizon, and yet Q preachers can’t seem to provide anything but deflection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which makes sense, since they actually have nothing to provide. I’m sorry if I come across as unfriendly towards the Q hoax,  but you can’t expect me or anyone else to take it seriously when even a supporter with as much gusto as you is unable to provide anything to support your (and his) claims.

       What they said has come true within the last 6 months. I've been watching, vigilantly, because I trust this person above anyone that's ever been in my life, because they love me, and all of you as well.

       To anyone reading, there are two ways this is going to happen. The first, is that as people in positions of power resign, or are forced out, due to crimes coming to light, there may be a collapse in government. A big one. Divorce yourself from politics and look at top, vs bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this collapse occurs, things will be very, very bad for us for a number of years. Watch what is happening very closely. Take this seriously. Plan a route out of your city away from tall buildings. This is the worst case scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       The far better scenario, is, as corruption is exposed, as people resign, and are forced out, new people may step in to keep order. This is what I truly hope can happen. That everything can go on working, that each of us can be safe in our lives, and that we can make a true advancement in our society, and our species, by weeding out those who are predatory, and who would feed on us.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the most exciting time to be alive. Be aware. Be alert. Trust your intuition. There will yet be a push to tell you what it is you are seeing, vs what it is you are actually seeing. Be the one to decide what it is you are actually seeing. I believe in you, I love you, you are all my brothers and sisters, no matter who you voted for, no matter what your politics are.

       Q has been around for months now. If he was at all legitimate then there would be a long list of things which have already happened as you and his other preachers are always claiming they’re just about to.
      </p>
      <p>
       One could go back a week, a month, or however long and find plenty of posts like this one, promising something just over the horizon. But even now none of those claims will have come to fruition, and they never will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully the change you describe will come to our world, but it won’t be anything like Q has said it will be and it will be news to him as much as anyone else, because he is a hoax and none of his claims have ever come true and none of his information has ever been verified or proven true.

       There's a long list. To anyone reading, you can go find it if you decide you want to. I'm saying it exists. Another person is saying it doesn't. You get to decide which one of us is right. Take charge of the information you're being given. I've personally given you very little, because anything I can say to you is only as valuable as an anonymous reddit screen name. That really isn't worth shit, is it. What is worth shit, is what you yourself uncover, discover, and understand. I'm asking you to do that.

       ...and you know better. If it wasn’t obvious before it certainly is now. Nothing Q has ever said has come true. Nothing has ever been confirmed or verified. Even after all of these comments, we have yet to see a single piece of evidence supporting the Q hoax. Not even from a true believer as informed as this, who should easily be able to support these claims given his extensive knowledge of Q.

       Does anyone here believe in evolution, or do you believe in creationism? I for one kind of think the whole biblical creationism thing is...pretty silly. If you don't, I apologize. I mean no offense. Truly. It's just that the evidence I've seen, seems to really, really indicate that there's a long process of evolution on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you believe in creationism, well, you believe that. I doubt there's much I could say or present to you that would change your mind. And really, I guess I shouldn't try to. It's not my place to dictate your reality. However, if you were curious, and came to me asking about the evidence I had about how this whole shitfest of a planet came to be, I'd happily discuss it with you. Not in an attempt to change your mind, because you're in charge of that. I would however gladly talk with you about what has shaped my understanding of the world. And I think that I have some very solid point to make. Maybe some that a creationist hasn't considered before.
      </p>
      <p>
       And perhaps they'd have some that I haven't considered before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quite frankly I tend to think that the truth lay somewhere in the middle. A place that neither of us have arrived at yet. I don't believe in the traditional "God", however, I could entertain the idea that there may be an original "source" of consciousness. Neither of us really know. But, all of us likely have at least one piece of the grand puzzle.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet here we are in our understanding of the world, claiming to have all puzzle pieces, and hating or fearing anyone who doesn't adhere to the limited image we've put together.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if, we could understand exactly what we are, and how we are here, if we all decided to put each piece of the puzzle together, with one another? I mean, that kind of makes sense, doesn't it. Our planet is divided and violent based on sections of belief and understanding. Like we're pieces of a puzzle that have yet to fit together.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how hard is it to tell someone who believes they have finished their image that you have a piece that they do not? A creationist will reject the fossil record. An atheist may reject an example of a spiritual experience. These are only two examples of opposites in a world with hundreds, if not thousands, of different understandings of the way things "are".
      </p>
      <p>
       What will happen when we begin to put them all together?

       You do realize what you're asking people to believe is basically the creationism version of current events? You're asking them to "just believe" in Q and to not even ask for any evidence of anything he's said being true.

       Hard to tell a creationist that evolution is real by showing them the fossil record, isn't it. Usually they have to be ready to accept the information first. ;)

       No, usually you show them the fossil record and they decide for themselves. What you’re doing here is refusing to show me the fossil record.
      </p>
      <p>
       After all this, you still haven’t shown a single thread of evidence that anything Q has said is true. You keep replying with these random anecdotes, but still no evidence. Nothing confirmed, nothing verified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t get me wrong though, I understand why this is the case, and I commend you for your tenacity. It must be hard trying to defend something so indefensible. Props on keeping up the charade.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder though, do you think anyone will actually buy into anything you’ve been saying here? It seems to me like it would be obvious to anyone that this is a load of crap. Take any other conspiracy here and, while people might take offense to being asked for proof, they could at least provide some evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, pizzagate. Look at all the connections people have found regarding this conspiracy. There’s a veritable mountain of evidence. Of course others could either believe it or not believe it, but it’s something. This is unlike Q, where we’re supposed to believe that there is some reason his preachers are not allowed to post the evidence backing him up here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s obvious what is going on. It’s like if you went to a KKK promotion and they kept telling you no, no we aren’t racist we just care about white pride. And when you asked to see some of their official literature, of course they tell you it’s not available for the public to read. That’s because this literature when examined would make it abundantly clear that the KKK is in fact a racist organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when you’ve been to a few meetings and proven yourself to be “one of them”, only then would you be invited to the secret actual meetings where they talk about hating non whites, because only then would they be reasonably confident that you aren’t about to out them for what they really are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or take Scientology as another example. It all seems very reasonable to the uninformed from one of their centers. It’s only when they have decided you are susceptible that they tell you to cut off all connections with family and friends and to start paying significant sums of money to further the organization’s interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       As with any cult, it isn’t until you are a true believer that they start talking about the mass suicide. This is how the cult lives and survives, by limiting scrutiny to only those who have already drank the kool-aid and who the cult knows will not look critically at its teachings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing this, it becomes easy to spot a cult or a hoax. When requesting verification of the information, are you taken for a run around or given the information so that you can verify it?
      </p>
      <p>
       When requesting information on Q’s veracity, whether anything he’s said has been confirmed or verified, did you provide me with information to see for myself? Nope, you engaged in a deflection of epic proportions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also unsurprising due simply to the way the Q hoax works. Of course if all of his information was laid to bare, it would be obvious that there’s nothing to it. Q works because it feeds readers a slow trickle of information. Each separate piece seems reasonable enough, and by the time that information can finally be verified as having actually come to pass or having amounted to nothing, another drop comes along and Q’s followers are on to chasing the next wild goose, the conclusion to which is perpetually just around the corner.
      </p>
      <p>
       What’s surprising to me is that no one seems to care. Here’s someone who claims to be an insider releasing inside information, and no one seems interested in determining if he’s actually an insider and is actually releasing inside information.  I suppose it’s what they want to hear, what they want to believe, so they accept it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But make no mistake, not a single thing Q has said has turned out to be true. None of his predictions have come to pass and none of his information has been shown to be valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that were the case, you would have posted it by now.

       Also, to anyone reading, if you'd like to know more about the tactics currently being employed on this sub to control the flow of information and how you can defeat them, message me in private and I'd be happy to have a conversation with you. It's actually more simple than you might think once you understand everything. Anyways, keep fighting the good fight everyone! Keep your hope alive for a better world. We can create one for ourselves if we believe it's possible, and I for one absolutely believe it.

       Hate to break it to you but I’m not employing any tactics. I’m just some guy who thinks Q is bullshit. I suspect there are many like me, especially after you haven’t provided even one piece of evidence after all this time. Why would you expect anyone to believe in Q if you, obviously a very strong supporter, are unable to show anything lending any credence to his claims?
      </p>
      <p>
       I keep asking, show me the evidence, and you keep posting crap like this. If Q is so obviously true, why not just say why? Obviously something convinced you. What was it? Why do you believe in Q so strongly?

       Nah you can't start out a joke that way man. You just gotta tell it and let the audience decide. No standup comedian starts a bit by engaging with an individual. They have a couple one liners first to get the crowd warmed up, and after that, then maybe they ask questions to grease their piece.

       Oh nice I think one part is talking about electronic mind control, targeted individuals (everyone's targeted in a way) and how they can affect minds with drugs/waves. They can increase my emotions or affect of a drug to max with tech when I'm targeted really bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like suicide programming after they intentionally infected me and I did something they really hated, I didn't know infections could cause depressions or that I was targeted so it was really bad, they did some other things too but not worth mentioning atm. Or like another time I had to be 'punished' and I didn't know they could do this with drugs, I'd taken little of a dissociative drug and 2 xanax with fucking SIDE EFFECTS of memory impairment, totally backed me out and controlled me to do something and didn't remember any of it, found out next morning. It's like they need certain areas of the brain to light up so they can lock on to it and increase the effect with synthetic waves. Never had experiences of lost time of DID before that or since.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they induced a possession/mk-ultra experience and controlled my vocal chords and heart rate I felt lot of pressure moving around under my scalp and the effect would go away near some places when I took a walk outside like it would jump on WiFi signals. They also made me speak with any words I'd previously spoken in like the past 1-2 months at the time like they needed my EEG signals of me speaking and they'd play it back to me, just changed their placements and made whatever sentences they wanted, I feel it's A.I controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I'm not it's not the worst thing when shillbots call me mentally ill so the system deems me less of a threat. They're intimidated by powerful minds who're supported by great friends/family and will do anything to silence or use them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the pain/suffering in society is a manifestation of mental illness, they're mentally ill and trying to make everyone else like them.

       Remember the mind control they do now is global and far more advanced than the stories that float around about MK-Ultra. Most targeted individuals say there are 2 aspects to targeting, the gangstalking/community harassment/physical abuse/slander/vandalism/incarceration which and the electronic mind control/electronic harassment/remote neural monitoring/bio-electric weapons/directed energy weapons/voice to skull etc. Most say GS/EH (gangstalking/electronic harassment)
      </p>
      <p>
       They've almost ruined my life by organized harassment against me and my family, like creating trauma in Mk-Ultra then they introduce horrible people in my life to act like heroes/handlers to control my behavior and create more trauma.
      </p>
      <p>
       The electronic harassment is NOTHING compared to how much they've altered my life path with their organized harassment. (facepalm) Of course I can make my own decisions but think how much they've limited my options, I had lot of artistic potential with an intense desire to help others and they deemed me a threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people say 'mind control' it's not literal controlling of thoughts (although they can do that too) it's manipulating people by WHATEVER means into thinking differently, it's controlling their decisions and how they live their life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Advanced mind control came out of the lab long time ago and went global (it was always an agenda with religions, occult practices, wars, borders) most just don't realized how much we're being manipulated by everything around us.

       To anyone reading, what this poster has written sounds pretty nuts. And to you poster, I don't discount what you've written, but I will try to bridge a gap here. How would you expect your average person to interpret what you've said? It could very easily be written off as something outlandish, obviously. Even if it is all 100% true, I'm sure you understand how someone could write it off. You're not coming at the reader with something they can approach or easily digest. If you do in fact have a very large story to tell, something that is beyond the scope of most people's understanding, you can't dump it all on them at once like this. No one will accept it in the way you've presented it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What people will accept though, is what they learn by themselves. And there are a lot of very, very strange things we can learn by ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       To anyone reading, I'd simply ask you go out and look for strange things. Make up your own mind. You're intelligent, far more than you've been told you are, and you're dangerous, far, far more that yo think you are.

       I wasn't lying simply my personal experience and I don't mind if you don't want to believe me. To anyone reading I encourage you to do your own research on targeted individuals if you're interested enough but I believe you shouldn't indulge so much in conspiracy material or news and focus on what you really think you should be doing right now.

       There's a long list. To anyone reading, you can go find it if you decide you want to. I'm saying it exists. Another person is saying it doesn't. You get to decide which one of us is right. Take charge of the information you're being given. I've personally given you very little, because anything I can say to you is only as valuable as an anonymous reddit screen name. That really isn't worth shit, is it. What is worth shit, is what you yourself uncover, discover, and understand. I'm asking you to do that.
