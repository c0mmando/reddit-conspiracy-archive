This reminded me of how Vice President Joe Biden started a foundation for sexually abused children after the videos of him touching young girls started to circulate YouTube. </p>

<p>I spent some time in college studying search engine optimization. Saturation of particular terms can guide a search online in the way you want it to go. Marketing companies are masters at this. It&#39;s about guiding your audience to what you want them to see. </p>

<p>I get the sense that sometimes things like this are done to muddy the waters on touchy topics. What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Black panther is a comic book hero, incepted into the marvel universe in 1966. He is an integral part of the Avengers series, of which, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is centered around. I highly doubt its release has been planned to censor the real Black Panther movement, considereing the MCU has been in planning for the better part of a decade now. I have a feeling its release date is just coincidental</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not so fast bucky... It&#39;s entirely possible that before June&#39;66 Black Panter Party had already been infiltrated by FBI (via Aoki) and so it easily could have leaked to the Marvel propaganda machine.  Read up about Vison/Red Tornado controversy to get a sense of how they did things back then.  Kirby, the characters creator, has long history in counter-intelligence, ever see Argo?  The whole concept of superheroes is mindfuckery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The comic character has been around for decades, and they&#39;ve been trying to get this character on film since the 90s at least when a movie starring Wesley Snipes almost got made. Black Panther is an iconic character associated with the Avengers and one of the most prominent comics characters whose African ancestry is an important aspect of the character. If you&#39;re going to make a superhero movie with a Black male lead, and of course that should happen, Black Panther is probably at the top of that list for Marvel. </p>

<p>That said, I think you&#39;re right that this happens. Search engine optimization is a big thing today, so you gotta figure that there must be some people out there actively working to de-optimize undesirable searches too. It might even be a conscious bonus that the producers recognize as being somehow beneficial to them, but I can&#39;t imagine that&#39;s the true impetus in this particular case. They were trying to make Black Panther happen on the big screen before Google was even a thing. </p>
