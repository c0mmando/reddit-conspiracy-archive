       How exactly is this an assualt on the 2nd amendment, if nothing has been passed about gun control? Increased security measures and drills at school, contingency plans for local goverment, state EMA funding. But no federal rule changes, even with LV shooting country music fans?

       Brainwash the populace and they will disarm themselves. You may not feel like they are coming for your guns, and you might teach you kids to value their safe application, but your great grandkids will likely look down upon it because of what they will be told by your kids and everyone else in their generation.

       except they can literally just do it. there's plenty of things the government passes that is wildly unpopular. 90% of the population already thinks we need stronger background checks and they don't do anything, why does it matter if they get a majority on full gun control? the NRA has more power than almost any political group in the country

       don't disagree about AIPAC's power, but the NRA has given millions of dollars to a number of politicians. those politicians care much more about that than opinion polls on specific issues.

       no one said anything about the 2nd amendment. i didn't even give my stance on gun control. this is about how the FF idea makes no sense when there hasn't been a single step of federal action toward gun control after 98349871498 mass shootings. if they wanted to do it they've had enough justification for years.

       Again I will reiterate my point across.  Its called the totalitarian tip toe.  No they could not "literally just do it" The 2nd Amendment states: "the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed"

       yes they can. they can easily limit it, and we have. there are bans on destructive devices. there are bans on full auto. they could reasonably ban anything down to muskets, and then go further. the 2nd amendment isn't some sort of divine device that prevents anything from ever happening. a government capable of pulling off dozens of false flag shootings should have no problem getting something passed under certain interpretations of the 2nd amendment. but we can't even get stronger background checks (which is, again, an immensely popular thing).
      </p>
      <p>
       nothing's called the totalitarian tip toe. it's another thing david icke made up because he likes attention. almost every other advanced country has gun control and hasn't become a totalitarian state. but the government doesn't care about public support when they pass laws already, and they would've had enough justification years ago.

       Easy.   They are not all false flags and the government knows there is nothing they can do about guns.  Pandora's Box has been opened already and you cant close it.   There are over 300 million guns in America already and there is no way to get rid of them unless they go door to door and confiscate everything, which still won't work.

       Agreed.  I know this is a conspiracy subreddit but sometimes there isnt a conspiracy, sometimes the world just fucking sucks.

      <p>
       Whats more likely: A mentally ill teenager was bullied and isolated, so he grabbed his guns and shot his class mates and now people genuinely want gun control
      </p>
      <p>
       or that the federal government orchestrated a giant undercover plot with the help of multiple news media stations, in order to maybe pass lukewarm gun legislation that no one in the entire country wants passed.

       You're generally right, in that it's clear that people can sadly become so disillusioned or deluded and resentful that they would actively seek out to harm that which is good and alive. Columbine seems to be a genuine example of this, as far as I know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say, however, that you're drawing a conclusion with your final sentence that isn't really warranted because you're arguing against something that nobody seriously suggested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody claims that "the federal government" is doing these things. Nobody in Congress (who isn't part of the innermost circle) would have to be aware of false flags. And there's not much you need to "orchestrate" when you have a profile of pretty much every individual (especially high-schoolers) anywhere, which allows you to pick out those few who are actually close to that point which the Columbine kids crossed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're the kind of person who understands psychology enough to know how to trigger responses in people (CIA, et. al.), it's really not that difficult to conceive that events like this one might be provoked, triggered, or staged (with the predetermined "culprit" being no more than a patsy; mysterious second shooter and all).
      </p>
      <p>
       So my point is that the fact that people can genuinely become cruel and deranged enough to shoot up a school out of their own volition doesn't take away from the idea that shadowy groups would abuse our collective emotional response to events of this sort to transform our societies in ones of ever-increasing "security" through control, gun or otherwise.

       Baloney. That number could be drastically reduced over a sufficient time horizon by:

       But Why ruin something for law abiding citizens when we can address the real problem. I for one think it's our culture and mental illness that leads to guns looking like a bad thing. You can do as much with a stolen semi truck can you Not? I mean confiscate all the guns that will just lead to the "bad guys" who have the illegal guns to be the only ones to have them. There is strict guns laws on South America, Mexico, The UK and Europe but you still have tons of people with guns that terrorize people because they know they have the gun and regular people dont.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know. A lot of people know that their gun is purely for safety and the last check before a tyrannical takeover. We're not mentally disturbed people that want to hurt people unless someone poses an immediate  threat to loved ones.

       This doesn't make any sense to me. Who will protect us? The "SJWs" you're talking about are the same people outraged when a police officer shoots a young u armed black kid. And usually it's the conservatives defending the cops. I don't buy this theory at all. It wouldn't help the government to have the public be constantly paranoid.

       The NRA and politicians in their pockets get paid each shooting to spout how this is not a gun control issue but a terrorism issue(if he's a white nationalist it's suddenly a mental health issue). Big firearm companies like Smith&amp;Wesson, Ruger, And even the hundreds of small AR part producers make money after these shootings.

       It's not the government.... It's not the NRA. It's the deep state. And yes the baby boomers had it way worse. The difference is that the threat is localized, random, and often without warning. Now false alarms in schools across the nation will put children on higher alert than they are already on, already happened today. The real question is what pushed this kid over the edge, and why would he be able to carry out his attack if the school, the police, and the FBI knew that he was a threat. If you think that the kids of today have anything in common with the baby boomers besides dna take a look around. Baby boomers played outside, these kids don't play. They take selfies, and snapchat.

       "a generation raised by fear", allow me to introduce the baby boomers. The fear this generation has nothing on the fear the boomers lived with growing up. Fear is a tool used by those in power since the dawn of civilization, there's nothing new about this.

       You mean like how the Baby Boomers were raised in fear of nuclear annihilation by performing endless (and unnecessary) "drills" where they were made to hide under their school desks? Or how they lived in fear of a compulsory draft that would send them (or their loved ones) to fight and die in a foreign land for amorphous and unjust aims?

       They aren't false flags and they aren't about gun control. It's just crazy fucks doing horrible violence, and then less violent crazy fucks denying it happened, and even less violent crazy fucks thinking this is a good time to push my political agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do need to have conversations about the things that cause these shootings Ann's how to stop crazy fucks from getting weapons, but in the aftermath of these tragedies everybody runs to their corner and plugs their ears.

       I agree that most school/rampage shootings are not FF or TI. I think we have a serious issue in America and it's not just access to weapons or the "mentally ill". There's a sociopathic, voyeuristic narcissism to exist in this world. We're all plugged into our own entertainment, including the elderly, and remote from each other, including nuclear families that all socialize online, even when home together.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watch the kids at the bus stop across the street. One dad parks with his kid in the car. The dads and moms talk. Only the 2 youngest boys are playing with each other. Kids don't even know how to socialize with their neighbors? I fuckin loved my 'hood friends. I had dozens. We did so many things beyond Nintendo. Rode bikes. Played sports. Made a hiking/biking trail in the woods. Had a fort. Bottle rocket wars. Snuck porn at one kid's house. Snuck cigarettes at another. Explored the creek all the way to the river.  I had social contacts, even when not at school, church or sports/dance. I also grew up without cable and a lot of network programming was aimed at pre-schoolers, so TV was a lame way to spend my time. Do kids even read books, craft, listen to music anymore, without it being an app?
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing this sub doesn't like to talk about is that the perpetrators are generally white (young) males, who are unhappy with society and spend a lot of time online. The denial is thick on this point.

       I was just thinking about this as well. What if it is not only about gun control but also overall control of the population? It was not long ago you could be put in an insane asylum (basically prison) without any sort of trial and held indefinitely . Imagine a society going back to that sort of system combined with todays surveillance technology.

       There could be other things that could change as a result - more security cameras, more security in general like metal detectors, maybe going places will be like going through TSA when you fly. There are talks about this kid's social media and how his posts were red flags, maybe there will be more surveillance of social media, thus causing people not to post or express opinions aka freedom of speech.

       An assault weapons ban was proposed one month after Sandy Hook. It’s certainly not from a lack of trying.

       Is that even trying, though? If you accept that 9/11 was a false flag (as I do), that was followed by both parties nearly-unanimously passing broad and sweeping provisions allowing for greater police powers, stronger surveillance, and curtailed civil liberties. It was then followed by two different wars, the first of which was supported almost unanimously by both parties, the second of which attracted majority support from Democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Sandy Hook, a bunch of young children were mowed down. If anything was going to be a "9/11" for gun confiscation,
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       would've been it. And it was followed by literally nothing serious being enacted.

       If you want to take away rights and make the people themselves want it to happen in order to make them feel more secure you need time to ignite fear, build momentum and create tension. You keep repeating over and over until they can't take it. Then they'll beg you and that's where you step in as the saviour. You create the problem, most of the attacks are suspicious if not outright semi-staged or allowed to happen, and then you offer a solution. If you take such valuable rights away too quickly people will protest. But if you convince them through such events, and most importantly the media, that gun control is needed they will gladly obey and give you their guns with open arms eventually. It's like chess. You think in advance long-term and don't want to rush your moves.

       so how does this work nationally? where stronger background checks poll at over 90% with nothing being done? or tax cuts for the rich being wildly unpopular but happening anyway? or how legalization of marijuana polls at over 60% now but we don't even have medical marijuana legal at the federal level? or how the republicans feel comfortable holding the widely-supported DACA program hostage in a midterm year?

       they're going to do what they want. pro-gun politicians even pretended to support a bump stock ban for about 5 minutes and nothing happened. lobbyists and donors have far more control over our government than the opinions of the people.

       There’s a conspiracy for sure, but it’s not false flags to push a gun grab, it’s politicians and media being paid off with gun lobby money and ad revenue to look the other way instead of taking common sense measures to reduce gun violence and report on it. The public (including most of the gun-buying is overwhelmingly in favor of things like universal background checks, not selling to people with mental illnesses or criminal histories, and banning quasi-auto devices like bump stocks and cranks, yet we can’t even accomplish those...let alone anything that would be mildly more controversial.

       The conspiracy here is not about gun control. It's about the fear of gun control driving people to stock-up while they can, fueling gun sales and donations to the NRA. 
I'm not saying the NRA/ gun industry is orchestrating false flags, but that they have the most to gain when these tragedies occur (roughly once per fiscal quarter). 
I am curious about what (if any) ties might exist between the pharmaceutical industry and gun industry, as many of these murderers have a history of anti-depressant or anti-psychotic medication.

       Because Americans aren't giving up their 2nd amendment rights because of some mentally ill people any more than we would give up our 1st amendment rights because of people we disagree with.  What can they pass that will make a difference? Ban AR style weapons? They will use a regular rifle. Ban rifles?
 hey will use a shotgun. Ban shotguns? They will use a pistol. Ban all guns? They will rent a U-Haul and run down kids after class. Ban all cars? You can't stop crazy, you can only prepare for it by having good security.

       There isn’t a single cohesive “they”. There are different factions/groups in power pursuing different agendas.

       I don’t really know, but it’s possible that this latest shooting with its “mental issues” focus is a FF in response to the reported softening of gun control laws for the mentally ill.

       And your point is? I don't want to live in a country where policy is dictated by fear of extremists. Neither should you. I want to live in a country where policy is dictated by welfare of its citizens.
