        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The views on gun ownership seem so different between Americans and most of the rest of the world. I come from NZ and we need a license which involves numerous tests, contact with police, multiple referees ( who will be interviewed) and proof of where your guns will be locked. This is not fail safe of course but it makes it a lot harder to buy and use a gun. NZ still has violence. And guns. But no mass shootings. In a long time. 
I come from a place of compassion when talking about this, I&#39;m not trying to say Americans are wrong at all. A lot of the world really feel for you with these terrible shootings. Kids shouldn&#39;t shoot other kids. 
Is this seemingly starting to look like a conspiracy to take America&#39;s guns? Not that the government set it up, but they take full advantage of these terrible events? </p>

No one needs a gun that quick unless it’s for nefarious reasons. Problem is there is a mindset amongst gun owners that if you give an inch on gun control the left/liberals will take a 100 yards....it’s all absurd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who thinks banning guns is a soloution is wrong!
For instance Australia and the U.K. Banned guns due to certain mass shootings that happened, so all the anti gun activist will say look they barley have any mass shootings right?</p>

<p>Well yes that&#39;s true, but let&#39;s look at he stats, before those mass shootings Australia and the UK barley had mass shootings, and they still had guns!!! After mass casualty events are still happening, but the perepetrators of violence are using other means to carry out those attacks.</p>

<p>For instance in Australia after they banned guns, someone used arson to kill 15 people, or how in the uk there&#39;s constant Truck attacks.</p>

<p>Because some people are fucking nuts doesn&#39;t mean I should give up my liberties, same reason if people are irresponsible with alcohol doesn&#39;t mean they ban it for everyone else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this.</p>

<p>Although the laws here in Canada are different, people these days have a serious misunderstanding about guns everywhere.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in my late twenties and I truly believe that my parents&#39; and grandparents&#39; generation failed us on teaching us how to appropriately handle and think about guns (that includes lawmakers). But it wasn&#39;t entirely their fault.</p>

<p>Sometime in the late 80s, early 90s, the music and movie industry starting negatively associating guns with rappers, gangs, violence, etc. How could our parents compete with that when they didn&#39;t watch MTV after school or use a computer for a few hours a week? Then when the internet happened, our parents had no chance. They hardly knew how to use a computer, let alone knew what we were being subjected to on the internet.</p>

<p>It&#39;s too bad the waiting times to obtain guns aren&#39;t longer. I think what people these days need is more time to think about their decisions and they need big purchases like this to take longer. We are a society of &#39;now now now,&#39; and it&#39;s not doing us any good.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>exactly right...it&#39;s a BIG purchase and should be treated as such. 30 minute wait to get a gun is not treating it like the BIG purchase that it is. Had a friend last year (struggles with depression) get into a huge fight with his wife and leave his house to go to Academy Sports to buy a shotgun to off himself in his car...fortunately the police got to the store while he was making the purchase and stopped him...had there been a wait time for him to get the shotgun he&#39;d probably feel different about killing himself a week later...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia: Self-defense and protection of property is a constitutional right guaranteed to Russian citizens, “each individual has the right to defend his/her rights and freedoms by all means not prohibited by law.” This means that people may use weapons that they legally own to protect their life, health, and property when necessary.</p>

<p>Most of the weapons used in crimes committed in Russia turned out to be unregistered.</p>

<p>1 school shooting in Russia&#39;s history - 2014 Moscow - Two people were killed in the shooting,- teacher, policeman - A medical examination confirmed that Gordeyev has symptoms of mental disorder (paranoid schizophrenia)</p>

<p>Reaction: Give one&#39;s attention to children&#39;s education and gun control. He also told a Moscow Kremlin advisory council on the arts and culture that &quot;the new generation...needs to be raised with good artistic taste and the ability to understand and value the theatrical, dramatic and musical arts.&quot; Criticism was also aimed at violent video games and exposure to American culture</p>

<p>He has also called for the Church to play a larger role in citizens’ social lives, better religion classes in schools, and television programs emphasizing religious values.</p>

<p>Communist Party of the Soviet Union</p>

<p>.&quot;If the opposition disarms, well and good. If it refuses to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves.&quot; - Joseph Stalin</p>

<p>“All political power comes from the barrel of a gun.  The communist party must command all the guns, that way, no guns can ever be used to command the party.”
- Mao Tze Tung, Nov 6, 1938</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has been a movement to Teach every american citizen a basic firearms course. Our constitution gives us the right to own guns. New Zealand is better about how to do gun ownership.  </p>

<p>In the USA we like to be free to exercise our constitutional right. And many see education, Tests, licenses, roll sheets in militias as n infringement of those rights.</p>

<p>All of this is argued and no consensus is ever really reached. </p>

<p>On a side note.  We have millions of floating &quot;stolen&quot; guns in the US.  The guns are here.  If the Government takes everyone&#39;s guns then only the criminals will be armed. It is a spurious argument, but true as well.</p>

<p>What is the answer? Educate and arm everyone.  Or....take away all the guns and hope for the best. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with this.</p>

<p>Although the laws here in Canada are different, people these days have a serious misunderstanding about guns everywhere.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in my late twenties and I truly believe that my parents&#39; and grandparents&#39; generation failed us on teaching us how to appropriately handle and think about guns (that includes lawmakers). But it wasn&#39;t entirely their fault.</p>

<p>Sometime in the late 80s, early 90s, the music and movie industry starting negatively associating guns with rappers, gangs, violence, etc. How could our parents compete with that when they didn&#39;t watch MTV after school or use a computer for a few hours a week? Then when the internet happened, our parents had no chance. They hardly knew how to use a computer, let alone knew what we were being subjected to on the internet.</p>

<p>It&#39;s too bad the waiting times to obtain guns aren&#39;t longer. I think what people these days need is more time to think about their decisions and they need big purchases like this to take longer. We are a society of &#39;now now now,&#39; and it&#39;s not doing us any good.</p>
