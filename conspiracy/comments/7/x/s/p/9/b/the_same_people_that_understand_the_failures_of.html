Who is doing the background checks on the enforcement? Who holds <em>them</em> accountable? Or stops <em>them</em> from carrying out a mass shooting? </p>

<p>Criminals get guns. If you have spent one day in certain American cities or <em>anywhere</em> in the underworld you <em>have to know</em> how fucking easy it is to get guns unregistered. Hell, I can get police issued glock&#39;s with no serial number... know where those come from? You guessed it <em>crooked cops</em>!!</p>

<p>So with that being said when you give up your legal gun hoping to stop a mass shooting, I will be buying as many illegal ones as possible to protect you when a mass shooting <em>does</em> happen.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>why can we not make mental health examinations a regular thing for youth in school in order to pick up on problems that may go unnoticed otherwise. They do check-ups for physical health. Most mental health issues fly under the radar until something drastic brings them to light. <em>That</em> is the entire problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well one problem with that is how easy it would be to skirt the testing by simply lying during any examination. There still exists a huge stigma about mental health in this country and the fact of the matter is that kids are some of the meanest, most hateful people when it comes to teasing and bullying and when they latch on to something it could be months to years before they let go. They’re like wild animals that can smell the smallest weakness amongst their peers and they don’t have the cognitive ability to know when and when not to say appropriate things to each other, especially when no adults are around. </p>

<p>Another issue is that most kids are so pumped full of hormones starting at around age 12 and until about 19-20 that they literally can’t control themselves some times. One minute they’ll feel invincible and the next they will feel utterly worthless. And this cycle goes back and forth throughout the day/night for years. Not only does that fuck with them mentally but there’s not really a way to explain that to a kid who thinks they know it all. And things like gender identity, and being gay are more acceptable to the community at large, but see my first point. Some kids can only take so much and if they don’t actively solidify that core friend group early then they don’t have any support to deal with the teasing etc..</p>

<p>Really, a strong push should be made for kids to solidify core friendships early and learn to take gentile hazing from those friends. That’s really how I personally got through a lot of shit. I had a strong group of 5 guys who were so much more mean to me than anyone could possibly imagine, but when I needed them they stuck up for me like none other. And I gladly did the same back to them and because of that we became brothers. So I learned to brush off a lot of things just by being exposed to the worst of the worst but also having a support group. Not every kid has that and time and time again it seems the kids doing the school shootings are either loners or only have 1 friend that they never really hang out with outside of class.</p>

<p>I think you’re on to something but if a kid thinks something like a psych test could be used against them then they will likely lie just to not be attacked by the pack. But again, I really think you’re on to something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re just not listening to what I&#39;m saying. The U.S is the most gun happy place on the planet. It&#39;s why most of the mass shootings happen here and not in other countries.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2014/09/24/how-gun-control-made-england-the-most-violent-country-in-europe/">How gun control made England &quot;the most violent country in Europe&quot;</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;The Firearm Act of 1997 was passed while emotions ran high. Gun control proponents push for an all-out ban on private gun ownership, in the much the same way that Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) reacted to the heinous crime at Sandy Hook Elementary by trying to ban approximately 150 different guns...</p>

<p>And what has been the outcome of passing more laws in Britain to remedy the fact that other laws were ignored or broken? It has not been good.</p>

<p>In 2009, twelve years after the Firearms Act of 1997 was passed, Daily Mail Online reported that Britain was “the most violent country in Europe.” They also reported that Britain’s home figures showed “the UK [had] a worse rate for all types of violence than the U.S. and South Africa.” </p>

<p>Sounds like a nice place to live. Their gun laws predated 1998 and when your gun homicide rate is 15 to 38 any fluctuation is just noise at hat point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s <em>only</em> murders with a gun, not total murders (which went up dramatically). And the UK uses different <a href="https://mises.org/blog/gun-control-fails-what-happened-england-ireland-and-canada">measurement methods</a> than the countries you&#39;re comparing it to:</p>

<p>&quot;homicide numbers in England and Wales &quot;exclude any cases which do not result in conviction, or where the person is not prosecuted on grounds of self defence or otherwise...</p>

<p>The United Kingdom is often held up as evidence of the effectiveness of gun control. After all, since 1920, the UK has experienced increasingly restrictive gun control, leading up to an almost-total ban on handguns, and even many shotguns.</p>

<p><em>And yet, the homicide rate increased for years after gun confiscation was put into effect</em>&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Low ownership strongly correlates to low homicide rate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong again, because you&#39;re still using faked stats and <em>only</em> shootings, not <em>total murders</em>. But even then, you&#39;re still wrong:</p>

<p>&quot;Using the developed nations as defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), developed countries in fact show that <em>more gun ownership as measured by the Small Arms Survey is associated with fewer homicides</em>...&quot;</p>

<p>The article goes on to explain the statistical fallacy of using cross-sectional data like this:</p>

<p>&quot;There is a real problem in using cross-sectional data. Suppose for the sake of argument that high-crime countries are the ones that most frequently adopt the most stringent gun control laws. What if gun control actually lowered crime, but not by enough to reduce rates to the same low levels prevailing in the majority of countries that did not adopt the laws. Looking across countries, it would then falsely appear that stricter gun control resulted in higher crime. Economists refer to this as an “endogeniety” problem. The adoption of the policy is a reaction to other events (that is, “endogenous”), in this case crime. To resolve this, one must examine how the high-crime areas that chose to adopt the controls changed over time&quot;</p>

<p>No, gun bans do not get rid of guns. They make them illegal, which means people who follow the law will not have them. Criminals don&#39;t obey laws. Using your logic, drug prohibition has made it impossible to get marijuana.</p>

<p>None of this will make sense until you understand the following: guns are used <em>all the time</em> to prevent crime:</p>

<p>&quot;Gary Kleck, Ph.D. is a professor in the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Florida State University in Tallahassee and author of &quot;Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America&quot; (Aldine de Gruyter, 1991), a book widely cited in the national gun-control debate. In an exclusive interview, Dr. Kleck revealed some preliminary results of the National Self- Defense Survey which he and his colleague Dr. Marc Gertz conducted in Spring, 1993. Though he stresses that the results of the survey are preliminary and subject to future revision, Kleck is satisfied that the survey&#39;s results confirm his analysis of previous surveys which show that American civilians commonly use their privately-owned firearms to defend themselves against criminal attacks, and that such defensive uses significantly outnumber the criminal uses of firearms in America. The new survey, conducted by random telephone sampling of 4,978 households in all the states except Alaska and Hawaii, yield results indicating that American civilians use their firearms as often as 2.5 million times every year defending against a confrontation with a criminal, and that handguns alone account for up to 1.9 million defenses per year. &quot;</p>

<p>Except for the multibillion dollar smuggling industry that specializes in bringing illegal things into the US. The US has weak borders and every time we try to strengthen them we get called racist. Obamas fence was racist, Trumps wall is racist. We search 5% of vehicle traffic into the states. Send 20 trucks full of guns only one will be statistically even looked at. Send a bunch of trucks full of stinky weed first, well the guns all get through.</p>

<p>Even if you managed to magically vacuum up every gun in the nation instantly the next day there would be trucks loaded and incoming to arm the smugglers, and then once they are armed may as well sell them to anyone that wants them.</p>

<p>When has prohibition of anything worked in the US? We cant even keep drugs and weapons out of maximum security prisons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just trying to be funny, sorry, it&#39;s a well-known meme (I thought). 
Yes, background checks will stop criminals from getting guns just like it keeps them from robbing banks (big money) and instead robbing unsuspecting people (small money). The tighter laws will keep them from getting AR&#39;s and instead having only smaller guns, especially as the years go by and the regulations have been in effect for decades and less and less high-powered killing-humans-only guns like the AR are harder to come by. It&#39;s simple math really. Besides, just because something is easy to do now, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right or that it will always be that way. Cultures evolve. They always have and always will..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mass shootings that occur in the US almost exclusively (relatively speaking compared to other developed nations), I don’t believe has any bearing on the ability to get firearms legally. The reasons I cite are grounded in evidence at the state level in the USA. For example, IL has some of the most aggressive gun control laws in the country and yet has one of the highest crime rates involving a weapon. Granted not many mass shootings that I can recall, but violence is violence. Whereas the “fly over states” like UT, MT, ID, WY, and the Dakotas (to name a few) have some of the highest firearms ownership per capita and yet some of the lowest violent crime rates. Why is this?  If gun control does work these states should have the highest violent crime rates in the country involving a firearm. I believe the root issues to this type of violence are deeper societal/cultural issues. It’s easier for grieving and frightened citizens to have something tangible to demonize.  At its base, a firearm is nothing more than a tool. It does nothing damaging without a careless or deranged mind behind the trigger. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really?  I’ve seen a lot of evidence for both sides. And both piles seem highly manipulated. The problem I have with gun control personally is that it only affects law abiding citizens. Criminals, you know the guys that do bad shit with weapons, don’t care what a law states. So why disarm law abiding citizens??  I can tell you why, most populations throughout history were disarmed before they were openly subjugated. I don’t know if the plan is to disarm to subjugate, or if human beings are such shit bags that people take advantage of the situation after they are disarmed. Either way, disarming law abiding citizens is an open door to further subjugation. It is disgusting that the moral compass of our people is so broken that children kill children.  Call me crazy, and I’m sure you will, but this kind of violence won’t stop if all guns stopped existing tomorrow. The tool is not the problem, it is the mental state of a few that wield them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good thing I’m fluent in sarcasm. We have a billion gun laws on the books currently much like traffic laws.  Gun laws don’t allow for someone to purchase a weapon that is a felon, arrears in child support, history of mental illness, domestic abuse history, etc etc etc. Completely removing firearms would be like completely removing vehicles to use your EXTREMELY insightful and relevant analogy. Ultimately you can’t control someone’s free will.....to the cabals chagrin. If someone wants to kill people they will find a tool to do so. </p>

Not cars versus guns. Which is another analogy entirely if you look at what is written above. You can try to defeat the straw-man you created or you can honestly answer my simple point.

<p>I lived in Bolivia for a while.

The biggest problem was that these cia fucktards killed all the crops, not just the coca. coca was one of the only plants hardy enough to grow in the aftermath, so they ended up planting more than before.</p>

<p>One of the leaders of the coca growing union in Bolivia was Evo Morales. He represented coca growers&#39; rights, later became the head of the socialist movement, and in 2005 he was elected as Bolivia&#39;s president, the first ever self identifying indigenous president in South America.</p>

If it was harder to procure a weapon, this kid Cruz would have had a tougher time getting a weapon, plain and simple. The fact that it was easy to get at least facilitated the issue.  Criminals will get guns anyway?  OK, well, the fact that Heroin is illegal stops SOME people from getting it, no?  Not all, I get it, if someone wants something bad enough they&#39;ll get it.  Whats wrong with putting roadblocks to try to prevent this though? Its not even a consideration, its just basically fuck you, too bad, guns for fucking everyone. 
I&#39;m all for 2A. I don&#39;t want rights taken away from me.  I also see a problem that needs to be fixed, and since we&#39;re a country of smart fucking people its pretty sad that we can&#39;t come up with a solution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no heroine being illegal creates a market with incentives to deal it and help kill people. I guarantee 80% of American high-schoolers have access to heroin within their school. and 99% can get <em>some kind of opiate</em> Do you think Cruz would have not attacked the school if he couldn&#39;t have gotten the guns as easily? Because I think he would have just taken more time. You forget a lot of these kids plan these things out, and have the time to acquire weapons </p>

But I believe there are many other steps that can be taken that will be more effective, cause less problems, and much easier to manage. And yes- if you are making longer waiting periods you are hindering people from legally buying a gun. Then theres the argument of what degree of mental instability will dictate who can own a gun and who can&#39;t? will it be a universal process? will it be doctor to doctor? because one shrink shouldn&#39;t be able to decide if I can own a gun when I have the right to per the Bill of Rights (the Bill our whole country is built on)</p>

Thanks Trump! He just repealed a law from Obama that specifically STOPPED the mentally ill from legally acquiring guns, idiot-tool-of-the-gun-industry-that-he-is) and then snap one day and use simply start to use them for the only thing they are designed to do. Kill as many humans in as short a period as possible with the LEAST amount of effort. Hell, why are grenades illegal? Rocket launchers? Bazookas? Flame-throwers? Ground-to-air heavy guns? Nuclear weapons? Where does the line of madness belong? How about where the children of America are getting mowed down in the classrooms where we send them to learn and grow each day?

Try building a building with complaints and opinions and no plans. This kid was unstable. If he went to home depot, or to his job, and had a huge fight with the people there, you don&#39;t think he could have just as easily gone there and done the same thing? Would you say he &quot;planned&quot; it then? No, you wouldn&#39;t, because there were no plans, or diagrams, or lists, or anything else except an unstable kid with access to a lot of guns designed for one purpose. And that is to kill as many humans as possible in the shortest .amount of time using the least amount of effort possible. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s what they&#39;re for. And they are as easy to buy at the corner store as a toaster oven or a pair of sneakers. With minimum regulation or oversight. And that&#39;s just stupid. Who could argue otherwise?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Originally your point was that passing new laws against guns was a bad idea because these kids often &quot;plan ahead&quot; anyway and will go to Great Lengths to get the weapons they require to carry out those plans. You drew a picture of a guy laying out specific details of what he was going to do and therefore any new laws would not stop him. Now you&#39;re arguing that merely wanting to do something is the same as planning on doing something and therefore nullifying your argument from the beginning anyway that laws would somehow not stop this.

<p>&quot;The Firearm Act of 1997 was passed while emotions ran high. Gun control proponents push for an all-out ban on private gun ownership, in the much the same way that Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) reacted to the heinous crime at Sandy Hook Elementary by trying to ban approximately 150 different guns...</p>

<p>And what has been the outcome of passing more laws in Britain to remedy the fact that other laws were ignored or broken? It has not been good.</p>

<p>In 2009, twelve years after the Firearms Act of 1997 was passed, Daily Mail Online reported that Britain was “the most violent country in Europe.” They also reported that Britain’s home figures showed “the UK [had] a worse rate for all types of violence than the U.S. and South Africa.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d argue they&#39;re proof that better quality of life means lower crime. The fact is most shootings in the US are related to gang violence and the drug trade, and mass shootings are done by people with mental illnesses and people with extreme ideologies. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to be obsessed with guns to own them. I know many people who own guns and don&#39;t make a big deal out of it, they simply want to be able to defend themselves if the need arises. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well one problem with that is how easy it would be to skirt the testing by simply lying during any examination. There still exists a huge stigma about mental health in this country and the fact of the matter is that kids are some of the meanest, most hateful people when it comes to teasing and bullying and when they latch on to something it could be months to years before they let go. They’re like wild animals that can smell the smallest weakness amongst their peers and they don’t have the cognitive ability to know when and when not to say appropriate things to each other, especially when no adults are around. </p>

<p>Another issue is that most kids are so pumped full of hormones starting at around age 12 and until about 19-20 that they literally can’t control themselves some times. One minute they’ll feel invincible and the next they will feel utterly worthless. And this cycle goes back and forth throughout the day/night for years. Not only does that fuck with them mentally but there’s not really a way to explain that to a kid who thinks they know it all. And things like gender identity, and being gay are more acceptable to the community at large, but see my first point. Some kids can only take so much and if they don’t actively solidify that core friend group early then they don’t have any support to deal with the teasing etc..</p>

<p>Really, a strong push should be made for kids to solidify core friendships early and learn to take gentile hazing from those friends. That’s really how I personally got through a lot of shit. I had a strong group of 5 guys who were so much more mean to me than anyone could possibly imagine, but when I needed them they stuck up for me like none other. And I gladly did the same back to them and because of that we became brothers. So I learned to brush off a lot of things just by being exposed to the worst of the worst but also having a support group. Not every kid has that and time and time again it seems the kids doing the school shootings are either loners or only have 1 friend that they never really hang out with outside of class.</p>

<p>I think you’re on to something but if a kid thinks something like a psych test could be used against them then they will likely lie just to not be attacked by the pack. But again, I really think you’re on to something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how three island nations solutions will work perfectly here in the US. </p>

<p>Except for the multibillion dollar smuggling industry that specializes in bringing illegal things into the US. The US has weak borders and every time we try to strengthen them we get called racist. Obamas fence was racist, Trumps wall is racist. We search 5% of vehicle traffic into the states. Send 20 trucks full of guns only one will be statistically even looked at. Send a bunch of trucks full of stinky weed first, well the guns all get through.</p>

<p>Even if you managed to magically vacuum up every gun in the nation instantly the next day there would be trucks loaded and incoming to arm the smugglers, and then once they are armed may as well sell them to anyone that wants them.</p>

<p>When has prohibition of anything worked in the US? We cant even keep drugs and weapons out of maximum security prisons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Originally your point was that passing new laws against guns was a bad idea because these kids often &quot;plan ahead&quot; anyway and will go to Great Lengths to get the weapons they require to carry out those plans. You drew a picture of a guy laying out specific details of what he was going to do and therefore any new laws would not stop him. Now you&#39;re arguing that merely wanting to do something is the same as planning on doing something and therefore nullifying your argument from the beginning anyway that laws would somehow not stop this. So I have to ask you if I want to go to Mars does that mean the same thing as I am planning on going to Mars? No it does not. You&#39;re merely dancing now.</p>
