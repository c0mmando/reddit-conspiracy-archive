</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I would like to point out that I am <strong><em>not only</em></strong> questioning the beliefs held by the establishment, and by the greater majority of humanity, but also questioning <strong><em>my own</em></strong> beliefs at the same time.</p>

<p>I am doing so by employing the <strong>Socratic method</strong> as opposed to the <strong>scientific method</strong> you are all probably used to.</p>

<p>Indeed there is mountains of evidence to prove these claims are not true, and the weight of evidence supports this, but what about the proof of the evidence? </p>

<p>How can it be proven that the evidence which proves the claims are not true itself is true?</p>

<p>And thus lies the paradox.</p>

<h1>Nothing can truly be proven to exist.</h1>

<p>I know what you&#39;re thinking right now :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;fuck off mate, go post this shit on <a href="/r/im14andthisisdeep">/r/im14andthisisdeep</a> &quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>consider this.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/eATtmpn.png">https://i.imgur.com/eATtmpn.png</a></p>

<p>Now, is that a case of coincidence, serendipity, predestination, retrocausality, or did the collective will of everyone thinking what I am saying, and having the idea in the collective conscience cause this to happen?</p>

<p>Or, am I the only being in existence, and all my experiences are just myself experiencing myself, and in so doing, I have just trolled myself?</p>

<p>Can you show why any of these cannot be more true than the others?) </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Socratic Method, is a form of <strong>cooperative argumentative dialogue</strong> between individuals, based on <strong>asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking</strong> and to draw out ideas and <strong><em>underlying presumptions</em></strong>.</p>

<p>[It] is a method of <strong>hypothesis elimination</strong>, in that better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and <strong><em>eliminating those that lead to contradictions</em></strong>. </p>

<h1>The Socratic method searches for general, commonly held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinizes them to determine their consistency with other beliefs.</h1>

<p>The basic form is <strong>a series of questions formulated as tests of logic and fact intended to help a person or group <em>discover their beliefs about some topic [and explore] definitions</em>.</strong></p>

<p>Socrates generally applied his method of examination to concepts that <strong><em>seem</em></strong> to lack any concrete definition. </p>

<h1>Such an examination challenged the implicit beliefs, bringing out inadequacies and inconsistencies.</h1>

<p>In view of such inadequacies, Socrates himself professed his ignorance, but others still claimed to have knowledge. </p>

<p><strong>Socrates believed that his awareness of his ignorance made him wiser than those who, though ignorant, still claimed knowledge.</strong></p>

<h1>While this belief seems paradoxical at first glance, it in fact <em>allowed Socrates to discover his own errors</em> where others might assume they were correct.</h1>
</blockquote>

<p>The Oracle of Delphi was right when she proclaimed that :</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;no man is wiser than Socrates&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For Socrates knew :</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>&quot;The only thing we can <em>truly</em> know is that we know <em>nothing</em>.&quot;</h1>
</blockquote>

<p>Which only demonstrates the weakness of the Socratic Method and the strength of the Scientific Method.</p>

<p>The difference is, the Scientific Method calls for the formation of an hypothesis, and from that the making of predictions. If those predictions are found to be accurate time and again, we can <em>assume</em> that the underlying hypothesis is at least partially true, and likely usable until a better hypothesis comes along.</p>

<p>While the Socratic Method is arguing whether the the evidence that the evidence that the evidence ... is itself true, the Scientific Method is putting a man on the Moon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand exactly what you are saying, yes, indeed, it proves that things are because other evidence also collaborates it, and then, once enough evidence correlates to the idea, it can be said to be true.</p>

<p><strong>Correlation does not equal causation</strong>, since it is not <em>absolute</em> proof, just our best idea at the current time, considering the bulk of evidence suggests that it is correct.</p>

<p>And, of course, I understand it can be proven to the nth degree, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, indeed.</p>

<p>But <strong>how can the scientific method prove that anything exists at all</strong>?</p>

<p>Can science provide absolute truth?</p>

<p>Can &#39;I think, therefore I am&quot; be proven?</p>

<p>If not, can you even prove you, yourself, exist?</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t be sure of your own existence, how can you be swure of anything external of yourself?</p>

<p>and therein lies the paradox of existence.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t need to - all it needs is to be a useful tool for getting shit done.</p>

<p>Navel-gazing may be intellectually stimulating, it may even lead to a more profound understanding, but the &quot;real world&quot; (whatever that may be) does not wait for anyone. Getting shit done is far more important than understanding exactly how or why - and nothing beats the Scientific Method for getting shit done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly my point.</p>

<p>and to the man in the street, it makes no difference, but I thought we were on the search for <em>truth</em></p>

<p>Or, perhaps I have it wrong, and I&#39;m looking too deeply into it.</p>

<p>But I believe that the only things we can truly accept are absolute truths, and the only one of those we have discovered so far is that we can only know that we know nothing.</p>

<p>Everything else is open for debate, and should be.</p>

<p>And my point, at last, we have reached again, why the hate?</p>

<p>ie : &quot;are you retarded? everyone knows that. science says so, look at all the proof&quot; and so on.</p>

<p>The claim is y&#39;all have open minds, yet when I ask, have you considered this, the majority of the responses are of that sort.</p>

<p>There is no truth in your world view. Makes discussion incredibly difficult if not impossible because we argue what truth means and abstract ideas instead of the distance to the sun (For example) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m looking too deeply into it.</p>

<p>I would say so. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;are you retarded? everyone knows that. science says so, look at all the proof&quot; and so on.</p>

<p>Straw man. </p>

<p>I havent called you retarded and Im not responsible for those that do. </p>

<p>I tend to see the opposite. </p>

<p>When a FEer (For example) has their beliefs challenged and factually rebuked they tend to fall back on name calling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>cool, then I guess we have come to an agreement.</p>

<p>I can respect your point of view, yeah, there is overwhelming evidence for science being correct. right on.</p>

<p>But obviously we are on different levels when it comes to looking for truth, and that&#39;s fine, there is no right or wrong level, just different levels of experience.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in <em>that</em> I would suggest looking into Clare W Graves and his work on Levels of Human Existence</p>

<p>I feel I am saying &quot;enough with shoving the same old reteric down my, and others, throats, I won&#39;t stand for it. If we are claiming there is a conspiracy, we should be able to look at ALL possible sides, with equal merit, because what is conspiracy to one is crazy to another.</p>

<p>we are all linked by one thread, we believe there may be a conspiracy of one sort or another.</p>

<p>we should be able to act in a descent way towards each other, and not engage in personal attacks and whatnot.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>so far is that we can only know that we know nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a bullshit platitude. Meaningless drivel.</p>

<p>If we &quot;know&quot; we know nothing, then we &quot;know&quot; something... right?</p>

<p>And if we can &quot;know&quot; something, there is nothing preventing us from &quot;knowing&quot; other things.</p>

<p>Sure it sounds profound to people who want to believe they are intelligent, but a moment&#39;s contemplation quickly sees it discarded into the pile of useless thoughts best left to stoners.</p>

<p>Here is something that will really wrinkle your brain:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The phrase &quot;I know that I know nothing&quot;,&quot;The only thing I know, is that I know nothing&quot; or &quot;I know one thing; that I know nothing&quot;, sometimes called the Socratic paradox, is a well-known saying that is derived from Plato&#39;s account of the Greek philosopher Socrates. The phrase is not one that Socrates himself is ever recorded as saying.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The saying, though widely attributed to Plato&#39;s Socrates in both ancient and modern times, actually occurs nowhere in Plato&#39;s works in this form.[5]</p>

<p>Two prominent Plato scholars have recently argued that the claim should not be attributed to Plato&#39;s Socrates. </p>

<p>Evidence that Socrates does not actually claim to know nothing can be found at Apology 29b-c, where he claims twice to know something. See also Apology 29d, where Socrates indicates that he is so confident in his claim to knowledge at 29b-c that he is willing to die for it.</p>

<p>In Apology, Plato relates that Socrates accounts for his seeming wiser than any other person because he does not imagine that he knows what he does not know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing</a></p>

<p>Turns out that one of the things you thought you knew is actually false. In fact, the entire premise of your argument is based on a falsehood.</p>

<p>Neither Plato nor Socrates is ever recorded having said &quot;the only thing I know is that I know nothing&quot; or even a variation of it.</p>

<p>No surprise really, because it is an obviously self-contradictory statement that renders itself meaningless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OMG.</p>

<p>Damn that irony is delicious.</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s the other side of the paradoxical statement isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>The only thing one can know is that they know nothing.</p>

<p>An turns out one cannot even know that.</p>

<p>But of course you couldn&#39;t, becaus that would indeed violate the initial statement.</p>

<p>Socrates would be proud.</p>

<p>The only suggestion I can make is that, through retrocausality, by the very fact of the paradox, the only way for the universe to be able to handle such would be to change reality.</p>

<p>But even I can see that is a real stretch.</p>

<p>But god damn, if I have created a Mandela effect by looking too deep into the fabric of reality, then I apologise.</p>

<p>However I must say, well done, you have disproven (quite easily it turns out) the absolute truth.</p>
