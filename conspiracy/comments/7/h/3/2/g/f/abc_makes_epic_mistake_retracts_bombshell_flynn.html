    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to misleading the FBI about conversations he had with Russia’s ambassador to the United States.</p>

<p>His guilty plea marks an escalation of the special counsel’s probe into Trump campaign ties to Russia, and also corroborates anonymously-sourced media reports about Flynn’s contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.</p>

<p>Flynn said he is cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, though it&#39;s unclear at this stage where his contribution might lead.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, Flynn’s charging document puts several facts we’ve been tracking on more solid ground:
Flynn talked sanctions with Russian ambassador</p>

<p>In the waning days of his presidency, Barack Obama responded on Dec. 29 to Russia’s interference in the U.S. election by issuing sanctions and ejecting 35 Russian diplomats.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, as president-elect Donald Trump readied for his inauguration, the Washington Post reported that Flynn and Kislyak had spoken by phone on or around the day sanctions were handed down. (The Post later reported that Flynn had been warned in November that Kislyak’s conversations &quot;were almost certainly being monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies.&quot;)</p>

<p>The Flynn-Kislyak conversation raised questions about whether Flynn had undercut Obama’s move against Moscow, particularly after Russian President Vladimir Putin declined to retaliate.</p>

<p>In the days after the Post revealed the Flynn-Kislyak phone call, key members of the Trump transition team, including White House press secretary Sean Spicer, Vice President Mike Pence and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, denied that sanctions came up during the conversation. Flynn also denied this to the Washington Post.</p>

<p>But Flynn’s guilty plea removes any lingering doubt about whether sanctions figured into his discussion with the Russian ambassador.</p>

<p>The charging document reveals that on or about Dec. 29, Flynn asked Kislyak to &quot;refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed on Russia that same day.&quot; The document also reveals that Kislyak told Flynn that Russia &quot;had chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of his request.&quot; (See the full charging document here.)</p>

<p>Right. I am giving you the benefit of the doubt, but you are aware of how bad the optics of stickying something that seems trivial on your own post, right? </p>

<p>I do not know you personally, but I know that the mods of r/conspiracy have a dubious reputation at best. Often putting popular threads subject to debate into &quot;contest mode&quot; for no good reason at all (usually just accusing the thread of being brigaded despite a completely predictable outcry from a &quot;hot&quot; story).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As the top two are no longer active, I assume that makes me #1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So how does that make you a great moderator? If you ask me, integrity and respect needs to be earned. r/conspiracy has so far given me little faith in the moderator team. It makes even more ironic since a conspiracy forum would, presumably, be organically anti-authoritarian and based on trust.</p>

<p>You sound like a great contributor, but why should I trust you to be a great moderator? Especially with comments like this:</p>

<p>It&#39;s not trivial to the mods.</p>

<p>So how does that make you a great moderator?</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t...my original content and knowledge of conspiracies, my bringing back the featured documentary, creating the round table discussions, and my engaging with the (legitimate) <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> community is what makes me a good mod.</p>

<p>It did, as I was overwhelmingly voted in by the community several years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again...I was pointing out that the report button is being abused.</p>

<p>When I posted this, most of the new submissions were being reported. They all were genuine and didn&#39;t break a single rule.</p>

<p>Let me spell this out further for you: we have a mod &quot;queue&quot; that we have to curate on a daily, even hourly, basis. Every time a comment or post receives a report it gets sent to the mod queue.</p>

<p>Occasionally, these reports alert us to PI or other serious violations of the reddit TOS. This is very rare, but the report system allows us to moderate more effectively, especially since we&#39;ve been dealing with a <em>huge</em> upsurge in traffic over the last few months.</p>

<p>However, the trolling types have flooded the sub with a vengeance since this political nonsense has been dominated the airwaves, and they have the triggeriest fingers when it comes to clicking that report button.</p>

<p>Anything that they find remotely disagreeable they report...it&#39;s indicative of the cognitive dissonance they apparently are compelled to peddle. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s nothing about this post that breaks the rules of this sub, so I&#39;m actually doing the other mods a favor by ignoring the reports so it doesn&#39;t further clutter the mod queue.</p>

<p>I hope this comment has been sufficiently elucidating. </p>

<p>The downplaying of Uranium One and the bribes that show the only real collusion that exists at this time actually stems directly from the Dems. </p>

<p>The fact that not a single indictment delivered has had any bearing on the original intent of the investigation.</p>

<p>The denial of wiretapping, across EVERY media outlet and from every member of the previous admin, and from the FBI/Intel agencies... only to later find out that the dossier was leveraged to authorize a FISA warrant for wiretapping. </p>

<p>And now, this...</p>

<p>Would you like me to continue? This is all bullshit. They are desperate and the media is complicit. As a result, no one is willing to call themselves out as they went &quot;all-in&quot; on this absurd fantasy theory that makes the left look WAYYYYY worse than the right. </p>

<p>flynn&#39;s visit to russia took place in december of 2015, and he did not join the trump campaign until february of 2016. your assertion that &quot;2 weeks after that Russian/RT invitation [Flynn] began working for the Trump campaign&quot; is false. absent further evidence, i am also denying the significance of even the corrected timeline to the dreadfully boring russian collusion narrative.</p>

<p>Well if you don&#39;t think that r/conspiracy is political then you are absolutely blind.</p>

<p>w/r/t r/Catholicism, it can get pretty political a pretty political thing, just like all other religions. The church&#39;s stances on birth control, immigration, etc are all political in nature and are the subject of pretty intense debate both inside and outside of the church. You only post in threads on that sub dealing with politics so far as I can tell. </p>

<p>i take it, then, that you have no substantive replies to offer and are instead defaulting to a demonstrable falsehood in self-defense. nothing shady there!</p>

<p>r/conspiracy explores political topics (sometimes excessively, in my opinion) but it is not a &quot;political sub.&quot;</p>

<p>So we have known about the capabilities of hackers hijacking planes for quite some time.</p>

<p>The only issue i see here, is that Trump showed that we have intelligence sharing with some unknown party, that did not approve.</p>

<p>I mean, it may be behind a secret clearance, but it wasn&#39;t like he gave them the nuclear codes. </p>

<p>I find it hard pressed Russia, didnt already know about intelligence sharing, which seems to be the crux of that article you posted. </p>

<p>take a moment to remember the context in which Flynn’s underlying conduct took place: He and apparently the Trump transition team were working to undermine U.S. foreign policy goals endorsed by both parties. In December 2016, President Obama authorized sanctions against Russia in response to cyber-enabled election interference. He did so with broad bipartisan support to deter such activity in the future against the U.S. and its allies. The shared bipartisan—even nonpartisan—goal was to protect foundational elements of democracy and legitimacy. To the extent that there was mainstream criticism of the action, it was for being too weak, not for being too aggressive with respect to Russia.</p>

<p>One, No. He met with Russians on several occasions prior to the election, as did Kushner, Manafort, and Trump Jr.</p>

<p>Two, the meeting you are referring to happened <em>before</em> Trump was officially President. It doesn&#39;t matter that he won an election.

<p>True.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To the contrary, for all the furor, we have a small-potatoes plea in Flynn’s case — just as we did in Papadopoulos’s case, despite extensive “collusion” evidence. Meanwhile, the only major case Mueller has brought, against former Trump-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an associate, has nothing to do with the 2016 election. It is becoming increasingly palpable that, whatever “collusion” means, there was no actionable, conspiratorial complicity by the Trump campaign in the Kremlin’s machinations.  <em>Andrew C. McCarthy</em>  </p>

<p>Flynn and Papa cooperating with the investigation is sure to mean nothing.   </p>

<p>Exactly.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As an ethical matter, it is inappropriate for an attorney whose client is cooperating with the government (or having negotiations toward that end) to continue strategizing with, and having quasi-privileged communications with, other subjects of the investigation and their counsel. <a href="http://archive.is/IQodt">http://archive.is/IQodt</a></p>

<p>No you are mentioning the classic Nixon defense though.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FROST: These meetings produced a plan, the Huston Plan, which advocated the systematic use of wiretappings, burglaries, or so-called black bag jobs, mail openings and infiltration against anti-war groups and others. Some of these activities, as Huston emphasised to Nixon, were clearly illegal. Nevertheless, the president approved the plan. Five days later, after opposition from the FBI director, J Edgar Hoover, the plan was withdrawn, but the president&#39;s approval was later to be listed in the articles of impeachment as an alleged abuse of presidential power.</p>

<p>Would you say that there are certain situations - and the Huston Plan was one of them - where the president can decide that it&#39;s in the best interests of the nation, and do something illegal?</p>

<p>NIXON: Well, when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to misleading the FBI about conversations he had with Russia’s ambassador to the United States.</p>

<p>His guilty plea marks an escalation of the special counsel’s probe into Trump campaign ties to Russia, and also corroborates anonymously-sourced media reports about Flynn’s contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.</p>

<p>Flynn said he is cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, though it&#39;s unclear at this stage where his contribution might lead.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, Flynn’s charging document puts several facts we’ve been tracking on more solid ground:
Flynn talked sanctions with Russian ambassador</p>

<p>In the waning days of his presidency, Barack Obama responded on Dec. 29 to Russia’s interference in the U.S. election by issuing sanctions and ejecting 35 Russian diplomats.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, as president-elect Donald Trump readied for his inauguration, the Washington Post reported that Flynn and Kislyak had spoken by phone on or around the day sanctions were handed down. (The Post later reported that Flynn had been warned in November that Kislyak’s conversations &quot;were almost certainly being monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies.&quot;)</p>

<p>The Flynn-Kislyak conversation raised questions about whether Flynn had undercut Obama’s move against Moscow, particularly after Russian President Vladimir Putin declined to retaliate.</p>

<p>In the days after the Post revealed the Flynn-Kislyak phone call, key members of the Trump transition team, including White House press secretary Sean Spicer, Vice President Mike Pence and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, denied that sanctions came up during the conversation. Flynn also denied this to the Washington Post.</p>

<p>But Flynn’s guilty plea removes any lingering doubt about whether sanctions figured into his discussion with the Russian ambassador.</p>

<p>The charging document reveals that on or about Dec. 29, Flynn asked Kislyak to &quot;refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed on Russia that same day.&quot; The document also reveals that Kislyak told Flynn that Russia &quot;had chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of his request.&quot; (See the full charging document here.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Russia is only a superpower in terms of global influence, not economy etc</p>

<p>2) It is a dictatorship maintained by an oligarchy that suppresses all media and popular dissent and facilitates corruption and embezzlement. Better relations with such an entity in the form that Trump would like is directly countering what the United States has stood for in every sense.</p>

<p>3) whether you like it or not Russia has been directly responsible for destabilising Ukraine and other Baltic states, there is widespread agreement across European governments and intelligence that Russia has been using covert operations to spread disinformation and create instability. This includes the U.K. Government which is clearly committed to not aligning itself with the EU. This isn&#39;t some EU created myth. We can include all US intelligence agencies unanimously agreeing with this as well, but I know you dismiss this out of hand with no evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>You may not want conflict with Russia but Russia is committed to creating conflict in the West. There is no doubt about that. The biggest danger to oligarchies and dictatorships are their people seeing democracy working well in other countries.

And the US is a corpotacy maintained by the oligarchy that suppresses all media and popular dissent and facilitates corruption and embezzlement.  What the US &quot;has stood for&quot; and how we actually do are two completely different things.  </p>

<p>3) Whether you like it or not there is no bigger threat to peace in the world than the US.  The US is directly responsible for destabilizing the entire Middle East and parts of South America.  The US doesn&#39;t just use covert operations to spread disinformation and create instability, we overthrow democratically elected governments for our own perceived benefit.  The US intelligence agencies have a long history of lying to the American people so believe them at your own peril. </p>

<p>Yes, those are the allegations by the US corporate media.  It would be disingenuous, however, to suggest that there hasn&#39;t been destruction of the free press in the US; or disruption of free elections.  Deep state sanctioned murder certainly wouldn&#39;t be a surprise either.  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I think this is the disagreement. I&#39;m not saying Russia is free from injustices and corruption. Far from it. I&#39;m saying that the corruption and injustices propagated by the US is far worse. How does Crimea, a territory with predominately Russian citizens, compare to Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, etc?  In Yemen the US is currently assisting Saudi Arabia in genocide that is responsible for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of deaths.  How does Russia compare to that? Not to mention, the US has been arming SA for years, the country believed to be responsible for 9/11.</p>

<p>Russia, along with the Syria Army, have really been the only ones fighting ISIS in Syria.  Oh and all evidence points to the US tacitly supporting ISIS to advance the goal of overthrowing Assad.  </p>

<p>If the tables were turned and it was Russia committing these sort of atrocities would you praise the US for challenging Russia hegemony? Because that is what Russia is doing.</p>

<p>Do you feel the same way about US relations with Saudi Arabia and Israel, two countries with right wing dictators known to support terrorism, or just Russia, a country that has fought against terrorism? </p>

<p>Russia isn&#39;t in the Crimea because of the plight of some Russians there. They have entered Ukraine to 1. Have a warm water port and 2. Destabilise Ukraine to prevent it from joining NATO after the Russian puppet president was ousted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I and many other people are well aware of these conflicts due to the free press. Once again, stop trying to draw an equivalence between a press with a varying spectrum of political biases and the completely state run media of Russia. The Russian people find out nothing from their own news other than what the state allows. Do I think media does enough to publicise conflicts worldwide? Probably not but it comes down to what they think people are interested in finding out about. Most people in the US are interested in finding out what happens in their own state, not conflicts half way around the world (which is a shame). Fortunately if they are interested enough they can find these things out. They can be involved in the political process through democracy to change these things. In Russia, where no democracy exists, even if people do find out about the injustices of their own government they can do nothing. You&#39;ve tried to deny politically motivated murder by the Russian state which is genuinely laughable. Criticising Russia&#39;s actions is not justifying the US which has a lot to answer for. Thousands of people have died in the conflict in Ukraine since 2013. It is equivalent as all of it is wrong. Listing ways in which the US has acted appallingly doesn&#39;t justify the dictatorship/oligarchy of Russia. I&#39;ve never defended the US, you have consistently defended Russia and put any criticism of Russia down to media bias. That is not the discussion of a person who is being objective. You are against US foreign policy and ok with Russian domestic and foreign policy. &#39;Crimea conflict is ok because Russians live there, Putin doesn&#39;t sanction political murder and hasn&#39;t destroyed democracy it&#39;s just media that says that&#39; is your line.

    <div class="md"><p>Born and raised in the US.</p>

<p>I must&#39;ve been unclear. I certainly am not defending Russia. I don&#39;t know if the murders were politically motivated but I&#39;m not denying they were. If you asked a Russian, they might say the JFK assassination was a politically motivated inside job. And they might be right. Either way, the point is that it&#39;s difficult to wade through the propaganda at times. </p>

<p>Russians also might point out how police in the US treat African Americans. Or how the US has 20% of the world prison population (the most in the world). Or how 25% of children in the US live in poverty. Or how the corporate media in the US only advances the interests of the rich and doesn&#39;t address important issues.</p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not defending Russia. It just seems to me that countries like Saudi Arabia and Israel have far worse domestic policies so why isn&#39;t there any discussion of them? I find the criticism of Russia to be mind numbingly hypocritical considering all the destruction caused by the US in the world and all the problems in our own country. But it makes sense: if you focus on the &quot;other,&quot; like the US media does with Russia, and Russia media probably does with the US, then it distracts from their own shortcomings, like racism, prison, healthcare, war, and poverty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree with most of your points here. I think you need to look up the history of Russia directly after the fall of the USSR to understand what has happened to their politics. A massive scramble for the countries resources by effectively a group of gang leaders who are now the oligarchs that Putin has to keep on side to maintain power. At least some semblance of democracy and free press exists in the US and acknowledging that does not minimise the massive problems that the country has created around the world and at home. The founding fathers warned against the power of corporations because the end game is the Russia of today. An economy stripped of its former strength by a group of people who maintain their power through intimidation and propaganda. &#39;War is a racket&#39; is an excellent book discussing the injustices of the US abroad and well worth reading. I&#39;m not ignoring that when I talk about Russia in this way, but it is naive to dismiss Russia as their oligarchy is supportive of what the US could become if left unchecked by its people. The only way to make sure the US acts in a more just way is to recognise the dangers facing all countries and understand how they came to be that way. As a final note Stalin has began to feature heavily in state propaganda in Russia recently as he reflects a period of time that Putin would like to emulate. That tells you everything of what is happening in that country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right. I&#39;m an accountant. So doing my own math based on $59k median wage in America, single filer, with full IRA contribution @ $5500. This means AGI 53,500 (AGI determines your bracket)</p>

<p>Proposed plan: take the new standard deduction of  $12,200 (single filer, single dependent(me)), I am at $41,300 taxable income. Effective tax rate of 7.9% and $4656 in taxes paid.</p>

<p>Compared with current based on same income and dependents. A deduction granted of standard 6350 plus personal 4050. I am at 43,100 taxable income. Effective tax rate is 11.0% and $6514 in taxes paid.</p>

<p>Thats a win for me, if they pass the bill. Of course, every individuals tax situation is different, but if you already don&#39;t have enough deductions to even itemize(can only itemize if you can claim more deductions than standard), I can almost guarantee you personally will have <strong>more money</strong> in your pocket and less taxes paid federally. As the standard deduction increase will see you pay less in taxes.</p>

<p>You can do the math and see for yourself <a href="https://www.calcxml.com/calculators/trump-tax-reform-calculator?skn=#top">here</a> and a link to 2017 calculator to compare is also included. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enough money to afford the increased premium costs from medical insurance? Because, frankly, that’s bullshit.</p>

<p>The numbers don’t actually matter, even though they really should, because that individual mandate repeal alone means the <em>existence</em> of my health insurance is in jeopardy. It is the single most important financial mechanism in my life. More money in my pocket is <strong>meaningless</strong> to me if it comes at the cost of increased premiums. There is no arguing that those premiums are going to rise, and will certainly outstrip any gains I’m getting here.</p>

<p>I could die, dude. Emergency room visits do <em>not</em> treat cancer. It treats the symptoms until you die of systemic issues.</p>

<p>This is the crux of my argument. You <em>cannot</em> seperate the politics from the numbers. You cannot seperate systemic issues from specific issues. The tax break the corporations just got will not translate into more money for the working class. This pittance of a benefit just laid out by yourself, comes at the cost of more financial squeezing in basically every area of life <em>not</em> directly related to taxes. It will not provide a net benefit, and for uncommon cases like mine, could be a direct attack on my health.</p>

<p>This left vs right crap is a big part of the problem.</p>

<p>If your perspective wasn&#39;t so compromised by your hatred of Trump the sentence would have read something closer to &quot;My argument is that the modern <del>Republican Party</del> <em>political system</em> is irredeemably corrupt and <del>Trump</del> <em>money in politics</em> is a symptom of that disease.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it’s mostly the Republicans.</p>

<p>The Democrats have many of the same problems but the voting records show they consistently vote in favor of public benefit. It’s astonishing to see the numbers, really. I had no idea it was so clear-cut until this last election cycle.</p>

<p>A moderate opinion is not intrinsically a more accurate one. A moderate opinion is just as at risk for bias that an extreme one.</p>

<p>I don’t even disagree with you, really. Political polarization lies at the heart of most political inefficacy these days, and the system itself is broken by money in politics.</p>

<p>But The Democrats are leagues ahead of The Republicans and it is in short because Democrats don’t elect men like Donald Trump. He is a man worth hating, and pitying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I was expecting from this headline, but the actual correction was that Trump ordered Flynn to contact the Russians as <em>president-elect</em>, not as a <em>candidate</em>.

<p>That&#39;s a critical difference because this &quot;mistake&quot; makes it seem like this was the first piece of &quot;evidence&quot; linking Trump to the Russia conspiracy nonsense regarding the election, which obviously couldn&#39;t be true about anything that happened after the election was over.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to misleading the FBI about conversations he had with Russia’s ambassador to the United States.</p>

<p>His guilty plea marks an escalation of the special counsel’s probe into Trump campaign ties to Russia, and also corroborates anonymously-sourced media reports about Flynn’s contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.</p>

<p>Flynn said he is cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, though it&#39;s unclear at this stage where his contribution might lead.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, Flynn’s charging document puts several facts we’ve been tracking on more solid ground:
Flynn talked sanctions with Russian ambassador</p>

<p>In the waning days of his presidency, Barack Obama responded on Dec. 29 to Russia’s interference in the U.S. election by issuing sanctions and ejecting 35 Russian diplomats.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, as president-elect Donald Trump readied for his inauguration, the Washington Post reported that Flynn and Kislyak had spoken by phone on or around the day sanctions were handed down. (The Post later reported that Flynn had been warned in November that Kislyak’s conversations &quot;were almost certainly being monitored by U.S. intelligence agencies.&quot;)</p>

<p>The Flynn-Kislyak conversation raised questions about whether Flynn had undercut Obama’s move against Moscow, particularly after Russian President Vladimir Putin declined to retaliate.</p>

<p>In the days after the Post revealed the Flynn-Kislyak phone call, key members of the Trump transition team, including White House press secretary Sean Spicer, Vice President Mike Pence and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, denied that sanctions came up during the conversation. Flynn also denied this to the Washington Post.</p>

<p>But Flynn’s guilty plea removes any lingering doubt about whether sanctions figured into his discussion with the Russian ambassador.</p>

<p>The charging document reveals that on or about Dec. 29, Flynn asked Kislyak to &quot;refrain from escalating the situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed on Russia that same day.&quot; The document also reveals that Kislyak told Flynn that Russia &quot;had chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of his request.&quot; (See the full charging document here.)</p>

<p>What it does show is that he apparently didn&#39;t lie to cover up any crime. It&#39;s not illegal to speak to foreign diplomats after the election is over and before inauguration. Obama was upset about this because he felt the incoming administration was undermining him in his final months, which is a fair complaint, but not illegal.</p>

<p>what I never seen mentioned is how the fbi proved flynn lied.</p>

<p>Seems that they caught flynn in a lie from back when Obama approved the wiretap for manafort. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no thats not what I&#39;m saying at all. flynn admitted lying to the fbi because they revealed to him that they had proof he lied from their wiretaps. </p>

<p>Mueller has long given up trying to prove that there was any &quot;collusion&quot; between trump officials and russians before the election. Everything they are talking about happened in December.</p>

<p>Now, the case has pivoted to trying to show trump obstructed justice  related to comey and flynn - not actually colluding.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still looking for a source that I saw a couple days ago about your last point. It basically said that they were surprised flynn was only charged with lying. Because typically, even with a plea deal, they like to have all those other charges &quot;on the books&quot; because by pleading guilty to multiple charges, they can still give him a short sentence for cooperating, but by having those other charges &quot;on the books&quot; it helps them proceed with their further targets </p>

<p>Yep, this is how the corrupt FBI will strongarm anyone into compliance. They don&#39;t ask you questions to find out information - they already know all the answers, they just want to get you to trip up. Lying to a federal agent is a crime, but they don&#39;t have to prove intent or willfulness (unlike perjury) - if you get a question wrong, they have a bargaining chip so they can force you to either get someone else to incriminate themself (doing their dirty work for them) or they&#39;ll throw you in federal prison.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, where&#39;s your proof that Flynn is throwing people under the bus to save himself?  Every article you linked says &quot;the FBI has enough evidence to bring charges against Flynn and this and this person&quot;  Except for Flynn, all speculations by the way.  Your articles say Flynn will fully cooperate fully with FBI.  How does that translate to Flynn will rat out the entire administration?  </p>

<p>Just take a look at the name of the second article.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Flynn&#39; lawyers cut off communication with Trump&#39;s, indicating a plea deal or a negotiation of plea deal</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s pure speculation.  The truth is, they have no idea why Flynn pleaded guilty.  </p>

<p>The point is this.  Flynn was fired just 24 days into his cabinet position for lying.  So no surprise that the lie was told to the FBI and VP and was caught for it.  Flynn&#39;s charges are for lying about to the FBI about the meetings AFTER Trump was elected.  Again, there&#39;s no crime in talking to the Russians.    Especially about how to stop ISIS.  It&#39;s that he lied about it that is the crime.  Truthfully?  I don&#39;t know why he lied about that when he could have told the truth and be perfectly okay.  So we shall see how this plays out in the coming days.  If Donald Jr or Kushner gets indicted, then you will have the last laugh.  I personally think all this is BS.  All three people who lied to the FBI, Manafort, Papadapoulus, and Flynn have been arrested.  We&#39;ve known about these 3 for months now.  Funny thing is, all of them, (not sure about Papad.) were fired immediately as soon as they were found to be fishy by Trump.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand what&#39;s going on at all. We know for certain that Russia interfered with our election. We know this because independent cyber intel groups have documented GRU-made code used for several hacking incidences in Ukraine, among other places, was also used to hack the DNC. This is only disputed by the ultra-dipshits and denialists. Did the Trump campaign have a hand in that? Not likely. That&#39;s not what anyone is even claiming.</p>

<p>What appears more evident with each passing day is that our fucking president is under the thumb of Putin. And Putin wants nothing more than to see American living standards drop through the floor. He wants AMerica to suffer, like Russia has for so long. And he wants to see the rise of the Soviet empire again. </p>

<p>You&#39;re aware that the POTUS hasn&#39;t effected the sanctions back on Russia--even though Congress forcibly passed them, right? Why would that be? Nothing to do with the fucking election. You&#39;re also aware that the conversation General Flynn lied to the FBI about was directly about Russian sanctions, right? This isn&#39;t news to you, is it? </p>

<p>Are you starting to understand why it doesn&#39;t matter if Trump was elected or not? This entire fiasco isn&#39;t just about interference in the election, it&#39;s about continuing Russian influence in our policies and functions of federal institutions, national security, economics and foreign relations. Do you think it was fucking coincidence that Rex Tillerson received the highest official honor a foreigner can get directly from Putin himself, gets appointed to the head of the State Department? And then immediately cuts the budget of that department by 27%? </p>

<p>You think it&#39;s a coincidence that Trump can&#39;t seem to get himself to actually impose the sanctions which have already been legally instituted on his best friend in Russia? Why do you think Trump hasn&#39;t levied those sanctions yet? </p>

<p>It must be convenient to wear blinders all day, every day, but it certainly doesn&#39;t help you in a conversation about the real world. Try reading something outside your media echo chamber.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I read all this shit to find out that they even admit they don&#39;t know exactly what this group is. </p>

<p>&quot;But are the Dukes a team or a department inside a government agency? An external contractor? A criminal gang selling to the highest bidder? A group of tech-savvy patriots? We don’t know&quot;</p>

<p>Beyond this the only data they have on the groups are the select situations that their activities we&#39;re revealed. The toilets that are used could even be the result of the original becoming open source and it getting modified over and over by multiple people. </p>

<p>They point to their Russian assumption based on the type of targets they know of. The problem with that is, how many targets we&#39;re unknown?. </p>

<p>The high level security that these specific types of targets would have allows for those targets to notice the threat. Without the ability to detect the threat then it is not reported. There could be a thousand targets that do not lead to the same conclusion which have never been seen. </p>

<p>Ultimately just as I have stated there has been zero evidence proving that the russian government hacked the DNC or podesta emails. </p>

<p>Does the Russian government have groups of hackers actively working to collect data from the West? Fucking obviously....anyone who didn&#39;t know this is a damn idiot. The west is also doing the exact same thing to them. </p>

<p>The facts are that these kinds of tools often get released and used outside of their origins. Just a few months back a massive amount of the cia&#39;s hacking toolset was dumped out into the world. Literally Russians or Chinese or any other nations gained access to the cia&#39;s tools and could easily use those tools to make it looked like an American source hacked someone. </p>

<p>Nailing something like this down to specific people and groups is basically impossible. That is why everyone with any common sense will state we don&#39;t know shit about who hacked what.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an appropriate place for the application of some Bayesian logic: is it more likely that insiders in the DNC got a hold of some hacking code from this unknown group (which used their hacking code in Ukraine) or that a Russian element had a hand in that hacking? </p>

<p>Or, are you proposing a third scenario in which the DNC worked with Russian intelligence to shoot themselves in the foot? I propose this not because it&#39;s reasonable, but because people who have no use for logic or reason would be tempted to make this seem like a justified alternative--if not because their morons, because it helps to muddy these waters.</p>

<p>This is the realm of a fallacy called a &quot;lack of understanding&quot;, better named a <em>&quot;pretended lack of understanding&quot;</em> in which the interlocutor (you) pretend you have no idea what a reasonable scenario would be, hence all theories are equal to you. It might be that the Chinese hacked the DNC, right? Or the Iranians. Why not? We can&#39;t name this group, so it <em>might</em> be. </p>

<p>Of course, that&#39;s a lot of pretending to be stupid. F-Secure isn&#39;t naming the GRU because they don&#39;t want to appear like a political group. They have money on the line--as a private company. But they&#39;re sure dropping a lot of hints in that paper you skimmed.</p>

<p>This is one of those scenarios where you just have to put together all the available data and ask &quot;what is most reasonable?&quot; In this case, the most likely answers are that a dedicated GRU hacking unit--the same group that had its hands in the Russian invasion of Crimea--hacked the DNC as well as servers in WI, MI, OH, and a few other states voting rolls. Not the Chinese, not the Iranians, not Seth Rich--as much as you&#39;d love to believe that.</p>

<p>This is simply false. There certainly is evidence. That&#39;s what that whole paper was about. You just equivocate about the lack of certainty.

<p>Why are you hedging? The best evidence available, which has been compiled through a thorough forensic data analysis points to a Russian state-run operation. </p>

<p>Let me ask you this: if there had been a thorough forensic data analysis that pointed to a DNC &quot;inside job&quot; hack, but no one could put their finger on the actual culprit, would you be saying &quot;it&#39;s not necessarily an inside job, because they can&#39;t name the person.&quot;? No, you wouldn&#39;t. You&#39;d be touting the analysis as <em>proof</em> of the Seth Rich garbage theory.</p>

<p>But because this work points a finger squarely at the Russian GRU, and that, in turn provides a route to implicating our dear leader in possibly a very serious crime, and you have all your eggs in the Trump basket, you can&#39;t see the forest for the trees. You are emotionally attached, and hence you refuse to connect the dots on what is essentially a connection between Putin and Trump. What the precise nature of that relationship is, is unclear at this point, but being a political realist, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s about money and power. Whose money? Whose power? We will see. You, it seems, will still be saying it&#39;s a rouse when the actual indictments come down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No doubt it&#39;s hard to prove one or another group did something for sure, but for sure, we can narrow down the suspects to either: Russian GRU or someone who wanted it to look like GRU. Your hedging is unnecessary. The real question is how does the Russian hacking operation work? Did GRU hire a contractor (not likely, because of known state structure) or was in all in-house? </p>

<p>We don&#39;t &quot;know&quot; the answers to these questions, but we have a pretty good guess. You&#39;re making it seem like we have no idea. That&#39;s simply not true. We have a damn good idea it was GRU because of the forensic analysis done by F-Secure among others. We also have the word of 3 US intel agencies who have no political affiliation that it was a Russian source. But you discount them too, eh?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean this comment reads like it has come straight out of the Kremlin. It&#39;s laughable that you can rightly criticise US foreign policy and yet defend Russia FP. The double standard really shows your complete and utter bias. Russia isn&#39;t in Syria out of the goodness of their hearts or to fight ISIS, they want to maintain the Assad regime that has been committing war crimes against its on people because they are allies of Putin. </p>

<p>Russia isn&#39;t in the Crimea because of the plight of some Russians there. They have entered Ukraine to 1. Have a warm water port and 2. Destabilise Ukraine to prevent it from joining NATO after the Russian puppet president was ousted. </p>

<p>Stop trying to draw an equivalence between a biased media that sensationalises and distorts with a Russian media that is entirely controlled by state messaging. </p>

<p>Stop trying to draw an equivalence between elections that are corrupted by foreign influence, voter suppression and out of control lobbying with the sham elections that are entirely directed by the Russian state.</p>

<p>Stop trying to draw an equivalence between the heavy influence of corporations on policy and the greed of politicians with a few people controlling and stealing the resources of an entire country to the extent that the economy has been destroyed off the back of it.</p>

<p>Your whole comment is embarrassingly biased and ignorant.</p>
