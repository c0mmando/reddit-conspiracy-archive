       Lol yeah ok let’s rush the White House , you don’t think much before you post do you ,  if you did you would realize you sound like a ridiculous 14 year old that believes things can be solved with more chaos , you’re probably very young with little to no experience in life and think strong arming the federal government is going to get you answers and closure to things you will never understand. Your post is ridiculous

       My counter argument is , you’re an idiot and I stand by that . The problem here is you don’t want to be disagreed with so you resort to down votes and unrealistic arguments that have no bearing on anything , sad for me ? Lol I’m not the one posting unrealistic solutions “get together a massive group of people on walk onto the White House “ ( you should proof read before posting) your a little kid looking for validation in the wrong place , go try Facebook you might find some like minded fuck sticks such as your self willing to larp some sjw with you.

       HMMMMM you are like sweet nectar for me. I am not gonna proof read because it upset your fragile sense. Get over yourself, more importantly go fuck yourself. You still have not offered a counter argument only insults. You are literally on the side of being kept in the dark. BTW I haven't down-voted these comments.

      <p>
       More importantly who taught you how to interact with people? "little kid looking for validation in the wrong place". who says shit like that. You really think some made up psychological bullshit is relevant to this discussion. YOU ARE NOT USEFUL TO THIS DEBATE. Keep pestering, but when you finally have a valid talking point I'll be here.

       Have you ever read history? French revolution? The Romans? You know that you have two legs, and they walk right?

       So since you're very simple point is "very unrealistic" I will do my best to help you understand.

       Reality is outside of your computer. It is how you receive nourishment, reproduce, and take major steps in your life. Which means that sometimes we have to stop trolling on our toys, and take action.

      <p>
       I get this is hard for you, I really do. Your whole life you have been neglected, and told this can't be done. That people can't make real change. I am here to give you a better option. A new way of thinking.

      <p>
       meanwhile you attack the wrong part of this debate, My integrity. Which is always open for debate, but is not the current topic. Point is I can see you are happy in complacency, but I see other commenting. I see people who are tired of the lies. I speak to them, and one lucky day to you as well.

       They will not shoot 200 people. Not if we are live streaming etc. See we have the tech to do something. Disney literally capitalizes on our ability to explore a topic for entertainment. We just need to use the same methods we use when we go out of our way for stupid tv crap.

       They wouldn't cover it up. They would call it what it was, an attack on the White House by a large, but poorly organized group. The group would probably be labeled a cult on a suicide mission.

       They don't have to shoot everyone with actual bullets either. There are no shortage of methods to quickly neutralize a group of people.

       I like the forethought here, so let me counter. With live streaming, and public videos of the groups intent. Along with hopefully some national coverage. At what point does the public believe their story? I mean the majority of Americans don't even believe the Vegas story. So They are not that amazing at cover ups clearly. Otherwise giant groups questioning 9/11 would not exist.

       The public may even believe their story, but I think you'll still end up with a lot of people that think that it may not be the best way to go about it, or the ones pretty sure that nothing of value is hidden at the White House, or the ones that figure anything of value is going to be physically impractical to reach, or the ones with moral concerns about hurting their fellow citizens, or the ones that are afraid to die or think it's not worth it, or the ones that worried about the state of The State after a mass uprising but most just won't care.

      <p>
       Not sure if you've ever looked into
       <a href="https://www.marxist.com/kashmir-four-months-of-a-mass-uprising.htm">
        Kashmir

       I see your point, and if they see it coming they could hide anything. However they can't hide tunnels hidden in DC, and white house is just one location. I think public investigation of multiple locations is needed at this point. I would counter the Kashmir with the actions of Tienanmen square. In the end the effort at the least would show the public still can take action. Even if it makes someone a martyr. I am willing to die to prove that point.

       Again the majority of people distrust this government. They don't agree with the official stories of 9/11, or Vegas. Let alone americas role in the middle east. Even countries outside of our country debate our authenticity.

       I think finding out for yourself what is real and what is fake,  and then collaborating with other people in a way that is peaceful and sincere,  not condescending or forceful,  is just as important.  Many people do not have access to truthful and non biased information.

       Agreed, but combining to outnumber them is something as well. I was at the women’s march (not to bring partisan politics into this) and the amount of people there was staggering. If we marched on every single city demanding the right we haven’t had, that’s where you illicit real change

       What would be the point? We know they're all evil, nobody needs to prove that to us, our life is proof enough. You think they'll stand trial for enslavement of humanity? That's worth a lol. There will always be people who try to control us but they ultimately can't take away the most important thing which is that true peace is found within our mind, not any amount of money or power can change that. They may try as they do to condition us to forget that fact, but if you allow yourself to be conditioned it's on you. There's never gonna be a grand finale, it's an ongoing cycle that will continue. Good and evil pushing and pulling each other. I don't think one side will win in the end but who knows, better to be on the good side because it's healthier.

       I like the ethical counter point, and yes true happiness is found in self. Not in outside material items. However they are poisoning the people, and hurting the innocent. We shine a light to disperse darkness. Not that I imagine a world void of it, but I want to give everyone a chance to live with the pursuit of happiness.

       I know it's a shame for sure the amount of poison we're fed in our lives, mental and chemical, but even so we still have the capacity for self awareness. Awareness is the crucial factor; some people choose to live unhealthily because they are unaware of the effects which leads to less awareness and so on. Acts of violence or calls to arms aren't the answer. They'll always spin it into some terroristic plot or something and everything will continue as planned. You can't use their own system against them because they own it and control it. All that can be done is to spread self awareness. If we stop letting them have our time and energy, then their influence will be stopped. How to spread this awareness on a collective level? Idk, but starting at the individual level seems to be the only thing really.

       Okay, but your statement "You can't use their own system against them because they own it and control it" defeats your overall point. We stop drinking our water supply, and we die. I never said we hurt anyone in my actions, and the reality is what are able to turn to? You are 1000% right on people still making the wrong choices. However they wont know better, unless the public shows them what is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       They suppress that info because it would show the hard truth. The one you and i want the public to know. I hate to say this, but at this point in history we need this.

       Everything has it's season. Even death. Even winter. It is in the nature of reality to end, and begin. Which calls for massive movements, like an large earthquake to change our ground.

        what are we able to turn to?
Ourselves, that's it. You can't force someone to see something they don't want to see, it's really frustrating I know.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They suppress info that they don't want us knowing about, but what were the origins of that info? The individual human mind, something we all have. This knowledge is within us already, that's why the awareness is so key. Someone could read an ancient text full of vital info but if they lack awareness, it would do no good and likely wouldn't make sense to that person.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree about the nature of the seasons and change, it's a continuing cycle. I just don't think that a massive march of frustrated humans would do any good for anything. Instead, I would say that a massive group of self aware people doing nothing would be a much better way.

       The knowledge is within us, but precious metals etc are not. Since you are on this sub reddit I am to assume you have heard of scientist you are murdered, bought out, or threatened to show methods of free energy. Again these tactics require action.

       The government puts out regulations that should over all not exist, and men have been jailed for wind turbines etc. We are not free to do the actions you are suggesting. I hope that point is very clear, because I 100% agree with your ethical standing.

       I like the forethought here, so let me counter. With live streaming, and public videos of the groups intent. Along with hopefully some national coverage. At what point does the public believe their story? I mean the majority of Americans don't even believe the Vegas story. So They are not that amazing at cover ups clearly. Otherwise giant groups questioning 9/11 would not exist.
