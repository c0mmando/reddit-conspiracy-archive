<p>The public may even believe their story, but I think you&#39;ll still end up with a lot of people that think that it may not be the best way to go about it, or the ones pretty sure that nothing of value is hidden at the White House, or the ones that figure anything of value is going to be physically impractical to reach, or the ones with moral concerns about hurting their fellow citizens, or the ones that are afraid to die or think it&#39;s not worth it, or the ones that worried about the state of The State after a mass uprising but most just won&#39;t care.</p>

<p>Not sure if you&#39;ve ever looked into <a href="https://www.marxist.com/kashmir-four-months-of-a-mass-uprising.htm">Kashmir</a> before, but you get a glimpse of a prolonged and unsuccessful uprising. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point, and if they see it coming they could hide anything. However they can&#39;t hide tunnels hidden in DC, and white house is just one location. I think public investigation of multiple locations is needed at this point. I would counter the Kashmir with the actions of Tienanmen square. In the end the effort at the least would show the public still can take action. Even if it makes someone a martyr. I am willing to die to prove that point. </p>

You think they&#39;ll stand trial for enslavement of humanity? That&#39;s worth a lol. There will always be people who try to control us but they ultimately can&#39;t take away the most important thing which is that true peace is found within our mind, not any amount of money or power can change that. They may try as they do to condition us to forget that fact, but if you allow yourself to be conditioned it&#39;s on you. There&#39;s never gonna be a grand finale, it&#39;s an ongoing cycle that will continue. Good and evil pushing and pulling each other.

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s a shame for sure the amount of poison we&#39;re fed in our lives, mental and chemical, but even so we still have the capacity for self awareness. Awareness is the crucial factor; some people choose to live unhealthily because they are unaware of the effects which leads to less awareness and so on. Acts of violence or calls to arms aren&#39;t the answer. They&#39;ll always spin it into some terroristic plot or something and everything will continue as planned. You can&#39;t use their own system against them because they own it and control it. All that can be done is to spread self awareness. If we stop letting them have our time and energy, then their influence will be stopped. How to spread this awareness on a collective level? Idk, but starting at the individual level seems to be the only thing really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, but your statement &quot;You can&#39;t use their own system against them because they own it and control it&quot; defeats your overall point. We stop drinking our water supply, and we die. I never said we hurt anyone in my actions, and the reality is what are able to turn to? You are 1000% right on people still making the wrong choices. However they wont know better, unless the public shows them what is going on. </p>

<p>They suppress that info because it would show the hard truth. The one you and i want the public to know. I hate to say this, but at this point in history we need this.</p>

<p>Everything has it&#39;s season. Even death. Even winter. It is in the nature of reality to end, and begin. Which calls for massive movements, like an large earthquake to change our ground. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t consider water to be part of their system, bottled water yeah, but you can get it from other sources like natural wells if you look.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what are we able to turn to?
Ourselves, that&#39;s it. You can&#39;t force someone to see something they don&#39;t want to see, it&#39;s really frustrating I know. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They suppress info that they don&#39;t want us knowing about, but what were the origins of that info? The individual human mind, something we all have. This knowledge is within us already, that&#39;s why the awareness is so key. Someone could read an ancient text full of vital info but if they lack awareness, it would do no good and likely wouldn&#39;t make sense to that person.</p>

<p>I agree about the nature of the seasons and change, it&#39;s a continuing cycle. I just don&#39;t think that a massive march of frustrated humans would do any good for anything. Instead, I would say that a massive group of self aware people doing nothing would be a much better way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The knowledge is within us, but precious metals etc are not. Since you are on this sub reddit I am to assume you have heard of scientist you are murdered, bought out, or threatened to show methods of free energy. Again these tactics require action. </p>

<p>The government puts out regulations that should over all not exist, and men have been jailed for wind turbines etc. We are not free to do the actions you are suggesting. I hope that point is very clear, because I 100% agree with your ethical standing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol yeah ok let’s rush the White House , you don’t think much before you post do you ,  if you did you would realize you sound like a ridiculous 14 year old that believes things can be solved with more chaos , you’re probably very young with little to no experience in life and think strong arming the federal government is going to get you answers and closure to things you will never understand. Your post is ridiculous </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the forethought here, so let me counter. With live streaming, and public videos of the groups intent. Along with hopefully some national coverage. At what point does the public believe their story? I mean the majority of Americans don&#39;t even believe the Vegas story. So They are not that amazing at cover ups clearly. Otherwise giant groups questioning 9/11 would not exist. </p>
