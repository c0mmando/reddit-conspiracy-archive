       If you pay enough attention you'll notice patterns. And there seems to be about a half dozen posters who stick around permanently and agitate. They never engage in any meaningful debate, they just hurl personal insults and one sentence snarky comments that attempt to make people feel stupid.

       There's a pretty good way to point out some of these people, all you need to do is go into any non-Trump related thread and CTRL-F for a number of desparate attempts to inject "Trump" into the conversation rather than discuss the topic at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same goes for Hillary on non-Clinton related posts but the former is far more prevalent, they all suck for what it's worth.

       Hillary is also a piece of trash. She is like a badly programmed robot. There’s not point in talking about her because she couldn’t even win a goddam election against an incompetent moron.

       There was a difference between Bush and Obama. Both were crappy overall like all American presidents, but one was better than the other.

      <p>
       I think the deep state chose Trump because they could embolden the wealth gap. They didn’t choose Clinton because the trump supporters whom were most fervent would probably kill people with the guns they’ve been stockpiling since obama put everyone in fema camps

       There are some areas where liberals would have preferred her version of corruption. I'd rather still have net neutrality, corporate regulations related to the environment, and a liberal SC justice. I know she's corrupt, but so is Trump. At least with Hillary, we'd be getting some liberal policies. The same way Trump is pushing conservative policies.

       I can’t understand why she is still in the spotlight at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       She’s not in power, retired from politics, is no more or less corrupt than the majority of other US politicians. Every time places like this sub bring her up the circle jerk of hate commences. But then no one understands why this sub isn’t taken seriously.

       If anything, their fixation on her makes her more powerful than any news outlet. She’s their boogeyman. I can’t wrap my brain around it.

       I hear more about her from non supporters than anyone else. In fact I think I
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       hear about her from her critics. Politicians should certainly have their feet held to the fire, but she usually seems to pop up in a whatabout or deflection context.

       That's it. Republicans control the presidency, the house, the senate, so who is the necessary enemy? They need one.

       Yesterday, literally all, the news outlets had Flynn's plea on their front page and FoxNews had a story on Hillary up there for over a half hour until they changed to a story about Flynn.

       Someone recently did some numbers on Sean Hannity 'covering' Hillary, and - don't quote me on the exact numbers here - it was something like, over the 100 days of this past summer, he led with a Hillary story 83 of those days. (Again, don't quote my numbers; they're certainly not exact, I'm going from memory.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The fixation is because you need an enemy in order to keep people rallying and focused on something other than negative news about your own side. Give people someone to hate and they're easier to lead around by the nose.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let's face it, Hillary is
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       easy to hate. She's an easy target, so the Hannitys and Trumps of the world go on autopilot and invoke her name whenever they can to fire up their base, despite the fact that she's been rendered largely irrelevant by her loss.
      </p>
      <p>
       And
       <em>
        that's
       </em>
       the key: she's irrelevant. Unlike, say,
       <em>
        the sitting president
       </em>
       , she wields no real power and is in no position to make decisions that impact not just the country, but the entire globe. The only reason to focus on her is because there is a need for someone to hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       When she was still in power that was another story. Slam her all day long. But to still be fixated even now?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's over, Sean &amp; co. You won. Why are you still acting like you're losing?

       Most Dems on here aren't bringing her up at all. She's irrelevant in the party now, so we're moving on. It's conservatives on here that are obsessed with her and Obama. Seems like they're both mostly used as a distraction now.

       These "redditors" really like to give Hilary Clinton a free pass because she's not in office anymore.

       She's not "significant" anymore so we shouldn't worry about her past deeds.

       It's a distraction to constantly focus on her even though she's done extremely questionable things.

       Yeah I hate both. I get called a Hillary and DNC shill all the time, but I really don't like/care about her. I just hate Trump as well and recognize she can't do anything but go on talk shows and make comments to news papers and Trump can literally order the extermination of human life via nukes. Every one who said something bad about Trump doesn't mean they're a Hillary supporter. It just means we don't obsess over a 70 year old lady who has literally zero influence or impacts on our personal lives.

       yea i'm sure you'd like for us to stop talking about 2 people responsible for more war crimes than bush, bill, bush, reagan, carter, ford, and nixon combined. just today it came out that one of the guys investigating trump was fired for sending anti-trump texts and that he was a key player in the sham investigation against hillary last year. there's your russian collusion story lmao.

       Right. As the current POTUS steal money right out of your mom's pockets and puts the bill on our kids and their kids, and institutes Putin's dream agenda, you think it's more important to talk about a has-been corporatist piece of shit with no power and no influence on our lives.

       No...what? You don't want that to be true? Doesn't matter. The fact remains, no one else gives a feathered fuck about HRC. The only people bringing her up are Trump defenders and anti-American cunts.

       you know what sucks? there's an actual goddamn conspiracy, about backchannel conversations in isolated islands, about sanctions not enacted, about dissidents falling off of roofs in Russia, about secret payments to subsidiaries in the Cayman islands, about an unelected advisor holding the highest security clearance in the land, about .. about .. so much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       and yet, r/conspiracy, of all the places is seemingly blind to it.

       yea this is exactly what r/politics sounds like to a t. i've actually made posts quite a few times about how they name drop our subreddit like this in the last sentence of their comments on their subreddit which inevitably leads to a lot of brigading on here.

       Yes that's the corporate neoliberal narrative. So is that the conspiracy or is the conspiracy about why they're leading us to believe those things?

       In my experience it's always a good idea to at least question the mainstream media propaganda.
