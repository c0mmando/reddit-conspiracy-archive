       Evolution is a complete lie. Nature itself is a fractal. Why would you be any different?  The earth is not evolving. The earth is actually a fractal of their original sources. Look into the Mandelbrot Set to begin to understand what a fractal is, then dig deeper. Everything about evolution is b.s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Approximate fractals found in nature display self-similarity over extended, but finite, scale ranges. The connection between fractals and leaves, for instance, is currently being used to determine how much carbon is contained in trees.

       Modeled fractals may be sounds, digital images, electrochemical patterns, circadian rhythms, etc. Fractal patterns have been reconstructed in physical 3-dimensional space and virtually, often called "in silico" modeling. Models of fractals are generally created using fractal-generating software that implements techniques such as those outlined above. As one illustration, trees, ferns, cells of the nervous system, blood and lung vasculature, and other branching patterns in nature can be modeled on a computer by using recursive algorithms and L-systems techniques. The recursive nature of some patterns is obvious in certain examples—a branch from a tree or a frond from a fern is a miniature replica of the whole: not identical, but similar in nature.

       There are plenty of easy examples in biology that show how simple structures can evolve to become more complex. I don't see how fractals disprove this.

       You don't know what evolution is. Evolution doesn't work towards a goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and evolution does include splitting in two too. One species can split into two sperate if the right external circumstances apply (ie separation of population through natural events).

       Sorry for being pedantic, but from my point of view there is no "unnatural event" as humans ar part of nature. But ok if you want to make that difference. Still it is an outside force to which a specific organism reacts. So even breeding a species is a form of evolution.

       Oh I didn't meant it like that. I wanted to write natural desasters first but revised to events because it doesn't need to be a disaster per se. Regular natural processes like erosion or continental drift are reasons for separation as well but not disasters.

       I think disasters do have e very big impact to the equation. A simple example is the end of the dinosaurs which happened due to a range of events, most famous of them was the asteroid impact but also a growing volcanic activity if i am not totally mistaken. This led to them dying out making room for our ancestors to evolve as they did. There have been many of these extinction events in earths history and all of them shaped life how it is today.

       I agree that large events will shake up the evolutionary tree and lead to a very different ecosystem
      </p>
      <p>
       I only wanted to point out that even small shifts in a landscape can lead to speciation too when two populations are separated over a long enough time and evolutionary pressure applies.

       Science states: Late in the period, the diapsid reptiles split into two main lineages, the archosaurs (ancestors of crocodiles and dinosaurs) and the lepidosaurs (predecessors of modern tuataras, lizards, and snakes). Both groups remained lizard-like and relatively small and inconspicuous during the Permian.
These animals fractured down different branches of animals. Just like in nature. Why would a reptile losing its legs be evolving? ridiculous.

       Simply because such a mutation might have given it an advantage in its environment leading to it being able to reproduce. Changes usually don't happen drastically like loosing legs from one generation to the other but gradually.

       Did I say evolution works towards a goal? 
Science states:
Late in the period, the diapsid reptiles split into two main lineages, the archosaurs (ancestors of crocodiles and dinosaurs) and the lepidosaurs (predecessors of modern tuataras, lizards, and snakes). Both groups remained lizard-like and relatively small and inconspicuous during the Permian.
      </p>
      <p>
       These animals fractured down different branches of animals. Just like in nature. Why would a reptile losing its legs be evolving? ridiculous.

       Yes this is evolution. Splitting into subspecies is evolution too.
      </p>
      <p>
       And losing features is part of evolution too. Isn't a whale losing his legs for fins evolution?
      </p>
      <p>
       Again evolution is neither directed to a goal nor does it have to become more complex. Natural selection might lead to losing a feature of a species if it helps survivability.

      <p>
       The only thing evolution describes is the process of adaption of a species to external pressure by natural selection.

      <p>
       Evolution doesn't care if legs are lost or gained, it doesn't care for flying or swimming as long as the next generation is more adapt at surviving then that last.

       Past research showed this ancient whale had large hips, which suggested it also had large hind legs.

       No a whales didn't have legs and grew fins. It was a gradual process for many generations that lead to a transfer from legs to fins through multiple species. That's why you find bones similar to our fingers and feet in today's whale's fins. Because whales are mammals like humans.

       The whale would be a fractal of a larger mammal of the past. So, we went from dinosaurs, to mammals growing hands, to losing hands, and growing fins? What would the possible evolutionary point of survival, or reproduction?

       But what would be the process of a whale becoming a fractal?
      </p>
      <p>
       First, whales didn't lose hands and gained fins. The hands and feet transformed to flippers of multiple generations and species.
      </p>
      <p>
       The benefit of gaining flippers would be a better suitability to aquatic life for a mammal. With flippers a whale can obtain food and sustenance more easily and doesn't have to expend as much energy as with hands and feet. This benefits survival.

       From what? That is how they were from their original fractal. You just said they still to this day have human looking hands. These animals were how they always were, and modern examples of evolution are vague, and easily explainable in other ways.

       I understand what your trying to say. That's not the problem. Season Lions would be a fractal down, then maybe otters, etc.

       Yes, but the species could split/fracture to different species resulting in the similarities of animals. The way science states dinosaurs split to crocodiles, lizards, birds, snakes, etc.

       Well why is there a human, then an a bunch of ape species, then smaller monkey species? Why does man differ so much? Apes are fractals of man, and monkeys are fractals of apes. Why is an ape an ape, and a man a man? Do we really have a scientific explanation for that? We are the more intelligent species. They are fractals of us. Why? Simply because we exist. Cause, and react effect. Does evolution really explain our difference between them? Not at all. They are just a lower species that exists from our existence.

       Apes and other animals "talk" to. Just because it isn't intelligible to us doesn't mean it isn't the case.

       Lots of animals use tools too. Some even use our machines for their purpose. Ravens drop nuts in front of cars at traffic lights to bust them open with our tires.

       We don't have fur or thick skin because our intelligence allowed us to expand to environments that should kill us. We don't need it. To ask why we have no fur is the same as asking why a lion has no tentacles.

       Ridiculous. I am speaking of language not stupid animal sounds. Yeah emotionally  animals can sense each other like talking, but you can't even compare it. You believe in evolution in a physical world, but man doesn't evolve through the physical world just his massive intelligence. That doesn't make sense. Why is man so ill equipped to handle the world, and rely  on his brain? We went from playing with sticks to flying machines. You name any other animal on earth that can compare.That is not evolution. Man didn't develop fur, but he killed animals and working them like fur. Why? If evolution is true we would of developed physical traits, and characteristics . We didn't. Our ancestors were "evolved" from were actually  more equipped to handle the earth. Man is not an animal, but has similarities to an animal.

       Simply because such a mutation might have given it an advantage in its environment leading to it being able to reproduce. Changes usually don't happen drastically like loosing legs from one generation to the other but gradually.

       There is no up and down, that's a human concept. In nature there is only survival or death. If a mutation is beneficial to survival it has good chances to stay. As simple as it is...

       I’m confused why you’re conflating a lizard having legs to evolving and a lizard losing legs to devolving.

       If the loss of legs provides an evolutionary advantage than it can be considered a success. Plenty of creatures survive just fine with no legs.

       Yes legless creatures do survive, but the point I'm trying to make is that it isn't a subconscious decision, or. mutation, but rather just a common ancestor, and the snake split from.  Evolution doesn't explain such a dramatic split into different forms of Life. That is why some animals have useless characteristics, and traits that benifet them in no way, but the traits are still there. Whale has hand
like features, snake with no legs, but previously had legs, animals that are Land , and water based like the sea lion which on land is useless. I'm saying these animals didn't evolve, but rather devolved from original sources. Whale-manatee- sea lion- otter, etc., or dinosaur- crocodiles -lizards-birds-snakes,etc. or even human-ape-money

       I think you're mistaking evolution with the idea that it's continuous 'improvement' on the earlier versions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution is simply the result of small changes in genetic make up over time. First changes are unexpected mutations of genes, which in most cases don't pose an advantage over non mutated versions. However, if the mutation was say in a colour pigment gene and that mutation was a colour provided better camouflage, then there is better chance of that mutation being passed on to offspring. Another example could be longer legs that aid in speed and agility to avoid a predator. With every 'Predator vs Prey' relationship in nature, you can see these evolutionary 'arms races' in action.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are actually concerned about keeping an open mind and questioning everything, read some material on the subject. The Richard Dawkins book "Greatest Show on Earth" goes into great detail on evolution and how it works. It very much helped me understand the concept more clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are viewing this from a religious point of view where you think that by accepting the fact of evolution it disproves the existence of god, that doesn't have to be the case. Instead you could view it as God equipped DNA with the ability to mutate and result in gradual changes over time, in order to let the universe constantly change and adapt in order to not require micromanaging. Just like he used fractals for creating crystals, horns, leaves or whatever your post is trying to say.

       I am getting nothing mixed up. I'm afraid you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       You believe in evolution in a physical world, but man doesn't evolve through the physical world just his massive intelligence. That doesn't make sense. Why is man so ill equipped to handle the world, and rely on his brain? We went from playing with sticks to flying machines. You name any other animal on earth that can compare.That is not evolution. Man didn't develop fur, but he killed animals and wore them like fur. Why? If evolution is true we would of developed physical traits, and characteristics . We didn't. Our ancestors we "evolved" from were actually more equipped to handle the earth. Man is not an animal, but has similarities to an animal.Surely, you don't believe all the great , vast different forms of Life on earth all share the same ancestor of some floating comb jelly. That is absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way science states that dinosaurs split into crocodiles, lizards, birds, snakes, etc. This isn't a process of evolving. These animals are similar , because they share a common bond from their original fractals. This is why you can't explain all animals traits as evolution from survival, or reproduction, but you can compare the animals from common ancestors, and where the fractals occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science states: Late in the period, the diapsid reptiles split into two main lineages, the archosaurs (ancestors of crocodiles and dinosaurs) and the lepidosaurs (predecessors of modern tuataras, lizards, and snakes). Both groups remained lizard-like and relatively small and inconspicuous during the Permian. These animals fractured down different branches of animals. Just like in nature. Why would a reptile losing its legs be evolving? ridiculous.
      </p>

       I know you like to think highly of yourself, but the earth isn't in a state of evolving, but rather devolving.

       I'm afraid I'm wasting my time with you but I'll try again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man does evolve through the physical world. Our lack of full body hair (ability to sweat all over for cooling) and our upright posture and long powerful legs that evolved after thousands of different generations of humanoid type ancestors, makes us the best undisputed long distance runners on this planet. Out ability to out run and out last our prey and using our intelligence to work together with each other, is what put us on top. Any other remaining humanoid type ape couldn't compete with us for food, or we just killed them for any number of reasons. The reason no other land animal comes close to our intelligence is that we have killed off all direct competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man is extremely well equipped to handle the world, thanks to:
- upright posture allowing a farther field of view to survey the terrain.
- good eyesight to spot threats / food in the distance.
- powerful legs for running long distances
- hairless, sweat gland covered body to help cool during long distance pursuits
- Intelligence that allows problem solving, teamwork, and use of tools to solve problems that can't be solved by body alone.
- dextrous hands to work with the tools we have created.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are fixated on fractals to a fault of not seeing the direct evidence before you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are unwilling to accept the truth of evolution and won't even bother reading well written books on the subject that explain it in such a way that anyone can understand, then enjoy having your opinions cast aside as the ramblings of a fool, because that's what they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please explain to me how the splitting of evolutionary paths and the variation in species can be explained without evolution.

       You didn't. You made a reference to fractals and how they dictate how species change without giving any further explanation. I understand what fractals are but I cannot for the life of me understand what you are talking about and why you feel that life is devolving.
      </p>
      <p>
       I took the time to write out some explanations for you with regards to how evolution works. I would appreciate if you were able to make a practical fractal example for me that explains why humans look and work the way we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of insulting me for not believing your outlandish theory, try explaining it in a nicer way. You don't make friends by assuming everyone else is an idiot just because they don't understand you.

       The point I'm really trying to make is that all life on Earth, similar to fractals, fractured, and splintered into all the different forms of Life we see.it isn't a subconscious decision, or. mutation, but rather just a common ancestor, and the snake split from. Evolution doesn't explain such a dramatic split into different forms of Life. That is why some animals have useless characteristics, and traits that benifet them in no way, but the traits are still there. Whale has hand like features, snake with no legs, but previously had legs, animals that are Land , and water based like the sea lion which on land is useless. I'm saying these animals didn't evolve, but rather devolved from original sources. Whale-manatee- sea lion- otter, etc., or dinosaur- crocodiles -lizards-birds-snakes,etc. or even human-ape-monkey

       You’re literally talking about evolution. Given the time scales involved it most certainly explains the dramatic splits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the book I suggested. It’s very straightforward and explains all the remnants left over from previous species, like whale bone structure.

       How whales accomplished such an enormous transformation has baffled even the greatest scientific intellects. Recognizing the conundrum as one of the great challenges to his theory of evolution by natural selection, Charles Darwin took a stab at accounting for whales in the first edition of Origin of Species. He noted that black bears had been seen swimming with their mouths open for hours at a time on the surface of a lake, feeding on floating insects. "I can see no difficulty in a race of bears being rendered, by natural selection, more and more aquatic in their structure and habits, with larger and larger mouths," Darwin concluded, "till a creature was produced as monstrous as a whale." His critics poked such loud and gleeful fun at this image, however, that he eventually omitted it from later editions of his book.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nearly a century later George Gaylord Simpson, the preeminent paleontologist of the 20th century, was still at a loss to explain where whales fit in his otherwise orderly evolutionary tree of mammals. "The cetaceans are on the whole the most peculiar and aberrant of mammals," he remarked peevishly. "There is no proper place for them in a scala naturae. They may be imagined as extending into a different dimension from any of the surrounding orders or cohorts."
      </p>
      <p>
       If science could not account for the transformation of whales, antievolutionists argued, perhaps it never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't explain anything. You just say oh a lot of time passed. Yeah that's the answer for everything. Regardless of time. Why evolve and animal evolve in a sense backward.  You can't account for the traits, and characteristics being for survival, reproduction, mutation, etc. It doesn't make sense. If you think you can just spout out propaganda from a book and you proved your case I assure you the propaganda doesn't work on me.

       <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/how-did-whales-evolve-73276956/">
        Smithsonian article on the evolutionary path of whales
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Key Points:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For more than a century, our knowledge of the whale fossil record was so sparse that no one could be certain what the ancestors of whales looked like. Now the tide has turned. In the space of just three decades, a flood of new fossils has filled in the gaps in our knowledge to turn the origin of whales into one of the best-documented examples of large-scale evolutionary change in the fossil record. These ancestral creatures were stranger than anyone ever expected. There was no straight-line march of terrestrial mammals leading up to fully aquatic whales, but an evolutionary riot of amphibious cetaceans that walked and swam along rivers, estuaries and the coasts of prehistoric Asia. As strange as modern whales are, their fossil predecessors were even stranger.
       </p>
       <p>
        (Regarding the Bears swimming quote) Darwin was widely ridiculed for this passage. Critics took it to mean he was proposing that bears were direct ancestors of whales. Darwin had done no such thing, but the jeering caused him to modify the passage in subsequent editions of the book. But while preparing the sixth edition, he decided to include a small note about Basilosaurus. Writing to his staunch advocate T.H. Huxley in 1871, Darwin asked whether the ancient whale might represent a transitional form. Huxley replied that there could be little doubt that Basilosaurus provided clues as to the ancestry of whales.
       </p>
       <p>
        While analyzing the relationships of ancient meat-eating mammals in 1966, however, the evolutionary biologist Leigh Van Valen was struck by the similarities between an extinct group of land-dwelling carnivores called mesonychids and the earliest known whales. Often called “wolves with hooves,” mesonychids were medium- to large-sized predators with long, toothy snouts and toes tipped with hooves rather than sharp claws. They were major predators in the Northern Hemisphere from shortly after the demise of the dinosaurs until about 30 million years ago, and the shape of their teeth resembled those of whales like Protocetus. Van Valen hypothesized that some mesonychids may have been marsh dwellers, “mollusk eaters that caught an occasional fish, the broadened phalanges [finger and toe bones] aiding them on damp surfaces.” A population of mesonychids in a marshy habitat might have been enticed into the water by seafood. Once they had begun swimming for their supper, succeeding generations would become more and more aquatically adapted until something “as monstrous as a whale” evolved.

       What i'm trying to say is that article basically speaks to each one of your arguments and refutes them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I expect you'll dismiss that article as Propaganda though, so good luck in your future endeavors. I don't think I can say anything or provide any trusted source or material to change your opinion at this point.

       We have already pointed out the extreme story-telling that occurred with Pakicetus, involving Dr Philip Gingerich.3 An incomplete skull fossil was imagined to be that of a whale-like creature, displayed  as an artist’s impression on the cover of the prestigious journal, Science, in 1983. Some years   later the rest of Pakicetus was found, published in 2001, and it proved to be nothing like a whale. Contrary    to what Dr Gingerich had imagined, there was no blowhole, there were no flippers (only hooves), and there was no whale neck (just a neck typical for land mammals). Even so, Dr Werner reveals that the American Museum of Natural History in New York  and the Natural History Museum in London have not stopped using the falsely-reconstructed skull that shows a blowhole
      </p>
      <p>
       In a National Geographic documentary in 2009, Dr Gingerich still claimed that Pakicetus should be classed   with whales, based on its ear-bone. However, the ear-bone is not like a whale, which has a finger-like projection (sigmoid  process), but is plate-like, like the fossils of land animals known as artiodactyls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ambulocetus
 A painting of Ambulocetus at the Smithsonian, showing fake blowhole and tiny ears. There is no fossil  evidence for either claimed whale-like feature.
Ambulocetus
      </p>
      <p>
       ambulo-check-bone
 Comparison of the cheek bones of a cetacean (a dolphin, which is in the whale family), Ambulocetus, and    a horse. Dr Thewissen claimed that the cheek-bone of Ambulocetus is thin and whale-like, but this is not the case   at all.
The ‘walking whale’ is portrayed as an intermediate between Pakicetus and Rodhocetus. Dr Hans   Thewissen, former student of Dr Gingerich, said that there were eight characteristics that showed that Ambulocetus  was a whale ancestor. We have also reported on Ambulocetus  but Dr Werner   recorded on video Dr Thewissen admitting that a key evidence of whale ancestry, the sigmoid process of the ear-bone apparatus   (again), was actually nothing like a whale ear bone. Also, the cheek bone, which Thewissen claimed is thin like a whale cheek bone, is actually not thin at all; a horse, for example, has a much thinner cheekbone than Ambulocetus .
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr Werner says, ‘All eight characters he reported as whale features are disturbingly non-whale features.’
Furthermore, Dr Thewissen’s lab has supplied models of Ambulocetus to various museums that show a blowhole    in the snout of the skull, but there is no fossil evidence of a blowhole. Dr Werner says, “All eight characters he    reported as whale features are disturbingly non-whale features.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodhocetus
      </p>
      <p>
       Rodhocetus was claimed to be an aquatic animal that was developing front flippers and a whale-like tail with flukes (horizontal fins)—i.e.    supposedly well on the way to becoming a whale. However, when Dr Werner pointed out to the paleontologist who discovered    Rodhocetus, Dr Gingerich, that there was no fossil skeletal evidence for a tail or flippers, Dr Gingerich admitted  that this was so. He also admitted that he now thought that the creature had neither of these critical  whale features. We provided some of this information in Creation magazine in 2011.  However, the tail and flippers are still displayed in many articles, and I expect that, like Haeckel’s artistic embryos, will be for many years to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without these three supposed transitional creatures, the story of whale evolution collapses. Another evolutionary icon bite the dust!

       according to whale expert Philip Gingerich, the “Hind limbs of Basilosaurus are most plausibly interpreted as accessories facilitating reproduction. … used as guides during copulation which may otherwise have been difficult in a serpentine aquatic animal.”  (Science vol. 249, pp154-157, 13 July 1990)
      </p>
      <p>
       Living whales have also been claimed to have vestigial legs as they have small bones in their pelvic region. However, we know these have a function in supporting and stabilising the pelvic organs.
      </p>
      <p>
       What can we conclude from the fossil evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no evidence that any of the above fossil creatures, or any others in the textbook whale evolutionary tree, ever turned into a whale. Simply arranging fossils according to the number of land or water dwelling features it has, does not prove one evolved into the next in a diagrammatic sequence.  There is no more reason to believe that extinct semi-aquatic creatures evolved into whales any more than we should believe than living semi-aquatic creatures are evolving into whales now.  The fact that they are extinct does not mean they evolved into anything else.  It simply means they are dead and buried, which is a good reminder that the fossils do not show the history of life on earth, but only the record of death on the planet.

       Example evolution would say that a sea lion is useless on land, so over time the sea lion would eventually would evolve into a strictly water based mammal like the whale , or dolphin, but I'm saying that will never happen. It's useless characteristics will always be present.

       Evolution is a vague term you try to fit anywhere. I refuse to accept man is a byproduct of moleculor circumstance. No more than the result of mere biological chance. The odds are astronomical. What the hell are you evolving to? Sounds like you are a domesticated monkey.

       Science states: Late in the period, the diapsid reptiles split into two main lineages, the archosaurs (ancestors of crocodiles and dinosaurs) and the lepidosaurs (predecessors of modern tuataras, lizards, and snakes). Both groups remained lizard-like and relatively small and inconspicuous during the Permian. These animals fractured down different branches of animals. Just like in nature. Why would a reptile losing its legs be evolving? ridiculous.

       You believe in evolution in a physical world, but man doesn't evolve through the physical world just his massive intelligence. That doesn't make sense. Why is man so ill equipped to handle the world, and rely on his brain? We went from playing with sticks to flying machines. You name any other animal on earth that can compare.That is not evolution. Man didn't develop fur, but he killed animals and wore them like fur. Why? If evolution is true we would of developed physical traits, and characteristics . We didn't. Our ancestors we "evolved" from were actually more equipped to handle the earth. Man is not an animal, but has similarities to an animal.Surely, you don't believe all the great , vast different forms of Life on earth all share the same ancestor of some floating comb jelly. That is absurd.

       The way science states that dinosaurs split into crocodiles, lizards, birds, snakes, etc. This isn't a process of evolving. These animals are similar , because they share a common bond from their original fractals. This is why you can't explain all animals traits as evolution from survival, or reproduction, but you can compare the animals from common ancestors, and where the fractals occurred.

       Fractals are common structures because they're efficient in terms of space and energy. Evolution tends towards efficiency in these areas. I don't see how the presence of fractal structures in life constitutes evidence against evolution.

       Because it made them more adaptable to their environment. Evolution is happening constantly, in that mutations to the cellular structure of animals happen in a certain percentage of births. The idea is that if some mutations make an animal better situated for their environment than that animal will live longer/have more chances to reproduce. In nature, we see that this means 1) some species split into two distinct evolutionary tracts, or 2) that an entire species evolves over generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for why snakes lost their legs, the current best guess is that snakes ancestors were typically burrowing creatures, and that rendered legs (or any external appendages) a liability. Read some research on modern pythons and you can see that they have all the genetic coding needed for legs, they just don't develop them.

       Well wouldn't all animals that are borrowing creatures, or at least most, have lost their legs also? I mean by that logic we have to take a whole lot on faith. Sounds like a complete guess.

       What the hell are you talking about? All of those have evolved (thus have hundred of distinct species).  Some crocodile species are able to live in saltier water than others, or hotter climates. some are smaller than others, or have stronger legs or bites.

       That doesn't prove evolution what your saying. It doesn't even discredit what I'm saying. The big snakes would be closer to dinosaurs, smaller snakes fractured down from larger snakes. The species split from fracturing itself into smaller similar species.

       Dude 99.9999999% of the species that ever existed are extinct because mutations are random but natural selection is not. The word adaptation probably confuses you, species doesnt get a mutation to survive, they just get a random mutation and then natural selection decide if its useful or not. It could even be an useless mutation.

       Science states: Late in the period, the diapsid reptiles split into two main lineages, the archosaurs (ancestors of crocodiles and dinosaurs) and the lepidosaurs (predecessors of modern tuataras, lizards, and snakes). Both groups remained lizard-like and relatively small and inconspicuous during the Permian. These animals fractured down different branches of animals. Just like in nature. Why would a reptile losing its legs be evolving? ridiculous.

       Why would losing legs be ridiculous? Legs aren't ideal for every possible situation. Over time organisms adapted to survive in different ways. Life forms evolve to survive.

       That would be devolving. The snake didn't have a choice in the matter even though you like to pretend that's the case. Snakes are a fractal of a lizard. Similar to how apes are fractals of humans, and monkeys are fractals of apes.

       Molecular circumstance? Absolutely. There is life here because of water, without it the planet would be geologically dead. Our location in the solar system and distance from the sun makes it possible. Chance perhaps. Is there some other explanation?

       An incomplete skull fossil was imagined to be that of a whale-like creature, displayed as an artist’s impression on the cover of the prestigious journal, Science, in 1983. Some years later the rest of Pakicetus was found, published in 2001, and it proved to be nothing like a whale. Contrary to what Dr Gingerich had imagined, there was no blowhole, there were no flippers (only hooves), and there was no whale neck (just a neck typical for land mammals). Even so, Dr Werner reveals that the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the Natural History Museum in London have not stopped using the falsely-reconstructed skull that shows a blowhole
In a National Geographic documentary in 2009, Dr Gingerich still claimed that Pakicetus should be classed with whales, based on its ear-bone. However, the ear-bone is not like a whale, which has a finger-like projection (sigmoid process), but is plate-like, like the fossils of land animals known as artiodactyls.
Ambulocetus A painting of Ambulocetus at the Smithsonian, showing fake blowhole and tiny ears. There is no fossil evidence for either claimed whale-like feature. Ambulocetus
ambulo-check-bone Comparison of the cheek bones of a cetacean (a dolphin, which is in the whale family), Ambulocetus, and a horse. Dr Thewissen claimed that the cheek-bone of Ambulocetus is thin and whale-like, but this is not the case at all. The ‘walking whale’ is portrayed as an intermediate between Pakicetus and Rodhocetus. Dr Hans Thewissen, former student of Dr Gingerich, said that there were eight characteristics that showed that Ambulocetus was a whale ancestor. We have also reported on Ambulocetus but Dr Werner recorded on video Dr Thewissen admitting that a key evidence of whale ancestry, the sigmoid process of the ear-bone apparatus (again), was actually nothing like a whale ear bone. Also, the cheek bone, which Thewissen claimed is thin like a whale cheek bone, is actually not thin at all; a horse, for example, has a much thinner cheekbone than Ambulocetus .
Dr Werner says, ‘All eight characters he reported as whale features are disturbingly non-whale features.’ Furthermore, Dr Thewissen’s lab has supplied models of Ambulocetus to various museums that show a blowhole in the snout of the skull, but there is no fossil evidence of a blowhole. Dr Werner says, “All eight characters he reported as whale features are disturbingly non-whale features.”
Rodhocetus
Rodhocetus was claimed to be an aquatic animal that was developing front flippers and a whale-like tail with flukes (horizontal fins)—i.e. supposedly well on the way to becoming a whale. However, when Dr Werner pointed out to the paleontologist who discovered Rodhocetus, Dr Gingerich, that there was no fossil skeletal evidence for a tail or flippers, Dr Gingerich admitted that this was so. He also admitted that he now thought that the creature had neither of these critical whale features. We provided some of this information in Creation magazine in 2011. However, the tail and flippers are still displayed in many articles, and I expect that, like Haeckel’s artistic embryos, will be for many years to come.
Without these three supposed transitional creatures, the story of whale evolution collapses. Another evolutionary icon bite the dust!

       according to whale expert Philip Gingerich, the “Hind limbs of Basilosaurus are most plausibly interpreted as accessories facilitating reproduction. … used as guides during copulation which may otherwise have been difficult in a serpentine aquatic animal.” (Science vol. 249, pp154-157, 13 July 1990)
Living whales have also been claimed to have vestigial legs as they have small bones in their pelvic region. However, we know these have a function in supporting and stabilising the pelvic organs.
What can we conclude from the fossil evidence?
There is no evidence that any of the above fossil creatures, or any others in the textbook whale evolutionary tree, ever turned into a whale. Simply arranging fossils according to the number of land or water dwelling features it has, does not prove one evolved into the next in a diagrammatic sequence. There is no more reason to believe that extinct semi-aquatic creatures evolved into whales any more than we should believe than living semi-aquatic creatures are evolving into whales now. The fact that they are extinct does not mean they evolved into anything else. It simply means they are dead and buried, which is a good reminder that the fossils do not show the history of life on earth, but only the record of death on the planet.
