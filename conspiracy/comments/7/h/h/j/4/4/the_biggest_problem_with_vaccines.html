        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When most people look at vaccine issues, they focus on the heavy metals and other compounds in vaccines. But I don&#39;t think that is the biggest issue. I think the biggest problem is that there is yeast in vaccines. Yeast/fungus is a very important part of your gut flora. When people have yeast/fungal probelms in their gut they can cause huge issues. 
The type of yeast in vaccines is present naturally in your gut. However, when it is injected into a baby or child, the body reacts to it and creates antibodies for it because it is not normal to have yeast present in your muscles after an intramuscular injection. 
So now your body has created antibodies that attack yeast that should be naturally present in your gut to be healthy. So your body is literally constantly attacking and fighting yeast in your intestines. Then add on the super carb rich western diet and you end up with yeast/fungus overgrowth and your immune system constantly working overtime creating antibodies to fight it.</p>

<p>This is why 90% of autistic people have gastrointestinal issues constantly, and why symptoms of autism are improved by fixing gut health.
This is also why there is such a big connection between autoimmune disorder and diet/vaccines.</p>

<p>There is lots of talk now about the gut brain connection and I have no doubt that in the future, fecal transplants follow by low carb diets will have a huge impact on all sorts of disorders. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually the biggest problem with vaccines is that the body is being exposed to pathogens in a way th a it was never meant to. The normal way the body is exposed is through the respiratory system. The immune system has a whole cascade of responses that communicate and work in unison to fight the pathogen and result in immunity when exposed this way. </p>

<p>With vaccines, the immune system is being activated by bypassing the body&#39;s natural defenses. Into the muscle and right into the blood stream. So there&#39;s inactivated pathogens that the body reacts to as if they&#39;re live, because it recognizes the protein coat of the virus, compounded by the adjuvants like aluminum, which are there to stimulate the immune system even more. The body goes haywire trying to deal with this assault on it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the first problem with vaccines. </p>

Science has tried quite eloquently to show the negative sides of vaccines, which are ignored and ridiculed as per plan, so that pharma can make more money.</p>

It&#39;s not a religion, it is a very excellent way of testing new ideas. It is neutral if done as it should be. There are protocols to follow, you know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The protections that are given to vaccine manufacturers is the problem with the word &quot;vaccine&quot;. Notice how the major pharmaco&#39;s are releasing a &quot;smoking vaccine&quot;. There&#39;s no way to vaccinate against nicotine, that&#39;s not what a vaccine is. But by labeling it a vaccine, they get blanket immunity to any claims of harm caused by the so-called &quot;vaccine&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a myth. Not only can people still sue vaccine makers, here&#39;s <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1612195.html">an actual example of it</a>.</p>

<p>The law routes a couple of specific product liability claims to the vaccine court, where claimants can get compensated without having to pay for a lawyer or in many cases without even having to show that a vaccine caused their injury. </p>

<p>But if people still want to sue, they can:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Plaintiffs alleged eight claims plus a claim for punitive damages in their state wrongful death action. Application of Section 22 affects only two of these claims—the strict products liability and negligence claims to the extent that they were based upon allegations of design defect and failure to warn. Therefore six of Plaintiffs&#39; claims remain unaffected by the Act and each of these provide a possible remedy to the injuries that they suffered as a result of Jacob&#39;s illness and death. Accordingly, our conclusion is in keeping with the strong presumption that Congress does not, “without comment, remove all means of judicial recourse for those injured by illegal conduct.” Silkwood v. Kerr–McGee Corp., 464 U.S. 238, 251, 104 S.Ct. 615, 78 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984); Cf. Shafer, 20 F.3d at 6.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(In other words, even though two of the plaintiffs&#39; claims were precluded by the VICA, they had six other claims that would support all the same relief--including discovery if they got to trial and punitive damages if they won. So they got to proceed on those six claims, despite anti-vax stories about how no one is allowed to sue pharma companies.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some key points from your link:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Section 22 of the Vaccine Act meanwhile <strong>provides vaccine manufacturers “significant tort-liability protections,”</strong> Bruesewitz, 131 S.Ct. at 1074, <strong>by eliminating liability for injuries from “unavoidable side effects,”</strong> 42 U.S.C. § 300aa–22(b)(1); <strong>eliminating liability for not providing direct warnings to a claimant,</strong> § 300aa–22(c); and imposing a presumption that a manufacturer provided proper directions and warnings if the manufacturer complied with FDA requirements, § 300aa–22(b)
The Act&#39;s structural quid pro quo leads to the same conclusion: <strong>The vaccine manufacturers fund from their sales an informal, efficient compensation program for vaccine injuries; in exchange they avoid costly tort litigation and the occasional disproportionate jury verdict.</strong></p>

<p>Putting these two provisions together, Plaintiffs argue that, because Section 11 of the Vaccine Act renders them ineligible for compensation through the Vaccine Court, no other part of the Act, and particularly not Section 22&#39;s tort-liability limitations, should apply to their claims in state court. We disagree. The exhaustion requirement in Section 11 is only a subsection of Congress&#39;s larger statutory scheme to ensure that vaccine manufacturers have an affordable and predictable way of handling injured parties&#39; compensation claims. <strong>Though parents are not bound by Section 11&#39;s exhaustion requirement, they are not free from the Act&#39;s tort liability limitations.</strong> Regardless of whether a plaintiff is the vaccine-recipient or the parent of one, <strong>Section 22 expressly preempts design-defect claims seeking compensation for injury or death caused by a vaccine&#39;s unavoidable side effects.</strong> § 300aa–22(b). <strong>Section 22 expressly preempts tort suits based “solely” on the manufacturer&#39;s failure to provide direct warnings to the injured party.</strong> § 300aa–22(c). In reaching these conclusions, we do not suggest that the Act otherwise forecloses a parent&#39;s state law claims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They can only sue in state court, and only if the state allows for it. Also, the Federal government pays for damages out of the vaccine injury program, the manufacturer doesn&#39;t pay directly and is not required to admit fault.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your interpretation is not quite correct. They can sue under state law, which is not the same thing as only being able to sue in state court. (That&#39;s counter-intuitive, I know, it&#39;s just a feature of the way US law works.) For example, Holmes is a federal case. I can&#39;t remember now if it went to a state court after that decision or continued in federal court; either is possible. </p>

<p>If the parents win in court, the damages do not come from the vaccine injury program. That sentence is referring to the VICP, where parents can get compensation more quickly and easily than by going through court. If they do sue in court, normal rules apply--if they win, the pharma company has to pay damages and maybe even punitives.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe any such cases have ever been won. Suing in court is incredibly difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. It&#39;s a myth that there are no cases, though, and a frustrating one to read over and over and over again given that it&#39;s so easy to point to actual examples of the lawsuits anti-vaxers say are impossible.</p>

<p>This reminds me of the kangaroo court known as FISC</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t really matter if theoretically you can successfully sue the pharmaceutical manufacturer if in reality there is no chance you will win. The pharmaco&#39;s are relying on this protection and the quality of vaccines will assuredly be affected. Why spend the money ensuring your vaccine is clean and safe if there&#39;s no chance of punishment from injuring your customers? Ultimately the almighty dollar will determine where their focus goes.</p>

<p>Theoretically, no, but in reality that&#39;s how it is playing out. These companies aren&#39;t worried about problems that won&#39;t actually happen. Losing a vaccine civil suit is one of those &quot;problems&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think this is realistic. Companies and their lawyers assume that they may be held liable in civil cases even when they don&#39;t think they&#39;ve done anything wrong, because they know that juries and even judges can get a wild hair. That&#39;s especially true in medical cases where the plaintiff may be a child. </p>

<p>Looking again at Holmes, the case went down because the plaintiffs structured their legal theory around the disclosures accompanying the vaccine, then admitted under oath they never read those disclosures. That&#39;s not a corrupt court, that&#39;s a badly-planned case. They probably could have amended the complaint and come back with more supportable theories, but decided that litigation is too expensive and slow. (Which is one reason why the VICP exists in the first place.)</p>

<p>Are you speaking from a position of experience with and knowledge about complex civil suits?</p>
