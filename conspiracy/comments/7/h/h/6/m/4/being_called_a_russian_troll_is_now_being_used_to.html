<p>Political discourse between establishment loyalists and everyone else has been trampled to death by the gratuitous use of this obnoxious debate-avoiding tactic. Everyone who publicly questions the MSNBC Russia narrative will be met with these accusations. Everyone who speaks about it with much of an online following will receive these accusations on a daily basis.</p>

<p>The MSM has brainwashed people into thinking that this is completely normal when in reality It is a bizarre obnoxious tactic, and when you use it, you are admitting that you have no fucking argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Russian government has been &quot;shilling&quot; since the early 00s when Russian activists used LiveJournal to publish financial documents, resulting in the government killing activists and ultimately purchasing LJ (yes, it is now owned by Russia).  The leader of the opposition party in Russia (who got his start from LJ) refers to this online dialogue from state actors as &quot;black noise&quot;.</p>

<p>And then we saw the rise of the Brockroaches in recent years.</p>

<p>The problem online is that the two groups have perfected the art of political trolling, and that we as critical thinkers are unable to rise above the noise without resorting to their ad hominem tactics of accusing the person you&#39;re arguing with of being a shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, resorting to personal attacks is very shill-like so it&#39;s important to notice when people are doing that.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the biggest problem. The biggest problem with shilling is the astroturfing and manipulating the forum to control the discussion. You can always use logic to counter a shill 1 on 1 but it&#39;s much more difficult when an army of shills are controlling the whole thread </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the Russians must be far far better shills as I have yet to come across any that stand out as blatantly as share blue et al. The Clinton shills always seem to turn up with msm media stories and demand to know why this sub isn’t discussing it. If they were genuinely interested in the story they would start talking about it, not demand to know why the whole sub isn’t discussing it. Normal people would make a separate subreddit to post pro Hillary conspiracies so they could pick over them in peace with other likeminded folk. They wouldn’t turn up here time after time to force a narrative. </p>

<p>And to add insult to injury, we’re not allowed to call anyone a shill regardless of how scripted, hostile and obvious they are. Or if we can complain, we have to pretend that Putin and the_donald are also equally as bad. </p>

<p>There’s nothing more tiresome than seeing a post complaining about shills, and the first comment is agreeing that the sub is filled with people from the_donald. No it’s not. It’s share blue astro turfed.
Personally I would welcome a whole bunch of Russian shills. They seem to understand how this sub works, obey etiquette and participate in good debates. </p>

<p>UPVOTE IF YOU WANT TO SEE MORE RUSSIANS ON <a href="/r/CONSPIRACY">/r/CONSPIRACY</a>!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t personally think it took an outside influence/campaign/conspiracy to convince these people Obama wasn&#39;t a US citizen.  Maybe it began as some kind of outside campaign but the fox news crowd took it and ran.  Maybe it was a fox news initiative to rile up their viewers and get them to vote.</p>

<p>I think it was most likely just an organic response to the president being black.  I think blaming the birther movement on outside influences is a cop-out that takes responsibility from the people who pushed that theory.  </p>

<p>Fox news viewers, old people, and non-critical thinkers did seem to be the crowds spreading that one.</p>

<p>Part of the problem on this sub is the immediate dismissal of anything that agrees with a mainstream narrative. For example, there were several posts in recent weeks about how the OP was opposed to Net Neutrality for no other reason that that the mainstream seemed to be for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol how are they not NWO agenda? If they weren&#39;t, you would see them calling other countries out on it all the time. An actual acknowledgement of the NWO by a world power would kill it. Its a very unpopular thing, and people would rally against it.</p>

<p>Russia is not only in the NWO, they are a insight to what a NWO would look like. A leader who just re-elected himself by changing term limits, the mysterious disappearance of dissenting politicians and reporters, the very heavy KGB influence and all that history etc.</p>

<p>And to top it off, they are working with the biggest NWO contender in the world, America. (How big is our military again?)</p>

<p>So I think you are wrong, based on previous Russian political actions and their economic status. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jeez you really missed the entire point in this response....</p>

<p>OP claims people mischaracterize anyone who goes against the MSM as a Russian Troll. Similarly, anyone who goes against Trump is immediately deemed a &quot;Soros shill.&quot; There are certainly examples of Soros&#39; shills out there, just like there are plenty examples of actual russian trolls (See the facebook and twitter interviews with Congress. RT the Russian News conglomerate even bought millions of $$ of Twitter ad space). </p>

<p>Both &quot;Soros shill&quot; and &quot;Russian Troll&quot; are used inappropriately excessively. To deny otherwise is just ignorant</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m afraid Vladimir Putin has the unfortunate effect of making all the other world leaders look bad or downright dumb and incompetent by comparison. That&#39;s not his fault, but rather theirs and major problem and embarrassment for us. </p>

<p>So our leaders have no choice but to vilify, disregard out of hand, or run him down any way they can so as to not look any worse than they&#39;ve already shown themselves to be. </p>

<p>From the look of it Putin seems to actually take an honest and serious interest in what goes on in this world, keeping abreast and staying fully informed about it, and being well-ahead of the curve as they say. He doesn&#39;t have to rely on other experts in world affairs because he happens to be one himself and very credible and respectable one at that. </p>

<p>When asked, he of course knows and understands all the history, players, and motives behind any current events that he can talk about at length and explain both logically and with a great deal of intelligence and confidence about what he see&#39;s in the way of any potential outcomes or consequences in relation to them and has an extremely good track record when it comes to that. </p>

<p>So he&#39;s simply too sensible and accurate by far to actually challenge or argue with without appearing to be completely out-classed and of your league.</p>

<p>His right-hand man, Lavrov is cut from the same cloth, extremely bright, intelligent and forthright. </p>

<p>As hard as it may be for anyone to accept that&#39;s not something that either of them is somehow faking or pretending to be, they actually are that way and consistently that way and persistently that way. </p>

<p>They are at the top and in command in Russia because they are the best possible choice for Russia and ordinary Russians in these precarious and unpredictable times. In fact the well-educated middle class in Russia is growing by leaps and bounds in spite of these times and all the enmity being arrayed against them while it&#39;s being systematically dumbed down, impoverished and destroyed throughout the western world. </p>

<p>From any public standpoint Putin and Lavrov&#39;s judgement is sound and trustworthy and both men enjoy the highest public approval ratings of any national leaders or spokesmen in the world both on and off the record when it comes to all the ordinary Russian people who&#39;ve certainly seen more than their fair share of political corruption and the outright abuse of authority and the public trust for countless decades on end to make that just all the more remarkable.</p>

<p>The real truth is that we, the ordinary citizens in the west are under siege and steadily losing ground thanks to all of our own leaders in government, business, and finance who also own and control all of our mass media just for good measure. </p>

<p>We are also being blocked as much as possible from discussing the truth about that and numerous other situations that our own leadership and governments are deeply involved with that Putin has quite frankly called out and exposed for exactly what it is.</p>

<p>So are any of the complaints about Russia&#39;s democracy any worse than any we have concerning the sad and sorry state of our own?</p>

<p>Or the way capitalism is currently practiced there being any more egregious there vs. here? Or the state and handling of it&#39;s national economy and finances with virtually no public and very little if any household debt? </p>

<p>Or that they have one of the best trained and equipped militaries to defend their borders, a military that unlike any of our own doesn&#39;t cost a king&#39;s ransom to have and maintain and carries out it&#39;s missions in a no nonsense and efficient manner rather than leaving it&#39;s citizens to be continually embarrassed by how poorly it actually serves and performs when finally called to under real life circumstances?</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid all we&#39;re really guilty of is trolling for the truth and it just so happens that the truth about our situation is also important to know and have spread by others that our own leadership has been scapegoating and putting on the defensive both to enrich themselves and cover-up their behind the scenes machinations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully realized that what I wrote would be removed just as quickly as possible. You can&#39;t say the truth when it comes to anything about the Russians who are no better of worse than any other European country the US government considers an ally rather than an enemy.</p>

<p>The Russian people have come a long way and deserve far better treatment. You take two steps back and look at it all objectively and it&#39;s the US that&#39;s behaving and becoming just like the old Soviet Union was while now it&#39;s the Russians are standing fast and challenging us on the issues of personal and economic freedoms and national identity the way we once did when the shoe was on the other foot.  </p>
