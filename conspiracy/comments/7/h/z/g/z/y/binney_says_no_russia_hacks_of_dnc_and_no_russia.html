        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">27</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-12-06 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Deplorableasfuk.html">Deplorableasfuk</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Binney spent 30 years at NSA, became a whistleblower and helped consult on the Snowden movie. He&#39;s now come out with definitive proof that DNC&#39;s servers were NOT hacked by Russia or other actors and in fact the emails were DOWNLOADED to a thumb drive.</p>

<p>ELI5</p>

<p>&quot;Trump, Russia, Collusion&quot; - Conspiracy theory by Hillary&#39;s campaign, Obama&#39;s intelligence dept. and the MSM that Russia stole the emails that Wikileaks published. These crimes helped Trump formulate a strategy to beat Hillary by Russia sliding info from hacks to Trump &quot;early&quot; for him to maximize impact on Hillary.  The &quot;evidence&quot; of collusion does not exist and Clapper, Comey, Meuller and everyone honest in the MSM has to admit that nothing exists tying Trump&#39;s campaign to any effort to steal emails to give to Wikileaks, regardless of who was involved.</p>

<p>Why this doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Publisher of the emails, Jullian Assange, denies it was Russia who gave them to him. In fact he names Seth Rich as the likely source or SOURCES who delivered the stolen emails to him.</p></li>
<li><p>Technical and digital evidence. Binney went to speak with the head of CIA Pompeo and told him that the forensic evidence shows that the emails from DNC were not transfered over the net but rather were DOWNLOADED to a thumbdrive. Why/how does he know? The speeds and other ip evidence that Crowdstrike found of the fake &quot;Gucifer 2.0&quot; (the Russian hacker the DNC made up) was at speeds unobtainable on the net and only by transfer to a thumbdrive or similar devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Circumstancial evidence. Upon learning that &quot;The Russians&quot; had hacked their servers, stollen the most data in the history of the DNC and revealing that they were complicit in Bernie&#39;s bogus defeat to Hillary, what did the DNC do? </p></li>
</ol>

<p>THEY BLOCKED THE FBI, HOMELAND SECURITY AND ALL OTHER FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS FROM HELPING FIND THE CRIMINALS!</p>

<p>Why would the DNC not use the FREE and EXTENSIVE network of crime fighitng agencies and turn to Crowdstrike, an expensive and private company? Does not make sense at all.  It&#39;s like someone breaking into your house and the cops get there while he&#39;s still in your home and you say &quot;Oh, no you can&#39;t come in, I&#39;m going to get my private security to come take care of it.&quot; Utter nonsense. And btw, the cops would go in regardless of what you said to catch the criminal. Makes you wonder why the FBI didn&#39;t go into the DNC without a warrant to investigate the physical servers if the NSA, who of course was monitoring the traffic from the DNC to the hackers, to catch the criminals and prosecute them.</p>

<p>Finally - The Mueller investigation. Not only is there NO leads to charge anyone with a crime of hacking or disruption our elections from Russia or inside the US, Mueller has not made one arrest or even MENTIONED a lead that would yield an arrest of a Russian hacker, a Russian diplomat, a Russian citizen, a Russian politician, a Russian US citizen who was involved in this VAST &quot;Trump, Russia, Collusion&quot; conspiracy to undermine the DNC, Podesta and Hillary&#39;s campaign to win the presidency.</p>

<p>What Binney concludes is what we at r/conspiracy have known for over a YEAR....</p>

<p><strong>The DNC hack was really a leak and was done by insiders at the DNC, transferred through a series of operators to Julian Assange and published by Wikileaks.</strong></p>

<p>Finally, if you don&#39;t believe this is the real story, then answer this question for me.</p>

<p><strong>Why would &quot;Russia&quot; go through all the effort to hack the DNC, steal the emails and NOT use them secretly to blackmail the certain-to-be new President, Hillary who had a 97% chance of winning on election day???</strong>  </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Binney is quoted as saying:</p>

<p>“Virtually all this data has been a fabrication that’s been created as a diversion.”</p>

<p>“The technical evidence [shows that]”</p>

<p>And when Binney met with CIA director Pompeo he explained the following:</p>

<p>“People in the FBI know exactly who leaked the data.”
“People in [FBI, CIA and NSA] made up the [Intelligence Community Assessment](Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections google it or download the PDF <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdjI_MqvbXAhXjYd8KHW4qDd0QFggnMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dni.gov%2Ffiles%2Fdocuments%2FICA_2017_01.pdf&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2eC6jCv8z3sCvH14xEw2AW">here</a>) where they claimed 17 intelligence agencies, well it was really only three. And it was hand picked people from those three to have a <strong>predetermined outcome</strong>, which is what they did, and they wrote a 14 page ICA paper that started out by saying we have “high confidence” and “it’s our judgement that we have high confidence” that the Russians did the hack. But then on at the very bottom on page 13 it says please don’t interpret our judgement to mean that we have absolute facts to prove that this is absolutely true.”</p>

<p>So to summarize.</p>

<p>Mueller has not interviewed, charged or even found a single Russian actor, agent, diplomat, elected official or private citizen to charge criminally in the “Russian collousion” crimes.</p>

<p>Mueller does not even have from the 3, not 17, intelligence agencies ICA report enough evidence or confidence that the crime was committed. And in fact, if Clapper, Comey, Brennan and the NSA director who wrote that assessment were brought to testify before a jury in a criminal case against any such Russian spy, they would not be able to say under oath that the evidence they found in their ICA was “beyond a shadow of a doubt” proof that the Russians hacked the DNC.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Because nothing was in the emails was anything that would be useful blackmail.  It would be enough for people to latch onto that already hated Hillary but nothing criminal or Earth shattering was in there, imo.  What was the WORST thing that came from them?  </p>

<p>And how do we know they don&#39;t actually have blackmail material on Trump?  He&#39;s led a shady life, so I&#39;m sure there&#39;s plenty there.  Why not have the true goal being to sow chaos in the country and if Trump gets elected, you have a puppet too?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. The whole rigged primaries was even hidden so well from Bernie that he looked physically shaken and sickened when the Wikileaks came out just before the DNC convention. It was as if he was in total shock that Hillary/DNC could stoop so low. </p>

<p>Hmmm, President Hillary could have been a puppet for Putin if he&#39;d just kept those DNC emails to himself a few more months right?</p>

<p>But no, had to help the candidate who only had a 3% chance to beat her up until and ON ELECTION DAY (lol cnn).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue with the whole &quot;downloaded to a thumb drive&quot; vs &quot;the servers were hacked from far away&quot; completely ignores the very real possibility that:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A computer on the same network where the information was taken from was compromised/hacked into from anywhere in the world.</p></li>
<li><p>That computer then connected to the computer where the information was taken from, and did a network copy from it, meaning, the information was stolen very quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>The information was then transferred from the hacked computer to any computer, anywhere in the world, and speed would not matter.</p></li>
<li><p>If necessary, the information was downloaded to removable media from the computer located anywhere in the world.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>And NONE of this is far fetched in the slightest.  It;s something I do <em>every day</em> as part of my job, often being three levels deep in remote desktop, for instance.  RD from my laptop to a server in Texas, then RD to a server in California, and then RD to another computer on the same network as the one in California.  </p>

<p>And, my computer was subject to the same kind of hack as I&#39;ve mentioned.  Someone hacked into any took control of my computer, and from there, hacked into certain web sites and did various things that would be traced back to ME, not the person who was operating my computer from who-knows-where.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI was given all the forensic data they asked for, and they came to the conclusion <a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/national/read-james-comey-complete-testimony-before-the-senate-committee-full-transcript/zSWeVUWnQExQ3wgfr6xMaL/">that it was Russian hackers.</a></p>

<p>BURR: And the FBI, in this case, unlike other cases that you might investigate -- did you ever have access to the actual hardware that was hacked? Or did you have to rely on a third party to provide you the data that they had collected?</p>

<p>COMEY: In the case of the DNC, and, I believe, the DCCC, but I&#39;m sure the DNC, we did not have access to the devices themselves. <strong>We got relevant forensic information from a private party</strong>, a high-class entity, that had done the work.</p>

<p>COMEY: There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever. <strong>The Russians interfered in our election during the 2016 cycle.</strong> They did it with purpose. They did it with sophistication. They did it with overwhelming technical efforts. And it was an active-measures campaign driven from the top of that government. There is no fuzz on that. </p>

<p><strong>It is a high-confidence judgment of the entire intelligence community, and the members of this committee have seen the intelligence. It&#39;s not a close call. That happened.</strong> That&#39;s about as un-fake as you can possibly get, and is very, very serious, which is why it&#39;s so refreshing to see a bipartisan focus on that, because this is about America, not about any particular party.</p>

<p>You might want to read that again. Comey claimed they <em>interferred</em>. Unless I&#39;m missing something, I don&#39;t see where in your quote he says Russia hacked the DNC server.</p>

<p>Trump tweeted that he fired Flynn as national security adviser in February “because he lied to the vice-president and the FBI” about his discussions with Russia’s ambassador to the US last December. Flynn pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to FBI agents.</p>

<p>This would mean that <strong>Trump knew Flynn had committed a serious crime</strong> when, <strong>according Comey, the president asked Comey the next day to halt an FBI investigation into Flynn.</strong> When Comey refused, Trump fired him. </p>

<p>That&#39;s textbook obstruction of justice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol who the fuck do you think your fooling u/TheSalvation? We were all here in these threads watching the &quot;GUICCER 2.0&quot; drama unfold in real time. We were all right here, in these r/conspiracy threads, discussing how much GUICCIFER 2.0 smelt like DNC bs from the get go. We were also right here in these threads discussing how CrowdStrike failed to prove that it was Russian hacks in their phony &quot;report&quot;. Actually r/conspiracy pointed out how crowdsrike claimed that within the &quot;Guccifer&quot; (DNC) documents, there were traces of Russian language which, in their mind, &quot;proved&quot; it was Russian Hackers... Buttttttt when you compare the data from the documents from Guiccifer 2.0 and the documents from the WL dump, the WL docs don&#39;t contain any of the &quot;Russian traces&quot;. It&#39;s clean RAW data. unlike DNC&#39;s fake Guccifer2.0. The funny thing about those Guccifer documents is that from the metadata of those documents, we can tell that some Microsoft documents were purposely masked with a Russian Language pack in order to &quot;prove that it was Russia.&quot; These dumb fuck DNC peeps literally right clicked on the language bar, scrolled down to the Russian Language and clicked Apply. Then when on to claim that Russia &quot;hacked&quot; the DNC. Who the fuck do you think your fooling with your vote script bots?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>someone is charged, so we now have an accused. </p></li>

</ol>

<p>3,  I think  you are saying there was a robbery and there is a charge of conspiracy. </p>

<p>Then you say, &quot;it was an inside job,&quot;  meaning what? there was another conspiracy that that included bank insiders only and  </p>

<p>or are you saying insiders conspired with the other conspirators so it isn&#39;t a crime? </p>

<p>But as you make your claims,  that there was no theft,  you neglect to say that someone did steal those emails and first offered them to the Trump Campaign, then they were transferred to Wikileaks by someone not yet identified.</p>

<p>So . . . Are you saying there was no crime when there clearly was? or are you claiming that because it was an inside job it was not a crime?  And I don&#39;t think that works in court.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know the law better than 99% of people here. There is no law, crime or statute that Meuller is investigating around a &quot;Conspiracy&quot; or a &quot;collusion&quot; for that matter. The &quot;crime&quot; does not exist if the emails were not stollen/hacked by the Russians.  </p>

<p>I think your confused about what the word &quot;conspiracy&quot; means in the criminal setting. You can&#39;t be found guilty of just &quot;conspiring&quot; to do something. There has to be an underlying crime either committed or planned and in the process of being executed. </p>

<p>are we talking about the ODNI report, which - despite the non-stop media hype from anonymous sources - remains a cornerstone of the &quot;election hacking&quot; farce?</p>

<p>LOL do you even know what that means? Binney&#39;s using what he learned in the 90&#39;s and trying to apply it to 2016. He&#39;s a clueless old geezer. The &quot;last mile&quot; doesn&#39;t apply if the files were taken from either a DNC server or if the DNC&#39;s office is on a GB network like mine it. </p>

<p>The &quot;last mile&quot; problem is something ISPs deal with when trying to connect their fiber backbone to <strong>people&#39;s homes</strong>. If Binney&#39;s really said that he is a fucking moron.</p>
