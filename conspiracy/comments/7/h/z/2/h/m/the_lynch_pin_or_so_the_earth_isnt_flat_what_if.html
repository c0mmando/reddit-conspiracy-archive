<p><strong>read the <em>WHOLE THING</em> before you reply, so you know what the fuck you are talking about, k?</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>I know this sound ridiculous, but please hear out my arguement, I think that there is something to this.</p>

<p>I have attached evidence, please tell me why this theory is wrong.</p>

<p>I might be a hopeless optimist, but I believe that a perfect world, that operates on logical principles, can exist, and by extension, a perfect and logical universe.</p>

<p>As did the Ancient Greeks.</p>

<h1>this is not flat earth</h1>

<p><strong>I need your help, please.</strong></p>

<p>I would just like to clear up one point in the flat earth debate before I &quot;let it go&quot;</p>

<p>I have said various things regarding the Flat Earth, which I have listed here</p>

<p><a href="https://na.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7go21k/flat_earth_debunking_fake_science_and_cognitive/">https://na.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7go21k/flat_earth_debunking_fake_science_and_cognitive/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://na.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7h8iei/flat_earth_society_is_disinformation_to_make_true/">https://na.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7h8iei/flat_earth_society_is_disinformation_to_make_true/</a></p>

<p>on the basis of the Socratic Method, as I explained here :</p>

<p><a href="https://na.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7hi8fh/yo_waddup/">https://na.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7hi8fh/yo_waddup/</a>
socratic method</p>

<p>the main thrust of the argument was </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did Eratosthines chose Non-Euclidean geometry, rather than Euclidean geometry, to measure the earth</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://na.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7gwvb4/everyones_got_an_angle/">https://na.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7gwvb4/everyones_got_an_angle/</a></p>

<p>which I maintained incorporates an element of assumption, as </p>

<blockquote>
<p>he went looking for the curvature of the earth, going in with the assumption that the earth was curved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, while yes, <em>the point is true</em>, he did go in assuming the earth was round, that is <em>beside the point</em>, other people had aready surmised that the earth was, in fact, round, and, regardless, </p>

<h1>the Ancient Greeks <em>didn&#39;t actually think the earth was flat</em></h1>

<p>I just wanted to raise a seperate point, down the same rabbithole, so here we go, <strong><em>strap yourself in for another thrillride.</em></strong></p>

<h1>Well? What <em>DID</em> the Ancient Greeks thing about the earth?</h1>

<p>they thought it was <strong>the earth was at centre of the universe</strong>, and the sun, and the planets orbited around it, with the stars being fixed in a sphere around.</p>

<p>and <strong><em>THIS</em></strong> answers <em>a lot</em> of the questions that Flat Earth does not, including <strong>apparent motion of planets and stars</strong> as well as the <strong>Coreoles effect</strong> and, most importantly :</p>

<h1>Why the space program is a lie, and why I maintain that we went to the moon, but what we have been shown has been faked or heavily doctored.</h1>

<p><strong>The Earth could be at <em>the centre of the universe</em>.</strong></p>

<h1>The Sun could orbit the Earth!!!</h1>

<p>perhaps a video will help explain :</p>

<p>This is what the Ancient Greeks believed the universe looked like :</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utH-GHH1FT8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utH-GHH1FT8</a></p>

<p>another modelling :</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Plxed3JVOnI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Plxed3JVOnI</a></p>

<p>another modelling :</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpSy0Lkm3zM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpSy0Lkm3zM</a></p>

<p>and then, the questions about why you can slew your telescope with it&#39;s fancy gps platform etc can be answered thusly :</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Toya19H12w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Toya19H12w</a></p>

<h1>PLEASE, I AM NOT BEING FACIETIOUS, I AM REALLY SCARED RIGHT NOW THAT THIS MAY BE THE CASE.</h1>

<p>can anyone please tell me why this absolutly cannot be the case?</p>

<p>In this model, *<em>we *CAN</em> pend probes to the planets, we <em>CAN</em> have all the space things.</p>

<h1>PLEASE PROVE ME WRONG!</h1>

<p>this picture is also a metaphor for my point!</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/zuANHY7.png">https://i.imgur.com/zuANHY7.png</a></p>

<p>do you get the &quot;let it go&quot; reference now?</p>

<p>Every idea has two sides, each equal and opposite, and both are just as valid.</p>

<p>Unfortunatly, they are the poles of a vast spectrum.</p>

<p>One is the sweet and nice <strong>Queen Elsa explanation</strong>, which suffers self doubt early on, but strives on to self realization to become a more whole snow queen and harness her powers, not through fear, but through <strong><em>love</em></strong> for the betterment of all Arendelle. </p>

<p>The other is the dark and twisted <strong>Queen Freja explanation</strong>, where all was going well for Freja, until she suffered terrably, and was turned into a cold, uncaring, lost soul, trapped on the brink of the world, but who comes to dominate the world later in her story, or at least attempt to, until, ultimatly she succumbs to destruction in a mono e mono confruntation with her sister, and it&#39;s all been pointless, naught for <strong><em>love</em></strong></p>

<p>The point is, they are both two opposing interpretations of &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; by Hans Cristian Andersen</p>

<p>Thankyou very much, and keep watching the skis </p>

<p>:/</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em> I just thought about something, redshift, blueshift, oneshift, twoshift (sorry, couldn&#39;t resist), cosmic waves, all the other things flying around in space, were coming from <em>outside</em> the celestial sphere of the fixed stars (the fixed sphere of stars rotates slowly, if you&#39;re wondering). </p>

<p>As for the speed of light, the either may exist, which may slow the speed of light through the outer area of the Poltomaic System. Yes, we have looked for the either, but have we tested far enough out in space?</p>

<p>on or beyond the moon?</p>

<p>the gases of the atmosphere could push the aether out, maybe?</p>

<p>Edit : on the point of the <strong>Michelson-Morley Experiment</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment">https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment</a></p>

<p>How would a <strong><em>geocentric</em></strong> model affect the result?</p>

<p>Would you not expect to see the result of &quot;no aether wind&quot; if the Earth was stationary, and the sun orbited around it?</p>

<p>Edit :</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it only appears that way from our perspective. As the Ptolomaic system model shows, mathematically, and visually, there <em>IS</em> a way for it to work.</p>

<p>it&#39;s just the gravity that is an issue, but as we all know, gravity is a mystery, so it may just operate in a way we don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>and perhaps the gravity of the various objects interplay with each other.</p>

<p>Explain the orbit of mars. </p>

<p>Mars makes dramatic loops through the air which can be explained because the Earth and Mars both orbit the sun. If it orbits the Earth then it makes zero sense. Its actually part of the reason the geocentric model was abandoned, no one could make it work. </p>

<p>You can get a telescope and see other moons orbiting other planets. </p>

<p>Lets do it like this. Do you believe that gravity is the force that is responsible for motion in your geocentric view?</p>

<p>If you do where do the masses that are causing these insane orbits to make loops through the air exist? </p>

<p>If you think its any other force explain why you think so and where the forces are that adjust the orbits as such. </p>

<p>There are too many holes and your entire arguments hinges on an animation showing what the orbits of the planets would have to be to make this fit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you like to think I am &quot;just making stuff up&quot; when you don&#39;t have an answer, don&#39;t you?</p>

<p>It couldn&#39;t possibly be because <strong><em>you</em></strong> are mistaken, could it?</p>

<p>for instance :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for example, why can the other three fundamental forces be blocked, stopped, or absorbed, but gravity just keeps on going?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never said weak and strong can be blocked or absorbed. note the working word <strong><em>&quot;or&quot;</em></strong> as opposed to <strong><em>&quot;and&quot;</em></strong></p>

<p>furthermore, they can be absorbed, or stopped.</p>

<p>Follow me on this line of reasoning :</p>

<p>Strong nuclear is the force holding atoms together, yes?</p>

<p>Atoms can be split, and in so doing, the energy within the atom is released. Where does that energy come from?</p>

<p>It comes from splitting the strong nuclear bonds? Or do I not understand that properly?</p>

<p>Therefore, it can be said that the strong nuclear bond has been stopped, or absorbed, by being absorbed into the energy it becomes.</p>

<p>A convoluted explanation, but never the less, correct.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission#Energetics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission#Energetics</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Once the nuclear lobes have been pushed to a critical distance, beyond which the short range strong force can no longer hold them together, the process of their separation proceeds from the energy of the (longer range) electromagnetic repulsion between the fragments. The result is two fission fragments moving away from each other, at high energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that is incorrect, tell me why.</p>

<p>As for the weak force, I have confused the cause of decay with decay itself, as in I thought the weak force was radioactivity, but it seems to be the cause of radioactivity.</p>

<p>But, there is a hypothetical universe model whereby no weak force is needed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakless_Universe">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakless_Universe</a></p>

<p>and furthermore</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The strength of the weak interaction is an outstanding problem in modern particle physics</p>

<p>A theory should ideally explain why the weak interaction is 32 orders of magnitude stronger than gravity; this is known as the hierarchy problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so you say we know, but we don&#39;t. </p>

<p>or can you clarify this</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Instrument error isn&#39;t very likely because, for one, we see thousands of these, not just a few. More importantly is how we find these stars with planets. We don&#39;t just pick random stars and look for planets, we predict where planets are likely based on the theorized age and mass of the star. If it was mere instrument error, you could point your telescope at any star and see some indication of planets, but we don&#39;t, instead we see the planets around stars that our models predict are likely to have them. Further, different instruments at different locations detect the same planets, at the same periodicities, in the same stars, at the same time. That kind of independent verifiability is really hard, if not impossible, to ascribe to &quot;instrument error.&quot;</p>

<p>If the stars just happen to be flickering...what makes them flicker? It seems like an awfully massive coincidence that they would just so happen to flicker in a way that perfectly mimics what we&#39;d expect if they had planets, and that we&#39;d be finding these flickering stars so reliably using a planet model based on the estimated age and masses of the stars. It&#39;s a <em>ton</em> of coincidences that all happen to conspire to create the illusion of a non-geocentric universe. It&#39;d practically require some kind of trickster god out there moving all the planets around by hand just to create the illusion of a general, universal system of gravitation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But, on the other hand, what if the fixed stars had tiny planets orbiting them, in the celestial sphere? would that explain the apparent flickering we see?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would every star be a celestial sphere with planets orbiting them...except ours? Why would we be the one planet in a solar system that&#39;s orbited by its star, whereas all other planets do so oppositely? An elegant, logical universe doesn&#39;t have exceptions to rules like this. The very nature of logic is that its consistent across all cases, it doesn&#39;t apply in one way at star A and another way at star B.</p>

<p>but what if every other star or something, maybe every one in some sort of golden ratio number (Fibonacci) kind of thing, would have a planet system around it, because it would be a smaller version of the whole system, all the way down the line in a fractal type way.</p>

<p>like in the same way we&#39;re pretty sure dark matter is there, and we can make the calculations for it, but we just can&#39;t quite find it. Maybe?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Standard Model is currently the most accurate model for the physical universe at macroscopic scales. That includes cosmology and astrophysics.</p>

<p>If you have a better model I strongly encourage you to publish it for review.</p>

<p>The Standard Model is currently predicting an undiscovered planet based on the observed effects on nearby masses.</p>

<p>This is something good models can do: be used to predict outcomes. In fact, the standard model can predict solar eclipses, lunar eclipses, asteroid fly-bys, and more! It&#39;s really handy.</p>

<p>Surely your models can predict cosmological events hundreds of years into the future, right?</p>

<p>Hey, if you have a better model, I&#39;m sure everyone would love to see it. That&#39;s how science works, you know. The &quot;best&quot; model is the &quot;right&quot; model until a better model comes along. That&#39;s actually the entire fucking point of science.</p>

<p>The Standard Model is not completely accurate. It breaks down at small scales. So it&#39;s not &quot;right&quot; in the sense that it can model the entire physical universe, but it&#39;s &quot;right&quot; in the sense that there isn&#39;t a better model (for large scales) yet.</p>

<p>Does that mean there never will be a better model, or it won&#39;t get tweaked a bit in the future? No, of course not. As long as we continue to practice science, &quot;right&quot; will get &quot;righter.&quot;</p>

<p>But until you can publish a model that will predict the movement of planetary masses, asteroids, Rosanne Barr, and apples with the same methods, you can&#39;t compete with the Standard Model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The size of the universe is as big as the best telescopes can see. The Universe has gotten bigger in direct proportion to the distance telescopes can see.</p>

<p>When Einstein developed relativity he didn&#39;t know that galaxies existed, the science community thought galaxies were just more stars.</p>

<p>The size of the observable Universe is just that. It is just what we can see.</p>

<p>It is obvious to me that the total Universe is a lot bigger than what we can see.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion the total Universe is massively bigger than the observable Universe.</p>

<p>There are black holes millions of times bigger than the observable Universe. There are areas in the total Universe trillions of times bigger than the observable Universe that are completely void of any atoms.</p>

<p>Think big, Earth can&#39;t be the center of the total Universe. It is just too big for that to be possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You asked to be proven wrong. I asked what your reasons are for presupposing a geocentric universe and all you come back with is &quot;what if the sun is smaller than the Earth? How would you explain that?&quot; Which is like asking &quot;What if all men had vaginas too? How would we have kids?&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s a nonsense question based on a nonsense presupposition. So I ask again: what reason(s) do you have to discount the voluminous amounts of corroborative data for the sun to be much larger than the Earth, for the speed of light to be uniform at 186,000 miles/sec, and for our solar system to be heliocentric?</p>

<p>Do you have any substantive reason whatsoever to discount these theories?</p>
