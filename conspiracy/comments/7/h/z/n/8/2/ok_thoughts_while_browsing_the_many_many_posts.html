<p>What if there ARE no conspiracies against us, TPTB are just us making connections where there shouldn&#39;t be, and everything going down is simply a case of severe incompetence and random happenings? What would we even do with that information? Which is worse, even? Having TPTB trying to enslave us all, or having politicians so terrible it LOOKS like there is a conspiracy? </p>

<p>Seriously, not a shill, not a plant. No way to prove that, so clearly there will be downvotes and such. Such is life in r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>Obviously. But what if instead of it being a conspiracy to enslave us, they are literally just so bad at long term planning, they don&#39;t REALIZE the negative parts of their actions. What if corporate giants are just greedy and stupid instead of greedy and evil? How would we even respond to that? And again, whats worse enslavement intentional, or incompetence ad infinitum?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Intentional enslavement is much worse, i mean think about the implications. You could also assert that if we are that stupid to enslave ourselves to a system we know to be negative, we instantaneously accept also that the system is designed that way and not there by accident. Incompetence ad inifinitum is an idea but does not reflect reality. The negative impacts stemming from policies and behaviors from our senators, representatives etc is broadcast all around them everyday. On their phones, tv, computer. It would be impossible even for the oldest supreme court justice to be completely isolated from reality and still go to work everyday. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, one of the major flaws of conspiracy theories is the desire to see it all as connected, it&#39;s all one big overarching conspiracy, with a hidden all-powerful organization pulling puppet strings from behind the scenes (and yet leaving clues like we&#39;re in an E-rated video game?). </p>

<p>However there are conspiracies by the rich against the poor, but the rich isn&#39;t all united as one against the poor; they often use the poor of their rival nations as away to agitate against the people at the top. This is not to say the poor people of any side don&#39;t have legitimate grievances, but you do have to watch out for outside influence. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to think that there is an overarching conspiracy that involves the entire world, a comfort that the world is controlled instead of chaotic, and a single enemy that can be beaten instead of many who will use the weakness of their rivals to grow stronger.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>in my opinion, you have to be open to every idea, the people who downvote ideas like this are just as brainwashed as normal everyday people are. so convinced that their strong belief in something makes it real, makes their opinions concrete. i always keep this in the back of my mind, it’s a very grounding idea. it’ll keep you from falling so deep into the ridiculous ones, like the flat earth theory. those people have never questioned their convictions, they just believe it blindly. there’s a huge chance that every conspiracy is just someone looking was too deep into something and digging at any small coincidence. or people mistaking thoughtlessness and incompetence with evil intentions. personally, even though i do believe in a few small conspiracies, i believe most of the issues in our society is that a lot the people in power are greedy morons who think that no one will notice them doing these things. people are naturally manipulative, it’s proven in the way we live our lives. we manipulate everything around us to get what we want. and if someone really wants to vilify a certain person or a group of people bad enough, they will find a way. that’s how you get the conspiracies about the left from the right and vice versa. they want so badly for the other group to be evil to the public eye, they’ll make any coincidental connection they can. it’s the same way for all conspiracies. now sometimes the suspicions are warranted, it’s good to question everything bc chances are that at least one of the questions will be the right one. but as a conspiracy observer, you have to be alittle but skeptical of everything, no matter how convincing it may be.</p>

<p>I am simply asking what if TPTB are made up and all these conspiracies are happening not because of some super rich few controlling and manipulating events, but is in fact caused by stupids being stupid. What would we do in that case? If it turns out no NWO is in play but the officials running the show are just really really bad at doing that, would you stand up and fight, or stare blankly at them until you started laughing madly at the whole crazy thing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is some truth to that, although I don&#39;t think its all just random happenings and incompetence. There are too many &quot;coincidences&quot; for the major conspiracy theories to just be random events. Also from a logical perspective, in a hierarchical society you will have conspiracies amongst powerful people to take control over certain regions or power structures. It is just the nature of power. However something we don&#39;t often acknowledge on these forums is the fact that most conspiracies involve one powerful group temporarily allying themselves against a larger more powerful entity. In the case of the NWO conspiracy theories, you have several powerful groups allying to control the global population. I think its likely that many  power plays are misconstrued to appear as though it is some &quot;NWO&quot; type group trying to take over the world because it is easy to make connections where there are not any when you lack critical information (ie all of us trying to figure out whats going on). In reality I think the &quot;NWO&quot; conspiracies mostly stem from the UN and related ventures along with the IMF and BIS which aim to control all the financial sectors of most nations. Looking at the membership of these groups you see connections to the old nobility so its easy to conclude that there is a global conspiracy, but that doesn&#39;t mean that all evil things in the world are a result of this supposed conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Intentional enslavement is much worse, i mean think about the implications. You could also assert that if we are that stupid to enslave ourselves to a system we know to be negative, we instantaneously accept also that the system is designed that way and not there by accident. Incompetence ad inifinitum is an idea but does not reflect reality. The negative impacts stemming from policies and behaviors from our senators, representatives etc is broadcast all around them everyday. On their phones, tv, computer. It would be impossible even for the oldest supreme court justice to be completely isolated from reality and still go to work everyday. </p>

<p>Intent is not important, the fact is they are &quot;debt-slave&quot; owners.</p>

<p>Go ask if they would change policies if it cut into their profits and helped people free themselves from their debts.</p>
