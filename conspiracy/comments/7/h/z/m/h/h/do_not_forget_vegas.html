       It's been two months, and the Vegas event seems to already be forgotten. There's still no motive, no explanation for the leaked crime scene photos, nothing on his girlfriend. Nothing about why large hospitals stopped receiving patients before they were even full, instead diverting victims to smaller more poorly equipped hospitals. No explanation for the mystery man escorted away by heavily armed police. Or about the Reno shooting that took place on the 29th in a condo that Stephen Paddock had owned property in as recently as December 2016, or the mysterious female "hostage" that was in the room during the shooting. "During the shooting, Stone held a woman hostage while he was firing sporadically, five to eight shots at a time for roughly 30 minutes." Nobody was killed other than the shooter, and there were at most two injuries. Coincidence?

       I don't understand this argument. They release footage when they're trying to find a suspect. Why would they have needed to release footage of the shooter if he was already dead.

       Finding a dead body in a room doesn't prove anything about who fired the shots.  Concrete VIDEO evidence does, or ballistics tests, something....anything at all other than the official story that has changed enough to not talk about it on TV anymore.

       Well, according to their official statement.  No.  Swat found him dead and he was identified and that there was no further issues.  Yet, there’s video on YouTube of Mandalay Bay employees terrified and hiding in their stores then exported to the Michael Jackson theater by officers all with assault rifles.  Which they kept the lights off and 45 minutes later told everyone to hit the floor which caused ppl to panic and cry.   Before the finally evacuated the theater and put everyone on a bus out of the area.  They didn’t let them go back and get their personal things till the next day.   I can dm you a link if you’d like.

       Just FYI... only 1 SWAT officer entered the room. Apparently they waited a full hour and the other 19 SWAT officers on his team were too busy to show up. He went in with 4 other officers from the LVMPD. Sorry, don't mean to be picky... But, this is a problematic fact that needs addressed I think too many people are ignoring. No offense. Just wanted to get it out there...

       It's because the outfit blends so seamlessly into society that most Chicagoans aren't really even aware that there's that much organized crime still going on. It's mostly all money &amp; politics tied up in local businesses that the average person would never think has ties to the "mob", as you call it.

       What about other locals? I assume anyone who works there on the strip has been forbidden from talking about it.
My parents went on their annual Vegas trip about a month after the shooting, their Uber driver said one of his friends was killed at the show. He gave this information up without my parents even bringing up the topic- like dud you just picked up tourists from the airport and the first thing outta your mouth is that?!

       Yea I look all the time and work on the strip, nobody talks about it anymore. All you see is "Vegas Strong" junk everywhere because now it's a thing used to draw customers into a business. Sad times. I told my wife, this is EXACTLY how things are covered up: They stop reporting it, so the questions disappear, and before you know it the whole thing is forgotten. But some of us won't forget that the whole thing is totally fucked. They are even stopping taking donations for the fund. It's so fucked up.

       I bet that if its brought up with typical people that a goto response is something like everyone being traumatized by it and needing to heal and so not to dredge details up since we are moving on "Vegas Strong and marketing gimmicks.

       Nice MGM housing "for security purposes", food, the whole deal. Short of a suitcase full of cash. Or, maybe he got that too.

       I don't even think the shooter was killed. But yes in the two months since the event there has been no evidence of an actual shot being fired. No one can demonstrate any gunshot wounds, bullet damage, medical activity, or definitive images of bullets striking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, someone attempt to rebut this with the Liveleak "aftermath" video that emerged within two days of the event and shows none of the above.

       Literally shows nothing, and even if it showed real wounds that would do nothing to show that shots were fired in Las Vegas on 10/1. Thanks for the reinforcement. Everyone should watch that video.

       Anyone can take a picture of their scar and say "never forget Las Vegas," duh. In a real mass shooting it would be apparent real shots were fired, let alone one with so many witnesses. 0/4 fail

       Of course it's not fucking real. Does that look like an exit wound from a high caliber rifle round? Anyone can show someone with a booboo 2 months later and say "this happened in Vegas."
      </p>
      <p>
       What we don't have is any imagery whatsoever of anything being shot at the scene at the time, at all. Do people not understand what a mass shooting is? They claim thousands of rounds were fired in front of hundreds of recording devices. When I ask for proof that anything was shot the most they can show is this bullshit on Facebook that has no context and proves literally nothing.

       The hole is very questionable just on a first time look for me. Very clean looking. Damn near a perfect circle. It's like he stuck a damn cigarette lighter from a car onto his body. lol

       Ok, so it's suppose to be a
       <em>
        fresh

       exit wound of a high powered rifle. That makes more sense considering it looks more like a large tick bite.

       You're expecting cameras to be recording every inch of every place in history so you can catch a visual of a crime? Hilarious. Not gonna happen buddy, there's other things called evidence. Only questions involved don't include whether people were really shot. Sorry but you're clueless if you think the whole thing was fake. Prove it if you're so right.

       We're not talking about "every inch of every place in history," numb nuts, we're talking about Las fucking Vegas in front of 20,000 witnesses (which means about 20,000 recording devices) at a music festival.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet no one can show anything which has been shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't have to "prove it." The claim is that hundreds of people were shot with thousands of high cal rifle rounds. This is the claim with the burden of proof on it and which has not been proven to any convincing degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this were a real shooting you could save your fingers and just link to a dozen images of bullet damage, gunshot wounds, and actual medical treatment. But of course you cannot.

       I agree things aren't what the media and FBI say, but you clearly don't live in Vegas if you don't know someone affected. Shit did happen, whether your brain tells you to believe that part or not. What kind of circumstances surrounding it, who fucking knows. But you're an idiot to think people didn't get shot/killed. Straight up idiot.

       No one was shot or killed, because instead of offering responses to any of the criteria for evidence that I laid out all you have is insipid name-calling.  In a real mass shooting with hundreds of victims and thousands of rounds fired we would see evidence of shots being fired, so go ahead and provide them or shut the fuck up.

      <p>
       My bosses sister was killed and her husband seriously wounded. I worked with him the night of October 1. Woke up the next morning to the news of the shooting, and then news of his sisters death. He was off work 3 weeks and isn’t the same since he came back. So I’ve seen first hand the effect. My mother has a good friend who was working the event. I’ve heard firsthand her story. So for that to be a hoax those two people would have to also be getting paid off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next I would ask what PROOF do you have that it didn’t happen. And your position that the burden of proof is on me doesn’t work.

       My bosses sister was killed and her husband seriously wounded. I worked with him the night of October 1. Woke up the next morning to the news of the shooting, and then news of his sisters death. He was off work 3 weeks and isn’t the same since he came back. So I’ve seen first hand the effect. My mother has a good friend who was working the event. I’ve heard firsthand her story. So for that to be a hoax those two people would have to also be getting paid off.

       Next I would ask what PROOF do you have that it didn’t happen. And your position that the burden of proof is on me doesn’t work.

       I didn't document and record all the videos I saw when I went onto Twitter and YouTube right away.  Wait until the next big thing happens then immediately hop your ass onto Twitter and YouTube.

       I typically see rebuttals to comments like yours, pointing out that there is no evidence released, as
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        "WTF are you talking about there has been tons of evidence released... we've talked about it extensively in 'the other thread', but I'm not going to tell you which thread because do your own work"
       </li>
      </ol>

      </p>
      <p>
       or my personal favorite, 3. "Well you wouldn't believe it personally so because one random Redditor wouldn't believe it that renders the whole entire exercise of providing any sort of evidence at all to the public as moot, and a waste of resources too."

       I would add a reply that I've got probably over twenty times so far just on this subreddit: "I know someone who died you fucking idiot" or "what about my cousin's ex-boyfriend who got shot in the head, is she a crisis actor too you fucking idiot?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah I like #1 that you mentioned because they act like there's all this evidence and proof that people were shot and then when I ask for any all they can do is say "just Google it" (which I obviously have) and assure me that it's so abundant and convincing, yet they can't even show one link or image or time stamp that shows anything being shot or even that has been shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where if it was a real shooting on the scale claimed, they could simply show a video of bullets impacting or a large area of bullet damage or people being worked on by EMS or any blood or injuries. And they can't show any of this at all. If it were a real shooting there would be multiple angles and examples of all of the above.

       The "I know someone who died you fucking idiot" response is one I definitely forgot about. It's an interesting one too because I can't imagine myself in the same situation, with a loved one who was just killed in one of the deadliest massacres in recent US history, going on a reddit conspiracy board and arguing with random people about it. That would probably just open up too many wounds for me personally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually do believe it was a real shooting, but I'm interested in talking about it and not just shutting people down. I want to know all possible perspectives and make my own decision what is most plausible. And the things you mention are all plausible to me. There are so many anomalies in the story I just don't know what to think, hence why I'm on here trying to find answers.

       I agree, the number of people who claim to have personal connections to victims who are arguing with random people like me about it on r/conspiracy is simply too damn high. I do not exaggerate when I say I have had over twenty people on this forum make such a claim. Naturally not all of them can be telling the truth, just on a basic mathematical level. None of them have offered any proof other than linking to some random Facebook post or news article that I could have found on my own.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if at least some of them are liars, it begs the question of why there would need to be people on a conspiracy forum spreading these lies. We know there are crisis actors involved -- one of the girls claiming there were multiple shooters was formerly on Dr Phil for example, playing an out of control narcissist. This begs the same question, of why there would need to be actors in the wake of a real shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many reasons to doubt any shots were fired and no good reasons to think anyone got shot. We should have a pastiche of photos and videos that all show rivers of blood, gruesome carnage, windows shot out, people being treated by EMTs on the scene, etc. and there is nothing like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are four main videos people point to when they do attempt to offer "proof" that people were shot instead of just downvoting or launching a personal attack: the liveleak "aftermath" video, the video of people arriving at an emergency room, a video of a cup being kicked over that they say is being shot, and a guy with blood or fake blood on his arm.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of the above show any real injuries or medical activity. They are clearly staged. The one in the emergency room shows no blood when there should be tracks and smears of it everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Las Vegas is one of the world's most video surveilled cities. 20,000 people were said to be present at the concert and probably thousands of them had recording devices which were active at the time. Yet we have no footage of a bullet striking anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let alone the fact that the victims have been made-up, and even have phony sounding made up names to go with their contrived identities.
      </p>
      <p>
       One "witness" named Mike Cronk (see what I mean about the stupid names) claimed his "buddy" was shot three times in the chest and survived. Anyone who thinks a high powered rifle, tripod or no tripod (and there was no tripod), could hit the same target three times over hundreds of yards from a height of 32 stories is living in a television fantasy world. The slightest recoil of the gun barrel translates into much vaster deviations of the bullets over that distance. Yet there he is, making this bullshit claim on CNN. I can link to the video of this right now, and it's enough to prove we have a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       This just doesn't have the three dimensional appearance and flavor of a real shooting, on any level of scrutiny. I have many links I could share that further debunk the entire charade but here's a good discussion to listen to while you drive or chill.

       This is a well reasoned argument. I get what you mean about not having the three dimensional appearance of a real shooting. It seems produced. Like details are intentionally left out because they would detract from the narrative. In one of the videos I saw I think there was even some on screen direction. That might be the live leak video you mention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don’t know what to think, man. Part of me wants to just believe it happened as told, and the other part keeps seeing things that don’t add up. When I come to forums like this to get answers, some of the rebuttals are downright hostile. I keep holding out hope that the official report will make sense when it drops, and will clean up some of the inconsistencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s an idea I had re: crisis actors. I heard they are often recruited on Craigslist. There can’t be an incredibly huge number of them in the US... What if someone were to post fake ads on Craigslist, soliciting crisis actors for an upcoming production, and asked aspiring extras to reply with their headshot, an example or 2 of their work, and resume? I wonder what would turn up. Then someone would have the headshots for future comparisons against future events like this...

       Yeah I was the one trying to hype it up but it got nowhere. My own investigations found that, according to police, Stone was shooting at "targets which did not exist" and my speculation is that the hostage was a woman who worked for an NPR related radio station. The officers took at least 36 hours informing the family and subsequently the media of the identity of the shooter. The shooter had no criminal history (once again) and was not a big gun nut. He was on the eighth floor of the Montage facing the east side whereas Paddock lived on the 15th floor facing the west side.

       Hard to see how these two are related, but everything is fucking weird right now. 2016 was the year of the weird. 2017 was the year of the ultra-weird/professional victim seeking. Hopefully 2018 gets their shit together.

       Doubtful. Have a feeling things are just getting started. As for their relationship idk but FBI was on the scene at both events even though Stone didn't shoot anyone. The other nutty thing is that Stone supposedly did not suffer life threatening injuries yet still died on the way to the hospital. Then his name wasn't released for 2 days after the shooting. It's all very odd.

       One of the biggest bullshit remarks is the "200 rounds at a security guard" claim. 
.223 would go flying through that door, through the next door across the hallway, and possibly continue through that next wall as well. 
200 of those were fired off? In a hotel environment? Absolutely laughable. That door would be toast.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police reports claim that they had to evacuate adjacent rooms. No one can attest one way or another to 200 rounds being casually fired at a security guard? Who sustained a minor leg wound from what would be nearly 7 standard capacity magazines?
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, they claim that there were cameras set up by the "shooter" both inside the room, and the hallway. Why has none of this surfaced?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did he have access to the freight elevator? Why is there no footage of this happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       (If any of the above comments have been addressed by recent news, I apologize, but I can only take so much drivel when periodically looking for updates)

       An independent investigator discovered that the frieght elevator could be easily accessed by the public but discovered it was under camera surveillance. Supposedly the cameras in the room were not recording and were meant only for surveillance.

      <p>
       As for the lack of footage, it's just the general obstruction of Justice surrounding this whole event

       Thank you for the follow up. I'll redact that from my usual bar ranting about the incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       My biggest concern is that round count allegation. As someone who uses the .223 caliber round frequently, that just doesn't make sense. 
I'm not usually a tinfoil hat kinda guy, but I heard that and was instantly suspicious. 
I was out of the country at the time and thought it was just a foreign news source misquoting, but nope... we are really going with 200 rounds through a hotel door.

       The guy gives you a list of facts anyone can look up.  You have no counter to his facts.  So you just simply type: "nope, not facts".  Even though anyone can google and youtube those facts.  You give up on the argument and resort to flat denial in the face of facts.

       It's easy for customers to access the service lift and it's perfectly normal to bring in tons of luggage for business trips. But the lack of footage disturbs me.

       The only reason I can think of for not releasing the footage is MGM knows it makes them look VERY liable.

       And my response to that is since when should we give a fuck about MGM's bottom line? They should be
       <em>
        compelled

       to release that shit, and fined a million dollars a day until such time as they comply.

       On what grounds though? What legal standing would someone have to compel MGM to release footage publicly? Investigators we're presumably given the footage, there's no suspect loose that the public needs to help identify or locate, why would they release the footage?

       Why can't the LVPD hold a press conference and instead of saying "The shooter shot over 1100 rounds. Have a nice day." Why can't they say, "As you can see in this picture, the shooter shot over 1100 rounds. What you are looking at is a picture of 1,185 spent casings of .223 caliber ammunition on the floor of room 32-whatever-it-was. Have a nice day."?

       It actually isn't that easy. A buddy of mine does armed security for a local small-time casino in a town with a fraction of the foot travel of Vegas. The service lift is kept guarded, as well as requiring keycard access before the damn thing will even go anywhere.

       I use to believe this, but then the Bellagio cashier cage was robbed and within 24 hours of it taking place they had CCTV footage released to the public because the suspect escaped.  That was the straw that broke the camels back for the ongoing investigation excuse for me.

       You're correct, so is video footage of mass murderers only released when they're still on the run?  Or does it have to do with body count?  I ask this, because we as a nation saw video footage of the Boston marathon suspects who attempted to cause mass murder.

       Paddock left a car in vegas to fly to Phoenix, rent a vehicle (probably a van as all his vehicle purchases have been shared) and then spent 5 additional hours in Phoenix before driving the rental back to Vegas.  Strange.

       Saw a video with a map of the 32 floor posted in the hallway.  The service elevator was basically two full length hallways away from Paddock's room.  Yet, the staircase, right outside the door.
      </p>
      <p>
       I forgot the name of the person who uploaded this video info and also recorded how the service elevators were not locked and even walked into the area.  He was also banned from all MGM properties within 24 hours and escorted out of his room and the hotel after uploading.

       I don't think people largely realize what that much brass would look like. I do my own reloading, and generally keep pending brass in gallon bags of 250 at a time. That is a whopping amount of spent casings.

       That's a nice way to put it into perspective for people who don't do much shooting. So you're saying there should be 4.5 gallons of brass somewhere in the hotel room(s). I wonder what a good every day comparison we could make?

       We lack crime scene photos, so there is a likelihood that there IS that much brass somewhere. The issue is that we aren't privy to those photos.

       If he was posted up at a window, it would logically be piled up nearby. Correct headspacing of that rifle wouldn't really allow that random of a pattern shelling out brass.

       I’m perfectly willing to say it exists somewhere. Probably in an evidence locker at this point. It would be nice to know why it didn’t show up in those photos. So are you saying it would have been in a relatively contained pile due to how it was ejected? The last time i shot any gun with a large magazine was decades ago as a kid so I don’t really remember what the brass does.

       The greater conspiracy is that it doesn't matter who did it or why - it's not worth changing society for a few sporadic events.  Whether these types of events are planned nefariously by powerful organizations or simply happen at "random"...it doesn't matter.  MassMedia uses these to keep people scared and addicted to debt.

       my only possible explanation to the possibility of:
A - Paddock was just a psycho who wanted to kill people
B -why no footage/answers etc?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's Vegas (casinos, etc) paying to keep it out of the media so people keep coming to vegas and gamble away their bucks
AND to avoid any lawsuits they might be liable for (for whatever reasons) - I can't justify why...

       And that in and of itself, even if Paddock was just a lone wolf psychopath and the MSM narrative is 100% factually accurate, is why this is a worthy topic to keep asking questions about. It's not just about the shooting anymore.

       Same. The guy who's still looking into this is someone on YouTube who has a channel called the End Times News Report (yeah, I know...). But, he actually gathers info and if he speculates he makes sure to say so. Backs everything up with 2 sources. Just wanted to let you know you're not alone.

       I'm not sure. I'm inclined to believe someone is just messing with him but until Vegas, I never watched anything like this. I don't think he's making it up for nefarious reasons. Lots of these YouTube people are constantly asking for $ but he only briefly mentions it at the end of his videos (which I think is fair). And, I heard Laura Loomer slashed her own tires for attention. But, from what I could see from his neighborhood, it looks like he's doing pretty well money wise and I don't think it's a matter of attention seeking. He's not above giving away his research to other YouTube journalists without taking credit. I respect that as it appears he really cares about just getting the info out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only watch his videos on Vegas though. LOL, so... basically to answer your question... I have no idea!

       I've been trying to post about the pharmacist connection on here as much as possible b/c that's really something. There's no denying actual titles with those two as co-owners. Not sure about all the interviews he's been doing with the high rollers because witnesses can be pretty unreliable. But, to be honest, I'm just happy someone who's not an attention seeking, greedy nut is still covering the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just try to keep an open mind and cross my fingers he doesn't give up on it or, God forbid, something does happen to him.

       You're right he doesn't really ask for $. I think me and you have the same mindset on this whole thing. I'm giving as much attention to the people still investigating as I can so they don't give up.

       I've been trying to find a podcast where someone is still talking about the attack. Most recent one was just 2 weeks after the shooting. But if I find something I'll let you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what to make of the 2 shooters theory. I believe it's possible. But, I'm not buying there were shooters in a helicopter. I kind of think the Saudi theories are a bit out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       As of now, it's my opinion half of the information being kept under wraps is simply MGM trying to cover their asses in future litigation. The other half of me thinks Paddock was involved in some kind of illegal dealings. Maybe drugs, guns... like the Uber driver said, there's many criminals that approach guys like Paddock who have connections to other players. I don't necessarily think he was involved with the FBI (I have some trouble and questions about the whole FBI sting Paddock as a CI theory... still possible I suppose). In any case, with the FBI investigating his brother, there's no way they hadn't investigated Paddock and his family. They definitely had some knowledge of what he was doing and this is why we aren't getting any answers from them either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because I'm new to this whole cover up conspiracy thing, I'm still thinking analytically.... trying to reach the most "believable" conclusion. However, since this story broke it's been getting weirder and weirder. If someone really did find evidence of a Saudi assassination, I'm not sure I'd be all that surprised.

       Again, I'm exactly like you. I've only found a few podcasts that talk about Las Vegas. One was recorded two days after so they didn't have much info, Joe Rogan completely dismissed any other theory than the official story, and the other podcast used numerology to analyze the shooting, which I can't get behind at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fire from the helicopter is out of the window for me. The "muzzle flashes" people are seeing on the videos are just a special type of strobes helicopters have in busy areas. But you cannot dismiss the helicopter activity itself. The radar from that night is strange, very strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't let go of the 2 shooters theory. I was in the military. I've heard a fair amount of machine gun fire from the receiving end, and I can't get over my instincts that say there is two weapons being fired. Also, the taxi cab footage is just too damming audio wise. People say that far away sounding volley of fire is an echo. I tried going with that, but after watching dozens of times, that is a second position of fire.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's so many moving parts to this. It's fascinating. The man being escorted from the Tropicana. The video of someone lifeless on the casino floor of the Delano. Campos going missing after the shooting. Idk, I desperately want to know the truth, but chances are we never will.

       Thanks for your unique perspective. This is what we (or at least I) need... more educated opinions about that night. Because I've seen so many videos that either support or deny the 2nd shooter theory and I've never even touched a gun. So, I have no clue. I do think it's pretty weird there were 2 windows broken out and it's almost impossible to explain why the adjacent door was locked from the other side after he "killed himself." I've talked to several people at work who think it's possible we aren't being told about certain things because there's another person still out there. There's one video that vaguely shows another body in the hotel room leaked photos. I can see it, but it's like one of those photos where you see one thing but then look at it another way and it's something completely different. However, if the FBI had killed 2 people in the room, I don't know why they would want to cover that up... Then again, never in my life have I seen anything like this whole mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact Lombardo gave such differing timelines and answers that contradicted himself, doesn't make things any better. If he simply fucked up and gave out info before he knew the right answers, was pressured by the FBI/MGM or something else entirely only fuels the fire. But, man, I was so disappointed when they discontinued those press conferences.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a legal background (not a lawyer but studied criminology), so I know for sure MGM isn't releasing the videos because it simply implicates them. Stuff like that can be easily explained. Not that hard to believe a huge company like MGM would just hand attorneys more ammunition (unintentional pun).
      </p>
      <p>
       So where do you think those helicopters were going/doing? That military place a couple YouTube ppl visited are only making themselves look suspicious by refusing to answer questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, I'm right on board with you. I look for something new everyday. Regardless of how (or anyone) feels about Tucker Carlson, he's the only real media figure that's keeping this whole thing going. I wish he'd done more than 7 minutes the other day. Kind of saddened by the fact Jake hasn't released anything about Vegas recently. Hopefully, he's just onto something and piecing it together for a new video. Hey, I'm going to save your username just in case something comes about, however vague... because I feel like we're pretty much on the same page here and both up to date. Plus, both kind of obsessed with this topic!

       Anyone remember how every single day Keith Olbermann used to say something like "it's been It has now been x days since Sean Hannity said he'd undergo waterboarding to prove it's not torture"? Well, what if every day Tucker said something like "it's been x days since the Vegas massacre and the police still have not given us a motive or shown us a single video of the perpetrator at Mandalay Bay or anywhere in Vegas the week of the shooting."

       I was watching him around that time and he did bring up a lot of things.  Well though if there is no new information to report on then there isn't much of a show.  It does seem though that around that time he became noticeably more irritated in his demeanor.  It could just be after so many months of working a job like that since he was quite fresh when he first started again, almost like he had just meditated for two hours before the show.

       At this point it's obvious that nothing we were told about the Vegas incident was anywhere close to the truth. Now, we're in a dark time where bringing it up gets you labelled a conspiracy theorist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I fucking hate what's happening to this country. We're being molded into a pussified, non questioning, mob-mentality swarm that blocks out anything related to critical thinking.  The moment you start working at finding things out or getting some actual stuff done, you're destroyed. If not physically than mentally by your peers/coworkers.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Vegas goes, we were lied to, we'll never know what really happened, and fuck the United States government for blatantly lying to the American people.

       This is important to remember. We have seen almost no evidence, of anything. The Las Vegas Chief of Police saying "This is what we think happened", while providing additional detail, is NOT evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think we will eventually get a report someday, maybe even soon, that will include something that counts as evidence. Maybe they found gunpowder residue on Paddock's hands, or his fingerprints on bullet casings. But to my knowledge they haven't released anything other than "This is what we think happened".

       Someone should track down the names of the lawsuits that were filed and monitor the docket, which is public. Not likely to prove fruitful exactly because discovery (i.e., investigative information) is not made part of the public record under normal circumstances. However, there may be motions file to compel disclosure of certain information that could be interesting or enlightening.

       I was reading on the conspiracy sub yesterday about Vegas. One of the theories is that it was a plot to assassinate the crown Prince of SA. Something about paddock being an arms dealer. This theory makes  way more sense than the "lone wolf " narrative. Also, not to get off topic, but if people are gonna mass murder, can you at least  make it count. Quit killing hard working Americans. Go after lobbyists and politicians. For fuck sakes

       Can we definitively state that the goal of the Vegas shooting wasn't to bolster gun control? Because nothing came of that and the Vegas shooting is already forgotten without causing any policy changes anywhere.

       I work at a restaurant with a girl who just took a job in loss prevention for Kohl’s. Her boss showed her that they could pull up the cameras on the parking lot and zoom over to the wal mart in the neighboring parking lot and zoom in enough to read tags on cars. In the store they could zoom in enough to make out the logo’s on purses as well as shoes. There is no way that the security footage in Vegas doesn’t show the faces of those involved in enough detail that you couldn’t plaster them on the news and have ppl identify them. I understand it’s an ongoing investigation but come on, something is up and the public needs to know what.

       Sometimes I think the general public does know there's something VERY wrong with this story, but no one in the MSM (with the exception of TC) ever talks about it-- because they have nothing to report except "It's been X amount of months and we still don't know anything about Las Vegas."
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, "regular people" don't have a place to voice their outrage (comments sections, etc.). So, it's sort of a chain of stupidity and ignorance...
      </p>
      <p>
       FBI--&gt;LVPD--&gt;MSM--&gt;PUBLIC
      </p>
      <p>
       If this was a more prevalent story, I do think more people would be asking questions. Instead, no one cares because they can't remember.

       Part of the problem is trying to sort out what's being covered up because of legal culpability and an illegal cover-up (hopefully you know what I mean).
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, questions surrounding lack of footage re: Paddock entering MB and using the freight elevator seems like MB just covering their ass in the event any of these lawsuits go to court. Eventually, they will HAVE TO hand them over.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, the TWO smashed windows and locked interior door are an entirely different story (among MANY other things).
      </p>
      <p>
       To make things even more confusing, some of the questions overlap. In the case of Jose Campos, I can definitely see why he was placed on Ellen and hidden away-- He's a major reason MGM could lose millions. But, the lack of time stamp and distress call sound are beyond fishy.

       That's a nice way to put it into perspective for people who don't do much shooting. So you're saying there should be 4.5 gallons of brass somewhere in the hotel room(s). I wonder what a good every day comparison we could make?
