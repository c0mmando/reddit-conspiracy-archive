       If you disagree with mods or if they find any slight, small, tiny reason to ban you they will.  Just an FYI.  I urge people to start moving on to other subs...please share them here.  They've started banning people in this thread:

       Are you saying that the mods are manipulating the votes? I think you meant other redditors, but I'm not sure. I just want some clarity before I decide to up/down/no vote you.

       That is in line with my comment. I never doubted the vote brigading. I said I don't believe it is tied to the mods. Both can be true at the same time with no contradiction.

       Its a powerful hammer made of metal from an ancient meteorite.  It was turned to hot molted metal and spun for a century creating the all powerful BanHammer used by our Mods.   You should test the power.

       I'm thinking it's like "dropping the hammer" with bans. I'm not sure what coming storm OP is referring to though. Usually bans aren't something you have to worry about unless you're being deliberately antagonistic.

       I don't know any of the mods, so no division necessary.  Just sharing my experience.  In that thread alone there were many saying they were treated the same (not sure if the comments are still there).  You can always see what was deleted by using ceddit.com btw if interested.  It's not that big of a deal for me, personally, I will move on, but I wanted to let others' know what is really going on here (especially seeing as we are a conspiracy sub).  Honestly most of the critical thinkers know this so I guess the motivation is just to warn others.  I can see that almost nobody wants to be warned.

       yes, let the sheep be sheep.i mean, you would have to be a sheep, in a conspiracy sub, that couldnt deal with the daily shilling, on a sub, that is highly regarded in a negative light. conspiracy to most sheep means "bullshit". for others, it means "probably truth involved". which is sad tbh. what do you think will happenwhen you move subs, do you think you will be safe from these specific people who make a life of discrediting free thinkers? sure, temporary solution, but long term, is just making the best of the current climate

       be strong. they want you to do exactly as you propose, so the sub is splintered, and whilst i dont doubt, dedicated subs regarding a more narrow scope could be better, there would be so much stuff we could miss out on. you just have to ignore the idiots (yes, il include myself in that, make your own choice, as you will, as a critical thinker). im fairly new on this sub, but i was drawn here, by repeated references on YT to stuff on here, and this sub seemed to have the head start on other things that would hit YT. after a while of just watching YT referencing links from here, i just made an account. ince i been here (maybe 1-2 months), i have learnt so much, whilst seeing people sharing things i already knew about, with a nice dose of political pushing, which is no different to me walking in my local shop and taking a glance at the newspaper rack. but all that aside, there is so much gold in this sub, it would be sad to see the people actually contributing and giving this sub its standing, leaving.  imagine with half a million members, and all the legit theorists leaving, and newcomers coming here, taking the numbers involved as credibility. its up to the real thinkers to keep on top of this sub. which is going to be hard as fuck. but, its  a battle that must be waged. if i had of come to this sub, post all the legit people leaving, (say, 2 years time, if people give up now), i would just be in a propaganda machine disguised as the community. dont give up

       Nice comment.  I will stick around underneath the surface.  There
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a lot to learn here, regardless, as you have said (even if the atmosphere has changed radically over the last 1-2 years).  I agree that splintering makes things harder and is a tactic.  Part of the problem is just the structure of Reddit.  I look forward to the day when Reddit is not the top platform "of this type".

       So I just looked at the comment that you were referring to.  You are referring to the sides being democrats vs republicans.  I thought you meant you dissed both those who were being censored and those who were censored (which is what I was referring to, not that they are conservatives being banned).  I see how you could see that's what I meant based off of what I linked, though, so my apologies I suppose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I agree that the republican vs democrat construct is unhealthy and idiotic but you must also understand that just because a user has posted on a certain other subreddit doesn't mean that their whole character is defined by being a "supporter" or "blindly following".  Sometimes it might mean that other people on that subreddit share their same views (ie maybe some were even from this subreddit) and so they are able to discuss like-minded things there.  Unfortunately now that means they are just "jokers" or "clowns" to you?  People who used to be your conspiracy-kin?  Maybe not to you, but to some indeed.  Stereotyping whole groups of people is not a smart thing to do, regardless of where you stand.  Reddit has promoted this.  Likewise, even if you personally don't stereotype these groups like that...you're view of being "above" or "outside" of current leaders comes off with the sort of style of a detached hipster (excuse my language).  This perspective can become a problem because even if someone does come along that can actually help change the world for the better and fix the "conspiracies", you will deny them that possibility.  Stuck in the mud forever.

       Yes, and if anybody ever tries to help the world to make it a better place...be sure to call both sides jokers or clowns so you can remain as the most all-knowing and Godly hipster of truth.  Our world will definitely have a chance at fixing our problems if we just deny the possibility of ever happening, right?

       If I may inflate your bubble a bit, it's mine too. That's the beauty of a public forum; it's everyone's playground. That they are so interested in this place is a testament to this sub's ability to (very) occasionally get some dynamite information.

       despite my highly unpoopular views, that i would perfectly accept a mod to be pissed with, i have not recieved a ban, or many warnings. i had a warning, for accidentlywriting a post, in letters larger then tolerated (i still dont know how that happened).but mods, have been noneexistent in my experience here. someone earlier go 2 rule 10s, in their replies to my comments ( i didnt see their comments, so dont know what they contained, i just saw the mods message of "rule 10". i think its pretty laid  back here. i have ben banned, for far less, in many other places on the internet. so maybe people should take not of font size, caps lock,and other little wierd things. after posting this, i guess il be permanantly banned as mods scour through my posts/comments lol

       Disagreed with a mod in a comment, got a 7 (or so) day ban. 5 minutes later got a perma-ban, been commenting on this sub for over 5 years on that account. Kind of a bummer.

       I don't know any of the mods, so no division necessary.  Just sharing my experience.  In that thread alone there were many saying they were treated the same (not sure if the comments are still there).  You can always see what was deleted by using ceddit.com btw if interested.  It's not that big of a deal for me, personally, I will move on, but I wanted to let others' know what is really going on here (especially seeing as we are a conspiracy sub).  Honestly most of the critical thinkers know this so I guess the motivation is just to warn others.  I can see that almost nobody wants to be warned.
