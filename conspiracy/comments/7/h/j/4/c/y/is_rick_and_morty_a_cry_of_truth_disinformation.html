        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Conspiracy Time.</p>

<p>The anti-Rick and Morty crowd is a disinformation group, and Rick and Morty is a cry of truth.</p>

<p>Consider the fact that Rick and Morty deals with issues on the cutting edge of science, questioning the reality of our existence, could it be a way to discredit and divert the debate.</p>

<p>This takes the form of your basic ad hominem attacks, &#39;guilty by association&#39; fallacy, such as :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I hear that people who are fans of Rick and Morty are also talking about dimensional travel, multiverse theory, simulation theory, aliens, overarching galactic government, looking into other potential timelines, and so on, but people who are fans of Rick and Morty are also shrieking &quot;Pickle Rick&quot; to one another on the streets. I&#39;m not sure I can put any stock into people like that, therefore I guess what they are trying to say is also just as stupid.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I hear that people talking about dimensional travel, multiverse theory, simulation theory, aliens, overarching galactic government, looking into other potential timelines, and so on, but those concepts are also in Rick and Morty, Rick and Morty is a morally subversive, and distasteful program, therefore I can also attribute those traits to the ideas contained within.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are more layers to it, but you don&#39;t wanna know about it here.
If you want more info on logical fallacies, please go here : <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/index.html#index">http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/index.html#index</a></p>

<p>Or, for the same reasons, is Rick and Morty itself the disinformation campaign.</p>

<p>Anti-intellectualism is a serious problem, which has been seen in fascist governments and oppressive governments.
The next step is usually burning books.</p>

<p>And you know what they say, anywhere they burn books, they will soon enough burn people.</p>

<p>Or maybe it&#39;s just a cartoon that we all enjoy, and nothing more, these topics are contained within it for the very fact that they are on the cutting edge of science, challenging the traditional concept of the nature of reality, is why they are used in a cartoon about a scientist exploring those areas.</p>

<p>All I know is that incest porn should have a more mainstream appeal.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading. Keep watching the skis!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s just a cartoon. Ricks musings about the universe and the futility of emotions and attachments are not in a vacuum. They are almost always challenged, sometimes rightly sometimes wrongly by Morty on the regular. </p>

<p>There’s lots of commentary on the struggles of marriage, the consequences of teen pregnancy, personal responsibility and social or cultural expectations. </p>

<p>But none of which I believe is designed to be some sort of disinformation campaign or virtue signaling to the proletariat. As someone said above, it’s just a woke cartoon, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick &amp; Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂</p>

<p>And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick &amp; Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎</p>

    <div class="md"><p>anything that takes your time away from you is disinfo to you and your world. All cartoons are mind rotting, all tv programming is.   Nothing different w this show.    Faced with the daily attacks on the vast number of issues that your life depends on, what on earth is Rick &amp; Morty offering to you?  Does Morty&#39;s constant whining help you feel more #woke or more #cholita?  Good, feeling woke is the first step. Am I able to take the next step... or am I stuck repeating step one ....over and over again like a post-modern Nietzschean retard?  There&#39;s a good reason Freud used that nutcase as his baseline for modern psychology ...which Jung took to build his &quot;hero&#39;s journey&quot; myth.  So now we have Harmon stating that his template for the show is &quot;hero&#39;s journey&quot;. So there you have it... why THAT one?  Do you personally feel hero&#39;s journey is a helpful myth or is it just another Santa Claus domestic fantasy fostering messianic visions?  I do like cartoon shows,  but realistically it is childish escapism.  that&#39;s precious but what&#39;s new?</p>
