       With all the firepower that Anonymous has in hacking capability, why shouldn't they... or haven't they just picked a person, (anyone it does not matter), told them their points, then hacked them into office?

       - If they can hack financial services, why not poorly secured (

       ) After all, there is even a convention to hack into voting booths, and it is extremely easy for anyone with any form of hacking power. Someone with the power to attack heavily secured financial institutions should quite easily be able to take some voting booths, (which are, again, extremely easy to hack).

       I think what you’re missing are the consequences. An unsecured system is not really dependent on hacker skill. A lucky hit is all that’s needed. Regarding the scenario you mentioned, this would be found out, elections declared void, systems tightened and a second vote would be conducted.

       Russia?

      <p>
       Even if you believe that Russia did not hack the elections, the uproar is deafening, to the point where it is surprising the elections haven't been thrown out. This lucky "hit" would be easy with such a large amount of computational power. Assuming it was found out, why couldn't they just place the news covering it in boxes, (dead ends in websites), block the news of it, (snip reruns of older, (though not outdated), news segments on top), then ignore it? It would be easy to just keep it secret, anyway, as the boxes are not checked enough to matter- until it is too late.

       You do realize that the uproar comes from people repeating what their preferred politicians cried out, right? Absolutely no evidence has been presented to the public, so anybody calling this out as fact, is, in fact, not talking about facts, but opinion.

       Politicians are corrupt, just tell them they can have cabinet, positions, or an electoral boost, (supporting speech). If they refuse, bribe them straight up. Or failing that, kill them, if you can doctor the news, why not the truth? (The person just disappears, and Anon. has them move to an acid bath or something). The politicians are the least of the concerns here.

       Politicians are corrupt; bribe them, offer them cabinet positions, VP, a speech supporting them, or failing all that, just make them disappear to some acid bath somewhere, then smear them with the junk on their computer, (if you can hack the election, why not people?) Alternatively, hack their computer, then smear them publicly, which removes the threat of their position.

       Or coordinately take individual voting booths. Or they could be masquerading as Russia in the past election in order to set up a populist. Trump would be to radicalize the population further, causing increased tensions, allowing for a dictatorial candidate to more easily be placed in.

       anonymous is the government. only idiots believe parading around in chinese manufactured masks, and sticking vocoders on videos to narrate them is legit. anonymous is the greatets scam out there.but DW, we will just continue to run around wearing chinese made, guy fawkes masks, popularised, by hollywood, in v for vendetta

       It doesn't have to for this purpose, you really only need a distributed computational network to hack something like this, or far less, really, (just a small chip to insert at the booth). Those small chips would be easily planted by the individuals in Anonymous, electing a candidate who follows the whims of Anon.- which I would call far more fun than prancing around in Guy Fawkes masks accomplishing little with much.

       They've had a few successes with DDoS attacks, but I believe you're completely overestimating Anonymous if you think they can not only hack a US election but also somehow get away with it. I can maybe see an Anonymous-backed candidate doing decently in an election if most of Anonymous unified behind a candidate with an widespread campaign and a commitment to vote for said candidate, but that's about it.
