<p>The scope of corporate greed blows my mind. They&#39;re trashing the earth for profit. And the way everyone just slaves away at jobs they hate just to make money. I dunno, it feels like everything is fucked. I&#39;m just hoping the pendulum has swung so far to one side that the current situation has got to give eventually. Maybe then we&#39;ll see some positive change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you go camping a lot? Ive had this urge to go camping, and actually thinking back to when i would.  its like a hard reset on your body and state of mind. Real man vs nature camping though, no porta pottys or restrooms. Im talking camping with no cell service miles away from civilization. The mile hike back to the car after 4 or 5 days is always bitter sweet and eye opening. I think most of todays problems is we are so out of tune with nature and now that everyone is plugged in its not just the city folks losing their minds. </p>

<p>&quot;Not only is the universe stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine.&quot;</p>

<p>So, these clowns calling me weird are basically saying I&#39;m the realest most natural thing they&#39;ve seen in a while since weird is nature&#39;s default state. What&#39;s worrying is when everything becomes the same - The Clone Wars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree. Being disconnected from nature is being disconnected from our deepest, truest self. We are a part of nature and nature gives us life. A week camping is a spiritual and emotional recharge that more people really need to discover and take part in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, most definitely. I&#39;m just saying that there came a time when society was doing pretty good. A time when family values were strong and just one bread winner could take care of the finances. It&#39;s been on a constant downhill slide since then. This is just a generalized statement, though. There have always been struggles for people. It just seems more the norm now.</p>

<p>So much of our happiness depends on how we look at the world. Good luck, buddy:)</p>

<p>People have degrees. People are more productive. Yet wages are stagnant  and benefits are being carved away. Pensions are almost non existent these days. Health care costs out of control. </p>

<p>The shareholders over everyone demand 5% growth per quarter consistently or you are dubbed a failure in the board room. So you squeeze and squeeze people who are compensated less and dollar value is worth less every year to meet those goals. Multiply that over every industry that people rely upon to survive.</p>

<p>The confiscation of wealth has been long enacted on the very workers that  have given rise to unprecedented productivity and market value, but these workers are not rewarded for their efforts. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/AdoQnWH.png">The money stays at the top while the workers get beaten down year after year.</a> </p>

<p>We have become more valuable. We just aren&#39;t compensated for that value, and are rewarded with pay cuts and benefit cuts while <a href="https://i.imgur.com/MZsH14Q.png">those at the top soak in the rewards.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most important factor today is that consumption is down, and consumption is 71% of our economy. We are in a Catch-22 economy. Corporations are not going to increase capital investments because there is not enough demand. But there is not enough demand because wages are low.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People are just asking for their fair share of the record productivity. You wouldn&#39;t need to increase taxes on people if workers were fairly compensated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good Bones by Maggie Smith</p>

<p>Life is short, though I keep this from my children.
Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine
in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,
a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways
I’ll keep from my children. The world is at least
fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative
estimate, though I keep this from my children.
For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.
For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,
sunk in a lake. Life is short and the world
is at least half terrible, and for every kind
stranger, there is one who would break you,
though I keep this from my children. I am trying
to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,
walking you through a real shithole, chirps on
about good bones: This place could be beautiful,
right? You could make this place beautiful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s definitely scaring predicting what our future generations are going to become, but note that fear is just a part of us. We can live to work and fight for those we value. Whether an idea or our own humanity stands in our way, we take only the knowledge that matters to us at face value. Seeing beyond the curtains is a risk to our developing perspectives and awareness (especially when you&#39;re under a hierarchy) as it shifts between two different realities. Looking at each headline is just our way of patrolling our way of life. The worry that your body produces to cope with your circumstances is not much different than others. What it comes down to is how strong you can set your mentality to do what it sets out to do. Solutions and rules are made to change and adapting to new knowledge is constantly happening. Taking preventive measures will only collide against others&#39;s reality eventually and that&#39;s my philosophy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are entering the scarcity of resources phase. This includes everything: water, home, fossil fuel, money, mate(!), job, education as well. </p>

<p>We are obviously seeing a massive class divide where many work two monism jobs and the few live in a gilded mostly unwalled fantasy. It will cost out of pocket in a few years $500,000 for a private school education for college and grad school. The value of such degrees themselves are questionable now even. </p>

<p>We will start seeing a huge number environmental refugees, most notably from coastal areas but in particular Bangladesh as it hopelessly floods. Most will be turned away and left to die. </p>

<p>People are getting both fatter and dumber. Food is both cheap and bad. Social media is making their users childlike as they bid for attention from the lowest common denominator. </p>

<p>The west has undergone a huge demographic shift. The results are also questionable, but prognosis is poor fir his. My city spends more per child on education than elite suburbs. The students themselves are poor learners. 46% have English as a second language. So-called liberal whites have quietly pulled almost all of their children out of the city school system, leaving 13% of their children at the systems  mercy. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s also not forget the apparent &quot;menace&quot; of automation on the horizon. An industrialist&#39;s wet dream is about to be realized and trust me, you aren&#39;t going to teach 55 year old truckers how to code after they&#39;ve been laid off. </p>

<p>This is not a nuclear winter that threatened us as children but a slow, decaying timeline instead. </p>

<p>It is possible to correct this path, but the status quo will need to change. I think everyone is fucking stupid if you think Labor Day barbecues and sending your grandchildren off to grad school would ever be a permanent thing for you or your neighbors . </p>

<p>Not so! FAR from it. It&#39;s the <em>distribution of resources</em> which is FUBAR ,, that&#39;s why there is a 1% and that&#39;s why it&#39;s FUBAR for the &#39;rest of us&#39;</p>

<p>But there&#39;s a great passage from one of the &quot;Freakanomics&quot; books about how horse shit was once taking over New York City in the late 19th Century. Horse-drawn carriages were everywhere, the horses were shitting everywhere, it would pile up and up on the streets, people were getting sick all the time, nobody knew what to do.</p>

<p>New York City convened a huge gathering of experts and strategists to figure out what to do. It was a disaster, nobody could agree, everybody had their own agenda, the gathering broke up early, a complete failure. No one knew what to do or what would happen.</p>

<p>Months later, the internal combustion engine was invented. In a couple years there were almost no horse drawn carriages. The shit problem was solved from a totally unexpected and unpredicted invention.</p>

<p>Things like this happen throughout history. We may be on the cusp of it happening again. </p>

<p>I went to walmart at 6am to get some things to better sleep in my car more comfortably.</p>

<p>The checkout guy and i do the usual dance of &quot;how are you&quot; bs.  He says &quot;another day in paradise&quot; and I say &quot;i hear ya&quot; then paused and said, &quot;keep voting republican (yes i know ultimately it doesn&#39;t matter, but it does matter when it comes to some very important things) so they can pass tax bills.&quot;  He says, &quot;yeah we&#39;re screwed&quot; and I said &quot;yep, were all fucked, unless you own a jet...&quot; he nodded and as I walked away he said &quot;but, i have a glock 9&quot; and I chuckled.</p>

<p>Drive back to a cheap motel I&#39;m &quot;staying at&quot; along with sleeping in my car.  The girl at the front desk manages the motel, and she&#39;s awesome, always in a good mood and happy.  But, she has 3 kids, makes $9 an hour, no daycare, no insurance, no sick days, and they don&#39;t even give her a room at the motel which very rarely fills up.  She&#39;s renting a house she got for cheap, but her heater broke and the landlord isn&#39;t fixing it.  Her fellow church goers gave her two small electric heaters for her kids rooms.</p>

<p>Sounds like you need to move, friend.  I grew up in a town like that and it was pretty terrible.  However, not all communities are like that.  I&#39;m not sure my shared community &quot;treasures my soul and understands my feelings&quot; - but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s typical of human nature in general.

    <div class="md"><p>Fellow Canadian here..... I agree; our real estate market is fucked but that&#39;s about all. </p>

<p>Canada is a vastly superior place to live. Not saying it&#39;s perfect (ie the way our government treats First Nations people is appalling, our central bank is owned by the Rothschilds like almost every other country, we are failing the environment in our quest for fossil fuels in Alberta, etc etc) but I&#39;ll take Canada over the USA any day. </p>

<p>Mass shootings? Police brutality? Nazi rallies? Ridiculous income inequality? (Not saying these things don&#39;t/can&#39;t/won&#39;t happen here...)</p>

<p>Where I live, people get along for the most part. Of all  races, religions, colours and creeds. I feel safe all day everyday. Thankful for that and I hope the rest of the world can learn some things from us. </p>
