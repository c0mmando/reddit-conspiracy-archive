<p>I like to drive down into the comment and submission history of the users responsible for the brigading. </p>

<p>What I quickly noticed is that most of their reddit histories are on video game chat subs or completely irrelevant corners I call karma farms. I think this is how they “raise” their users. </p>

<p>Once you do this is it so obvious shills are literally everywhere on reddit especially this sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub has a huge problem with duplicate content  threads overall. I think it promotes forum sliding and circlejerking, as well as splits the conversation at time. Many of the duplicates don&#39;t add anything to the convo, it&#39;s just repackaging and i suspect many users don&#39;t even watch the YouTube links, given they start shitposting in shorter time than it takes to watch. </p>

<p>I also recognize that if mods tightened rules then users would throw a tantrum over censorship. So they&#39;re in a shitty spot. </p>

<p>Another related issue is several users who drop several posts at a time every day, at the same times often. Could be users genuinely dedicated to the sub, karma farmers, astroturfers/forumsliders, and people otherwise trying to promote their own content/domains. </p>

<p>They certainly keep the sub content filled but I notice that some don&#39;t comment often or ever.  It would be cool if users were encouraged to post an explanatory comment when they link a YouTube video and other low effort posts.  </p>

<p>There are other older, major users who have hundreds of thousands of post karma from stuff like that. Sometimes you can catch alts by seeing who’s spamming the same domain (marvinqt and mightbemarvin with blacklistednews.com, for example. Both shadowbanned now.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I’ve observed there’s four major types that get pushed in waves: msm news that’s big enough, alt-media/hitpieces, distraction/fluff, self post/rule 12 material.   </p>

<p>I consider accounts like that pretty bad actually, as they do not act human (I.e. don’t communicate or interact). Those accounts can be sold, used to manipulate votes (note all the users posting that domain are probably the same user), and used to earn themselves money. That’s not even mentioning potential attempts to propagandize the sub and sow discord. </p>
