       Well, it is really simple:
      </p>
      <p>
       So what?
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea being pushed here is that X means nothing because Y happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is just stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me put it into terms you might understand:
      </p>
      <p>
       A republican congress attacked Hillary over Benghazi. They didn't like Hillary and because they didn't anything about that investigation means nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       They pushed out lies, etc, about her, then investigated her all for political reasons. Did that stop the investigations? Did it negate any information gleaned from it (her server, emails, etc)?
      </p>
      <p>
       You tell me - did their motivation and actions mean nothing? Are you willing to ignore all the investigations into her since the 90's because people doing said investigations didn't like her?

       That is the new profile type they are rolling out. They talked about it earlier this year.

       I didn't opt into it (and my older accounts didn't use it). Never really looked at it until you said something, but that is how they plan on having everyone's eventually.

       Comey the Clown was head of the FBE, which stands for Federal Bureau of Exonerations, and the line of Hillary-buttkissing RINOs is as long as the Democrat line headed by Bernie...Are these terms you might understand?  The absolute
       <em>
        worship
       </em>
       by the bipartisan mainstream of all things Hillary must have escaped your notice; also the fact that only crooked Lyndonian Satanist scum "investigate" Hillary must have escaped your notice as well...The haters making YouTube be the lone investigatory thing happening with Hillary ain't hating because of political reasons; 'political reasons' is what makes them alone in investigating.  She and her scum-sucking pig of a husband are as hateworthy as the Bushes, who really aren't even a separate crime family.

       She isn't. Should she be?
      </p>
      <p>
       Was she convicted of anything other then in the court of rw public opinion?
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't think so.

      <p>
       Amazing how the right is sooo concerned with justice and her and then totally turn a blind eye to Trump and his business dealings, ethics, etc and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get is. She helps distract the right from their failings of being consistent on their 'values'.

       Just to hone in the the thesis of the bullshit you just spewed. Youre saying its okay to use the justice department as political retaliation,  because some dipshits in congress (not trump or his team, but the jackass gop) investigated hillary clinton?

       No, I didn't say that.

       What I am saying is...Why bitch now when people on the right were all for that before?
      </p>
      <p>
       Consistency is important. Look at what conservatives were whining about under Obama and look at them now...they are silent on those things with Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       What was it...oh yeah "lock her up". How did that turn out? And people wanted to lock her up with no trial and after multiple investigations since the 90's?
      </p>
      <p>
       Looks like the ones getting locked up over crimes are trump people - and suddenly some folks want them to get a pass. Maybe them folks never really cared about laws and such, they just wanted a political enemy jailed. Sick people imho.

       Thats fair. Ill give you that. Although it is worth point out that the email investigation is looking more and more like a sham. With special agents in charge are sending politically charged anti trump text/emails back and forth, immunity deals being handed out like opiods, and the deputy director and lead investigators wives receieving large donations to political campaigns coninciding with the investigation.

       Manafort was arrest for illicit deals during his time working with the podesta group. Which is a huge DNC backer. Flynn lied to the fbi and is taking his medicine. The other no namer is exactly that, a no namer. Als9, worth pointing out, none of the supposed crimes have anything remotely dealing with russian collusion in before the election. This investigation is well off its intended purpose.

       And the Benghazi investigation went in other directions as well. As did watergate.

       Birth cert and college transcripts with the right and obama - Trump's taxes though?
      </p>
      <p>
       The right swore Obama would ban guns (he expanded where they could be carried). They said he would he would turn the US into a caliphate, would make gas $6/gal, fema shit and jade helm, he was born in Kenya, he played golf and watched Benghazi go down on live video and denied aid...and the list goes on and on and on. And don't forget how they talked about his drone strikes (the same people bitching about that loved the wars)
      </p>
      <p>
       But with trump? Question anything he does and you are the msm, hate him, are deep state, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go back and listen to rush or hannity, look at fox and brietbart, etc and what they said and complained about. It isn't hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then look at them now.
      </p>
      <p>
       You remember the "Moral Majority" and how people during Obama's presidency whined about how Obama was an embarrassment to the world and how we should care what other countries thought about us? Well...now they say screw them and why should we care what others think about us.  Remember 2012 and Romney and the right saying Obama was naive about Russia and we shouldn't trust them? Well, they sure changed their minds didn't they?

       I think we are talking about truth in one aspect and concern in another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary, for example, is a no one and could care less about her. She is an egomaniac who carpetbagged her way into the senate with a desire to be president. And she and the dnc screwed over Bernie to boot.
      </p>
      <p>
       But she is, as I said, a nobody. At least today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who has the most power and influence right now? Trump and republicans. Who is profiting from the presidency? Trump and his family (compare that to people who complained about hillary and speeches).
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't like bill or hillary? Ok, I don't either. But you want to see real crime? Bush and 9/11. Then there is ashcroft and crew, iran contra, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       But today we have someone new in power - and shouldn't we keep tabs on them in real time so we don't go through all this shit in 4 years (or more) and look back on it all and say "Gosh, didn't see that shit back then!"?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a man obstructing justice, profiting off the office, etc and so on (and the list is long). Forgive me for wanting to keep up on current events over older ones. But we employ these people, they answer to us. I called out Obama on his shit (aca - the man hated that idea and wanted single payer. And yemen and drones? Etc and so on) and I damned well think we should all hold trump to the same standards we have others.

       This statement shows how naive you are.  I am kinda neutral on Trump as he has done some good some bad.  His great sin here is winning the election Hillary was owed by Barry for not running in 2012.  Aside from that he pissed all over his own supposed party.

       So your argument is the

       person and reason for the Russia investigation was this one agent? Not that anyone's ever talked about it, he got Mueller appointed right? No that was Rosenstein.

       Maybe if we had people actually interested in cleaning up corruption in D.C. and draining the swamp, he'd be indicted along with Clinton.

       So counterintel guy Storzk, who specialized in Russia stuff in general, was on the team before there was a special counsel.  He was the one that signed to open the investigation and served higher up on that team. Trump fires Comey and admits that it was because he didnt like the Russia investigation.  Sessions recuses himself because of his involvement in the matters of the investigation.  As a result, Congress appoints special counsel Mueller who, from the sound of it, integrates the current investigation into his own team.
      </p>
      <p>
       In summer of this year, Mueller removes this guy, Storzk, from the investigation for partisan private messages, presumably because he wants the i vestigation to be carried out with no doubt for the outcome; afterall, the confidence in Mueller being nonpartisan and being good at his job is why he had bipartisan support when appointed.  Unrelated to the Russia investigation, Storzk also served as part of the Clinton email investigation and was on the panel that decided what language to use for the report.  His contribution was to call Clinton's mess careless instead of negligent, the language was agreed upon and the report was completed.  A reason Trump cited before firing Comey and begore later telling CNN that ot was because of the Russia investigation was his dissatisfaction with the Clinton investigation, presumably the outcome not being what he wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, considering how Trump has openly claimed that he is dissatisfied with the result of the Clinton email investigation, because of the timing of these allegations about Storzk are only now coming out as a result his partisan message that he sent and because, the most obvious thing, this is being pushed as an issue just barely after Flynn gave himself up, is now cooperating with the investigation and also now there's stuff about Deutsche Bank also cooperating with the investigation.  It certainly looks like focus on Storzk is being pushed as a distraction.  One of the biggest issues is that he was reportedly removed in summer, and we are only finding out now.  If there was a connection to be made, it wouldve more than likely have been made before then, especially since he's the one who signed off on starting the investigation to begin with.
