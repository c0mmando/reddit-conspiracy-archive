    <div class="md"><p>In all honesty, the fact is you don&#39;t have a better option for President. By trying to get rid of Trump you only create an opportunity for that vacuum to be filled by someone worse. For example, another lap dog for the Bush and Clinton crime syndicates.</p>

<p>The Democrats must surely be eliminated so trying to make an opening for them by propping up our fake two-party system is just a joke.</p>

<p>Our goal should be the elimination of the fake two-party system.  We should start by eliminating one of the major parties first. As the Democrat Party is an incredibly weak state, we should kill that one first. The argument for destroying the DNC can be easily made as they are the traditional party of racism, fascism, false flag wars, slavery, globalist treason, etc.</p>

<p>The same arguments can be made for the NeoCon &quot;Bush wing&quot; of the Republican party so if the Republican party can&#39;t be purified of the Bush wing then we will need to take them down as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In any case, this isn&#39;t a &quot;republican vs democrat&quot; dialectic. Your comment is obviously an attempt to proliferate the fake two-party discussion. </p>

<p>The Democrats must be eliminated because they are an essential component of a mass fraud being perpetrated on the American people. They are the easiest to eliminate and they are a beach head of corrupt influence on the American political system. </p>

<p>They are the easiest to eliminate because their control over both federal and state governments is virtually non-existent. They are an injured beast and it our responsibility to put them down. </p>

<p>This is not Republican Party favoritism. This is recognizing that one wing of this turkey bird is damaged. </p>

<p>It is easier to kill one party at a time than to try to take them both our at once. </p>

<p>It is this system which socially engineers the masses and &#39;the swinging pendulum&#39; while sneaking in their various objectives that must be destroyed. </p>

<p>The Democratic Party proved it had to be destroyed when it bypassed the democratic process (using the Superdelegate System) by selecting a candidate under suspicion of multiple murders &amp; guilty of the mass murder at Waco and various other crimes as President.</p>

<p>So yes, the Democratic Party should be eliminated. Focus should then shift on splitting the Libertarian wing from the Republican Party </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if you&#39;re aware but Bush is a Republican. You clearly lean to the right because you want to save libertarians but completely destroy the entire democratic party and old school republicans. Were you saying we need to completely destroy the Republican party after Obama won his first election? That includes libertarians. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How would that even remotely make sense? I did believe that destroying the Republican Party was conceivable after Bush was wildly unpopular. However, the the party of the President isn&#39;t the only indicator as the weakness of the Party. Even when Obama was President the Republicans held the majority of the individual State governments. There was a balance between Republican control of States vs. Democrat control of the Federal government.</p>

<p>That balance no longer exists. Republicans control both State &amp; Federal spheres of government to a huge extent. I have no problem with this, I have a bigger problem with this constant &quot;back and forth pendulum swinging&quot; being perpetuated by social engineering.</p>

<p>If all we want is a multiparty system, then the Libertarian branch of the Republican Party is more than sufficient to maintain a multi-party system. I personally believe in George Washington&#39;s view that there shouldn&#39;t be ANY political parties and I consider &quot;single party&quot; rule to be no different from &quot;no parties&quot; because at that point a &quot;party&quot; is simply a competition of the individuals within in it.</p>

<p>REGARDLESS, the Repubican Party is easier to argue for keeping in that because it does not have a &quot;super delegate&quot; system to corrupt the process in the democratic election of its candidate.</p>

<p>As of right now, the Democratic Party is being propped up by an axiom of the Open Society followers of Karl Popper who believe that &quot;opposition must exist for opposition&#39;s sake&quot; as a requirement for Popper&#39;s definition of a &#39;free society&#39;</p>

<p>Popper&#39;s Open Society definition requiring &quot;opposition forces&quot; is of course, stupid bullshit, a failed thesis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your view of the Democratic party is severely outdated. You&#39;re thinking of the South. The one that is currently Republican. Who fought to keep civil war statues up? Republicans. Who had neo nazis at their rally, unite the left of unite the right? Which party does the NAACP support? Which party fights for minority rights?

    <div class="md"><p>1) The Republicans got the vote for Blacks &amp; Women
2) The Democrat&#39;s treatment of the NAACP and black communities are merely proof of their urban plantation strategy.
3) The &quot;Southern Switch&quot; strategy time line doesn&#39;t match up with the facts. That is merely Democrat Party propaganda they made up (just like the Russian collusion garbage is made up) </p>

<p>We have an obligation to the truth, not in helping a specific party save face. </p>

<p>Republicans don&#39;t fight for the rights of &quot;minorities&quot; they fight for the rights of &quot;the individual&quot; in the context of the &quot;bill of rights&quot; irregardless of skin color etc. The Democrats invent or prop up &quot;minority definitions&quot; because they are race obsessed. </p>

<p>Republicans didn&#39;t fight to keep &quot;Civil War&quot; statues up, they fought to keep up &quot;historical relics&quot;</p>

<p>The Democrats attempts to destroy &quot;historical relics and monuments&quot; is no different from the Taliban destroying Buddhist statues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re using Presidential politics during a World War to try and reflect a switch. However, the real fact isn&#39;t in Presidential elections but in whether or not the Elected Representatives of the time changed or switched parties in the State and Federal House &amp; Senate.</p>

<p><a href="https://hillarysamericathemovie.com/evidence/assets/images/stills/Hillary_Imac_DPX__00000.00_53_13_14.Still061.jpg">The facts exposing the &quot;Southern Switch&quot; strategy lie are exposed in this picture here</a></p>

<p>The only people who &#39;switched&#39; were Albert Watson, Andy Ireland, Billy Tauzin, Bob Stump, David Duke, Greg Laughlin, James W. Grant, Jimmy Hayes, John Jarman, Michael Parker, Nathan Deal, Phil Gramm, Richard Shelby, and Strom Thurmond.</p>

<p>The change was, in fact, due to the economic situation that had arisen during WW2: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The very basis of the Southern economy was to change profoundly. At the beginning of World War II, roughly 40 percent of the South was still employed in agriculture, a share twice that of the rest of the nation. By 1990, that figure was down to 1 percent, a smaller agricultural sector than the non-South. In its place, a modern occupational distribution inevitably emerged. The agricultural economy, and its agrarian society, were gone. An industrial, and then within short order a post-industrial, economy and society had appeared</p>
</blockquote>

<p>further</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, according to The End of Southern Exceptionalism by Byron Shafer &amp; Richard Johnston, both blacks and non-racist Southeners switched parties due to changes in economic opportunities. Since 1860, less than 1% of Southern Democrat representatives (elected as racist KKK dudes) switched parties. The Big Switch is a known fabrication to help the Democratic Party save face after it &quot;bribed / blackmailed / bought&quot; the black vote.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the details here. The South didn&#39;t switch because the Republicans abandoned their anti-racist &quot;Northern views&quot; and suddenly started appealing to racists. The South switched because the voters became less racists and chased out the Democrats while the democrats ran and hid in Urban ghettos to continue their dreams as the &quot;minority masters&quot;</p>

<p>As for corporate interests being our interest, corporate interest drive the economy and jobs.  Government policies (and unions) can drive those corporate interests offshore, but if you can harness their power you really have a strong economy, job market and country.</p>

<p>There have been 3 arrests so far.  Manafort, Papadapolous, and Flynn.</p>

<p>Manafort and his underlings are charged with tax evasion and money laundering.  Nothing to do with Russia.</p>

<p>Papadapolous is charged about lying to the FBI about his attempts to setup a meeting with Russians which was denied.  Twice.</p>

<p>Flynn is charged with lying to the FBI about Russia contact AFTER Trump was elected.  God knows why he lied but it has nothing to do with Trump&#39;s campaign.</p>

<p>Trump Jr.?  Yeah, he was lured to a meeting with false promises.  He released the entire email chain.  No arrest there and I will guarantee you he won&#39;t be arrested.  You know why?  Because it&#39;s not illegal to get information about your opponent from foreign sources.   You don&#39;t believe me?  Where do you think the Trump dossier came from?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think if you tried a bit more balance and said &quot;some of the left,&quot; rather than &quot;the left&quot; you would sound a little more believable.</p>

<p>Remember, the Nazi&#39;s were bastards but Hitler was a vegetarian who just happened to like gassing people.</p>

<p>The big problem here is that &quot;most of the right&quot; have just suddenly realized that they have been lied to and used for political purposes and the person that pointed it out to them was Trump.  Who has then gone on to to tell more lies as president in less than a year than any other president in history whilst he rules squarely on behalf of the elite 1%.</p>

<p>This is not to say any other president was particularly good, except Ronald Reagan, of course, who didn&#39;t tell any lies at all.  Well, at least he couldn&#39;t remember any lies he told.</p>

<p>Fancy someone like Trump waking you up to the fact that you&#39;ve been lied to and then being marched willingly down a path to an abyss by him whilst defending his even bigger lies.  </p>

Ask yourself why the hell we would allow another country to gain control of 20% of our uranium production when we have to import 90% of our uranium from other countries? Uranium is a huge national security asset and the clowns crying &quot;RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA&quot; are literally the ones who sold those assets to the evil Russians.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.virginiauranium.com/uranium-101/uranium-market-u-s-uranium-sources/">http://www.virginiauranium.com/uranium-101/uranium-market-u-s-uranium-sources/</a></p>

<p>Have you not picked up on the obvious entrapment schemes the former administration and bad actors in Intel community played on Trump? Fusion GPS was hired to do this. Russian lawyer met with Fusion before and after meeting with Don Jr. Russians were paid with funds provided by Hillary, DNC, RNC and FBI to help compile the dossier that was used as evidence to justify an investigation and probably to gain FISA warrant.  The only reason we have this Russian conspiracy theory is because CrowdStrke claimed the Russians hacked the DNC. Nobody else has see the server and the evidence and crowdstrke did a lot of stalling and pleading the 5th when asked to answer questions at hearings. </p>
