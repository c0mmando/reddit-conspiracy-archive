<p>here I am asking, what&#39;s the deal with the Euclidean vs Non-Euclidean problem? I would <strong>love</strong> an answer, so I can put this to bed, so I can see, yes, wow, I can see for myself that the earth is round and not flat, and this proves it.</p>

<p>but I&#39;m getting a lot of, &#39;are you retarded&#39;, &#39;science say this, science says that&#39;, and, &#39;you can&#39;t seriously believe that&#39;</p>

<p>which one of us is saying, &#39;there is nothing you can say to convince me otherwise&#39; and which one is saying &#39;answer this simple question&#39;</p>

<hr/>

<hr/>

<p>Flat Earth Society (FES), as the title says, is a disinfo group.</p>

<p>They are not looking for proof of the shape of the earth, they are spreading lies and half truths.</p>

<p>ie : this article relating to Elon Musk and his round Mars claim <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/259821-flat-earth-society-trolls-elon-musk-claims-mars-round">https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/259821-flat-earth-society-trolls-elon-musk-claims-mars-round</a></p>

<p>where FES claim </p>

<blockquote>
<p>unlike the Earth, Mars has been observed to be round</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and also </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me be clear: I’m assuming the FES is trolling mostly because I’m dubious that any group that so thoroughly rejects science, geometry, and basic math is willing to accept any evidence of how planets shape themselves. Wading into their “scientific” explanations for the shape of the Earth is like being kicked in the head by a mule and falling into a vat of stupid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Flat Earth theory does not say that Mars is observed to be round, it says, it can only be observed to be a dot in the sky, it might just be a giant dome.</p>

<p>relating to FES standpoint on gravity, Flat Earth does not say the disk shoots up at 9.8m per second per second simulating gravity, it says that everything is density, that&#39;s why things float and sink.</p>

<p>Do not believe the Flat Earth Society, use your own mind, look for yourself.</p>

<p>Also, still waiting for an answer re this : <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7gwvb4/everyones_got_an_angle/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7gwvb4/everyones_got_an_angle/</a></p>

<p>which relates to this point against flat earth from the linked Musky article </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The evidence Flat Earthers cite to justify their views are claims that were disproven thousands of years ago. The Greek mathematician, astronomer, and geographer Eratosthenes (276-194 BC) calculated the circumference of the Earth within a 10 to 15 percent margin of error with extremely simple tools and observations. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>it also says </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clinging to simplistic, easily rebutted arguments doesn’t make you an independent thinker.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is why I find it so strange that no one can find the hole in the Eratosthenes angle problem. if it&#39;s so simple, then answer the question. </p>

<p>Thanks, and keep watching the skis! :)</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Nope. It&#39;s called perspective - something you flat earthers love to talk about until it rebuts your arguments.</p>

<p>The &quot;vanishing point&quot; for an object is the distance from the camera or eye at which the apparent size of the object becomes to small for the camera or eye to resolve. Obviously this means the object becomes &quot;invisible&quot; unless a higher resolution camera or eye is used, at which point the &quot;vanishing point&quot; simply moves further away.</p>

<p>If you had a perfect camera able to resolve any size object at any distance, the &quot;vanishing point&quot; will be at infinity.</p>

<p>That is why you can zoom in a camera and make something too small to see become visible again.</p>

<p>However, what you <em>can&#39;t</em> do is zoom in a camera and make only <em>half</em> of something visible, unless something else is blocking the view.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/i46MFv4.png">Vanishing Point vs Horizon</a></p>

<p>In this image I have created a sequence of red stars, scaling each one down by 50% from the one before. At the bottom I have also placed an &quot;horizon&quot; that obscures the bottom of the star.</p>

<p>In the yellow boxes I have zoomed in so that you can see that when the zoom is applied to the star without an horizon, the full star becomes visible, while zooming in on the star obscured by an horizon does not make the full star visible.</p>

<p>This is the difference between the &quot;vanishing point&quot; and an horizon.</p>

<p>This is why you can zoom in on a distant ship and see the top half, but not the bottom - the horizon is obscuring the bottom half, not the &quot;vanishing point&quot;.</p>

<p>half of it gone, right?</p>

<p>yes, slicing off half of it would make it half gone, but is making it half as visible, ie: half as washed out, 50% opacity, also making it half gone?</p>

<p>I think so.</p>

<p>the point of the shuttle going straight up, is so you can see it is not going &#39;over the horizon&#39; just disappearing with distance, and in doing so, it has lost half of itself, for which I have given an explanation above.</p>

<p>what is your take on that?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>1 - vanishing point and mirages.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you understand what the vanishing point actually is? It is not a &quot;horizon&quot; beyond which you can not see. The vanishing point is different for different sized objects. The vanishing point for a container ship is a lot further away than the vanishing point for a car.</p>

<p>Why is this? Because the &quot;vanishing point&quot; is simply the point at which the apparent size of an object becomes smaller than the ability of the camera or eye to resolve it. The smaller the object to begin with, the closer to the camera or eye its vanishing point is.</p>

<p>So with that knowledge in hand, explain how half of an object can apparently be too small to see, while the other half of the object is still large enough to be clearly visible?</p>

<p>Is the object changing shape as it moves away?</p>

<p>Or is it in fact dropping below a physical horizon rather than actually reaching its vanishing point?</p>

<p>This photo is a good example:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Railroad_in_Northumberland_County,_Pennsylvania.JPG">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Railroad_in_Northumberland_County,_Pennsylvania.JPG</a></p>

<p>Notice anything about those tracks? Here is the same image with the tracks zoomed in:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/vcRIuB6.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/vcRIuB6.jpg</a></p>

<p>Notice how the tracks do not actually converge, yet they still disappear? That is because they have <em>not</em> reached their vanishing point, but have instead passed below an horizon (probably over the top of a slight rise).</p>

<p>This is what happens when you can see the top half of a container ship, but not the bottom, as it passes over the horizon. It <em>hasn&#39;t</em> reached its vanishing point and is still visible, except that something is blocking the view of half of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, and the point about mirages?</p>

<p>If you can see Chicago across the Great Lakes because of a *Superior * mirage, why then could you not equally say you could maybe have a mirage of the water in front of a boat? thereby giving the effect of a horizon.</p>

<p>And then, perhaps, because a mirage will only happen when you are looking at it, wherever you look, the water mirages.</p>

<p>If it can be one, is should be able to be the other.</p>

<p>Or, what if it is a <em>Minor</em> mirage, and the boat appears lower than it actually is, because of bent light.</p>

<p>This is what I am talking about when I say people don&#39;t address the whole points.</p>

<p>Yes, very good, vanishing point, now combine that with mirages and bam, there&#39;s your apparent curve.</p>

<p>Can you explain why a mirage would cause Chicago to appear over the horizon, but a minor mirage wouldn&#39;t make a boat under the horizon.</p>

<p>Because I would love to know.</p>

<p>Do you understand how light works? A mirage is caused by the bending of light as if through a lens. For the water in the foreground to appear higher, all the light coming from that direction needs to be bent downwards by some sort of lens. But that also includes the light from the ship in the background. The atmospheric lens doesn&#39;t distinguish between light from the water and light from the ship it, bends all of it.</p>

<p>This means that the ship will also appear to be higher. So rather than sinking below a horizon, it will simply rise with the horizon to appear to be above where it actually is.</p>

<p>Do you understand how light works?</p>

<p>If the light from the water in front of the boat is being bent so that it appears to be higher, the light from the boat will also be bent making <em>it</em> appear to be higher too.</p>

<p>The atmosphere doesn&#39;t pick and chose which light to bend based on where it originated. It bends it all or none of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or, what if it is a Minor mirage, and the boat appears lower than it actually is, because of bent light.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume you mean &quot;inferior mirage&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For exhausted travelers in the desert, an inferior mirage may appear to be a lake of water in the distance. An inferior mirage is called &quot;inferior&quot; because the mirage is located under the real object. The real object in an inferior mirage is the (blue) sky or any distant (therefore bluish) object in that same direction. The mirage causes the observer to see a bright and bluish patch on the ground in the distance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage#Inferior_mirage">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage#Inferior_mirage</a></p>

<p>Do you understand what that means? It means both the real object <em>and</em> the mirage are visible at the same time. An &quot;inferior mirage&quot;, does not make the sky or distant mountains disappear, it simply creates a reflection of them below their real location.</p>

<p>Not only that, but an &quot;inferior mirage&quot; <em>inverts the image</em>. For a boat to appear upright <em>and</em> below the horizon, it <em>can&#39;t</em> be the result of an &quot;inferior mirage&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is what I am talking about when I say people don&#39;t address the whole points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I address the points people make, not every single point related to the claim. If I had to do that, every comment would be a novel.</p>

<p>You made the points now, so I addressed them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you explain why a mirage would cause Chicago to appear over the horizon, but a minor mirage wouldn&#39;t make a boat under the horizon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I already did. Put simply, the light is being bent near the surface of the water, but light passing above that surface is still visible. An &quot;inferior mirage&quot; creates a mirror image copy, it doesn&#39;t make the original image disappear.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Logic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You apparently wouldn&#39;t know what that is.</p>

<p>First let&#39;s specify that we&#39;re on a perfectly smooth spherical earth, where every point on the surface is equidistant from the center of the sphere - that is no mountains or valleys - and the mass of the earth is equally distributed throughout.</p>

<p>What direction would gravity point? It would point directly at the center of the sphere. No matter where you are on the surface you would always be the same distance from the center and the direction of gravity would be pointing directly at its center.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;m standing on the North Pole and start walking south. Would I feel any change to the gravitational pull? I stay the exact same distance from the center and the pull is always straight down into the center of the earth. No matter where I am, I can not determine my location based on the strength or direction of gravity, because relative to the surface it is always in the same direction at the same distance.</p>

<p>In that situation, no, you would not notice you were on a curved surface, because there would be nothing to reference against that showed a difference depending on where you were. No walking uphill or down, no leaning to or fro. The angle you make with the surface and the strength of the gravitational pull would remain constant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you please do the same thing, but over a distance of 100 miles, that would be grate, and I am being serious, please and thanks in advance :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, let&#39;s do one quick equation... how many pixels would I need to show 100 miles at 8 inches per pixel? Well, there are 63,360 inches per mile, so 100 miles would be 6,336,000 inches. Divide 6,336,000 inches by 8 and I would need 792,000 pixels.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I do not have an image editing program that can handle an image that wide, and even if I did, I doubt my computer hardware could handle it.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say I did create the image so that it shows 100 miles of surface. This means each end would be 50 miles from the center. Over 50 miles, the surface drops 1,650 feet or 19,800 inches. At 8 inches per pixel, this means that each end of the line needs to be 2,475 pixels below the center, which would be 396,000 pixels away.</p>

<p>Clearly I can not use 8 inches per pixel to demonstrate this curve.</p>

<p>What about 50 inches per pixel? At that scale, the curvature would be 1/5th of a pixel per mile. The image would still need to be 126,720 pixels wide, but the ends would be 396 pixels below the center. That is still beyond the capability of my system.</p>

<p>At a scale of 100 inches per pixel, the image would need to be 63,360 pixels wide, and the ends would be 198 pixels below the center.</p>

<p>The original image I created was 15,840 pixels wide, so what if I make the scale 400 inches per pixel? That gives me a width of 15,840 pixels! Perfect. So let&#39;s run with that. At this scale the ends of the line need to be 49.5 pixels below the center.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/eEMxN6H.png">It would look something like this.</a></p>

<p>A small point: for the sake of ease I drew straight lines from the center to the ends rather than curved lines, so this isn&#39;t quite right.</p>

<p>Now of course, we can see a perfectly straight horizon line. The human field of view is about 114 degrees. For the horizon to stretch 100 miles from one edge of our field of view to the other, it would have to be 32.5 miles away from us at the center, but 59.6 miles away on the edges. This means we can see the ends of that 100 mile &quot;horizon&quot; because it is actually hidden behind the horizon that is actually 32.5 miles away!</p>

<p>ok, now what we have to do is show that, in the real world, like say, on the great flat expanse of the ocean (or maybe Antarctica, I&#39;ve always wanted to go, you can come too, we&#39;ll all go, then we can all see it together, right! sweet), that the curvature is indeed analogous to what you have shown.</p>

<p>Bullshit. Perspective does not make the bottom half of a ship disappear below the horizon while the top half remains visible. it can&#39;t. Perspective works on the entire ship at the same time, or not at all.</p>

<p>The fact ships appear much smaller as they move away is due to perspective. The fact we can see the top half of the ship but not the bottom is due to the horizon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he went to Aswan, as this Vice article claims</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where did this knowledge come from? That would be Eratosthenes, the Greek mathematician and astronomer... Eratosthenes was pursuing a papyrus text preserved at the library at <strong>Alexandria</strong>, which he was the director of, and noted a peculiar observation. As reported in the city of <strong>Syene in southern Egypt</strong>, the text&#39;s author noted that, &quot;<em>the shadow of someone looking down a deep well would block the reflection of the Sun at noon</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>In <strong>Alexandria</strong>, this was not the case, Eratosthenes noted. The Sun here was not directly overhead and so it did indeed cast shadows. To get to the bottom of things, he did an experiment. By measuring the length of the shadow cast by a stick at noon on the solstice, he could calculate the angle between the Sun and the vertical stick: 7.2 degrees.</p>

<p>And yet, in Syene, the angle was 0 degrees. What gives? 
Eratosthenes realized that the difference must be the result of a <strong>curvature on the Earth&#39;s surface.</strong> [there&#39;s the assumption]
With respect to a vertical stick in Syene, a vertical stick in Alexandria would be tilted away by this amount. He then realized that if he knew the distance between the cities, he could calculate the circumference of the planet itself. And so he did [using non-Euclidean geometry], arriving at a value either 2 percent less (39,375 kilometers) than the actual circumference or 16 percent more (46,620 kilometers), depending on Eratosthenes&#39; exact metric (e.g. what a &quot;stadia&quot; translates to in modern terms). Which is not bad.</p>

<p>cool cool.</p>

<p>except, and that&#39;s my point, in the linked reddit regarding our Greek boi, by using non-Euclidean geometry, he assumed that it was round.</p>

<p>If measured with Euclidean geometry, it gives an answer that the earth is flat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been around the globe. I feel that the earth is round.</p>

<p>As far as Eratosthenes, I feel he brought a red granite obelisk to Alexandria, and the Roman emperor came to steal it, then burned everything Eratosthenes ever wrote.</p>

<p>So, whatever grand conspiracy exists... if you want continuity... it all goes back to that guy, who purportedly measured the circumference of the earth from the Elephantine Isle, using the shadow of a red granite obelisk that now sits in St Peter&#39;s (The Rock) Square.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>cool, and thankyou for having the decency to actually engage in this debate, I appreciate that.</p>

<p>I understand that you feel the earth is round, and you are entitled to feel that, as I am entitled to feel it is flat.</p>

<p>I will look into Elephantine island, and the obelisk issue.</p>

<p>And what about the looking for the curve using a method that assumes that things are already curved idea?  </p>

<p>I have to do further experiments, including testing from different time zones, three or more points, which I will.</p>

<p>But the thrust of the argument is that, when Eratosthenes measured the world in 250BC, he used Non-Euclidean Geometry, which goes in assuming the earth is round. He got the result that the earth is round.</p>

<p>If you use Euclidean Geometry, you go in assuming the earth is flat. you get the result that the earth is flat.</p>

<p><em>Note</em></p>

<p>I must stress that there has been quite a point that I overlooked, that is triangulation, checking from more than one time zone, and I admit that I did indeed overlook that, which is why I prefaced this answer by saying that I need to do further investigation.</p>

<p>But that is what I mean :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes, indeed I have. the more I study it, the more I find that the base truths it is based on don&#39;t quite add up.</p>

<p>And I am not just talking about the Socrates thing.</p>

<p>As I have also said, yes, it is almost certain that the earth is <strong>round</strong>, but I do not believe the evidence is undeniable, and would like to be able to be satisfied that what I am being told is true.</p>

<p>I have never said <strong><em>the earth is flat</em></strong></p>

<p>what I am saying is, <strong><em>I&#39;m not completely convinced it is round</em></strong></p>

<p>you might think that&#39;s just semantics, but I think it is more than that.</p>

<p>as Einstein said, if you were on a train, travelling at a fixed velocity, so you couldn&#39;t sense the movement, empirically, you could not tell whether the train was moving past the scenery or the scenery moving past the train.</p>

<p>We assume the train moves, because that is how we understand the nature of trains, but objectively, it is unknowable.</p>

<p>So, we cannot tell, empirically, for ourselves, if the Earth spins, of if the stars and sky spin.</p>

<p>The FE argument is that it is a giant HD display, <strong>like a planetarium</strong>. You do believe that planetariums exist, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>alright, let&#39;s follow that logical line of questioning, and think about what other arrangements could be able to deliver the same result.</p>

<p>We are about to go way way <em>waaaaaaay</em> out there, but remember, <strong>the truth <em>is</em> out there</strong></p>

<p>Do you see the double meaning of that, the truth is out there, and the truth is like <em>out there</em> dude.</p>

<p>Ok, here we go.</p>

<p>The earth is a sphere (or close enough for this point), and the universe only appears like a dome because of the vastness of the universe, the curve of the earth, and the vastness of the earth, yes? </p>

<p>So, really, it&#39;s an illusion caused by just being on a ball in space?</p>

<p>I just want to get it right, that I understand what you are saying, you are following the round earth theory, in this fashion?</p>

<p>If so, then I would contend there are two variants that could produce the same effect.</p>

<p>1 - the flat earth, but the sky dome is a <strong>MASSIVE</strong> <strong><em>hemesphere</em></strong> like, so big, and we are in the centre, so so small, between the sky dome and us is the glass dome, the one that Admiral Byrd may have found in Antarctica in 1948 (Operation Highjump).</p>

<p>2 - perhaps, as we are arguing flat vs round earth, we are missing the real picture of the earth </p>

<p>The Mapparium is a three-story-tall globe made of stained glass that is viewed from a 30-foot-long (9.1 m) bridge through its interior.</p>

<p>The Mapparium was designed to allow the countries of the world to be viewed in accurate geographical relationship to each other, hence the design of the Mapparium—a mirror-image, concave reversal of the Earth, viewed from within. This is the only configuration that places the eye at the same distance from every point on the globe.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.marybakereddylibrary.org/project/mapparium/">https://www.marybakereddylibrary.org/project/mapparium/</a></p>

<p>And yeah, I can hear you from here, &quot;yeah, nah, fuck off, that&#39;s just some weird map, that proves nothing&quot; and I would agree, except when I point out :</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the design of the Mapparium—a mirror-image, <strong>concave reversal of the Earth</strong>, viewed from within. This is the only configuration that places the eye at the same distance from every point on the globe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;yeah, and? So what?&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://physics.info/mirrors/">https://physics.info/mirrors/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRP82omMX0g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRP82omMX0g</a></p>

<p>&quot;Concave spherical reversal&quot; is when you are looking at something concave, and suddenly it appears convex.</p>

<p>If you were in the dead centre of a sphere, you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell if you were inside it or outside it.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Therefore, I portend that <strong>this shows that is can be explained another way</strong>, and even as crazy as it sounds, and I will be the first to admit, &quot;yeah, that sounds fucking whack&quot;, it does explain it.</p>

<p>As Einstein said, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and, as J. B. S. Haldane said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have no doubt that in reality the future will be vastly more surprising than anything I can imagine. Now my own suspicion is that the Universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose&quot;</p>

<p>You can stand on any continent and look south to see the same constellations... </p>

<p>If the Earth were flat you would be staring in different directions on each continent. </p>

<p>Now I heard you say the sky is a moving HD projection?</p>

<p>Heres a test that has been performed. </p>

<p>During the last solar eclipse in N America you could see stars at the apex. It just so happened that people in Asia and America were seeing the same stars when they looked North. </p>

<p>On a FE map people in Asia and N America would have been looking in different directions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi! Sorry it has taken me so long to answer you, but I said I would, and here I am.</p>

<p>Here is my counterpoint :</p>

<p>if they were both looking <em>**north</em>* they are both looking at the same point, on a FE map</p>

<p>ie : <a href="https://i.imgur.com/tD4yHOL.png">https://i.imgur.com/tD4yHOL.png</a></p>

<p>but as I see it, there should be no problem looking north.</p>

<p>or do I misunderstand your question, if so, please can you tell me how.
you first talk about the southern sky, but say there is a test that has been performed regarding the northern sky.</p>

<p>No... If they both look &quot;up&quot; they are looking North on a FE map. </p>

<p>In reality if they both look north they are looking over each others shoulders in opposite directions. </p>

<p>I guess I should have been more clear... Look north to the horizon. or near the horizon. </p>

<p>Where your wonderful ice wall is on that map. </p>

<p>Or another way to think about it is if they both look south. </p>

<p>See the problem? </p>

<p>Because I have heard they they put the flights on schedule, to make it look like they exist,  but then if anyone actually books the flight, they say, &quot;oh sorry, that flight has been cancelled, we&#39;ve put you on this two leg hop flight.&quot;</p>

<p>for instance, as these explain, why would you go from Perth to J-Berg, via Duabi? </p>

<p><a href="https://planetruthblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/fe-air-map-2.jpg">https://planetruthblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/fe-air-map-2.jpg</a></p>

<p>As for GPS, it is claimed that planes drop off the map over the South Atlantic, as shown on this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g-SsXIJp80">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g-SsXIJp80</a></p>

<p>it is claimed that it is because they don&#39;t have radar bases over the south atlantic </p>

<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-flight-tracking-websites-show-airplanes-over-oceans-in-the-southern-hemisphere">https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-flight-tracking-websites-show-airplanes-over-oceans-in-the-southern-hemisphere</a></p>

<p>but that&#39;s not how GPS works. It&#39;s claimed to be satellites (and that&#39;s another thing, it could also be radio direction finding, the land based precursor to GPS, satellites are not needed)</p>

<p>Also, MH370 flew off in that direction, and vanished. why was it not tracked by GPS? Did it fly into the dome over the Earth and crash into the sea? At this point, it seems that that is as good an explanation as any other.</p>

<p>Eratosthenes wasn&#39;t trying to prove the Earth was round. As you noted he already knew the earth was round. He was trying to measure the distance to the sun and the circumference of the earth.</p>

<p>However, his type measurements can be used to prove the earth is round.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V03eF0bcYno">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V03eF0bcYno</a></p>

<p>Answer this question: Do you believe the people that made the video above are in on the conspiracy? Do you believe they intentionally lied about their measurements to create a false &quot;proof&quot; that the earth is actually round?</p>

<p>Because unless you believe that, this one video <em>proves</em> the earth is round.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this guy gets it.</p>

<p>yes, science is a religion because none of us have time to undertake all the experiments solve all the formulas and go to all the places to prove it is all true, therefore we have to take the word of others and the words in the sacred books that it is all true.</p>

<p>step our of line, question the core beliefs, and get attacked and shunned.</p>

<p>don&#39;t think so? look at this comment section.</p>

<p>Why can no one answer the simple Euclidean vs Non-Euclidean problem?</p>

<p>Science is a religion because, due to the very nature of science, you have to take on faith what you are being taught is real.</p>

<p>And here I challenge that, provide sources, show how the facts of the ball earth don&#39;t make sense, and rather than answering the question, I get bombarded with all this info I did not ask for.</p>

<p>I know about the horizon, I know about the space program. Do you think I live under a rock?</p>

<p>I am asking a valid question, when Eratosthenes discovered the world was round, he did it using Non-Euclidean geometry. Using Euclidean geometry give the result that it is flat.</p>

<p>If you understand anything about geometry, you will know that Euclidean geometry assumes that the world is flat, Non-Euclidean geometry assumes that the world is round.</p>

<p>Consider this : I measure something with two different rulers. One says it is 3m long, one says it is 27m long. Without using any other means, how can you tell which ruler is wrong?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t so you must dismiss them both.</p>

<p>The Greeks knew, the only thing they could truly know is that they knew nothing, not even that they even existed. Nothing can truly be proven.</p>

<p>So why would those same Greeks accept that, even though it can be shown to be round with this type of geometry, and flat with this, it must be round because __________________?</p>

<p>Fill in the blank, using only what Eratosthenes knew in 250BC.</p>

<p>That is the question, and I would <strong><em>LOVE</em></strong> an answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have taken photos of The Ross Ice Shelf, also known as the Great Ice Barrier.</p>

<p>Beyond the barrier, may lie the dome, which Admiral Byrd may have found on Operation Highjump.</p>

<p>Highjump was in 1948, the previous year, Byrd had flown over the North Pole (some say he flew into the inner earth).</p>

<p>Soon after which both the USA and the USSR started doing &quot;atmospheric tests of nukes, or &#39;nuking the sky&#39;.</p>

<p>Soon after that was 1958 international geophysical year, where they explored Antarctica, dove to the bottom of the ocean, drilled into the seabed, and sent lots of weather rockets and balloons into the sky.</p>

<p>After that they lost interest for some reason, and turned to trying to break the sound barrier.</p>

<p>Now, <em>and you don&#39;t have to believe it</em>, I content Byrd found the barrier, they tried to nuke it, that failer, then they tried to study it, and tried to find if there was a way out in the up or down direction.</p>

<p>Then I content, as people thought that the speed of sound was a physical barrier at which something awful might happen to a human being due to the violent shaking experienced at subsonic speed, so they tried to break it, to see if that was possible.</p>

<p>It was, so the speed of sound is just the speed of sound.</p>

<p>But they found we are trapped, and then, the space program, the point about wow, we have been in low earth orbit except one manned mission, Apollo.</p>

<p>Could they have used the moonshot to be like, &#39;no one will question we are trapped in a dome if we can prove we went to the moon&#39;</p>

<p>Where are the moonbases,, I mean, come on this is [current year]!</p>

<p>It has been almost 50 years since we went to the moon. I think it is ridiculous to think everyone just abandoned the moon.</p>

<p>Not sure where the sound barrier comes in, it was &#39;simply&#39; a matter of getting past the compressibility problem.</p>

<p>as for gaining entry to the hollow earth, well, <em>strap yourself in, this one&#39;s gonna be a wild ride</em></p>

<p>The earth is much bigger than we imagine, with more land at the north and south poles, also we are on the inside of the hollow earth, see the gentleperson in another comment asking questions regarding his or her telescope alignment re: when they move their fancy computed guided telescope (so jealous), it knows where it is by GPS, and can swivel to centre itself, and move itself to track the sky.</p>

<p>At the poles, there are huge openings, something like this :</p>

<p>Nasa is one of many judeomasonic lies, and one of its purposes is precisely to hide either more land, the flat earth and it&#39;s religious implications (judeomasonry is heavily invested in herding the cattle with dogmatic &#39;science&#39;, and scientific authoritarianism), or both simultaneously.</p>

<p>and yes, that would also be consistent with some of these findings.</p>

<p>But again, yes, if the curvature is much more than we are told, but the earth is still round, then there could be <strong>vast tracts of Antarctica *beyond what we ate told is the South Pole</strong><em>, similar to what Admiral Byrd was talking about when he said, &quot;vast tracts of unexplored land *beyond the South Pole</em>&quot; and also mentioned deposits of uranium, coal, oi, and precious metals.</p>

<p>Some argue he was talking about Greater Antarctica, and the Queen Maud Mountains, but then why wouldn&#39;t he have said, on the other side of the pole, the continent, in greater Antarctica, on the Australian Claim, or any of the other ways, that would have made more sense, but no, <em>beyond the pole</em></p>

<hr/>

<p>Only if you exclude the evidence you don&#39;t want to hear. Remember  that &quot;nothing you can say that will convince me otherwise&quot; quote?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>relating to FES standpoint on gravity, Flat Earth does not say the disk shoots up at 9.8m per second per second simulating gravity, it says that everything is density, that&#39;s why things float and sink.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only by ignoring the simple fact that gravity is an essential component of buoyancy.</p>

<p>I have a giant sphere of water. Halfway to the center of that sphere I release a balloon filled with air and another filled with mercury. Which way do they move, if at all? If you say the mercury falls down and the air rises up, explain how the balloons know which way is up or down.</p>

<p>The simple fact is that gravity is what gives the direction. The mercury falls towards the center and the air rises toward the surface because gravity pulls the denser material downward, and the mercury is more dense than water while the water is more dense than air. Without gravity there is no buoyancy.</p>

<p>I know you&#39;re going to ignore it because &quot;there is nothing [I] can say that will convince [you] otherwise.&quot;</p>

<p>Simply put when you actually measure the angle to the sun from many points on the earth surface at the same time, you find that either the sun is in multiple places at once (impossible) or the earth is a spherical object (the truth).</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;why can it not ALSO be explained this way?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The simple answer to that is, &quot;it can&#39;t be explained THAT way, because the evidence refutes it.&quot;.</p>

<p>For example, your favourite question (the answer to which I notice you ignored) regarding Eratosthenes&#39; experiment.</p>

<p>When you make two measurements of the angle to the sun from two different spots on the surface, the point where those angles cross is the location of the sun. Cool. But here is the problem - if you make dozens of such measurements, and the earth is flat, they should all cross in the same place.</p>

<p>But they do not. In fact, if the earth is flat, those measurements mean the sun must be in multiple different locations at the same time. You literally can not say the measurements are accurate, the earth is flat <em>and</em> the sun is only in one place at any given time. Either the earth is not flat, the sun is not in one place at any given time, or the measurements are wrong.</p>

<p>The latter is easily determined by making more measurements, more precisely. No flat earther has ever made these measurements and proved that the sun is always in the same place at any given time <em>and</em> the earth is flat. </p>

<p>Unless you want to argue that the sun can be in more than one place at a time, you have to accept that the experimental observations disprove the notion of a flat earth.</p>

<p>Put simply, the location of the sun as seen from the earth&#39;s surface <em>disproves</em> the flat earth theory, and this has been demonstrated time and time again. Flat earth theory simply can not explain the observations and is thus <em>falsified</em>.</p>

<p>it&#39;s 6.51am here in Bris-vegas. I have been up all night answering, to the best of my flat eartherbillity (you see what I did there.)</p>

<p>There are some comments I have not replied to yet, as I do not yet have an answer which I would find satisfactory to myself, or I just haven&#39;t gotten around to it.</p>

<p>Check the replies on this post, yo, I&#39;ve been all over the place.</p>

<p>I do appreciate your point, ignoring evidence, lying by omission is still lying, etc, indeed, I get it.</p>

<p>And I am not, I am looking for satisfactory proof for myself, I have found what I believe to be huge holes in the round earth story, and I am raising them, in the same way that, say, expanding earth, or plate tectonics have been proposed.</p>

<p>They both explain the moving earth crust, but in different ways.</p>

<p>I am maintaining an open mind, on all sides of the idea, and simply trying to find if the theory of the round earth holds up to close scrutiny, and, from what I have found, I do not believe it does.</p>

<p>And I am determined to find the truth.</p>

<p>If the truth is it is round, so be it.</p>

<p>If the truth is it is flat, so be it.</p>

<p>If the truth is a weird inside out reversed sphere earth, so be it.</p>

<p>Whatever it it, I just want it to be <strong>the truth</strong> and I want to believe the facts <em>myself</em> enough to say, &quot;yes, I believe that wholeheartedly&quot;</p>

<p>Now, tell me, what&#39;s wrong with that?</p>

<p>Thankyou again for the multiple places part of the experiment, I did indeed completely miss that, and so onwards towards discovery.</p>

<p>If I win the Nobel Prize for proving the earth is flat, I will invite you to the ceremony</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he went to Aswan, as this Vice article claims</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where did this knowledge come from? That would be Eratosthenes, the Greek mathematician and astronomer... Eratosthenes was pursuing a papyrus text preserved at the library at <strong>Alexandria</strong>, which he was the director of, and noted a peculiar observation. As reported in the city of <strong>Syene in southern Egypt</strong>, the text&#39;s author noted that, &quot;<em>the shadow of someone looking down a deep well would block the reflection of the Sun at noon</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>In <strong>Alexandria</strong>, this was not the case, Eratosthenes noted. The Sun here was not directly overhead and so it did indeed cast shadows. To get to the bottom of things, he did an experiment. By measuring the length of the shadow cast by a stick at noon on the solstice, he could calculate the angle between the Sun and the vertical stick: 7.2 degrees.</p>

<p>And yet, in Syene, the angle was 0 degrees. What gives? 
Eratosthenes realized that the difference must be the result of a <strong>curvature on the Earth&#39;s surface.</strong> [there&#39;s the assumption]
With respect to a vertical stick in Syene, a vertical stick in Alexandria would be tilted away by this amount. He then realized that if he knew the distance between the cities, he could calculate the circumference of the planet itself. And so he did [using non-Euclidean geometry], arriving at a value either 2 percent less (39,375 kilometers) than the actual circumference or 16 percent more (46,620 kilometers), depending on Eratosthenes&#39; exact metric (e.g. what a &quot;stadia&quot; translates to in modern terms). Which is not bad.</p>

<p>cool cool.</p>

<p>except, and that&#39;s my point, in the linked reddit regarding our Greek boi, by using non-Euclidean geometry, he assumed that it was round.</p>

<p>If measured with Euclidean geometry, it gives an answer that the earth is flat.</p>

<p>please check out this post for more info :)</p>

<p>Thanks for your question :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have also heard of the &quot;earth is larger than we imagine&quot; theory.</p>

<p>and yes, that would also be consistent with some of these findings.</p>

<p>But again, yes, if the curvature is much more than we are told, but the earth is still round, then there could be <strong>vast tracts of Antarctica *beyond what we ate told is the South Pole</strong><em>, similar to what Admiral Byrd was talking about when he said, &quot;vast tracts of unexplored land *beyond the South Pole</em>&quot; and also mentioned deposits of uranium, coal, oi, and precious metals.</p>

<p>Some argue he was talking about Greater Antarctica, and the Queen Maud Mountains, but then why wouldn&#39;t he have said, on the other side of the pole, the continent, in greater Antarctica, on the Australian Claim, or any of the other ways, that would have made more sense, but no, <em>beyond the pole</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5tRJH9QTsM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5tRJH9QTsM</a></p>

<p>some also claim he flew into an opening at the North Pole around 1947 into the inner earth.</p>

<p>But what I do know is you should look into <em>Operation Highjump</em></p>

<p>Thanks for your comment :)</p>
