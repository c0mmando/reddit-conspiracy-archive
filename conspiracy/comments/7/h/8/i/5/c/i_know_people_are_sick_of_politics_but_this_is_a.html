       Timing.  This is a perfect example of media mind control attempts.  It doesn’t really matter whether you like or hate the guy, this should anger you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, Russia is losing traction and TPTB need a new line of attack...  well what time is it?  Oh!  The holidays!  Where soon we will be seeing family and there is a likelihood that many people will spend time with some relative who has dementia!
      </p>
      <p>
       What better time to circulate a rumor that implants “Trump has dementia” then now to make a calculated bet that it will subconsciously pop up when you see an elderly relative with dementia and they hope the confirmation bias will set in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Timing is everything, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit:  The greater point here is not to argue whether he may or may not have it, the point is the media suddenly putting out this line in lockstep and the fact that it is a see-through attempt at a psychological primer based on the probability of seeing someone with dementia during the holidays.  That is why I said this is a bit different than just Trump/politics. It is a clear example of media “mind control” tactics.

       Because truth be told, he honestly could have it. We have not elected a middle aged president in quite some time other than obama. Dementia shows differently in different people. Trump has actual symptoms of the disorder.

       The dementia thing isn't new, its been mentioned for a while now.  I'm no psychiatrist, but if you watch him speak it's pretty damn obvious his brain isn't all there.  He wasn't a genius back in the 90's but at least he could form coherent sentences once upon a time.

       I dunno, he is a practiced speaker, but mostly speaks without a script.  Have you ever taken public speaking?  I am pretty good at it (well I have to do it a bunch and don’t get nervous anyway) and I daze out or forget words and such...  it is pretty normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       TBH, I have seen more that would suggest ADHD or just having a lot on your mind than dementia.  (Disclaimer:  I have adult ADHD and before finally getting diagnosed had many of those behaviors like thinking about things to the extent of literally not seeing or hearing the person speaking to me, forgetting random things, etc.  point is it could be confirmation bias on my part.)

       Hey, it isn’t beyond the realm of possibility.  But, most of those things are not obviously dementia.  I mentioned it on another comment, and also admitted that since I have it my view may be biased, but it seems more like if anything ADHD than dementia.  The Bibi thing?  I can’t count the number of times someone said something that made me start thinking and just totally daze out into my own head, little things like the hand and the wife...  having a lot going on in your brain makes just as much sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have had relatives with dementia and known a few older folks unrelated that had/have it.  Those are not really he behaviors that I have seen, and being able to speak off script as well as he does is not really in the realm of possibility for it.  Uncontrolled and inappropriate emotions, repeating a statement or question (non-rhetorically) out of time, confusion in general are the signs.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you see some of those videos you have to realize it is all very choreographed and such, have you ever posed for wedding pictures?  You know how the photog says “look left” and there is confusion as people go the wrong way and such?  Yeah, that kind of stuff for the state visit photo ops but also with other people trying to simultaneously direct in another language or two...

       Putin can’t and didn’t influence shit in the election.  All of his efforts were to give the
       <em>
        illusion
       </em>
       of being able to.  Anyone that has read real info or listened to actual KGB spies would realize it is all about appearance and deceit, not actual hands-on subterfuge.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like when the Cold War ended and we realized just how much of a joke the Soviet arsenal was or how North Korea puts on fake shows of wealth for visitors.  It is all about appearance and perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also that is much easier and cheaper to accomplish.

       You assume Trumps on your side. This whole post does. The evidence says otherwise. Nefarious forces want you to cheer for Trump. Cheering for the Shepard leading you to slaughter. Hence why they made a religion out of Trumpism.

       Yes, but this week has seen it suddenly jump to prominence over the Russia stuff.  Like any official narrative, you can find it mentioned on every single media outlet.  That kind of thing doesn’t happen by accident.

       I agree that the media picks their moments to spotlight things. On the other hand, he just made several tweets and some speeches that definitely point to something being more wrong with his mental processing.  Tweeting to the wrong Teresa May, and the way he kept free associating during the speech at the tree lighting for instance. He's always been prone to go off script, but it's getting worse.
      </p>

       No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, if you've watched a relative deteriorate with dementia or alzheimer's, you probably recognize some of the signs in him. I never liked him, even before his political career, but this is just making me sadfor him on a personal level. His family should encourage him to step down instead of leaving him to flounder in front of the whole world.

       I have seen a few relatives go through it, and it is very hard to really spot at the beginning, true.  There are always so many reasons other than dementia that could explain the small things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could he have it?  Maybe, don’t know for sure.  I really don’t think Melania would pull a Nancy Reagan and let him keep going if it was sure, I really don’t think she is some trophy wife gold digger.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really, really didn’t care for Trump before this.  He wasn’t much on my radar beyond some commercials for The Apprentice until Ron Paul dissed the fuck out of his attempt to host a debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I am glad he won the election and I do support his presidency so far (though there are things I disagree with and some things I agree with for reasons outside of the box). If nothing else, he won me over by showing in an almost “Ali-G” style Socratic irony manner how fucking absurdly bullshit the media/political machine has become and how much of a farce presidential elections are now.  It was beautiful watching the elections unfold on so many levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I have no doubts, and question the sanity of anyone who does, that Hillary would have done far, far worse for things like net-neutrality (ok that one she would have done the same but lies about it) freedom of speech, international relations and wars.  Plus she wouldn’t have the economy and markets going like they are now.

       I think the recent media focus has more to do with the fact that Trump is becoming more and more unhinged by the week. And he is starting to forget which lies he's told, to whom. It's only a matter of time before he does something to deflect the unwanted attention. He's going to start a war.

       However, I am glad he won the election and I do support his presidency so far (though there are things I disagree with and some things I agree with for reasons outside of the box). If nothing else, he won me over by showing in an almost “Ali-G” style Socratic irony manner how fucking absurdly bullshit the media/political machine has become and how much of a farce presidential elections are now.  It was beautiful watching the elections unfold on so many levels.

       Lastly, I have no doubts, and question the sanity of anyone who does, that Hillary would have done far, far worse for things like net-neutrality (ok that one she would have done the same but lies about it) freedom of speech, international relations and wars.  Plus she wouldn’t have the economy and markets going like they are now.
