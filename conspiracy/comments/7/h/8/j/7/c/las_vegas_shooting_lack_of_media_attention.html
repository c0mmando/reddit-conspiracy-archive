        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Found this interesting <a href="http://www.dailywire.com/news/24188/vegas-matt-walsh?utm_source=facebook&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=062316-podcast&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mattwalsh">article</a>. We’re 2 months post shooting and know nothing more than we did hours after the shooting. The article essentially goes on about how many questions there still are, yet mass media attention of the shooting is nearly non-existent at this point and how other mass shootings had an amazing amount more media attention long after the event. </p>

<p>I personally feels it adds to the major mystery that surrounds this incident and further advances the notion of a conspiracy. I still have many questions that run through my mind, many of which are contained in this article. Any once else refuse to forget about this and still feel perplexed?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve even talked to very level headed every day people who think the so called official story is bs but it still doesn&#39;t matter,when the whole system is corrupted and rotten to the core there isn&#39;t much to do bout it.I try not to get stressed out anymore about it,I&#39;ve learned years ago I can&#39;t wake people up anymore and there&#39;s no point of caring too much,sure I care but not at the point as I used to,just live the rest of my life and keep hoping one day maybe we will see justice and the evil powers that be collapse,I really doubt I will in my lifetime though.Things like Vegas,JFK,etc are proof that out own government can get away with anything and 99% of population doesn&#39;t care,therefore it&#39;s pretty bleak atm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s nice to know someone is talking about it. Hard to follow every media outlet, but the premise remains that there is little mass coverage. The Pulse Night Club Shooting seemed to dominate mass media coverage for what felt like eternity. It’s not that it shouldn’t have, but this just fell off the map almost inexplicably. </p>

<p>As someone who works in public safety (EMS) I find it completely strange that no details have been released as to how the victims died. No count on GSW vs GSW received post-mortem (ie a cause of death of say trampling or traumatic asphyxiation) across the 58 dead and the 500+ injured. It’s common place for this kind of information to have been released quickly. Statistically this information is easily available quickly from hospitals and the medical examiner after any kind of event. Heck, small shootings this kind of information reaches the news. You’d think the biggest mass shooting in history would have a little more information known about it. Hell, this event could change the landscape of how pre-hospital medicine is provided and be a great educational tool with some of this information. </p>

<p>Sadly, I think a lot of people died in what seems like a giant cover-up and no one seems to give a damn. </p>

<p>does this look normal or a drill !?</p>

<div class="comment mb-3 ml-3 op" data-depth="3" data-id="dqqhnc3">
    <p class="byline text-muted mb-0"><a href="javascript:;" class="score"><span class="badge badge-secondary">1</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/sstudebs.html">sstudebs</a> 2017-12-03</p>
    <div class="md"><p>The first picture looks very much like a drill. Appears to be no sense of panic or speed by anyone in that picture. Now, I will say that most likely Las Vegas Metro PD, the Las Vegas Sheriff’s Office, Las Vegas Fire and the other private ambulance services trained extensively on MCI(mass casualty incident) situations being in such a major metropolitan area. However,  any public safety employee receives training in MCI will tell you training vs real life are vastly different. You can’t account for stress, adrenaline, etc. </p>

<p>As for the second picture, that is actually plausible. In some MCI situations, there are things known as casualty collection points, where all patients are brought, triaged (a system by which you determine criticality of a patient) and systematically sent to various hospitals. It’s very likely this person had mortal wounds that were incompatible with life. They would not in that case transport that body to the hospital but rather the medical examiner would eventually come to collect any bodies directly from where they are. Triage is the hardest thing for a pre-hospital medical provider to have to do, as you’re making decisions that could factor into who lives and who dies, but when resources are thin, you have to give those that have the highest chance of survival the best chance. The tarp you see under this person is what makes me believe this. During triage people are usually categorized into 4 colors which represent a priority. Red is considered critical and are your highest priority patients. Yellow is moderate and considered your secondary priority. Green is considered low acuity and often are referred to as “walking wounded” and generally our lowest concern. Black categorized patients are considered DOA. During a true MCI it is common to see tarps of these same colors in that casualty collection area as a way to separate these patients easily. </p>

<p>Hope that helps. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was on cnn 24/7 for like a week. How much more coverage do you want? Extensive coverage is what these assholes want, maybe we as a society need to stop giving it to them? I think that article is kind of weak, here is why</p>

<p>Why haven&#39;t we seen any video footage of Stephen Paddock whatsoever? </p>

<h2>Why are we entitled to see it? It&#39;s footage from a camera of a private business, it belongs to the hotel. Private people and businesses are under no obligation to release footage from their security system. There are lots of niteclub shootings in my city and the footage is never released. If I caught a shooting on my home camera the only people who would view it are police and the D.A. strictly out of respect for the dead. The hotel has their reasons too, they want to forget about it, or they promise other patrons privacy, and the only reason to release it is the internet conspiracy bullies who will never be satisfied. You know that is true, they release one you want more, or its doctored. Releasing the videos would not stop the conspiracy talk. There is no benefit to the casino, only more hassles. </h2>

<p>And why did Paddock wire $100,000 to the Philippines before the shooting?</p>

<h2>That&#39;s where his wife was?</h2>

<p>And what happened to his missing hard drive? Did they ever find it? And why did he get rid of it? What&#39;s on it?</p>

<h2>So a guy about to go on a rampage destroyed his hard drive. That doesn&#39;t seem unusual to me. How can anyone know what was on a destroyed and missing hard drive? </h2>

<p>1) Why did he stop shooting after ten minutes if he had so many guns and so much ammunition?</p>

<p>2) Why did he stop shooting yet make no attempt to escape?</p>

<p>3) Why did he do it</p>

<p>Those are unanserable, the person who knows is dead. Everyone questions the &quot;official story&quot; on these but here you are asking</p>

<h2>for an official answer. They can&#39;t answer, they have no window into the mind of a dead man. </h2>

<p>Was he crazy? But then how did a crazy person manage to orchestrate something like this? </p>

<p>There are different kinds of crazy, but I don&#39;t see this being any more sophisticated than Holmes using smoke bombs during the movie shooting. Paddack may not have been babbling in the corner crazy but he was probably disturbed. </p>

<p>And why hasn&#39;t a single person from Paddock&#39;s personal life come forward and called him crazy?</p>

<p>He sounded like a loner. He didn&#39;t have to report to a job. Who would say anything? His mail order wife? Those chicks don&#39;t
see anything. His neighbors didn&#39;t talk to him. Some people are totally socially isolated. </p>

<hr/>

<p>hey tell us 527 people were injured, along with the 58 killed, but were all of those injuries from gunshots? 
Did the guy actually physically shoot 585 human beings? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t really see the distinction. Maybe the hospital just tally up the injured and gave one lump number   </p>

<hr/>

<p>Police didn&#39;t finally enter the hotel room until an hour after the shooting stopped. What took them so long? Where were they? </p>

<p>What you are saying is if you had been there you would have kicked down the door and saved everyone? I have seen many scenarios where the person holed up with a gun is there for hours and hours. This isn&#39;t TV, no hero is coming. It&#39;s unfair to expect cops to die to stop him. They take the guy down when its safe. </p>

<hr/>

<p>He had dozens of guns in the hotel room with him. How did he get them all in there?</p>

<p>The elevator. You can make as many trips from your car to your hotel suite as you wish, there are no metal detectors. </p>

<hr/>

<p>How did he manage to shoot hundreds of people from 500 yards away at night? Was he trained?</p>

<p>He used a bump stock. He didn&#39;t have to be accurate he pointed in the general direction of a huge crowd and pulled the trigger. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Why did the timeline of the shooting change three times?</p>

<h2>I&#39;m not Las Vegas police nor do I speak for them but I guess mass shootings result in mass confusion. The police have been known to be wrong.</h2>

<p>Multiple witnesses swore that there were shots coming from more than one location. Were they mistaken?</p>

<p>Yes they were. You ever come under fire? I haven&#39;t but I hear it&#39;s scary as hell. I bet I would get all sorts of things wrong. Shots echo too. It&#39;s actualy hard to pinpoint where they are coming from. There was a gang shootout near me and I was totally off about which direction i thought I heard the shots, when I read about it the next day in the paper I was shocked to learn it was west of me not east. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All I’m merely saying is that other shootings (Orlando Pulse, Auora, Sandy Hook, etc etc) received weeks upon weeks upon weeks of coverage and all those combined don’t tally up to the casualty amount here. So, I guess I’d like at least equal coverage of the biggest mass shooting in United States history. In this case, it makes no matter about mass coverage. He isn’t alive to appreciate his work being covered. </p>

<p>This is a historically relevant event. Did you not want to hear and know what you could about 9/11? At that time in my life I was in 8th grade and I was fascinated by the historical significance of what I witnessed. This is awfully significant too. </p>

<p>As for a few other points, why are we entitled to see footage? Well, the police opened that Pandora’s box. They gave information to the public regarding the investigation. People crave information and want to know. It’s a major public event. How about Freedom of Information Act once the investigation is fully completed? There are lots of reasons to want to know this information and it should be made public at the appropriate time. I’m not calling for it to be released today and risk compromising any sort of information investigation into this. </p>

<p>Everything else, you have reasonable answers to, however they are merely conjecture as are many of my guesses to things. I think what people crave is some sort of official update, something to answer some of these questions. It matters incredibly if he shot 500+ people vs if they suffered other injuries as a result of the situation at hand. Shooting that many people, bump stock or not would be absolutely unprecedented. That’s why I think people want these answers. </p>
