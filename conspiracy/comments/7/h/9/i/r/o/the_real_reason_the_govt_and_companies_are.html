        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello my r/conspiracy bros.  Hope you are all well.  </p>

<p>I posted a few days ago about how those ancestry genetics testing services&#39; real intention isn&#39;t to sell you a service but to generate a DNA database of the population that contains matching names, addresses, and entire genetic profile.   Some of you stated that you are okay with this.  Even I stated it could be used to scan for disease/cancer prone genetic profiles and be sold products to help them.  Others stated they had no choice but to use the service because they needed to find who there parents were, etc...  No problem.  If you had a need then you really didn&#39;t have a choice, so I understand you.</p>

<p>However, for those who don&#39;t see an inherent problem with a database of DNA, let me try to change your opinion.  </p>

<p>How long do you think it will be before we find the &quot;violence gene&quot;, or the &quot;rape gene&quot;, or the &quot;pedophile genes&quot;, or the &quot;psychopath gene&quot;, or any other deviant behavior gene?  You could make the argument that we may never find them.  But I tend to disagree.  I think we&#39;re VERY close to finding the precise genes that control human behavior.  So let&#39;s say 10 or 15 years, we have found these genes.</p>

<p>What now?  The initial use of this DNA database will be to come up with potential candidates for a crime that has taken place near your area.  So, let&#39;s say there&#39;s a serial rapist who is running amok in a town in NJ.  The authorities will use the database to isolate all individuals prone to commit rape near the areas of attack.  Once they have a list of candidates, they will go through them one by one until they can locate the rapist.  Sound good?  Okay.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the next step?  Well, obviously, it&#39;s better to prevent a crime before it actually happens.  Right?  So the next logical step will be to monitor all individuals who carry a &quot;crime gene&quot;.  So, if you possess one of these genes, all your activities will be heavily monitored.  If you are acting a bit strange, you will be questioned.  Anytime there&#39;s a crime in your area, the police will be knocking on your door first.   Still okay with this?  Okay.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the next step?  Well, as shown with CRISPR gene editing technique, we can now splice and edit certain genes in developing organisms.  Without a doubt, we will soon be able to inject retroviruses in to people to correct genetic defects.  It will now be cheaper to just eliminate these genes instead of having to use vast resources monitoring the population who carries a &quot;crime gene&quot;.  So they will probably ask the people who have the deviant gene to voluntarily submit themselves to these &quot;gene therapies&quot;.  It will start out like a voluntary vaccination shots, like the flu shot.  People will be convinced that to prevent crime, just like preventing an outbreak, a crime vaccination shot is in their best interest.</p>

<p>But will everyone agree to take crime vacs shot? I don&#39;t think so.  In fact, I think very many will refuse.  Hence the government will pass the &quot;Crime Vaccination Act&quot;.  This act will work just like current vaccination shots.  Either you take the shot or be prevented from attending school, getting a job, or even be put in jail.  </p>

<p>And what&#39;s the atrocity of all this?  That people will be punished and ostracized simply for possessing a gene, even tho they have done nothing wrong.  Tell me, what is the difference between this and judging you by the color of your skin?  What is the difference between this and thinking you WILL commit a crime because you are black?  If you want to get rid of the crime gene, that&#39;s fine by all means, but to force a change on the population, isn&#39;t this the ultimate Orwellian society you could ever dream up?    Do you still disagree with me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DNA is a biological structure.  The first paper proves that you can produce effects using microwave energies on biological structures.  Did you actually read the paper?  If I know the location of someone and the resonant frequency of their DNA I can target them specifically.  This is just what is known based on public data and not what is known via DARPA, DIA, NRO, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, a laser is a type of directed energy weapon.  So are microwave weapons.  Anything where you direct energy at a target can be considered a directed energy weapon.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not talking about altering their DNA.  All of the cells in your body hold a copy of your DNA.  If I were to direct microwave energy at you at a frequency that aligns with resonant frequency of your DNA I could cause a physiological reaction.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same concept of when a group of soldiers walk over a bridge.  They are told not to march in step because if they were to keep marching in step side to side you can topple the bridge.  That&#39;s what is meant by resonant frequency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A single gene is rarely impactful towards health outcomes (most predict 0-25% MAX). Health, intelligence, physical ability is complex and webs of THOUSANDS of genes, epigenetic markers, metabolic patterns, and environments. It will be years before we can derive valid measures of intelligence based on genes, for example.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I am quite frightened of the dual marketing scheme used by Ancestry and 23&amp;Me in which they are paid both by individuals for personal information and companies and researchers for genetic meta data.</p>

<p>There are many public health studies looking into the ethics of these genetic marketing schemes and how incredibly misleading they are. People often greatly overvalue the current value of genetic material.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok.  You&#39;re the expert so I don&#39;t have any problems with your analysis.  But I&#39;m more worried about what one could do with a  database of matching names with complete DNA profiles.  A database like this is the ultimate power one could have over the population.  If leaked emails and social security numbers are a concern, imagine the power you can have with database of 200 million people of this kind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think these are very valid concerns, but in the name of science literacy, I also want to point out that finding something like &quot;the violence gene&quot; that can reliably label people is not realistic. They already have found genes associated with behavioural traits like that, but for one, there are probably all kinds of confounding genes they haven&#39;t identified yet, and more importantly, epigenetics (which they can&#39;t tell from your DNA alone) plays a <em>massive</em> role in determining which genes are actually expressed and how. Genes can give you probabilities for stuff like that, and those probabilities are getting more accurate all the time, but they never will provide certainty for most things, no matter how much the science progresses, because of the key role of epigenetics. </p>

<p>There is still plenty of cause for concern. You might be in for trouble even if your DNA just tells them there&#39;s a 75% chance you&#39;ll be violent or whatever. But it&#39;s also important to understand how we&#39;re learning more and more all the time that your DNA alone cannot define you. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the same concept of when a group of soldiers walk over a bridge.  They are told not to march in step because if they were to keep marching in step side to side you can topple the bridge.  That&#39;s what is meant by resonant frequency.</p>
