       Hello my r/conspiracy bros.  Hope you are all well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I posted a few days ago about how those ancestry genetics testing services' real intention isn't to sell you a service but to generate a DNA database of the population that contains matching names, addresses, and entire genetic profile.   Some of you stated that you are okay with this.  Even I stated it could be used to scan for disease/cancer prone genetic profiles and be sold products to help them.  Others stated they had no choice but to use the service because they needed to find who there parents were, etc...  No problem.  If you had a need then you really didn't have a choice, so I understand you.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, for those who don't see an inherent problem with a database of DNA, let me try to change your opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       How long do you think it will be before we find the "violence gene", or the "rape gene", or the "pedophile genes", or the "psychopath gene", or any other deviant behavior gene?  You could make the argument that we may never find them.  But I tend to disagree.  I think we're VERY close to finding the precise genes that control human behavior.  So let's say 10 or 15 years, we have found these genes.
      </p>
      <p>
       What now?  The initial use of this DNA database will be to come up with potential candidates for a crime that has taken place near your area.  So, let's say there's a serial rapist who is running amok in a town in NJ.  The authorities will use the database to isolate all individuals prone to commit rape near the areas of attack.  Once they have a list of candidates, they will go through them one by one until they can locate the rapist.  Sound good?  Okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the next step?  Well, obviously, it's better to prevent a crime before it actually happens.  Right?  So the next logical step will be to monitor all individuals who carry a "crime gene".  So, if you possess one of these genes, all your activities will be heavily monitored.  If you are acting a bit strange, you will be questioned.  Anytime there's a crime in your area, the police will be knocking on your door first.   Still okay with this?  Okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the next step?  Well, as shown with CRISPR gene editing technique, we can now splice and edit certain genes in developing organisms.  Without a doubt, we will soon be able to inject retroviruses in to people to correct genetic defects.  It will now be cheaper to just eliminate these genes instead of having to use vast resources monitoring the population who carries a "crime gene".  So they will probably ask the people who have the deviant gene to voluntarily submit themselves to these "gene therapies".  It will start out like a voluntary vaccination shots, like the flu shot.  People will be convinced that to prevent crime, just like preventing an outbreak, a crime vaccination shot is in their best interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       But will everyone agree to take crime vacs shot? I don't think so.  In fact, I think very many will refuse.  Hence the government will pass the "Crime Vaccination Act".  This act will work just like current vaccination shots.  Either you take the shot or be prevented from attending school, getting a job, or even be put in jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what's the atrocity of all this?  That people will be punished and ostracized simply for possessing a gene, even tho they have done nothing wrong.  Tell me, what is the difference between this and judging you by the color of your skin?  What is the difference between this and thinking you WILL commit a crime because you are black?  If you want to get rid of the crime gene, that's fine by all means, but to force a change on the population, isn't this the ultimate Orwellian society you could ever dream up?    Do you still disagree with me?

       Non of the links you just spent the time putting in your reply have to do with DNA. It's almost like you googled the words, "frequency weapon" and then thought that meant the same thing that you were implying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as far as crazy wacky patents go there are tons of them. There are patents for devices that let you astral project better, even though there is no scientific evidence that's even possible.

       DNA is a biological structure.  The first paper proves that you can produce effects using microwave energies on biological structures.  Did you actually read the paper?  If I know the location of someone and the resonant frequency of their DNA I can target them specifically.  This is just what is known based on public data and not what is known via DARPA, DIA, NRO, etc.

       Yes, a laser is a type of directed energy weapon.  So are microwave weapons.  Anything where you direct energy at a target can be considered a directed energy weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not talking about altering their DNA.  All of the cells in your body hold a copy of your DNA.  If I were to direct microwave energy at you at a frequency that aligns with resonant frequency of your DNA I could cause a physiological reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same concept of when a group of soldiers walk over a bridge.  They are told not to march in step because if they were to keep marching in step side to side you can topple the bridge.  That's what is meant by resonant frequency.

       A single gene is rarely impactful towards health outcomes (most predict 0-25% MAX). Health, intelligence, physical ability is complex and webs of THOUSANDS of genes, epigenetic markers, metabolic patterns, and environments. It will be years before we can derive valid measures of intelligence based on genes, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless I am quite frightened of the dual marketing scheme used by Ancestry and 23&amp;Me in which they are paid both by individuals for personal information and companies and researchers for genetic meta data.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many public health studies looking into the ethics of these genetic marketing schemes and how incredibly misleading they are. People often greatly overvalue the current value of genetic material.

       I gave a timeline of 10~15 years for all this to happen.  You don't think we'll be able to determine the combination of genes that cause deviant behavior by then?  I'm sure we won't figure it all out, but simple ones like propensity for violence and such, don't you think we'll be able to map them out by then?

       We are still at the phase of finding individual gene contributions, genome-wide association studies are rising in popularity, however are expensive (require twin or family studies or mass meta-data). The problem with the results from 23&amp;Me and Ancestry type services is that their results are not nearly as valuable as a family study in which the environmental component of genes can be teased out. You basically have no baseline, except those with a similar ethnic/racial background to reference results to (with no way to generalize environment). Whereas in family studies, you can weight results by "genetic relatedness" (parents and siblings multiplied by 0.5, aunt, uncles, gparents 0.25). This essentially allows for a genetic risk factor score.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's take your deviant behavior example. Thousands, if not millions+, possibilities of gene combinations can all result in a similar deviant behavior outcome. Check out the early studies on the "warrior gene" Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), where a scientist falsely assumed that the Maori people (Polynesian / New Zealand tribe) have a SINGLE GENE that predisposes them to violence or criminal behavior. But how do we know that this is purely genetic, or a combination of genes and environments? Are there certain factors in the environment that trigger this gene, or webs of genes that are connected with this neurotransmitter? These kinds of probabilistic, conjecture, will greatly retard the progress of genetic insight. Another example is obesity. I remember seeing a study of a genome chip test of metabolic genes and just the insane amount of permutations that result in visceral obesity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am optimistic, however I am fearful that low health literacy will be used as a tool to attract people into sharing and overanalyzing their genetic results. This follows suit with many theories on the "medicalization of american society", or in other words, the obsession with naming illnesses, conditions, and labeling things that are in truth, incredibly complex webs of genetic and environmental signals over spans of time. This will only be exemplified further in over analyzing genetic results.
      </p>
      <p>
       A timeline of this is difficult to assume, I think many webs will be theorized within 10-15 years, however if these theories are solidified into "fact", is another story. Thankfully, genetic discrimination is of great public health concern, however as seen in the marketing and advertising models, companies are still subverting individuals' health beliefs through phrases like "find YOUR genes", when these genes are shared across species, animals, plants, and life in general.

       Ok.  You're the expert so I don't have any problems with your analysis.  But I'm more worried about what one could do with a  database of matching names with complete DNA profiles.  A database like this is the ultimate power one could have over the population.  If leaked emails and social security numbers are a concern, imagine the power you can have with database of 200 million people of this kind.

       I think these are very valid concerns, but in the name of science literacy, I also want to point out that finding something like "the violence gene" that can reliably label people is not realistic. They already have found genes associated with behavioural traits like that, but for one, there are probably all kinds of confounding genes they haven't identified yet, and more importantly, epigenetics (which they can't tell from your DNA alone) plays a
       <em>
        massive
       </em>
       role in determining which genes are actually expressed and how. Genes can give you probabilities for stuff like that, and those probabilities are getting more accurate all the time, but they never will provide certainty for most things, no matter how much the science progresses, because of the key role of epigenetics.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is still plenty of cause for concern. You might be in for trouble even if your DNA just tells them there's a 75% chance you'll be violent or whatever. But it's also important to understand how we're learning more and more all the time that your DNA alone cannot define you.

       You hit it on the head.  75% chance will be enough reason for the govt to start doing this.  Think about immunizations.  What are the chances that you'll really catch measles or smallpox?  Very little.  Yet, you still are required to take the vaccine.

       I am a geneticist. This is really not much of a worry of mine. There are much more nefarious things they can do with data bases of our genetics then finding the Pedophile gene.

       Sure.  I know what you mean.  This was just one example to make people aware of how DNA can be used.  I'm sure they will think of 100x worse ways to use a DNA database.  As long as people are thinking about the issues, I think we're making progress.

       Well, the example I gave was the least offensive I could think up so as to not scare away normies.  But I'm sure you or I could come up with a few hundred terrible, horrific scenarios where a database of DNA could be used.

       It's scary how true this sounds, it actually is probably right on the head for what will happen, they probably already know they're gonna do it. If an elitist is reading this they would probably sit back and say " damn, were getting predictable" lol

       the results, though, didn't really match documented family lore on either side of my family.  Both sides have clear, unambiguous history prior to arrival in the New World.  The tree-branches ending in me and my aunts are pretty lacking in the ethnic groups dominating our results.  Unless we were the result of multiple generations of infidelity.

       Non of the links you just spent the time putting in your reply have to do with DNA. It's almost like you googled the words, "frequency weapon" and then thought that meant the same thing that you were implying.

       Also, as far as crazy wacky patents go there are tons of them. There are patents for devices that let you astral project better, even though there is no scientific evidence that's even possible.

       Yes, a laser is a type of directed energy weapon.  So are microwave weapons.  Anything where you direct energy at a target can be considered a directed energy weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not talking about altering their DNA.  All of the cells in your body hold a copy of your DNA.  If I were to direct microwave energy at you at a frequency that aligns with resonant frequency of your DNA I could cause a physiological reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same concept of when a group of soldiers walk over a bridge.  They are told not to march in step because if they were to keep marching in step side to side you can topple the bridge.  That's what is meant by resonant frequency.

       We are still at the phase of finding individual gene contributions, genome-wide association studies are rising in popularity, however are expensive (require twin or family studies or mass meta-data). The problem with the results from 23&amp;Me and Ancestry type services is that their results are not nearly as valuable as a family study in which the environmental component of genes can be teased out. You basically have no baseline, except those with a similar ethnic/racial background to reference results to (with no way to generalize environment). Whereas in family studies, you can weight results by "genetic relatedness" (parents and siblings multiplied by 0.5, aunt, uncles, gparents 0.25). This essentially allows for a genetic risk factor score.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's take your deviant behavior example. Thousands, if not millions+, possibilities of gene combinations can all result in a similar deviant behavior outcome. Check out the early studies on the "warrior gene" Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), where a scientist falsely assumed that the Maori people (Polynesian / New Zealand tribe) have a SINGLE GENE that predisposes them to violence or criminal behavior. But how do we know that this is purely genetic, or a combination of genes and environments? Are there certain factors in the environment that trigger this gene, or webs of genes that are connected with this neurotransmitter? These kinds of probabilistic, conjecture, will greatly retard the progress of genetic insight. Another example is obesity. I remember seeing a study of a genome chip test of metabolic genes and just the insane amount of permutations that result in visceral obesity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am optimistic, however I am fearful that low health literacy will be used as a tool to attract people into sharing and overanalyzing their genetic results. This follows suit with many theories on the "medicalization of american society", or in other words, the obsession with naming illnesses, conditions, and labeling things that are in truth, incredibly complex webs of genetic and environmental signals over spans of time. This will only be exemplified further in over analyzing genetic results.
      </p>
      <p>
       A timeline of this is difficult to assume, I think many webs will be theorized within 10-15 years, however if these theories are solidified into "fact", is another story. Thankfully, genetic discrimination is of great public health concern, however as seen in the marketing and advertising models, companies are still subverting individuals' health beliefs through phrases like "find YOUR genes", when these genes are shared across species, animals, plants, and life in general.
