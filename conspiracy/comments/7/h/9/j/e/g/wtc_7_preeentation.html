I'm your regular high schooler and my English presentation is going to be about the wtc 7 demolition. 
What are the things that I just have to mention.

       Biggest things to me are
      </p>
      <p>
       No plane hit building 7
      </p>
      <p>
       it’s rubble pile burned as intensely and as long as tower one and Two, with no plane
      </p>
      <p>
       The building feel at near free fall speed
      </p>
      <p>
       No other steel framed structures had fallen from fire, until the morning of 9/11 and then there were three. Shoe other steel buildings that burned longer and didn’t fall, there are many examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       The destruction was a “classic” controlled demolition pattern, look into the crimp and the way the penthouse (small building the allows the stairs to end on the roof) falls first through the roof into the building
      </p>
      <p>
       Also look into BBC reporter declaring it down with the building still standing in her shot and it actually fell around 30 minutes later

       Anytime I have noticed they are stepping up the “debunking” links in results these days so please spread this to anyone you can to get people to stop being programmed. Building 7 is a great opener to try to get people to wake up to 9/11 being BS. I was asleep for sooooo long that now that I know I want EVERYONE to know!

       oh i hear ya man. belinda me, i’ve had the building 7 debate many times before (most recently in a youtube comments section...shudder...) but i hadn’t seen a lot on the fires themselves. just the free fall acceleration, symmetry, through the path of most resistance, etc etc. this is good info to have

       Excellent point in fact the truck drivers that hauled the rubble were under extreme watch. One who deviated his route and was  overdue was fired and replaced that same day. Also check into the scrap yard that the debris was taken to it was connected to the cabal that ran the job and all debris was shipped to China without being inspected.

       People don't talk about this enough. You could convert a lot of people because otherwise people don't see why and then don't believe it happened. After thinking about that myself, I am now a believer because I though t it was ridiculous, then I realized why they would do it. That would be why WTC7 was thankfully evacuated.

       NIST have basically admitted that WTC7 was demolished on purpose, in their report they have actually included David Chandlers analysis that the whole structure went into literal freefall for 2.25 seconds, the only way this can be possible is if all the supporting columns were cut at the same time.

       Heat from the fires sheared the bolts holding the floors together due to metal expansion. This started mainly on the lower floors. With that structural failure down below in a supporting column caused the entire column to come down in a implosion type collapse i.e. from the centre outwards.

       It keeps getting more ridiculous. I gave you a real explanation of the reason why and how building 7 collapsed and you threw in thermite  just for kicks. And you must be the most empty headed demolition crew if you use thermite as a heat expansion agent. It melts stuff not heat it up over the course of hours of even minutes. How do you not understand this?

       What is more rediculous?  Really? Covert demolition teams rigging a new York skyscraper without anyone knowing or delivering evidence? And just because the exact same situation hasn't happend before doesn't make it impossible. What kind of an argument is that? 
If you give me an exact replica of a wtc 7. Hit it with massive amounts of debris. Set it on fire. Let it burn uncontrolled because of failing sprinklers and fire fighters who deem it a lost structure. You'd most likely get the same outcome. What incredibly dumb conspiracy is it that they rigged a skyscraper with thermite. Let another skyscraper falling down hit it and set it on fire, but still keep enough integrity to not cause a premature or extremely delayed explosion. Let alone keep your highly clandestine operation hidden from all investigations in a rubble pile. They can't even get 100% of controlled explosions go right. Why would you risk such a massive conspiracy with so many variables?

       Still. Too many variables to get a hypothetical cover blown. And just throwing nuclear and thermobaric in there still does not explain anything about metal expansion. Just different type of explosions. If I'd be a teenager looking for things I don't understand thermobaric and nuclear might peak my imagination. But it doesn't add anything to any logical explanation. Try again

       Except for the part where that's never happened before from office fires, and the simulations which showed that were only put forth after all the other models were debunked. Let alone that those fires couldnt burn hot enough to cause the bolts to shear.
      </p>
      <p>
       The notion that fires would symmetrically cause all those bolts to shear simultaneously (which is what would have to happen to get that blatant "crimp" you see on video) is just silly. Also the office fires were only on a few floors and not the ones which would be necessary to cause the symmetrical inward collapse
      </p>

       The evidence in this metabunk article is tenuous at best, even more illogical than the popular mechanics article debunking the demolition.

       So if that's your argument, you would still need a symmetrical floor expansion on a floor to floor basis. Fires were only on 3 floors in the lower part of the building, all the central supports on one individual floor could feasibly sheer at once from expansion, but not all the bolts on multiple floors at the same time. For that to happen, you would need to have similar heating profiles in similar, central locations on almost all the floors in the lower third of the building. Without that happening, the collapse simply could not reach free-fall acceleration for 2.25 seconds. Even just a handful of floors without fire maintaining their central support for even seconds longer than other floors would provide enough resistance to make free fall impossible. Even if you buy the inward bowing theory model, you cannot reconcile this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Kevin Ryan pointed out, they couldn't achieve these parameters in real lab tests, only on computer simulations. Why? Because as every other fire in a steel-framed building in world history has shown, floors don't expand to shear bolts in this way, ever. And they certainly don't expand symmetrically and simultaneously on floors which aren't on fire. The sheer force from other expanding floors would be met with resistance from intact floors, and would make free fall impossible.

       I love conspiracies, but when I found out that there are counter arguments to the fall of building 7, I investigated immediately. When you watch the classic shot of it going down pay close attention to a structure on the top of the building. It is a box room above the roof line and it collapses down before the building goes down. This actually shows how the guts of the building (not seen much because no camera on south side) are falling down much sooner then the side we see fall.

       That's because of an entire column in the center had lost its structural integrity at the bottom. Caused by the metal in the floors expanding and shearing the bolts holding it together. The entire column collapsed at once. Leading to an inside out propagation of collapse.

       Stick to the facts rather than grandiose allegations...better to understate a really strong case than make claims you can't support. Despite other comments, I would stay away from talking about the "why" maybe other than broadly pointing out that many entities have benefitted in very clear ways from 9/11, the Patriot act, and the war on terror. The "why" is far too complex to get into in a high school presentation, and you'll just ruin your argument. Let the students who see that wtc7 is the smoking gun find out the why on their own, you should just be trying to show them that a big fraud has been perpetrated, not why it was perpetrated.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that in mind, key points:
--if you can start off with a quick 10sec video of the building collapsing...that's the most powerful evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       This 5 minute video is really good because it makes only claims which have a high burden of proof. This is what you should be doing with your presentation, stay focused on just a handful of very strong pieces of evidence.

       I would show it to the class if you can, or at least pictures of the graph they include in here and collapse itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point out that never before have high-rise buildings collapsed from fires, ever. (you can give examples like the towers in Madrid/Dubai which burned hotter and longer than WTC 7 and never came close to collapsing).
      </p>
      <p>
       at first NIST said there was no free fall, then they had to retract and admit free fall. (Get that source, and show the graph). Why is free fall important? Because it's physically impossible to hit that rate of acceleration with any standing support left at all underneath, as would be the case if fires caused the collapse..i.e by definition the building had to be demolished by taking out the support from the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make the point that even if office fires could burn hot enough to do this, it would be physically impossible to have a symmetrical burn rate necessary for the building to fall straight downwards into it's own foundation. There would have to be parts that melted more quickly than others, causing the building to "lean" to one side or another, unless all the supports were removed simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get the quote from Silverstein about "pulling it" (i.e demolishing it), and the fireman who said the same thing at ground zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get the video/image of the BBC reporting the collapse early with WTC 7 still standing in the background.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get quotes from Kevin Ryan (who worked for underwriters labs which did the testing) about how many thousands of computer simulations failed before they finally made one that worked...how they doubled the amount of fuel and the time under fire of that simulation to make it work. (I.e talk about how they went through inward bowing theory, pancake theory, etc and how the final report was solely based on computer simulations and no actual evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get quotes from Nobel prize winner Dario Fo who basically tore the entire report to shreds..he makes loads of good points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I would stay away from getting into the insurance claim or Silverstein not showing up on 9/11....that's all blanket accusations with no definite endgame to prove "why". First you have to convince people that they're blatantly being lied to by the government, then the ones who can see it will naturally seek out the why on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes me very happy to see someone in highschool trying to spread the word..so keep up the good work, let me know if I can help you in any way.

       Thank you so much, this has been an awesome answer. Too bad the talking part of the discussion is going to be a maximum of 5 minutes and I can't show any video. But I'll put the graph in there. Together with a quote from Dario fo for credibility. 
Thanks

       Perhaps most important is the need to address as many counterarguments as you can because, as you'd imagine, your audience will be very skepitcal.
Be sure to present on the thermite reactions and do some psychological incentive/motivational analysis.

       Excellent point in fact the truck drivers that hauled the rubble were under extreme watch. One who deviated his route and was  overdue was fired and replaced that same day. Also check into the scrap yard that the debris was taken to it was connected to the cabal that ran the job and all debris was shipped to China without being inspected.
