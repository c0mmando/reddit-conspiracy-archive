       Hopi Indians are forbidden to reveal the Grand Canyon entrance leading to the "inside world", other tribes will freely share such information with a trusted ally.
      </p>
      <p>
       A description was passed down from the first human civilization of Mesopotamia, of the first mountain ever to receive a name, Mount Mashu.  After traveling through the darkness of a tunnel through the mountain, one man found an entrance to a bountiful, green subterranean garden.  That was only the first clue that the planet Earth is partially hollow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Numerous locations for entrances to the Hollow Earth have been documented... Paris, France; Staffordshire, England; Montreal, Canada; Hangzhou, China, and the Amazon Rainforest.  The elders of the Hopi Indians are forbidden to reveal the entrance hidden in the Grand Canyon which leads to the "inside world".  Of course the most widely known openings are at the North and South poles.  It was the 8th Earl of Clancarty who first recognized, the only way all icebergs could be composed of frozen fresh water, was if there were rivers flowing from the inside of the world to the outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edmond Halley, the English astronomer who computed the 76-year orbit of Halley's Comet, also figured the Earth is made up of a hollow shell 500 miles thick, with more concentric shells inside, separated by a luminous atmosphere.  Escaping gas causes the Aurora Borealis.  Inventor of the calculus, Leonhard Euler, the eminent mathematician, calculated against the idea of multiple shells and in favor of a centrally located interior sun, providing light to advanced civilizations living on the inner surface of the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1913 a full explanation of the formation of hollow planets was published by Marshall Gardner of Illinois.  One year before the release of his treatise, he registered a United States patent on a working model of the Hollow Earth, complete with interior sun represented by a light bulb.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pulp magazine Amazing Stories ran a series of factual articles between 1945 and '49 in which it was disclosed that a superior, pre-historic race once lived under the crust of our planet, and their descendants live there still.  Thousands of readers posted letters to the editor, affirming that they had indeed been able to hear voices from inside the Earth.
      </p>

       Jean Le Clerc Milfort fought in the American Revolution.  He was caught in a duel at the court of Louis the XVI in France, and having killed a servant in the King's household, was forced to emigrate to America.  On the side of the British he led a contingent of Creek Indians into battle.  Near the end of the war when the Indians wished to return home, he further led them to present-day Louisiana, where the Creek nation allowed him access to an enormous tribal domain underground, which he estimated could easily contain twenty thousand families.

       The Hindus believe in Patala, a subterranean heaven.  Patala is filled with splendid jewels and beautiful groves of trees.  A Sweet fragrance fills the air and sweet music can be perceived at the threshold of hearing.  There is no sunlight in the lower realm, but the darkness is dissipated by the shining of the jewels.  Underground riches are also represented in the beliefs of Tibetan Buddhist monks.  An endless cavern is filled with ancient machinery, the majority of which has not been used in thousands of years.  The writer Lobsang Rampa describes the activation of one such machine beneath the Himalayan mountains, which illuminates the ghosts who walk among the living.  Their molecules, after departing this world, are so widely dispersed that a ghost can walk through walls, without contact with the atomic structure of the wall itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       A monument stands in Hamilton, Ohio to John Cleves Symmes, who proposed an expedition to the entrance passage at the North Pole.  US president John Quincy Adams offered the financial support of the government for this effort.  But the next president, Andrew Jackson, cut funding for the expedition.  The renowned spiritualist, Lady Paget, predicted that the entrance to the underground kingdom will be found in this century, after the year 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat Earth is a psy-op. If you want real truth then start Hollow Earth trending then watch the government freak the fuck out.

       You mean fantasies are nice and there is always some way for us to make them real for ourselves just as long as we don't get completely lost in them.

       Rucker is a rather interesting fellow apart from this and his numerous other forays into fiction. He's one of the founding fathers of cyber-punk. Last I heard he was finally getting around to a sequel to this one.

       I was just doing some reading about him. Interesting man with good thoughts and concepts attached to him. I've found a few interviews with him where he refers to 'his' character of Eddie Poe, and how he conceived the characters, how he entangled his real life childhood into the 'stories' in The Hollow Earth, yet at the end of this pdf he clearly states this is not a work of fiction and was based on a manuscript written by Mason himself. What's your take on that?

       Like I said, it's not a good idea to get completely lost in any fantasy. Conan Doyle's fictional Sherlock Holmes was such a powerful and convincing character he began to reach right out of the pages and take control of Doyle's life. Doyle tried killing him off so he wouldn't have to write about him any more but Holmes was of course always smarter than Doyle and actually escaped the fate Doyle had planned for him and used the belief he was dead to recuperate from the close call and continue to work under cover on yet another adventure. As you can see, such things can begin take on a life and a reality of their own where they intersect with ours.

       Na, no liver probs here. Had Hep C for 30yrs and got the latest anti-viral's for it last year and cleared it in a few months!
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't believe
       <em>
        how much better
       </em>
       I feel, esp cognitively, for a while there a few years back I thought I was getting some type of 'early inset Alzheimer's'!! Fuck that shit!
      </p>
      <p>
       But thanks for the kind thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In return, IF you're having problems with 'anxiety' and/or depression related to anxiety, take 1000mgs of magnesium supplements and watch how quickly you calm down! The stuff works
       <em>
        immediately
       </em>
       i.e. a couple of hours and you've 'noticed' you've calmed down a Lot!
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't believe more drs aren't aware of how
       <em>
        magnesium deficient
       </em>
       the 'average westerner's diet' is!
      </p>
      <p>
       After all it's not just a
       <em>
        vitally important
       </em>
       mineral for proper neural functions, without it people suffer from increased anxiety!

       Tellinger has pushed flat earth. I was quite astonished to see it, but he goes on about it in one of his videos.

       The whole Adam's Calendar and mysterious structures across Africa thing is very interesting but it just shows you how anyone can believe flat earth, and plenty do.

       In the bible, light was created 3 days before the Sun, for what it's worth. It's possible if flat earth is a psyops, it could lead people away from geocentrism with an immovable earth and cellestial objects moving aloft. Still, there's no detectable curvature, so it would have to be a giant sphere if spherical at all.

       I have hear legends of our ancestors , called the Lumerians. These were a race of master cave builders.  They lived in a time when massive creatures roamed the earth, and the Lumerians evolved an aversion to violence because of this constant fear of death, and they went underground.  They had highly developed senses, being that they were always on a heightened pitch of awareness. Imagine if you are constantly , every moment , on alert something was coming to attack you or harm you kill you, they were terrified. Under this experience,  your hearing and they way you communicate begins to  include frequencies we ignore in our current much less dangerous  society.  After generations of running from intense fear, they went underground, the only safe place for them to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where they developed and perfected sound technology. Like I said their range of perceivable frequencies was much wider than ours. They learned a language where they could adjust the pitch of their voice to communicate over miles of tunnels, a high pitch like a dog whistle.  This frequency when honed can also alter the vibration of objects, loosening their molecular structure.  That movie Dune, where they use their voice as a type of amplifier, that comes from the knowing of the Lumerians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their aversion to fear and violence was so great it was also a weakness. Their fear of venturing in the outer world left them frail, sickly, their bodies under constant stress from the burying of the human violent expressions. Even to kill or swat a bug that was on their leg was terrifying to them. They moved with great care to avoid stepping on them. So they had this power from heightened senses, but also at a great suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their tunnel systems were very well hidden. The entrances were natural looking, with places for them to observe the other creatures near their area. They would watch Neanderthal man, observing , never making their presence known. But they knew when someone was around because they could sense the slightest tremor in the earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont know what became of them, their lineage may still be imparted Into our dna, and into our collective memory. I first heard this from Seth channeled by Jane Roberts.

       . You shouldn't be so quick to dismiss things and ridicule others who don't believe the same thing as you. It doesn't take a creationist moron to question the co-existence of humans and dinosaurs. Get your head out of your arrogant ass and open your mind

       <p>
        The Seth Material is a collection of writing dictated by Jane Roberts to her husband from late 1963 until her death in 1984. Roberts claimed the words were spoken by a discarnate entity named Seth.[1] The material is regarded as one of the cornerstones of New Age philosophy, and the most influential channelled text of the post-World War II "New Age" movement, other than the Edgar Cayce books and A Course in Miracles.[2] Jon Klimo writes that the Seth books were instrumental in bringing the idea of channeling to a broad public audience.

       Personally there's little real evidence to support either theory. My opinion.

       There's other more evidence backed theories we could support.

       I hate flat earth but love hallow earth. I don't think the earth is completely hallowed out though but I could see there being some caves or something to lead to each other. Either way I can actually entertain hallow earth unlike flat earth.

       So the Russians drilled a hole like 12km deep, and it was basically impossible to drill any deeper - it was too hot. If the Earth was hollow, with a cavernous system as you say, I guess where this bore hole is, it should probably be something under. But no - it's not possible to drill deeper than 12km, and it consistently gets hotter the deeper you get.
      </p>
      <p>
       This itself is pretty interesting to me, and it kind of disproves the hollow Earth theory, but it could also be that, our fucking planet is slightly oblong, maybe at the poles we got some hollow earth going on, I don't know. But - drilling deeper than 12km seems difficult as fuck, the Kola is not the only hole, many have encountered similar issues.

       Maybe that is a defense mechanism. Or maybe the Russians lied. Maybe there’s only a few ways in and the rest is protected by a heated shield or something. The earth isn’t like a jawbreaker with a molten core. It’s made of of caverns, pockets and habitable areas near the surface.

       I think it was just a painting. I measured the disc as a perfect circle, which contradicts what they say the earth should be shaped with flattened poles and slightly bulging equator.

       The Earth is nearly a perfect circle, though. If you shrunk the planet to the size of a billiard ball, it would be smoother and more of a perfect sphere than the ball. The flattening at the poles and bulge at the equator is only very slight.

       It's not SO egg-shaped that it's noticeable in a photo. But it is slightly egg-shaped because Earth's mass is not distributed evenly, along with the uneven gravitational pull. It causes a bulge in the center and very small, undetectable to the naked eye bumps and bulges around the rest of the planet. The Earth's shape actually changes ever-so-slightly over time, but nothing so drastic that it would send people into a frenzy.

       Your mail has been subtracted from reddits database, thx to our amazing virtual quantum computer,from there we searched you in all the databases on earth to find the bank account and passport, so you don't actually need to send me anything.

       It's a lob of rock, literally. It's not a perfect sphere when you remove the water from the surfaces. I don't believe a "hollow earth" is relevant when there's clear proof of massive cave networks around the planet ie Mammoth Caves.

       So to come up with a 12 km depth and lava isn't proof. Also, there's probably lava in the inner mantle.

        So the Russians drilled a hole like 12km deep, and it was basically impossible to drill any deeper - it was too hot. If the Earth was hollow, with a cavernous system as you say, I guess where this bore hole is, it should probably be something under. But no - it's not possible to drill deeper than 12km, and it consistently gets hotter the deeper you get.

       Except the temperature gradient was dramatically different from what was expected.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Continental_Deep_Drilling_Programme">
        The KTB borehole found the same thing
       </a>
       . If the earth is hotter than expected closer to the surface, this means that radioactive decay has far more impact on heat than a molten core (which holds the residual heat from Earth's formation, more or less, which is the other part of what determines temperature under the surface).
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence, there is something different than our current scientific theories regarding the internal formation of the Earth. We've already found a

       TIL: Caves exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       More interesting than that are the number of underground human built cave complexes/shelters carved by some unknown process by unknown people.  Actually caves you can find and which have carved walls. These things are huge, they will  blow your mind. They were build thousands of years before we ever realized we might need nuclear bomb shelters.

       Let me apologize first for my bad english:
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in montreal and when I was young I would often go out with friends on the mount royal. We found a suspicious rock pattern which looked like it was put there purposely to hide something, we started to remove all the rocks, every night from 1-4AM, we would go there and dig. I could tell there was a room or a tunnel, because on top of the entrance 10meters away there was a small cavity hinting that something was under our feet. I did some research on the internet and found out there was an old train station passing through the mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway on the fifth night we went back there to dig and the entrance was no where to be found, its like we had a mass hallucination for 4 days in a row. I could tell we where at the good location but there was no sign of the entrance anymore. Everything was grassy and there was no cavity at the top anymore. This is when I realized someone probably knew we were here and told my friend we should leave as soon as possible something strange was happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       We ran away and never went back.

       You should! This is so interesting. If there were underground civilizations who were advanced, they would probably deter people from discovering openings by hiding and masking them, and depending on their technology and abilities, maybe they could make people forget or hallucinate. If you go back keep us updated!

       If true, this would easily be picked up by seismic surveying (since seismic waves wouldn't be able to propagate through the empty space) and other geophysical techniques (low gravity anomalies, magnetic anomalies, etc).

       I am both intrigued and terrified of seismic surveying due to Kong Skull Island. But also who's to say nobody has done this before? It's not like amateur scientists/theorists like ourselves have access to the products and tools needed for seismic surveying. But militaries most definitely can (and maybe have already) perform these kinds of studies! They already use it for gas and oil explorations.

       Yeah, I didn't want to be too negative, but part of my point was that if this were true, lots of evidence of it would certainly already exist, and it would have to be a pretty massive coverup for us to be unaware of it, considering how routine this kind of research is for both academic studies and oil/gas/mineral exploration all over the world...

       Obviously the earth should be hollow because it's spinning right ? I mean when you spin something doesn't the mass get pushed away from the middle ? Imagine your clothes in the spin cycle .

       For that to be true the earth would have to expand greatly. The mass inside the earth couldn't just be pushed to the sides, it would need open room so that it could expand outwards. Your clothes in a spin cycles stick to the sides because it is spinning fast, AND there is open room for it. Hollow earth is something I believe in, but I don't think it has anything to do with the earth spinning!

       Anyone who starts a title with "this is not a psy-op" makes me think this IS a psy-op.. Is both hollow earth and flat earth a psy-op developed by the government to distract from how shitty they are?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue this is the case. Maybe legitimately developed by religious people because we know how gullible they must be for believing fairy tales and logical fallacies like the earth being 6 thousand years old.

       Yes there are caves, you got me on that, but quite the jump that because there are caves, there must be "civilizations" within the earth. Ridiculous.

       Aren't you going to argue why nobody has even a picture out of 300 million people, if you say "one entrance" is in Arizona, then surely someone has gone there and can provide some physical evidence, no?

       This is behaviour that is typical of of a psy-op in my opinion. I would entertain evidence, if you could provide it, I stand by this and am waiting patiently, I would like to be wrong.

       So, because there's caves then that means the earth is hollow? Sounds like you've made an amazing discovery! Do men with machine guns guard the entrances to the caves, preventing you from getting some pictures of this "hollow earth civilization"? Even pictures of the men with machine guns guarding the entrances, will pique my interest enough to continue to entertain your theory further..

       I'm probably far too late to this party but if anyone wants to seriously look into this topic more please read:
       <strong>
        Hollow Planets: A Feasibility Study
       </strong>
       by Jan Lamprecht. It is mainly a study on our seismological knowledge, where it comes from and just how much we do and don't know about what's beneath our feet. It is incredibly interesting and will change the way you think about the notion of the Earth, and the other planets, being hollow.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of comments here that claim we'd be able to tell and there would be countless anomalies to indicate the world is hollow, well there are. Tons, almost too many to list, that book is full of them. For example, after about 400km down seismic waves stop behaving normally, the aurora is mirrored at the poles! That's right, the aurora in the north pole is a mirror of the one in the south pole and vice versa. Seriously read that book, anyone that can't find it ask me and I'll send you an ebook copy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sucks I got here to late because I can talk about this all day. The earth is very probably hollow, and the kicker is if the earth is, almost every other planet is as well.
