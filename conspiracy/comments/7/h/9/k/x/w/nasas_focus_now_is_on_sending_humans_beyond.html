       Sure but since that time they have built an entire space station in low earth orbit, with many countries having been up. Yet still no one has left low earth orbit, past the Van Allen radiation belt.

       Apparently you get a whole years worth of exposure to radiation, in 1 day on the international space station. This line was also puzzling

       They were probably upset about being beat to the moon by the US. They've recently announced their plan to put a man on the moon. Here's what one Russian had to say:

         But it is hard to find a better way to hurt Russian prestige and emphasise Russian technological backwardness than by sending cosmonauts to the Moon around 2030, 60 years after Apollo.”

       This fallacy is always reiterated by someone, and yet it remains a complete fallacy of so epic proportions you would have to be fucking retarded to keep uttering it.

       5% of federal budget back then was not all that much to be honest, and technology today is so far ahead of what was available then that it's not even comparable.

       Calling the moon a dead rock is a completely laughable fallacy, as you are in no position whatsoever to say what the moon has on it or what it does not have on it. You have no fucking qualifications, so shut the fuck up.

       That doesn't mean anything. It's an empty statement of rhetoric meant to influence someone that has no idea what you are talking about. Money spent means nothing. They could have funneled all the money they spent into space operations into war or any number of places.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could have a secret space program right now on Jupiter and you wouldn't have a clue. You are restating useless fact figures produced by the government. Meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, if logic dictates they couldn't actually get anywhere in space anyway, then probably there would be a lot less money spent trying.

       Which ones?  180 of the 270 moon rocks "brought back" have gone missing and the other 90 are not allowed to be studied and analyzed by researchers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason is obvious, moon rocks can be found on earth and it is also well known that these rocks are virtually indistinguishable from NASA’s collection of Moon rocks and actual testing would prove that they too have gone through our atmosphere

       How is launching a rocket into LEO evidence of humans landing on the moon.

       It isn't.

       The original videotapes, telemetry tapes and blueprints are all "missing" or "lost"
      </p>
      <p>
       The photographic "evidence" is proven fraudulent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the Moon rocks are "missing" and the others claimed to have come from the moon are unverifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is literally no physical evidence to examine.

       I think you are missing the point. There is a huge difference between the moon and Mars. The exposure between here and the moon is not anywhere close to the exposure between here and Mars. You are talking about 3-4x more radiation than the moon trip which is already a lot

       Honestly, if they don't even get back to the moon by 2030 we basically never went there. At this point the shit is ridiculous. We have startups that can now launch rockets into space lol. In 15 years startups will be able to go to the moon easy.... if we can even do it.

       the tricky part would be matching the Lunar orbital speed around the Earth (apogee of something ballistic launched is generally zero, but the Moon is speeding around the Earth at its orbital height), insertion from apogee+speed into orbit around the Moon, landing taking off and safely returning.

       Yeah that's pretty easy actually. And the gravity of the moon is so little that it hardly takes anything to head back.
