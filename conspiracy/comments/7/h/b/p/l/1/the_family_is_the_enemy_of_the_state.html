        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since the Progressive Era and entered new phases in the late 60s and now the digital/information age.  </p>

<p>Public education aims to instill morals, values, history, etc. in place of the family.  It aims to the be real parent of the children.</p>

<p>Popular media undermines the importance of traditional family, its purpose and regularly casts stupid fathers, strong women and children who basically run the family with their needs and wants.</p>

<p>In many ways I see Behavioral Health and modern practices of psychiatry aiding this gradual conquest because many times people are told that someone else caused their problems (usually a mom or dad) when a necessity for being free is taking the responsibility to accept your own actions and knowing only you can change your station in life.</p>

<p>This ties in with scientism, which basically is today&#39;s creed.  Scientific concepts most of us do not understand are taken for granted as the justification for the &quot;end justifies the means&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much more that I hope others are willing to discuss...but the bottom line is:</p>

<p>Family has always been the institution that holds together a strong society.  When families were strong, society was strong.  When the importance and the authority of the family recedes this provides a vacuum for individuals to indoctrinate empty vessels (children) and program society the way &quot;they think it should be&quot;.  It&#39;s a type of gradualism that is worked on generation after generation.  The Long game....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Family is indeed important. It is the foundational blocks upon which all of society is built. This was even identified by the Greeks and Romans. The Greek term- <em>οἶκος</em> meant household, and was considered the foundational aspect of a City and its government. Cicero wrote in his De Republica that the Republic was formed from elite families that came together to create a commonwealth to protect what they had acquired, their property. That said, I have a couple of comments for the rest of the post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Public education aims to instill morals, values, history, etc. in place of the family. It aims to the be real parent of the children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t have to. I think Public Education is important, but I think that part of the problem is also the parents. They believe that school should do just what you did, and become lax themselves in their parenting. School has a place in raising the child, it is there to acclimate them to wider society. Parents are to teach manners, morals, and ethical living. School is to teach you history and facts that compliment the foundation of the family, at least that&#39;s how I think it should be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In many ways I see Behavioral Health and modern practices of psychiatry aiding this gradual conquest because many times people are told that someone else caused their problems (usually a mom or dad) when a necessity for being free is taking the responsibility to accept your own actions and knowing only you can change your station in life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A good point, but it is also important to note that <em>because</em> the family unit is so essential, parents and their parenting style really can effect their kids, and it can do so in terrible ways. There&#39;s a reasons its called the cycle of abuse...but you are completely correct, in that even if your parents helped fuck you up, it is still ultimately <em>your</em> responsibility to end the cycle, and to be better parents than they were. Just realizing that your parents were awful and help ruin your childhood is only part of the problem, next you need to learn from their mistakes with you and not repeat it with your own children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This ties in with scientism, which basically is today&#39;s creed. Scientific concepts most of us do not understand are taken for granted as the justification for the &quot;end justifies the means&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this &quot;end justifies the means&quot; has roots deeper than scientism. And while I agree that Science is increasingly seen as some infallible religion, when in reality good science always leaves a possibility for it to be tested and proven wrong, I think that this mentality is a societal one. The entire American cultural experiment, from the very beginning, has been based on a pragmatic &quot;what works&quot; attitude. Writers and cultural observers from the US and abroad have pointed this out since the 19th century. I feel that we have allowed this baked in cultural pragmatism to go too far, to eliminate idealism and to create the very cultural relativism we find ourselves in today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post.  The point about the parents and schools is spot on.  This behavior the parents are displaying is a microcosm of the larger philosophy.  It&#39;s a subconscious trust in the model that has been set up, a sort of social contract.  </p>

<p>The parents are giving their energy to something else that society deems necessary and acceptable (usually a job) and do not have time to provide the manners, morals, etc.  Who fills that role?  The state obviously.  Obviously screens are playing that role as well.  Most parents substituting them for actual interaction or supervision from a human.</p>

<p>IMO, individuals realizing they are not but clay to be molded but temples to be built is the solution but those who control our minds have done very well garnering support for our modern form of collectivization and selling the statism as altruism.  </p>

Of course this is tied in with the reductionism/materialism that is necessary to support collectivism.  It also ties in to a general theme of people worshiping form over spirit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say for sure but some would argue the Federal Reserve has given our oligarchs the ability to create boom/bust cycles and crashes that allow them to consolidate real assets.  Over the past 100 years the worth of the dollar has decreased and most of the real assets in this country are owned by a small minority.</p>

<p>This all coincides with two great collectivist victories in the progressive era being a graduated income tax and central bank.  Within years women were allowed to vote, work and more importantly TAXED.  </p>

<p>Oh, and not surprisingly this is when all of the tax free foundations started to pop up like Carnegie, Ford and Rockefeller.  They were in favor of taxing the broad population but obviously thought of themselves as the &quot;creators&quot; of this system so these foundations were necessary in protecting their wealth and also useful veils for their more controversial aspirations.  </p>

<p>i.e. actuaries paid to read through all existing corporate histories and decide, &quot;well, since you owe literally $99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999</p>

<p>since 1812, and since that much money doesnt exist, we&#39;ve gone ahead and sent the military to all your operating facilities. Your oil/telecom company no longer exists in america, and you can peacefully empty your bank account and get a job at McDonalds, or be exiled and have 24 hours to exit the country.</p>

<p>your business will be sold off in pieces to multiple new owners, for pennies on the hundreds of dollars and your consolidation reversed. please tell employees not to resist, we do not wish to cause harm to human life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am saying that if your children are going to have a chance at thriving you must recognize that the only truly important things you can provide are things money can never buy.</p>

<p>Any rodent can figure out how to navigate the maze for cheese. It takes a human to recognize the benefits of abstaining from the scientists offerings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>at what point do the sacrifices you are making in your children’s lives outweigh the benefit of having a stay at home parent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the point where someone cares more for my children&#39;s welfare than I do, or their desired education takes them beyond our experience and knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>being willing to take a hard look at why the economic barrier for some is so high.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a story in the Bible that answers this question quite poignantly, 1 Samuel chapter 8.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>it has more to do with the manipulation of the worth of currencies by central banking mechanisms, the inflation that waters down its worth, and the consolidation of real assets by the oligarchs every time the market crashes.  </p>

<p>The stagnating wages has more to do with our dollar being completely fiat since the 70s.  That is when we unpegged the dollar from gold.  This is when we went from Bretton Woods era to Petrodollar era.  This is the era of Vietnam and the birth of social welfare programs.</p>

<p>While outsourcing jobs and the deindustrialization of rural areas is a large problem I don&#39;t think that adds to the 2 income problems because their problem is just finding one job.  Also...this pushes the children of farmers and villages to the cities who will work for lower wages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just relating my experience here but I <em>was</em> providing for my family of 4 on a single income without a college degree and doing janitorial work at a hospital. It paid well and my work ethic and reputation had me in line for promotion, at least to a supervisor level. I took a lot of pride in this, as it was always my dream to do what people say is impossible these days.</p>

<p>I managed to do it successfully for over 3 years, but it ultimately didn&#39;t matter though because it hinged on my wife being a stay at home mother, which she chose to do but came to later resent her choice and despite us having a plan in place that would enable her to return to school or work as soon as our kids were of day care age, which was within a matter of months. She decided she didn&#39;t want to wait, and saw more value in the public assistance that would become available to her as single mother than she saw in having a supportive partner who she was dependent on. She felt that she could provide enough care and attention to the kids that it wouldn&#39;t matter that dad wasn&#39;t in the house anymore, as she also knows how much I will bend over backwards to continue my relationship with them and ensure they have a roof over their heads, and soon enough this will become the &quot;new normal&quot; for them - talking to, &quot;hugging&quot; and blowing kisses through the phone to daddy because technology has enabled us to soften the blow, in a way. Thanks, Facetime. /s</p>

<p>I feel like there is a social stigma which has convinced people, especially women, that if you are dependent on anyone you are at a disadvantage, or are weak. That if you&#39;re in your thirties and don&#39;t have a degree because you chose to devote yourself to raising your children, then you are setting yourself up for failure because your partner might decide to leave and you&#39;ll be left holding the bill. That the government can and will help you, but only if you dissolve your marriage, because these benefits aren&#39;t available at this level to married couples.</p>

<p>&quot;You can achieve the success you <em>deserve</em>, and we can help you do it sooner and easier. We only ask a small price...your family. What is a family, anyway? What has your family actually <em>done</em> for you?&quot;</p>

<p>With people trusting individuals, including their intimate life partners less and less these days, faceless entities like the government or technological conveniences feel safer, somehow. This is how the family is being destroyed. </p>

<p>There absolutely is a campaign to make women feel as though anything they do outside the home is valuable and anything they do inside it not. </p>

<p>i posted in another comment the interview with Aaron Russo and he talks about how they used feminism as way to destroy the family by denigrating stay st home. one and trying to get them into the working field. so they could be taxed and so the state could take control of the kids at a young age. i’m a father and feel for you . so sorry. that sucks </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have spent the greater part of this year hoping that I might suddenly wake up to my former life, but until I do I can only assume this is real. The only other conclusion would be that I&#39;d gone mad, or that Hell is real and I died some time ago.</p>

<p>I accept that this is real. I also accept that we are utterly alone and the universe is cold and unfeeling. That people are capable of anything and to trust a person in any sense is either foolhardy or a test of faith on your part, since betrayal is always an option.</p>

<p>This is why marriage is so beautiful - it represents the indestructible bond that two humans form when they decide to place faith and genuine trust in each other. That the feelings and meaning that you two have developed for each other have transcended the unknown horrors of reality. That you have come to value and appreciate what this person adds to your life and the daily lives of your children, especially during the early on when they are in critical development years. </p>

<p>From a marketing perspective marriage is easy to attack, especially in the modern era. All you need to do is undercut the value of the partnership and give provide readily available options to dissolve it, then constantly pump out reasons to take it - reasons that prey on the insecurities that reside in all of us. Bombard and brigade with propaganda. Increased insecurity in the self combined with the influence of exposure to daily propaganda will eventually cause the now-weary mind to come to what appears to be an organic conclusion: that what they were being sold is better than the current arrangement, and it will work out to be better for everyone so long as we all work together. If you factor in mind or body chemistry altering exceptions(drugs, certain forms of contraception, etc) in to the mix, I would wager that they tend to amplify these effects. </p>

<p>In fact, I don&#39;t have to wager, as my ex had blamed her IUD for her irrational behavior before and during our separation and after having it removed during the separation she went back to &quot;normal&quot; - I had no idea she had it removed and thought our re-establishment of trust was due to efforts on both our parts to better understand each other, combined with couple&#39;s therapy sessions we had been attending for months. Unfortunately, she also explained that  now aligns with a different sexuality than what was previously established during our relationship, so she still didn&#39;t want to get back together and that divorce would be better for everyone.</p>

<p>I wish I was making this up, but this is what my life has become. It seriously feels like I was expelled from Eden. All I can do now is press on and live for my children, and show them the value of a father as best I can from the outside.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bingo. She was able to get tuition assistance and day care subsidies we didn&#39;t qualify for as a couple almost immediately. With the kids going to day care every day she was also able to get a part time job. I think she was mostly just proud of bringing in her own income because she wasn&#39;t making much more than what I was already giving her every month for personal spending, and it is menial work to boot. Combined with my child support and alimony plus other social services, food and rent are covered. Despite this she and the kids struggle, but she&#39;s fine with that as the kids will &quot;adjust.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really do feel that women are psychologically attacked in so many ways to make them feel inferior and insecure not only to sell products but to sell lifestyles, choices, and world views.  It goes way beyond creating a void in their life to where they want to fill it with material.  </p>

<p>These same women will ultimately determine how men act because most are changing their behavior to be suitable for the female partners they desire.  On the other hand, women have a larger role in influencing the minds and values of children, which means the next generation has a better chance of holding a lot of these half baked ideas on equality to be fact.</p>

It makes everyone that disagrees enemies, rather than just neighbors who have different ideas. We&#39;ll never achieve our individual actions manifesting collectively.

<p>I do.</p>

<p>We overcome that evil and greed with a family unit. With families of families that we build into a society. And when the world got complicated, we needed to turn it into government to make it efficient. The state should be like a gigantic family taking care of itself. But the complications like money corrupt it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The attrition/lack of resources example you give is exclusively a product of agricultural collectivization policies.  Most famously in 30s Soviet Union and post war China.  That&#39;s part of the horror of &quot;redistribution&quot;.  It&#39;s still a tiny, elite clique that is using force and coercion to control all resources, labor, production, etc.</p>

<p>The United States is not perfect, and there are major problems with our current crony casino economy.  But that is only because we are so passive and continue to let these sharks run our lives.   </p>

<p>In theory, capitalism allows us to use the product of our faculties as collateral so that we can turn our savings into capital and invest.  There&#39;s no force or coercion there....you can&#39;t say the same for any form of collectivization.  I would add that where you do see force and coercion today, those are probably examples of collectivist/socialist policies within our system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In an ironic way, transgenders and homosexuals are the solution to themselves. If gay and trans are genetic and neither group is reproducing, there would be less gay and trans people.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there&#39;s anything wrong with either but I don&#39;t understand why anyone would care enough to stop them. The issue ends at the individual, very literally. Of course some gays and post op have kids before that but that&#39;s beside the point. It&#39;s probably less than half that do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wow, a very good point.  Makes you wonder if because so many people would not &quot;come out&quot; for so long the genes were obviously passed down.  But now that is acceptable to &quot;come out&quot; these genes will stop being passed down because gay people are no longer engaging in marriages and having kids that are for lack of a better word &quot;a lie&quot;....very interesting.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That is exactly what I am saying. Until the 1980s, a family could live a comfortable middle class existence with a single breadwinner. Now, all adults must work to prevent the family from drowning in debt. Divorce and teen pregnancy were rarities prior to the 1980&#39;s, now they&#39;ve been normalized, if not glamorized. </p>

In my experience the dialogue exchange almost always will indicate the characters are stepsiblings, but the method of delivery(clip descriptions, tags used, etc) almost always suggests straight up incest. As an avid porn viewer it is hard to imagine the market for incest is really that high. I would rather believe that it is part of an organized effort to manipulate thoughts and impulses, but it could just as easily be good ol&#39; capitalism hard at work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see your point.  We&#39;re not going to un-invent nuclear weapons and diseases that could kill the world&#39;s population.  My point is that government is our creation, not nature&#39;s.  Our last Garden of Eden experience might have really been as hunter gatherers.</p>

<p>Since the advent of government up until 1776, history was an assortments of theocracies, monarchies, etc.  This is ultimately the only period in history where a government or state did not derive its power from God.  Our government said individual faculties were granted by God and that the product of those faculties were that person&#39;s property. </p>

<p>So the truth that it holds is our government was designed with the idea that government is not part of nature.  I&#39;m not in favor of some unrealistic withdrawal government.  I&#39;m simply stating that individuals can reduce the power they grant to collectives, which are assuming the same powers theocracies and monarchies had.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I disagree with some of your viewpoints, I agree that the people could and should take the power back. Our government should rely on the will of the people, but the people generally are willfully ignorant to what&#39;s going on. They try to divide is by having half of us call the others communists or fascists. </p>

<p>While the family structure is falling apart, it&#39;s be design to keep us down and not focus on the people causing it. Sure, pundits can say it&#39;s because gay people can get married now, but is that really the cause? My fiance is a feminist, but wants to be a stay at home mom once the time comes, because that&#39;s her choice ( I don&#39;t disagree with it either. ) </p>

<p>There is blame being spread around to divide us. We need to take back our government. I don&#39;t mean from Trump, but from the people who view themselves as our rulers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love when conservatives trot out this schtick about the supposed degradation of the family unit and it is always under the guise of underlying homophobia and a yearning for a white supremacist racist past of the early to mid 1900s where minorities and women were subjugated and treated as less than. In actuality society is progressing for long oppressed minority groups and at the same time the US education system is crumbling because of corrupt politicians and because marriage as an institution that was once deemed necessary is dying—and rightly so. Conservatives always tie the family to Christianity and blame outside forces like gays gaining equality and so-called progressive values aka equality as the forces that have kill the family unit. And what&#39;s actual happening is we are progressing as a species and realize that marriage tied to a jungle of government legality is a thorny mess and what constitutes a <em>family</em> is evolving.</p>

<p>The bigger picture is I think that we as a society in the US are becoming less communal and are conversing less and less face to face and that that  is having a detrimental effect that is being felt throughout every facet of society. On one hand tribalism is dying and people of every color and ideology are being forced to live amongst one another on a grander scale than ever before but capitalism and technology has alienated a large portion of that society.</p>
