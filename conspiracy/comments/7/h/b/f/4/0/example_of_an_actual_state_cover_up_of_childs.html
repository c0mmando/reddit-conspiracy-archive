        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Think big establishment cover ups are just fanciful?? here’s a proven example....</p>

<p>Robbie Powell aged 10 died a needless death in 1990 from Addisons disease. Doctors missed numerous occasions to spot the problem and help... But that’s not the point of this story. For what followed was 26 years of a major establishment cover up involving multiply agencies including Police authorities, Crown Prosecution Services, British Medicla Council, NHS and more. It involves forgery and lies going up the chain of the establishment. </p>

<p>The father was painted out to be “obsessed whack job” and a “conspiracist” by those in authority, but he was only fighting for the truth. He’s still fighting for the truth, just as hard today as he ever did.</p>

<p>This is a story from the area I grew up, Robbie’s death was so sad, but the cover up is simply an outrage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are so many wrongs in this  story but for me the worst is how the dad was portrayed as “obsessive”, one judge even described him as such! Trying to imply only a nut-job would believe his yarns.....although the dad is now well respected the family are now out of options unless there’s a major change of stance by Government. </p>

<p>I think this story is Netflix worthy with all the twists and turns.</p>
