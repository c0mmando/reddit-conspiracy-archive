<ul>
<li><p>Seth Rich is no longer discussed. It all died down when the Donna Brazile news cycle washed over. She got her book sales, and it was done.</p></li>
<li><p>Sean Hannity stopped talking about Seth Rich. His advertisers were threatened and he backed off. Cowardly stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Tony Podesta stepped down, but nothing since then. No retroactive FARA registrations (he was legit about that) and he still walks free. Meanwhile, Manafort put 10s of millions of dollars just to celebrate Christmas. Flynn can go to jail for up to 9 months in his own guilty plea.</p></li>
<li><p>Müller seems to be doing a thorough and methodical job with no leaks. Why then do we trust people who we think are leaking? Trump&#39;s own counsel seemingly didn&#39;t know Flynn was pleading guilty. Also, he was stuck with Müller ALL of THURSDAY before the plea deal -- he still had no idea.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>How can be we more skeptical of things we see online? We don&#39;t trust the official 9/11 story, we&#39;re skeptical about the shootings in Vegas, why not the stuff that comes out of TD or 4chan?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, you were. You were insisting that we stop talking about Q. It&#39;s in your title. Replies that differ from your opinions aren&#39;t &quot;taking it personally&quot;.

<p>I wouldn&#39;t have minded your counter points to Q because it starts a discussion, but you clearly state that we should <em>stop</em> with the Q theories, which stifles any real discussions that may have happened. You have your opinions and points, Q followers have theirs. Yours isn&#39;t more important than the other and vice versa.</p>

<p>it&#39;s not OK because it shows a deep lack of critical thinking skills from a huge number of people.</p>

<p>and some people, like me and OP, think that is a huge problem for our society. and maybe talking about it on reddit doesn&#39;t help, but maybe we can convicne a few people to re-evaluate how they think about things, and consider WHY they fell for a hugely obvious LARP/troll (confirmation bias, largely, and willful denial of the red flags and failed predictions)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And many people outside of this conspiracy board think <em>all</em> of us here lack critical thinking skills and think we are a problem to society...a large percentage of people think this.</p>

<p>Discussions on why you think Q is a LARP is great...but I don&#39;t think people should stop digging if they don&#39;t want to. You never know what truth you may actually find on a journey you took a bad turn at. It&#39;s all an open book, or a blank page if you will. None of us here really know much of what&#39;s going on behind the curtain.</p>

<p>But then again I&#39;m not a flat earther, but I support flat earthers discussions because that is the journey they decide to go on. Maybe in all the rubble they&#39;ll discover something about themselves that helps them on a journey to truth or self discovery. Maybe I&#39;m just a softy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>look, i understand where the mods are coming from. but my honest opinion is that this place in all its goodness has been hijacked in terrible ways. in ways that aren&#39;t good for any sort of constructive and critical thought but rather as an amplifier of real propaganda that is manufactured out there.</p>

<p>there are clear and obvious waves of disnfo and <em>whataboutism</em> every time a major story breaks in the müller investigation. notice how his investigation is of a single-minded focus and progressing steadily towards something. </p>

<p>however, the other conspiracies are all over the place. first it was seth rich. before that, susan rice and unmasking, remember? now it&#39;s all about al franken and sexual predilections. the latest? the bit about the FBI person who was removed from the investigation for spreading partisan stuff on texts and having an affair.</p>

<p>people come here in waves and just latch on to stuff to try to get people to focus on anything .. anything .. except a huge conspiracy unfolding under our very eyes, which is the trump-russia collusion. </p>

<p>i wonder how this place would&#39;ve been around watergate. would people have constantly doubted the senate committees because they were &quot;the establishment&quot;? would they have sided with nixon getting away with using the office of the POTUS to blackmail, tamper juries, and literally break into opponents offices and bug the shit out of them? </p>

<p>it&#39;s kinda horrifying sometimes when you think of the stuff being enabled -- either tacitly or otherwise -- by some of the mods here.</p>

<p>it probably doesn&#39;t OP that a ton of people believe in a stupid troll from 4chan, you&#39;re right. BUT, it <em>might</em> affect him. it might affect all of us, if the world is turning into a place where a sizable number of people believe in stupid trolls from 4chan.</p>

<p>have you considered the possibility that he legit cares about impartiality, and an agent publicly talking about his hatred for trump delegitimizes his investigation and he has no tolerance for that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>well, if you&#39;re talking about the ridiculous theory that he is some secret democrat plant that was involved in some criminal enterprise with clinton and obama, yeah i&#39;ve read about that. and i found it ridiculous.</p>

<p>what i DO know about mueller is that he was a war hero, a distinguished student, a successful lawyer, and has been called one of the most non-partisan actors in washington. also a life-long republican.</p>

<p>so who is making a fool out of themselves, again?</p>
