       Why do we still trust anything that comes on 4chan anymore? Nothing they've said has been true.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Seth Rich is no longer discussed. It all died down when the Donna Brazile news cycle washed over. She got her book sales, and it was done.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Sean Hannity stopped talking about Seth Rich. His advertisers were threatened and he backed off. Cowardly stuff.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Tony Podesta stepped down, but nothing since then. No retroactive FARA registrations (he was legit about that) and he still walks free. Meanwhile, Manafort put 10s of millions of dollars just to celebrate Christmas. Flynn can go to jail for up to 9 months in his own guilty plea.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Müller seems to be doing a thorough and methodical job with no leaks. Why then do we trust people who we think are leaking? Trump's own counsel seemingly didn't know Flynn was pleading guilty. Also, he was stuck with Müller ALL of THURSDAY before the plea deal -- he still had no idea.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       How can be we more skeptical of things we see online? We don't trust the official 9/11 story, we're skeptical about the shootings in Vegas, why not the stuff that comes out of TD or 4chan?

       smart people hop accounts so that they don't leave a trail. going by account age might be useful in a perfect world of anonymity, but some of us are smarter than keeping around 5 years of activity all neatly tied in a package. do you trust reddit mastigia, to keep you safe? you moderate this subreddit, have you seen it change in the way it reacted to trump's election? do you see the waves of
       <em>
        whataboutism
       </em>
       whenever big news breaks? do you think nothing coordinated is going on here?

       Yeah, you were. You were insisting that we stop talking about Q. It's in your title. Replies that differ from your opinions aren't "taking it personally". I just like people to discuss whatever they want to and you are suggesting that we stop discussion on this topic completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't have minded your counter points to Q because it starts a discussion, but you clearly state that we should
       <em>
        stop
       </em>
       with the Q theories, which stifles any real discussions that may have happened. You have your opinions and points, Q followers have theirs. Yours isn't more important than the other and vice versa.

       i thought conspiracy would not trust anyone and wait for some accumulation of trust or at least knowledge from sources before entertaining them further. i see Q anon receive way more trust than he is entitled too, which is what i wanted to discuss.

       Have a post that doesn't say "Stop looking into XXX". If you don't agree with something, you don't need to tell others to stop talking about it. You can present your opinions without doing so, and the body of your post would have done exactly that if it wasn't for the title.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have blind faith on any of the subjects here, a true truth seeker wouldn't. But I love the open discussions about them because reading things you may not agree with can still expand your mind. That's not something I want to stifle.

       and some people, like me and OP, think that is a huge problem for our society. and maybe talking about it on reddit doesn't help, but maybe we can convicne a few people to re-evaluate how they think about things, and consider WHY they fell for a hugely obvious LARP/troll (confirmation bias, largely, and willful denial of the red flags and failed predictions)

       And many people outside of this conspiracy board think
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       of us here lack critical thinking skills and think we are a problem to society...a large percentage of people think this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Discussions on why you think Q is a LARP is great...but I don't think people should stop digging if they don't want to. You never know what truth you may actually find on a journey you took a bad turn at. It's all an open book, or a blank page if you will. None of us here really know much of what's going on behind the curtain.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then again I'm not a flat earther, but I support flat earthers discussions because that is the journey they decide to go on. Maybe in all the rubble they'll discover something about themselves that helps them on a journey to truth or self discovery. Maybe I'm just a softy.

       look, i understand where the mods are coming from. but my honest opinion is that this place in all its goodness has been hijacked in terrible ways. in ways that aren't good for any sort of constructive and critical thought but rather as an amplifier of real propaganda that is manufactured out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       there are clear and obvious waves of disnfo and
       <em>
        whataboutism
       </em>
       every time a major story breaks in the müller investigation. notice how his investigation is of a single-minded focus and progressing steadily towards something.
      </p>
      <p>
       however, the other conspiracies are all over the place. first it was seth rich. before that, susan rice and unmasking, remember? now it's all about al franken and sexual predilections. the latest? the bit about the FBI person who was removed from the investigation for spreading partisan stuff on texts and having an affair.
      </p>
      <p>
       people come here in waves and just latch on to stuff to try to get people to focus on anything .. anything .. except a huge conspiracy unfolding under our very eyes, which is the trump-russia collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       i wonder how this place would've been around watergate. would people have constantly doubted the senate committees because they were "the establishment"? would they have sided with nixon getting away with using the office of the POTUS to blackmail, tamper juries, and literally break into opponents offices and bug the shit out of them?

       There's still an outside chance of it being true, although very unlikely. Mueller's recent firing of an anti Trump FBI agent had me thinking of the Q story. I don't really know why Mueller would care...as nearly all his top lawyers are big democrats and likely very anti Trump.

       Flynn was just a low-level campaign volunteer, and Kushner is just some guy who perhaps went on a few dates with Trump's daughter.

       Nah. Much has happened. And besides it’s not a prediction thread. Many interesting questions were posed to say the least. We got to use our powers of discernment and watch for all intel coming out as we can plainly see the war of intel agencies before us. We are in the Information Age. We have to take part in getting to the truth.

       I'd say there isn't much harm in entertaining an idea and seeing if it pans out. If the predictions don't come true, we move on with our lives no better or worse off for having entertained the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't paid it much mind, and I don't see much purpose in arguing with others over the subject, but I don't see a clear reason people should stop reading. If nothing else it's entertainment.
