        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There&#39;s &quot;The Beam&quot; and then there&#39;s my primary reality. </p>

<p>The Beam is the constant stream of information and entertainment coming from TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, social media, and other internet sources. The Beam influences our minds to create an imaginary world that seems dark, foreboding, apocalyptic, and dangerous. Of course, a percentage of entertainment doesn&#39;t do this, but most of it does. Combine this kind of entertainment that depicts the world in this way with news, and one can see how one can believe the world is just plain awful.</p>

<p>Primary reality is where I m right now. The sounds, sights, smells, sensations, and tastes. The lines, shapes, colors, and seeming permanence of things in the visual field.  The temporary sounds coming and going in different volumes and pitches. The sound of my spouse&#39;s voice from the bedroom. Not a shred of violence, theft, or oppression happening in this room. I look out at my neighborhood, and it seems peaceful. We haven&#39;t had a violent crime here in the decade in which I&#39;ve lived here. There are no dogs trying to attack me in my kitchen. My Ipad is open to Procreate and I have a drawing going. My coffee smells delicious. This is my primary reality. It&#39;s what my life actually <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>In this primary reality, I have the ability to create reality through conception of vision in the imagination and then acting upon it. This might be a drawing, a pot of coffee, hugging my spouse, dancing in the kitchen, writing a story, making a great meal, and into infinity. I can either live a reactive life to other people&#39;s creations (words and other actions) in this primary reality, or I can accept it and love it and create with it.</p>

<p>I can forget about primary reality and get lost in The Beam. Perhaps, get confused by all the conflicting information and as to what is fake or real, increasing and reinforcing the sleep-like condition of living in a reactive orientation, as opposed to a creative one. I can get lost in the darkness presented to me, and start to get anxious about what is to come. Feel paranoid that an elite is conspiring against me looking to keep me confined and in a cage. </p>

<p>If there are certain powerful groups that want me to be asleep and not awake and not creative, then The Beam is the cage they would want me to lock myself into forever. Into the unreality of it. After all, is not most of The Beam a selection or a recording of the past? In any given day, there are billions, if not trillions, of events happening en masse in people&#39;s primary and shared realities. The worst of it all is selected and presented. It&#39;s easy to believe everyone is corrupt, evil, and out to get what I have. The Beam is a form of hypnosis. It keeps me asleep and unaware of my primary reality and the vast creative energy and love available to me here and now.</p>

<p>I noticed that when I&#39;m immersed in creative action, not only does the beam not exist, but all the little nagging insanities that might be looping in my brain also disappear. Time sometimes slows to a crawl, or speeds up like a high-speed train in one of those other countries that aren&#39;t the USA.</p>

<p>This moment is unlimited. All that is probable and possible for me starts right here, right now. Which me? Which world? A life of Beam immersion, or a life of creative action?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Inner world &gt; Outer world.</p>

<p>The outer world will shift to match your inner state.</p>

<p>This is all the information we need. Your mind is the navigation device, the radio antenna/ fishing rod that picks up frequencies and realities by way of thought and imagery. Our hearts&#39; electromagnetic fields (feelings) are what accept these new signals and make them so. Our guts and bodies are what records it into our cells as to what reality we will vibrationally match with, which is why it&#39;s hard to break habits, it&#39;s what our very CELLS remember doing the most. </p>

<p>So yes, it all starts in the mind, which is why meditation and insightful thinking as you just did is so helpful. Let your heart (feelings) guide what your mind thinks/projects/assumes to be true. Go out of your way to find gratitude and compassion. Watch these new feelings be recorded into every cell of your body, and subsequently into the cells (humans) of the planetary body (earth). And see how it transforms</p>

<p>&quot;The mind makes a wonderful servant, but a terrible master&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks for reminding me bro, so easy to get caught up in fear. Just choose/focus on what you love</p>

<p>Cool story, and it could all very well be true. It could also just be geopolitical theater for a new generation that lives online. As long as the water&#39;s still fluoridated, the skies are still sprayed, the food&#39;s still poisoned, and we keep getting pilfered by banks and corporations, it doesn&#39;t change anything about our day-to-day lives. LARP or not, it&#39;s a distraction from your own self-improvement. Focus on bettering your life for you and your loved ones.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I recommend anyone to read Robert Anton Wilton&#39;s Prometheus Rising. It talks about how society imprints or effects certain parts of our brains and creates &quot;reality tunnels&quot;. The current reality tunnel is that of the industrious age, but as information increases rapidly, and humans wake up, we&#39;ll get past that and create something for ourselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the same way I win any competition like for example playing video games, usually fighting games like Street Fighter or Tekken. It&#39;s also called Imposing Your Will and often referenced in the UFC.</p>

<p>I just decide &quot;this match is mine, I&#39;m not losing, I am the winner&quot; and if I happen to lose I know it was because of a flaw in my technique. If I win I know I earned it by putting in not only my hands but my mind as well. Other players/competition can just feel the force of your iron will, but sometimes the other player&#39;s will is stronger or I focus too much on repeating that I&#39;m the winner so I end up not focusing on the actual match.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the feeling of &quot;Okay - that&#39;s it! I&#39;m ending this&quot;. It doesn&#39;t EVEN matter if it&#39;s all bullshit, in the end all that matters is that you feel it works or improves your play.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post OP. To piggy-back off your thoughts, I had responded to a user a few months ago that claimed they thought they were going insane because of the shape the world APPEARS to be in.</p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth... I&#39;ve been fairly deep down the rabbit hole myself, trying to make sense of the world we live in. I spent a good amount of time searching for the &quot;meaning of life&quot;. The meaning of life, is the meaning YOU attach to it. Good or bad. Life is like a blank book and you&#39;re the author. Write whatever the fuck you want... After a few chapters it definitely makes it harder to change the plot, but know, the next page is blank, always. 
  With all that being said, I believe that is why the media is a non stop onslaught of bullshit. They know the page is blank, but would prefer if you kept repeating/rereading the story they had wrote for you. A world full of horrible people that are most definitely out to get you! The more attention you spend on any given subject, the more real it becomes. So while it&#39;s good to know what is going on in the world, the trick (as far as I can tell) is to put more energy into a solution than the problem itself. A metaphor I can think of is you see people standing outside Planned Parenthood all the time with nasty pictures of dead babies and shaming everybody that walks in and out. All they are doing is adding fuel to the fire they hate so much. But imagine if all these people that are outside pointing their fingers were to instead stand outside, and offer to adopt any baby that was about to be aborted? They would help solve the problem they hate so much. But, it is much easier to stand outside and point the finger than it is to step up and be a part of a proactive solution by offering to adopt these babies. While I&#39;m sure there on 100&#39;s of metaphors you can come up with (better than this one), it was just the first that came to mind that I could articulate in a way that would remotely make sense.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to get caught up in the &quot;Beam&quot; and begin to question what is real. It&#39;s a breath of fresh air to see other&#39;s view the world in a similar fashion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey man, great post. I feel a pull to get lost in the &quot;Beam&quot; when I disconnect. Sometimes I put my phone down, only to pick it up again, refreshing the same page despite not truly being interested. All while feeling a slight tinge of hesitant relief (if that makes sense?), masked by numbness. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m not aware of this effect either, as I always feel I should be doing something else. It&#39;s as if I&#39;m physically forced to plug in. </p>

<p>That being said, if I disconnect for long enough, and embrace the Here and Now, everything is perfect. Not good or just, but perfect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This so accurate. I recommend people watch the movie &quot; Perfect Blue&quot; It was made in the 90s but is SO much more relevant now with the wide adoption of the internet. Basically, it is about how everyone live in their own reality and what that means regarding the real reality. The internet makes it very easy to do nothing with your day and nothing to change the reality you are trying to escape from or portray by going online.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Important to stay grounded.</p>

<p>Switch off the MSM news! Once you do, after about a week (or could be more) you can try watching a couple minutes (no more!) of MSM news and you will realize how absolutely rediculous it is.</p>

<p>I basically haven&#39;t watched CNN, BBC News etc for more than a year now (more like 2 I think) and whenever someone else puts on CNN it comes accross almost farcical, like a huge joke or satire.  Also it is all the same news they show (some natural disaster somewhere, some shooting, some idiot politicians and &#39;analysts&#39; yabbing about something), none of it impacts my <em>reality</em> at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Primary reality (which is not a closed system, it&#39;s connected to a shared reality) is where all work with others is done, where all buildings, roads, and other things are conceived and then built, and the only time and place I can relate to the world. An Ipad can exist in one&#39;s primary reality for creative purposes or Beam purposes. My interaction on Reddit is not Beam, but creative action. I&#39;ve been using Macs and Ipads for a few decades to build a body of work in several mediums. I&#39;ve also been lost in The Beam for weeks on end, only to return to what my life truly is, and then to get busy at being consciously creative again. That&#39;s what the OP is about for me. Basically, that the here and now is the only place where reality happens, the only place where there is anything real, the only place action can happen, the only place I can make my life better. The Beam is almost always about the past, and when I&#39;m lost in it, I&#39;m not creating, and often a dark picture of the world begins to form in my mind, which is not reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So when a nuke goes off in the past it will catch up with you very quickly while you have your head buried in the sand. That&#39;ll cause a shift in your reality.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so interesting to read when some read the post, then try to peg what I am in my life. I&#39;ve been called upper middle class, privileged, and now an ostrich and a recovering addict. I&#39;d prefer it if people discussed the idea of The Beam, and the picture of a dark, foreboding world it presents, vs. actual reality or the primary reality one experiences, but I guess this comes with the territory.</p>

<p>The Beam surely is information, and as for the news portion of it, 90% of it is murder, corruption, violation, stealing, cons, etc. from <em>all over the world.</em> As for fictional shows, 90% of it is murder, corruption, violation, stealing, cons, etc. All of it paints a picture that the world is hell.</p>

<p>If a hurricane is coming into my primary reality, then that is something I&#39;m going to experience soon. That information is useful and empowers. But the vast majority of The Beam, if I focus on it too much, starts to create a dark picture of the world in my mind, and if I believe the picture in my mind is real, then it&#39;s probable I&#39;ll live in a fearful, reactive orientation. Like if I read hundreds of stories about pit bull attacks, and even though there are no pit bulls outside, I&#39;m afraid to go outside because one might get loose somewhere. In reality, the odds are very, very slim that I&#39;ll be the victim of a dog attack or a murderer.</p>

<p>As for the conspiracy part of this, the effects on the minds of people may be unintentional, and the Beam just a result of ratings and economics, but sometimes it seems that keeping the public in a state of fear is intentional on someone&#39;s part. Remember threat level Orange? Just a small part of The Beam, but what was I or anyone really supposed to do with that information, except feel fear?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, you sound stressed. </p>

<p>You bring up a great point though. People saying how horrible this beam is and yet they are clearly locked into the same system that the beam emits from. </p>

<p>My take is that the world is &quot;fear based&quot; and &quot;they&quot; want you to live in fear. If people aren&#39;t afraid enough they turn up the fear. If they are not afraid at all they are worried about losing their money or health or status or even just their looks. 
Once you realize that the world system wants you to live in fear you can become truly free. 
Unfortunately that wont solve your debt or your rent or any other problem but if you can fix your SELF and live as a free and good person things might fix themselves. </p>

<p>I feel really bad for young people trying to start out, pay rent, keep a car running, etc etc. it isn&#39;t easy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s okay and youre totally right, our state of mind is the most important thing in our life, it literally defines everything. Having all the riches in the world means nothing without the ability to enjoy it. And it&#39;s not like I have been a wonderful human, I&#39;m flawed and living with my consequences. Meditation helps greatly and mindfulness can pull you out of some really dark pits. </p>

<p>But still, you are on point about living in the system that supposedly you don&#39;t like. I see people live in huge McMansions driving 50k cars and going to clubs every weekend, then come and post about how consumerism and the man are kee humanity down, while utterly failing to see the irony. The truth is, people won&#39;t make changes until they are forced too, which sadly why things won get better until they get worse. Nobo will care about the coming oil crises and food shortage that will follo until teh can&#39;t fill up their car and have to stand in line for 2 hours for a single loaf of bread, all while the rich play golf and pretend to be on our side (cough cough our president). Only then will this nation push back and make real change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe there ever will be real change. Change can never happen because they hold all the cards and always have. </p>

<p>IF something does change and it looks like it is organic and real it would still be bullshit forever. The real controllers of this mess are in total control at all times and will always be in control. That is just the way it is, always has been and always will be. </p>

<p>True change, REAL change, happens to individuals who choose to wake up and divorce themselves from the system; to find themselves though the fog and shit of the lies that the PTB have woven for so many centuries. Then maybe you can experience God, experience YOURSELF and put aside the drugs and manipulation of this fucked up society. </p>

<p>Perhaps there will be a crash, an oil crisis, a war, but no matter what happens it is always what they want. To think this can ever change or be avoided is to deny that they ever had power in the first place. </p>

<p>They do what they want and we are expendable. Plain and simple. </p>

<p>But we are not worthless, not just because they say so. We all need to realize our self worth which is exponentially more than we could ever know or accept.  </p>

The only thing that got me out of it was getting off the Beam, and sitting down and writing a book in all my free time. As days went by, I had longer and longer periods in which the adrenaline wasn&#39;t pumping, until about 8 weeks later, it shut off completely. As if I created new neural pathways, while the unreasonable flight-fight loop atrophied. The thoughts that fueled the loop and constant adrenal pumping also disappeared. An amazing learning experience for me. The book wasn&#39;t very good, but that doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be sure to pass this message on to the thousands of children that are currently being sold into slavery and prostitution..... but that doesn&#39;t exist in your reality because you CHOOSE to ignore it.</p>

<p>I am in Thailand right now and it is even easier to live like an absolute king and ignore the poverty right next door. I could live here for a year or two without even having to think about working.</p>

<p>The point is that you are blessed and have the blessed opportunity to ignore suffering and &quot;create&quot; with the smell of your &quot;coffee&quot; and crime free &quot;neighborhood&quot; And you CHOOSING to ignore one reality so you do not have to think about the other reality. </p>

<p>They are both REAL reality&#39;s. How about you just realize that you can be in the know and the search for truth and the spread of truth without having to become depressed and say that what you are depressed about is not real.</p>

<p>The search for Truth and the spreading of these ugly reality&#39;s you want to now call false so you don&#39;t have to think about it anymore is actually helping people that are suffering, a little bit at a time.</p>

<p>In my primary reality, call it local reality if you will,  I&#39;ve taken care of suffering, dying people.

I can&#39;t solve all the worlds problems that are constantly streamed to as news, articles, videos, etc. I can affect change in my primary reality though. </p>

<p>What I&#39;ve created through hard work I feel entitled to, nothing else. None of what I have, which isn&#39;t much, hasn&#39;t been handed to me. What has been handed to me is the infrastructure of the country--the constitution, laws, roads, bridges, buildings, etc. All which came from the hard work of others and I&#39;m extremely grateful for the ideas and energy the people before me put into creating it all.</p>

<p>There are about 75 million owned detached homes in the U.S., mostly in neighborhoods that don&#39;t experience a lot of crime. My home, which cost 170,000.00 (with a mortgage of around 900.00 a month) and would sell for about the same amount if the market doesn&#39;t experience another crash, and is 1300 square feet, exists in a neighborhood of small homes between 1000-1500 sq. feet for about the same price range. Not much happens in terms of violence. There have been break-ins to unlocked cars and houses over the years, but it&#39;s rare. My Ipad was bought refurbished for cheap. I buy a new laptop every 8-10 years. I have a 2004 Corolla, my spouse has a 1998 Honda. My other main possession on which I spend a lot of time is an acoustic guitar I bought for $190.00 in the 1980&#39;s. If this makes me Bill Gates or Warren Buffet to someone then there is nothing I can do about that perception.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you understand what I&#39;m talking about in the OP. Imagine being in a room by one&#39;s self, watching a console that continually streams bad news about murders, rapes, wars, corruption, and other awful things from <em>all over the world</em>. And the voices are saying &quot;this is what the world is&quot; and implying one should be afraid. One then forms a belief system and imaginary version of the world in one&#39;s mind that is dark, foreboding, and ominous. One starts to live as if this is what the world is, thinking about it all the time. Feeling powerless to do anything about it, because there is <em>too much</em> of it. </p>

<p>The one day, one wakes up and realizes that one is living in an unreality in one&#39;s brain, and that what is real is the actual experience one is having, and that one is connected to it, and one can act creatively and change the experience. The first creative act might be turning off the bad news beam, and cleaning the house and yard. Perhaps, visiting one&#39;s ailing friend or parent and helping them out. Or beginning the novel one always wanted to write, or hugging one&#39;s spouse and enjoying a moment. There are milllion experiences one can create. It begins with an idea, then one acts to make the experience real. Some experiences take a lot of work to create (like working hard may years to save a down payment for a 170,000 home). A cup of coffee doesn&#39;t take much time. A hug is instant. </p>

<p>The events on the Beam news stream are just a small selection of what happens in the primary realities of the 8+ billion people all over the world. Trillions of things happen in a day. The overwhelming majority of it is peaceful, good, and people just creating their normal lives.</p>

<p>I speak about of choice between powerlessness in relation to the beam as opposed to power in one&#39;s primary reality. The power to create and make a difference in the lives of people who are local to me. Friends, family, neighbors, my town. Creative action for me has involved teaching, taking care of sick and dying people and alleviating suffering in people that exist locally, and helping others. As well as working in artistic mediums from which I make my money and truly enjoy. Mediums that don&#39;t cost a lot.</p>

<p>Or I can sit in the room and believe the world is a horrible place like the Beam wants me to believe.</p>

<p>Understand? </p>

I can only act with love and compassion and act creatively <em>locally</em> in primary reality. I can&#39;t be in 8 billion other realities. The Beam wants me to feel powerless, as it offers up it&#39;s selection of the bad in the world. How can I solve sex trafficking in Thailand? India? Warlords dominating in Africa? Kim Jong Un.  All of the thousands of things that the beam keeps feeding me. I can&#39;t.  </p>

<p>But I can awake and see that I&#39;m not separate from my experience, and then act with creativity, compassion, and love with my family, friends, neighbors, and people in my city the best I can.

It contains corruption, cons, murders, wars, tyrannies, rapes, thefts, attacks, and things we should fear for the most part. A small part of it is about innovations, creativity, sports, and good things peopl ehave done. A very small %. What good does it do me or anyone that I stay focused on different expressions of violence and corruption brought to me 24 hours a day on MSM or other places? To focus on the fighting going on in social media between people?</p>

<p>Or is it better to get involved in developing my potential, creating, and giving love and compassion to the people in my primary reality? Seeing my primary reality in all its glorious, alive and very real detail? Feeling connected to it. Not isolated.

    <div class="md"><p>Your attention and focus is more valuable than the money in your wallet or the possessions immediate to your person. Both to you, and to &quot;them&quot;. If you allow your attention to be subverted toward repetitive, short-term satisfaction, self-destructive, amoral, meaningless action at the material benefit of those subverting it, then you permit your body to be used as a pawn and you establish walls around your mind that trap you in that mode of being.<br/>
Mindfulness is the key to keeping your attention where it best serves. To be mindful of the attempts on your mind allow you to not get lost in the white noise of it all. To be mindful of your own needs and wants allows you to utilise that which does make its way into your sphere of being and extract the aspects of it that benefit you in the long run without being pulled into the turbulent air of meaninglessness that comes with it. To be mindful of your past and see it in retrospect allows you to see the mistakes you&#39;ve made and learn to recognise the patterns and circumstances that lead to those mistakes, so you may use that to avoid those mistakes in the future.<br/>
To work out where best your attention should be focused, first you must remove yourself entirely from the light of the Beam. Be on your own, be with no distractions. Meditate. Forget everything superficial for the time and mediate on your human requirements, both physically and emotionally. Look at your position in life, what that naturally brings to you and what it doesn&#39;t. Learn to live sustainably on what you have, give generously with that which you don&#39;t need, learn to dissect that which comes to you to extract the most fulfilling and useful aspects of it.<br/>
Essentially you gotta wipe your mental slate clean so you can see clearly your path. You will never see clearly if you approach it with attachments. Temporarily let go of your attachments, see truth unadulterated, and then you can go back to the life you live but this time if you apply what you learned then you can live that life in a far more fulfilling way than you ever previously have. </p>

<p>Which is being more awake:</p>

<p>1) Watching the stream of bad news, maybe offering opinions and complaints about it online, thinking about it all the time, perhaps getting depressed about it, believing the world is a horrible place. </p>

<p>or</p>

<p>2) Noticing what the things in one&#39;s primary reality actually look like, sound like, etc. as they are. Noticing what actually exists in my real experience. Noticing that my neighbor needs help with something and offering my time. Creating art for others to enjoy. For 25 years, teaching kids how to be creative. Acting compassionately when one sees suffering in one&#39;s primary reality. Giving affection to people. Working to maintain the things I worked so very hard for, which isn&#39;t much. Seeing that I&#39;m not separate from my experience and that my actions change my experience, as it will the experience of others. Knowing that real life and the real me is not thought structure running around my brain. Knowing that out of the trillion events that happen every day in the lives of people, most of it is good, violence and crime free, and not dark. Not living in fear, but in creativity.</p>

<p>Which is more awake?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plato&#39;s cave is an imaginary world. That can be fun, but I&#39;m talking about being connected to one&#39;s experience in an alive manner. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a difference between the constant stream of bad events in the world and getting a news flash on my phone that a hurricane is coming. Warnings about something coming helps me to create a prepared situation in my primary reality (batten down the hatches and drive to a motel somewhere out of harm&#39;s way).</p>

<p>I&#39;mm extremely grateful to the people who have come before me that created the Constitution, roads, bridges, buildings, etc. All that was created by people acting creatively in their primary realities. The ones with the ideas that then acted were awake. They knew they could change their experiences and those of others with action.
Living creatively means acting in a way that adds to reality, adds to the wealth of the community (wealth is always money). I do my best in this regard. I&#39;m not an engineer, but an artist and a teacher.</p>

<p>Why is choosing to focus on real life rather than a stream of images and stories being fed to me ignorant bliss? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s wisdom in you words old man. The asteroid was a thought experiment to do with any disaster you&#39;re not aware might sneak up on you. To answer your question though, yes there is always an apocalypse coming. We&#39;ve had 6 extinction level event asteroids in the last 200k years. About every 100 years there&#39;s a Kerington event. Satellites circle the globe in an attempt to give us a few minutes heads up to shut down the power grids so they aren&#39;t fried killing millions.</p>

<p>Just be thankful not everyone is as blissfully ignorant is you, that&#39;s my wisdom to impart. Someone had to look into the beam long enough to put all that together and learn to build satellites and put them into orbit.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I might be old, but I can still run a 1:50 half marathon. I understood your words. And of course natural events of which I have no control will happen, including the sun going super nova someday. I&#39;m all for the part of the Beam that warns people that a hurricane, tornado, or nuclear missile is on the way. But that&#39;s primary reality. I get alerts from the weather people, and keep track of the weather. Time is short. My life is limited in time. Which me? Which world? Right now it&#39;s this wonderfully creative discussion on Reddit r-conspiracy. But in terms of what life I have left? Is it sitting there thinking about the apocalypse, or is getting busy living in a creative fashion?</p>

<p>Amazing that you call me blissfully ignorant. Only a totally aware person, one who is aware of <em>everything</em> has the credentials to call anyone that. If you do have such credentials, then I think I need to be your disciple. You can&#39;t have my spouse, house, or guitar though. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good read and post.  What do you think when you take this to the next level.. and your &quot;primary reality&#39; is in fact just a simulacra and/or just a portion of &quot;real reality&quot;.  Aldous Huxley and Lovecraft (as well as others) believed that our senses are actually just filters.  They give us the information that we <strong>need</strong> to survive.  All the other superfluous information and data is filtered out.  The thing is, maybe the filtered out material is actually really important, and science (and orthodoxy) has convinced us what we see/hear/taste is all that is required to live, procreate, work and die (enslavement).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I noticed that when I&#39;m immersed in creative action, not only does the beam not exist, but all the little nagging insanities that might be looping in my brain also disappear. Time sometimes slows to a crawl, or speeds up like a high-speed train in one of those other countries that aren&#39;t the USA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some would call this mindful meditation.  There are many types of meditation that do not have you sit still, silently, for half an hour.  Some believe you can achieve states of meditation doing any thing you love; Zen Archery, Painting, Writing, Dancing etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you. From varying experiences, it seems to me that the senses can be opened up and fine-tuned to what might be called the interconnectedness of everything. Infinite variation and individuality within this oneness that exists. Obviously, it&#39;s some part of the brain opening up that changes the perception of what is, or lifts perception and belief all together so that one sees that reality is undifferentiated at the same time it is differentiated. Paradoxical in word, but not in the experience. </p>

<p>I believe I need more than just what comes in through the senses, food, shelter, and human contact. Sleep and dreams point to other needs we have. In dreams, our creativity is completely unleashed, as we create intricate landscapes, events, and even people. In dreams, we can fly, walk through walls, make things appear and disappear, especially when we&#39;re lucid. I equate lucidity in a dream to lucidity in waking life. In both experiences, it&#39;s waking up to the here and now and realizing one can create experience.</p>

<p>Huxley was an interesting man. I read 3 of his books back in the 80&#39;s (The Doors Of Perception, Brave New World, and his book about his eyesight and the Bates Method, The Art Of Seeing) and got a lot out of all of them. He was a creative man looking to expand his consciousness, and actually tripped on LSD as he was in the very last stages of dying.</p>

<p>The creative process does involve mindfulness, as it takes being rooted in the present. the process always happens in the present. But I speak more to being so focused in creating that there is a flow, a warping of time, and no effort to keep returning to the present. One is just in the present and creatively acting.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite possible there are other senses that have nothing to with the external, but the internal realms. For example, what senses are picking up information in dreams, when there are no &quot;real&quot; eyes or ears or nose? What is the sense of time? What senses are picking up the information that we call inspirational ideas? Or the energies and vibrations one can experience in meditation or on a trip? There&#39;s more to us than what we&#39;ve been told. I was clueless about my potential and inner world until my mid-20&#39;s. All of that back then led to a pandora&#39;s box of creativity opening, one that I can&#39;t close, bury, or jettison into space.</p>

<p>I think these creative men, Huxley, Lovecraft, and so many people we can list and discuss also experienced this opening up of creativity that involves that veil coming down, that informed them that this reality is really a creative medium, and none of us are separate from our experience of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about &quot;The Beam&quot; but I personally don&#39;t want you to focus on that, just to bear in mind that your pleasant primary reality lets you think in terms of ignoring the entity you refer to as &quot;The Beam&quot;, something that may end up making you less capable of seeing through the difficulties people in your environment may face day to day.
Not focusing, just being aware.</p>
