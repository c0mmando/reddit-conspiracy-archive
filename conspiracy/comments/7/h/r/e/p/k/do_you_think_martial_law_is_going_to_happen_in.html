       The US government has been infiltrated by NWO globalists, who are also Zionists.  In order to take away their ability to operate in the U.S., you have to take away their power.  One way to do this is to declare Martial Law or a National Emergency.  I think it is appropriate since the U.S. government has been infiltrated by enemies of the American people.  Don't you agree?

       i think there are plenty of extremely powerful people who "game" the system for their own benefit, i'm just not convinced that ti's as coordinated as many on this board seem to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm also not convinced that these people are doing so for esoteric or religious purposes or because of some "evil" ideology. i think it's rooted in greed and thirst for power almost exclusively. although maybe that's just pedantry, maybe what i see as psychopathic greed, other's see as supernatural forces of evil.

       I am an Atheist, so I can go either way.  They do game the system, and they believe it is acceptable if nobody stops them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read a lot about the esoteric belief system in play, and it has been around for a long time.  It is incredible to me that the same evil bastards we are dealing with today were described in the earliest manuscripts, such as the Nag Hammadi.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a short read, and I think it is very informative.

       It seems like these ancient manuscripts were warnings to humans about a certain group of people- the Moloch worshipers, the Caananites, etc.  They have the Babylonian money magic.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also the whole Bohemian Grove owl/Moloch statue.  I think they would not have such a thing unless it was really important.

       Having said all of this, I am not offended if you disagree or see things differently.

       At first your comment made me laugh but then I realized this is exactly true and you are 100% correct.  Many of the changes we have seen over the past 30 years (could be longer, I am 50 and didn't pay much attention until I got older) point to us voluntarily laying a red carpet for martial law. Militarized municipal police departments, warrantless searches, erosion of first amendment rights, annihilation of fourth amendment rights, won't even get into the fifth amendment, warrantless cell phone monitoring...
      </p>
      <p>
       Martial law is a legal construct, I get that and I doubt we will see a direct declaration of martial law but at some point how much effort does it take to create a de facto martial law state?   The military industrial complex and the mindset that it brings to the table is a large part of our every day existence.

       The President can declare Martial Law or a National Emergency at any time.  He can take over Federal Agencies by doing this.  The Federal Reserve comes to mind.

       No the US is too big and too spread out for any sort of mid level event to happen and require martial law. It would require something of such a huge level that just the event itself would throw everything into chaos anyways.  I'm also not sure American would fracture at that sort of moment in time either and require martial law. We tend to pull together more when everything goes sideways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy wise I'm not even sure what the government would gain from martial law anymore either. They seem to be able to do whatever they want out in the open now anyways. I don't mean that like everything that happens is a conspiracy but more that now gov openly make a bill, people really don't like it, it passes anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do they gain from a martial law being put into place? Total collapse of our econ? Why would anyone rich and in power already want that?

       Can I ask, about what age are you?  I ask because I see the baby steps of this happening.  I see where things have come from and what they are now and I understand its not a normal or organic thing at all.  This place/country/world wants nothing but police in armor and AR's if they can make it happen they will.  From military surplus spending to military hand me downs, this place has gone from "get off my lawn, I know my rights" to "Get down on the ground, get down on the ground".  Oops, no-knock warrant on wrong house resulted in a dead home owner, again!

       Things have changed drastically, ignoring the process here is hugely irresponsible.

       That may not be the stated goal, but when the police now have the things the military does and they use them, that could be termed a soft police state.  When law makers go out of their way to make criminals of people who protest things or when walmart people strike and they send in the riot police back in 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, the kind of things they never were used for in the past?  To me it shows an effort.  That "police state" label is easily dodged by saying that no one is actually
       <em>
        trying
       </em>
       to make a police state, but the results are right in front of people.  The police are used to create and continue an ongoign war over hearts and minds.  A divide and conquer type tactic.  You're either for the good guys, or you're against them.  Which is foolish as fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Checkpoints in the US, checking papers and randomly picking people to pull over and look at?  No evidence of criminal activity, just drive through and throw away that funny notion of driving unmolested through the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man, there are a lot of examples.  None of them should be the "war on drugs" or the "war on illegal immigrants" or the "war on terrorism" which as we know, is all a farce.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there a lot of reasons to pay attention.

       There's some pretty isolated instances of fuckups like with Wal-Mart and protesters getting shit on. A lot of protesters bring it on themselves, especially recently, but yeah there's been some bad shit cops have done. Recently though they seem to be more or less standing down even when protesters are destroying shit. People have criticised them for that too. It's really a lose lose for cops.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there are some pretty poor police tactics and excuses being used right now but I doubt there is ever going to be martial law without excellent reason. Think about it. Cops are just ordinary citizens. They aren't going to be too cooperative to enact martial law unless there's an actual reason. I guess a reason would have to be created if this was the end goal for the government, but i don't understand why they would need to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kinda rambling sorry. Yeah the war on drugs and checkpoints are both absurd but i don't think there is a huge anterior motive here. They just want to be able to stop people and search them. It's certainly a problem and should stop, but not thinking martial law is the end goal here.

       Well, regardless, what we are hoping for and what the police
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       are separate things.  The police don't decide that they should get military hand me downs.  They just don't mind at all.  They'll take it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying there is a hidden hollywood type effort to create a police state, I'm saying this is the end result regardless of the intentions, outright or not.  The police are only tools, they don't make the decisions.  Someone in DC make decisions and the police benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm with you on the obviousness of how stupid it would be to state "martial law declared!", people would see right through it.  The catch is when they can achieve the same goals without anyone thinking they're doing it.  Military hand me downs?  They're making it happen anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       See, you see the checkpoint issue and others. Those are precedents that need to stop.  Those are the ideas that left unchallenged, will become a new norm.  When that happens there are people (intentionally or not) who well expand and compound those problems and as with all war on whatever's.....will end up allowing those people to advocate for more of the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, that's what I see.  See it as you like, thanks for your time.
