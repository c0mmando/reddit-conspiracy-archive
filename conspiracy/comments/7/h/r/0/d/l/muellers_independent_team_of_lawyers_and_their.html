    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s not how these investigations work. Go look up the Starr case. You blast low level operatives with as big of charges as you can and make them witnesses. They sing like canaries over the thought of 20 years in prison. You don&#39;t cut a deal with someone like Flynn if you have something major on him. That&#39;s not how you get him to deliver.</p>

<p>And I keep hearing that same statement, for months now. &quot;THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING, JUST WAIT.&quot; Its approaching Qanon levels of credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You <em>absolutely</em> cut a deal with somebody like Flynn if he gets you information on somebody like Trump. Flynn is small potatoes, and that’s how big this thing is. A General is small potatoes.</p>

<p>Unless his deal includes immunity to further prosecution, he is still at risk for further charges being laid, too, so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It literally says in the court documents, that they could’ve charged Flynn with more than they did, in exchange for his cooperation. </p>

<p>Seriously just go read it, it’s definitely in there. So no, it’s not as if they only stuck him with the only thing can find. That’s the exact opposite. </p>

<p>That’s why they gave Flynn a sweet deal but Manafort got the hammer dropped on him. Also the reason why the day before Flynn’s deal, Manafort was seen renegotiating his plea terms to cooperate more. </p>

<p>Not trying to be a dick, just stating what is known publicly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong><em>please read</em></strong></p>

<p>Well that’s easy, Mueller could’ve hit him with a lot heavier charges like he did with Manafort and not like Papadopolous. </p>

<p>So let’s just think about it like this, Manafort has got it pretty shitty rn. I think he’s got close to like ten charges against him(setting aside his recent antics from last week), he’s under house arrest, likely facing some solid jail time. Like solid jail time, not necessarily just a few months or none at all. </p>

<p>Why did Mueller hit Manafort with such a heavy hand? Because it is known publicly that he was not cooperating with the investigation. So they pound him with charges, in hopes that he’ll either flip or force others to see how bad he got it and scare them into to flipping instead. </p>

<p>Flynn was known to cooperate from the get go. It’s even stated in the court documents he may have worn a wire during conversations he’s had the past 6 months. </p>

<p>Also turns out Flynn is extremely useful and if anyone is going to have good information on Trump, it’s Flynn because he was one of the main dudes. So he’s exceptionally valuable to Mueller. </p>

<p>And just because Flynn came out the other day, publicly stating that he lied about discussing sanctions with Russia before Trump was president, but that it was during the transition(not the campaign) doesn’t mean that the illegal sanctions negotiations with Russia <em>started</em> in December 2016, Flynn was known by the IC to be compromised by the Kremlin as early as July 2016. </p>

<p>Okay I’ll stop for now lol let me know if you have questions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again idk why you’re putting “could” in quotes as if you’re implying that they couldn’t actually charge Flynn with more. Because like I said, it’s stated in the documents that they can charge him with more, if he does not cooperate with the investigation. That’s literally the main part of the plea deal. </p>

<p>It’s super straightforward. Not trying to make you feel bad for having differing opinions, but this is readily available information for anyone to go read. It’s not a conspiracy. </p>

<p>Instead of asking yourself, “hm I wonder why this article would only list half of the lawyers on the SC?” You rush to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> out of excitement regarding the news that confirms your reality that the special counsel is all Democrats and is obviously a coup to out Trump...</p>

<p>And the only way for someone to counter your reality is for them to compile “lists” and other things for you so you can “see” and then confirm the truth.</p>

<p>So REALLY what you’re saying is your reality is dependent on others spoon feeding you your news that confirms or denies the reality that you wish to exist. </p>
