       Entirely an Ad Hominem argument.  What does this argument do to address the actual evidence they used to indict Manafort/Flynn and any evidence we will hopefully see in the future?

       Both were charged with crimes unrelated to Russian election meddling or Trump collusion. Flynn's charge amounts to political jaywalking in comparison to the hype.

       I think we are seeing the beginning of the charges.  First they charge him with lying to the FBI, then they move onto why he lied and who he was lying for.  At the end of the special investigation I expect to see a more detailed explanation about what happened, other then they were just lying cause it's fun to lie to the FBI or something.

       No, that's not how these investigations work. Go look up the Starr case. You blast low level operatives with as big of charges as you can and make them witnesses. They sing like canaries over the thought of 20 years in prison. You don't cut a deal with someone like Flynn if you have something major on him. That's not how you get him to deliver.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I keep hearing that same statement, for months now. "THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING, JUST WAIT." Its approaching Qanon levels of credibility.

       You

       cut a deal with somebody like Flynn if he gets you information on somebody like Trump. Flynn is small potatoes, and that’s how big this thing is. A General is small potatoes.

      <p>
       Unless his deal includes immunity to further prosecution, he is still at risk for further charges being laid, too, so.

       It literally says in the court documents, that they could’ve charged Flynn with more than they did, in exchange for his cooperation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously just go read it, it’s definitely in there. So no, it’s not as if they only stuck him with the only thing can find. That’s the exact opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s why they gave Flynn a sweet deal but Manafort got the hammer dropped on him. Also the reason why the day before Flynn’s deal, Manafort was seen renegotiating his plea terms to cooperate more.

       Well that’s easy, Mueller could’ve hit him with a lot heavier charges like he did with Manafort and not like Papadopolous.
      </p>
      <p>
       So let’s just think about it like this, Manafort has got it pretty shitty rn. I think he’s got close to like ten charges against him(setting aside his recent antics from last week), he’s under house arrest, likely facing some solid jail time. Like solid jail time, not necessarily just a few months or none at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did Mueller hit Manafort with such a heavy hand? Because it is known publicly that he was not cooperating with the investigation. So they pound him with charges, in hopes that he’ll either flip or force others to see how bad he got it and scare them into to flipping instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flynn was known to cooperate from the get go. It’s even stated in the court documents he may have worn a wire during conversations he’s had the past 6 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also turns out Flynn is extremely useful and if anyone is going to have good information on Trump, it’s Flynn because he was one of the main dudes. So he’s exceptionally valuable to Mueller.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just because Flynn came out the other day, publicly stating that he lied about discussing sanctions with Russia before Trump was president, but that it was during the transition(not the campaign) doesn’t mean that the illegal sanctions negotiations with Russia
       <em>
        started
       </em>
       in December 2016, Flynn was known by the IC to be compromised by the Kremlin as early as July 2016.
      </p>

       Okay I’ll stop for now lol let me know if you have questions.

       While your explanation makes sense on paper, it is not consistent with the strategy that special counsels of the past. Especially since they "could" change Flynn with more.

       Again idk why you’re putting “could” in quotes as if you’re implying that they couldn’t actually charge Flynn with more. Because like I said, it’s stated in the documents that they can charge him with more, if he does not cooperate with the investigation. That’s literally the main part of the plea deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s super straightforward. Not trying to make you feel bad for having differing opinions, but this is readily available information for anyone to go read. It’s not a conspiracy.

       It's like this post is laying the foundation of an argument that says the counsel is making up evidence or something even though there's boatloads of evidence.

       That’s literally the narrative in some places already, and will get worse over time. Once it is clear that this is not a “nothingburger”, the excuses will shift to “faked evidence”.

       i tuned into the sean hannity show for a bit today.

      <p>
       he is devoting his entire 3 hour radio show today to "revealing" that Mueller's team is not credible because they are politically biased and a bunch of liberals.

      <p>
       notice the shift from "nothing here" to "low level campaign people that trump didn't know" to "well manafort worked with the dems first!" to "this investigation is politically biased and you can't trust them!"

       Oh okay so what you’re saying is you only got 8 from the link because that’s all that was provided to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of asking yourself, “hm I wonder why this article would only list half of the lawyers on the SC?” You rush to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       out of excitement regarding the news that confirms your reality that the special counsel is all Democrats and is obviously a coup to out Trump...
      </p>
      <p>
       And the only way for someone to counter your reality is for them to compile “lists” and other things for you so you can “see” and then confirm the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So REALLY what you’re saying is your reality is dependent on others spoon feeding you your news that confirms or denies the reality that you wish to exist.

       No it shows you would rabble all day against OP and not add to his list. If you can't find the links just say so because that is what it's seeming like. Calm down with the caps. It's only Reddit kiddo, no reason to pop a vein. I'm not expecting to be spoon fed but you're going to participate in the conversation be prepared to add something worth while instead of nothing but your opinion.

       They're painting themselves into a corner. It's getting down to some people defending the illegal acts when the main argument in the beginning was that nothing illegal was going on. If Trump hadn't fired Comey the special counsel wouldn't have been appointed. There's a contigency plan in the event that Mueller is fired so this isn't going away.

       I'd say its more similar to JFK, but they probably decided that attempting to assassinate Trump would be too risky so they are trying to do it this way. I would be very surprised if they are successful, though.

       No I don't have the time because I drive for a living. Hence why I'm saying if your going to be helpful then be helpful. If not, stop adding hot air to the post. You haven't added anything credible to any of this. And no, you telling anyone anything is not adding anything worth while. Your opinion is irrelevant to the facts that you are unwilling to present.

       Again idk why you’re putting “could” in quotes as if you’re implying that they couldn’t actually charge Flynn with more. Because like I said, it’s stated in the documents that they can charge him with more, if he does not cooperate with the investigation. That’s literally the main part of the plea deal.

       It’s super straightforward. Not trying to make you feel bad for having differing opinions, but this is readily available information for anyone to go read. It’s not a conspiracy.
