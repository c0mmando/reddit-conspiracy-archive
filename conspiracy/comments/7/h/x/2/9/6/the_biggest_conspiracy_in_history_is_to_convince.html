       It's the only thing that keeps this machine going. If enough people say fuck it and get off the ride, they won't be able to control the population. But it's also the one truth that even conspiracy theorists are unable to handle.

       I'm baffled by how many on this reddit are willing to bring children into a world they believe is controlled by an organization that wants to kill or control everyone. Actually baffled isn't the right word.

       If fewer people are easier to control, every ruler in history would have depopulated. Turns out, it's actually better to have more peasants to plow your fields and fight your wars than fewer. If they reproduce on their own, it's a sustainable resource.

       It's a cruel world and it's hard at times to want to bring a child into this world, but that doesn't seem to stop the rich from breeding.

       I feel as though all this LBGT agenda from Hollywood, and all this Gender-Fluid nonsense is a tool for population control. It's as if they want children confused and unsure of what exactly they want. It's easier to influence children, as opposed to when you're older.

       You can't confuse children about sexual attraction or gender. I say that as a trans person. It would be immensely difficult to make a cis child feel uncertain about their gender. And no matter how hard you try, you're not going to confuse people about who they want to have sex with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, that would be a much harder agenda than deincentivizing safe sex education or access to birth control, so there is a constant surplus of unwanted children in the welfare state/available to sex predators.

       I'm fine with children growing up to be whatever they want to be, but this is not something you need to be pushing at a young age. Pink's very young daughter recently said she's going to grow up and marry and African woman, and learn how to cook African food. Pink was like, "Good! That's great." You think she'll grow up and do just that, just because that's what she says as a kid? 
Kids don't know what the heck they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there are definitely tons of unwanted kids for people to prey on, unfortunately. Some people really shouldn't breed. Sadly, those are the ones that are having unprotected sex, and not taking care of their children. Drug addicts, etc. Those are the kids that suffer the most.

       I've never understood the whole having kids things.
      </p>
      <p>
       You lose most of your money and time on them. It's effectively a second job.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for what?
      </p>
      <p>
       So they can grow up in a place where they go through 20 years of forced school then 50 years of forced work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who wants to condemn someone else to that?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only somewhat decent argument I've heard is that - then they can take of me when I'm older. They can, but it doesn't mean they will. When a family member of mine lost a leg, only one of three kids ended up helping. One fucking moved just to get away, and the other eventually stole his house.
