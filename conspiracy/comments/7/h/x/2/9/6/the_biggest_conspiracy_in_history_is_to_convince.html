    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fine with children growing up to be whatever they want to be, but this is not something you need to be pushing at a young age. Pink&#39;s very young daughter recently said she&#39;s going to grow up and marry and African woman, and learn how to cook African food. Pink was like, &quot;Good! That&#39;s great.&quot; You think she&#39;ll grow up and do just that, just because that&#39;s what she says as a kid? 
Kids don&#39;t know what the heck they want. </p>

<p>Yes, there are definitely tons of unwanted kids for people to prey on, unfortunately. Some people really shouldn&#39;t breed. Sadly, those are the ones that are having unprotected sex, and not taking care of their children. Drug addicts, etc. Those are the kids that suffer the most.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never understood the whole having kids things.</p>

<p>You lose most of your money and time on them. It&#39;s effectively a second job. </p>

<p>And for what?</p>

<p>So they can grow up in a place where they go through 20 years of forced school then 50 years of forced work.</p>

<p>Who wants to condemn someone else to that?</p>

<p>The only somewhat decent argument I&#39;ve heard is that - then they can take of me when I&#39;m older. They can, but it doesn&#39;t mean they will. When a family member of mine lost a leg, only one of three kids ended up helping. One fucking moved just to get away, and the other eventually stole his house.</p>
