       Forget your ideologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Critically view any evidence or idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Never insult anyone who is discussing an idea that seems far fetched to you. If the idea is wrong/stupid to you it should be easy to disprove and you should do so, respectfully. I'm not shitting on other people, I have been guilty of this in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shills do exist but you can't treat people like they are just for not agreeing with you. Answer any criticism with legitimate evidence. Even if you are completely convinced they are not genuine you should treat them like they are. Any evidence of actual shilling should be gathered and presented. Truth and facts will win in the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you buy in to a theory/idea you should not be ashamed or angry when someone brings evidence to disprove it. You should be happy that you exist in a place where discussion and debate is allowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bad ideas deserve to die. Don't bind your pride to one.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing wrong with ideologies and adhering to one but on this sub all that should matter is the truth.

       Maybe it's just inconsequential to us? It's a subject that we don't really give a fuck to delve into given the bad reputation it gives us to question a government mass murder of tons of Jewish people.

       Is that link supposed to be evidence? Im open to the idea that kimi might be a plant to persuade the masses to go to war, but I couldn't guess the possible motivation for this would be. What do we have to gain from warring with NK? Why would SK be so afraid if this was all for show? Is there anything besides the ridiculousness of his "character" that leads people to believe this?

       War means continuation of military budgeting with insane over-allocation of funds. It's pure profit for military contractors, who do heavy lobbying to keep this war machine running. Actually a pretty straight forward cause.

       I wouldn't know their exact motives, but the point is to always keep some hot spots on the map running. Syria is obviously a lost cause now, ISIS is pretty much useless to them now, because Russians came in and ruined everything. So here comes NK, another sweet battleground to use US's vast arsenal on. The money flow into more defense contracts to get rid of NK, these contractors are very happy, certain politicians are handsomely paid. That's what it looks to me. Take taxpayers' money, funnel into defense contracts, distill through the defense companies, pocket whatever comes out.

       I think people have seen through the war against terror (the war against the middle east). US military spending is huge and something needs to justify that spending. A lot of people make a lot of money on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       People tend to view a potential war against NK more favorably though. Liberate the suffering people and end the threat of nuclear devastation of Japan/SK/US. He's a new type of villain.

       I wouldn't necessarily say that. I'm more of a conservative/libertarian and I will here a "democrat" out.  What I don't like is when this sub goes loopy over incorrect headlines and tries to drown out and logical discussion of the implications and if there is any.  Just with the recent Flynn deal from ABC, people were being immediately dismissed as delusional Trump supporters conducting mental gymnastics just for saying "This was done during the transition and not during the campaign, is it even illegal or problematic?"  People were saying they were spinning and just repeating their "talking points" or marching orders.   People were making it seam like anyone questioning whether or not this was actually a big deal were just insane and had their head so far up Trump's ass they refuse to see the truth.

       to at least have some logical discussions on it basically to desensitization whatever the media is reporting.  When you can't even ask "Is this even illegal?" or point out a very important fact like "it was during the transition and not the campaign" without being downvoted to oblivion or being dismissed as a blindly worshiping Trump supporter it can be pretty annoying.

       Again...all I said was that I discovered they have the exact same face. I have always been very adept at identifying faces, it's just randomly something I have always excelled at. So when I saw the striking similarity I conducted analysis to verify whether or not my eyes were deceiving me. They weren't. I have not claimed to have all the answers and never brought up the phrase crisis actors. Merely noted that I had discovered this strange but undeniable thing. As I stated in my original post, I am curious what others on this sub make of the results of the analysis. I don't have all the answers, just a solitary and unequivocal observation.

       Like I said, I have always been preternaturally adept at identifying faces. I am a bit "kooky" as I am an outside of the box thinker. However this is as straight forward and undeniable as it gets. Why should I share it with you? You're clearly a self-absorbed dick who downvotes me for no good reason.

       Yeah,  one of our rules is "no shills".  Usually we ban people for being r/TopMindsOfReddit contributors or for attacking users.  It is hard to prove whether someone is a shill but easy to prove those two things.  You might be surprised how much those two rules clean up a conspiracy sub.

       The clever division tactic seems to be too strong. There is now 2+ versions of truth depending on if you believe the corporate media or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's face it, the double truths all have to do with turning people against the president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth #1 Trump says he want to enforce the boarder laws. He has said this in many ways and has been taken out of context many times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth #2 Trump is racist and hates foreigners and said all immigrants are rapists, that is why he won't let them in.
      </p>
      <p>
       One side takes one as absolute truth, the other side takes the other as absolute truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is one truth is from listening to what was said for your self. The other "truth" is from being told by the corporate media what was said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus by deception 2 opposing "truths" exist at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just one example of the problem.

       We are not talking about psychically knowing someone's true intentions. That would be ridiculous. We are also not talking about our feelings about a person we have never met personally. We are not talking about what we "believe", which is subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are only talking about the real words that came out of his mouth that are forever preserved in video.  That is the only truth about what he said. All else is just personal bias.

       What happens when the person you're arguing with refuses to accept what you've shown them?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the fact that you can't prove a negative. That is, if someone is claiming something and they have no actual evidence that supports the claim, you can't prove their claims wrong because there's no evidence for you to disprove.

       To your first point i say if someone cannot accept the evidence, and diaplays this, it becomes perfectly obvious to the community as a whole what the truth is. And why prove a negative? If there ia no proof of the positive, then no real member of this community is just going to blindly believe it. Both these questions have simple solutions.

       What you seem to fail to grasp is that there are things for which cold, hard evidence simply doesn't exist. All there may be is circumstantial evidence, where your intuition is the best tool you've got when searching for the truth. Some people here seem to have a lot of trouble with that concept, and want to convince others that they are wrong just because there is no smoking gun.

       The probem with ambiguous theories like pizzagate is that after the evidence starts to dwindle, people can just change the definition of pizzagate and pretend it's about something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       See "pedogate", and people pretending sexual assault in hollywood is evidence for pizzagate.

       I honestly never got the impression that Pizzagate was only about a pizzashop. It was always about pedophilia among the elite. Lots of Podesta's suspicious emails had nothing to do with pizza, for example.

       Pizzagate requires two things to be true:
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis, based on his instagram photos and comments, is a pedophile running a sex dungeon / pedophile ring out of his DC pizza shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Podesta emails, based on a list of code words sourced entirely from an unidentified source on 4chan, are a number of elderly people emailing constantly about fucking kids and keeping child sex slaves in their homes (and not a bunch of elderly people making corny jokes and planning meals),
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you remove those two things, Pizzagate / Pedogate is just "Pedophiles exist. Sometimes powerful people are pedophiles, and they get other people to cover their crimes". Which, while technically a conspiracy, is not anything new and not really what people are talking about when pizzagate comes up.

       Uh no it doesn't require the Pizza shop to have a sex dungeon or be the fucking headquarters of a pedophile ring. Why do you think this is remotely fucking required? Pizzagate is simply a small part of the global pedo network (Pedogate). The Pizza shop is probably just a meeting place for the pedos or for the ones who like to be "out in the open". Not very complicated.

       Pizza/Cheese I've seen used myself years ago. So unless they literally time traveled then yea it's actually confirmed. The others haven't (I believe) been confirmed, Although they do make sense (like hotdog). And not all of the emails are using codewords. Quite a lot of them are just using straight up strange language.

       What the fuck are you saying? Pizzagate is simply the investigation into the Pizza shop/Podesta's circumstantial evidence that points into them being connected to a pedo network and Pedogate is everything else. Again using weird dishonest manipulative language.

       <p>
        The fact is, however, that this supposed "law of logic" is no such thing. As Steven D. Hales points in his paper "You Can Prove a Negative," "You can't prove a negative" is a principle of folk logic, not actual logic.
       </p>
       <p>
        Notice, for a start, that "You cannot prove a negative" is itself a negative. So, if it were true, it would itself be unprovable. Notice that any claim can be transformed into a negative by a little rephrasingâ€”most obviously, by negating the claim and then negating it again. "I exist" is logically equivalent to "I do not not exist," which is a negative. Yet here is a negative it seems I might perhaps be able to prove (in the style of Descartesâ€”I think, therefore I do not not exist!)

       You're all just getting confused about the concept of falsifiability. It's not to do with negatives or positives, it's to do with falsifiable statements. E.g. The statement 'All swans are white' is falsifiable because the observation of one black swan would falsify it. The statement 'there are unicorns on Jupiter' isn't really falsifiable because we can't make sufficient observation to confirm.

       Or let's say I was alone on Friday night, and I never said what I did.  I might tell people I started work on my novel and wrote almost 20 pages.  Someone on here might say I was actually masturbating furiously for 6 hours and fell asleep in a chair with my pants around my ankles.  However, with no witnesses, and assuming the NSA wasn't watching me through my webcam, no one could ever prove that I wasn't working on my novel.

       Or Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.  We don't know what happened or where it is, only that it's crashed and everyone died.  If someone were to argue that it didn't crash, that it was abducted by aliens, could you prove him wrong knowing what we know today?

       Actually, I have found that as soon as they comment from the original post, you can 90% guarantee they are shills and trolls. With that in mind, they are eating themselves, genuine readers know they are not there for rational discourse, so just 1. report them as soon as possible, 2. people get more woke. They really are doing disservice to themselves, just like so many lies falling flat on their faces this year.

       Yeah there could be caverns big enough for whole cities and the Earth wouldn't have to be "hollow". Maybe in some places there's a honeycomb-like structure, especially where lava has flowed or where oil has been extracted. It would make sense for the existence of these places to be kept a secret. Anyone who blows the whistle can be disappeared underground...

       This really speaks to me at the moment. Most of the things I believe to be true are concentric with the beliefs of the majority of this community. Occassionally, however, I will discover what I believe to be true yet the majority of people will dismiss me as a kook without even glancing at the evidence for said belief. In those moments I become very discouraged about our potential as truth seekers to actually make an enduring difference. If we cannot continue to challenge our assumptions then we will just continue with the one step forward two steps back pattern. This is an important reminder. Thank you.

       Main thing I am referencing here is that I noted a striking similarity between Susan Bro and Sebbie Soto. I have always been extremely adept at identifying faces but thought my eyes could be deceiving me, so I conducted careful biometric analysis to see if my eyes were deceiving me, but the analysis showed instead that they indeed have the exact same face. I offered to send anyone that requested the video by PM, but no one asked and instead called crazy and downvoted to oblivion. It's like... ðŸ™ˆ

looking at the pictures, they look similar.  you have to wonder though, if it is the same person... the balls on the people setting it up to use the same person for both instances is pretty out there and unlikely.  it'd be nice to get them both in a room to unlock an iPhone X, that's for sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       i wouldn't dismiss you as a kook.  if the women sounded similar it'd be worth taking another look.

       sandy hook is a weird one for me.  while i dont go the whole alex jones route that it was a false flag and it didn't happen, certain things about the investigation stick out to me as odd.

       I agree that it certainly makes one wonder why or even how...but following the evidence leads me to conclude that whatever the answers to those questions, they are the same. (Or twins--which oddly enough seems less logical)

       Quite common for people to loom "the same" ? How does that apply to my analysis? I identified at least 10 IDENTICAL metrics.  If you think random people on the street regularly share this degree of similarity then I'm sorry but you have prosopognasia.

       I am not "measuring some lines" I measured and matched exact facial synchronicities. Clearly you are unaware of how facial recognition software was developed. You should get that prosopognasia looked into, compadre.

       Funnily enough my dissertation was related to face recognition. You are confused about prosopagnosia though, it's not really to do with matching faces, but more to do with not being able to recognise faces. People with severe prosopagnosia might not be able to recognise the faces of family and friends.

       Prosopagnosia also (obviously) applies to being unable to notice when you are seeing the face of a person you have already seen, such as when comparing two photos of the same person.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can keep slinging ad hominems but it doesn't make you sound rational when you are denying what's right in front of your face. If your dissertation was on facial recognition then what happened in the mean time? Did you do a lot of drugs or something? I literally used multiple forms of facial recognition software and meticulous manual analysis to verify that these are the same individual and all you can say in your apparent expertise is "that's retarded"--how sophisticated of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're denial and confidence despite any sort of rational counter-argument is quite honestly creepy AF. You need help or to meditate or something because at this point it's just bizarre.

       This is exactly what I'm talking about. People upvote this comment indiscriminately. But that's the issue, most people are not good at distinguishing faces, which is why I took it upon myself to make this analysis. To help people to see what I see, as I've always been preternaturally good at identifying and distinguishing between faces. Essentially I have never though anyone looked substantially the same unless they were identical twins and even then I can always distinguish between the two after I am initially introduced to them. Take it or leave it (looks like most are opting for the latter...so it goes.)

       You should get checked out for prosopagnosia. All of the things you just mentioned literally look exactly the same save for a bit more chin sag and a few more wrinkles in Susan Bro--who would have had 5 more years of gravity tugging on her face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their mouths are exactly the same shape and width and is the exact same distance from the other metrics of her face---did you even watch the video? In case you didn't notice Susan bro is pursing her lips, otherwise the mouths are identical.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the nose---I'm incredulous as to how you can say they are different in any way. Not only did I prove that the position and width of the nose is literally identical for each photo, but their noses even without measuring are clearly EXACTLY the same. They even both have a very slight downward slant to the right. How you can deny the nose is exactly the same is beyond me. Without a doubt it proves that you are deliberately obfuscating or are just very, very bad at analyzing facial features.

       The person is the first picture's nose is absolutely different. Much more wide set. Person 2 has a much more prominent nose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Person #1 has a wide chin, person #2 has a much narrower chin. aging does not affect your facial structure to that degree in five years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the distance between the noses and the eyes between the first photo and the second? Did her nose slide down her face over the course of five years as well? Or did her eyes slide up her face?
      </p>
      <p>
       In five years, she lost her under eye lines, lose the lines to the sides of her mouth, but gained lines between the sides of her nose and mouth? Did that come from her eyes changing position?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just going by what I'm seeing, I'm have no professional experience doing facial recognition comparisons, but I'm willing to bet that you don't either.

       Dood--in the photos you just showed me, Susan Bro is looking upward, while Donna Soto is looking downward. Hence why one's nose is upturned and the others is downward...basic shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The person is the first picture's nose is absolutely different. Much more wide set."
      </p>
      <p>
       Unbelievable. I literally proved that their noses are the exact same width. Did you literally not watch the video? I'll make it easy for you and link to that exact part:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0UPGbPJ91Y#t=09m10s">

       "Person #1 has a wide chin, person #2 has a much narrower chin. aging does not affect your facial structure to that degree in five years."
      </p>
      <p>
       No---again the chins are the exact same width. The only difference is Susan Bro's skin beneath her chin is understandably sagging a bit more. Not only does person two not have a "much narrower" chin, but her chin is literally not narrower. Are you just winging this? Or have you actually done the measurements? Because I have. I can update the video if you'd like to show you this regarding the chins, since it wasn't explicitly included in my video.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Look at the distance between the noses and the eyes between the first photo and the second? Did her nose slide down her face over the course of five years as well? Or did her eyes slide up her face?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Again--this was in my video. The noses are literally in the exact same position relative to the eyes. Here's another convenient link to that timestamp:

       You keep saying "They're the EXACT" same width, but how were you able to get two photos of these women where you know for sure that they were the exact same distance and angle from the camera in order to be so sure about that measurement?

       As I've explained to many other people, though I'll give you the benefit of the doubt since you may have missed those earlier exchanges, I normalized the size of the photos.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, it's obvious that they are both looking straight at the camera--so I find the comments about the "angle" to be just strange. Are you telling me you cannot see they are looking straight at the camera?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second of all, the distance is normalized by resizing one or both of the photos until the distance between one or more of the facial metrics match. Once an immutable facial metric matches (such as the distance between the eyes, then you can proceed to analyze the remaining metrics. At that point, non-identical individuals will start to have biometric measurements that diverge, whereas identical twins or the same individual will continue to have synchronous metric after synchronous measurement. Once you've verified that all of the major facial landmarks are exact, then you know they are the same person, relatives that closely resemble each other, or twins.
      </p>
      <p>
       This should be obvious. Just imagine how you would normalize the sizes of two photos of yourself looking directly at a camera--it is the same process I described above. I encourage you to try it for yourself with two photos of yourself with the camera at different distances away from your face.

       So basically, your initial data that you based everything else on was your resizing one of the photos until the distance between their eyes matched? And you're surprised that you're finding other things now match?

       What? Listen to what you are saying. Oh man, no offense but I didn't think people would be this, well, dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I described to you is literally the only way to normalize the size of the photos. It's not something I made up--it's literally the only way to do it!
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, I did not "eyeball" it, I took an exact measurement between the two eyes on each photo until they matched. In response to this you say:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Any measurements you take from that point are now flawed because your first data point was just something that you eyeballed until looked good for the rest of your conclusions."
      </p>
      <p>
       ...but that is very, very dumb. And I don't mean to say that because I think you are necessarily dumb. Just that as of right now you don't grasp the concept, so your current perspective is sounding dumb.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it this way. If I were to compare two photos of two obviously different people, and before doing so I resized the photos until the distance between their eyes matched. After doing so, most if not all of the other measurements would be totally off. How is that not clear? The only way that the measurements would continue to be synchronous after that normalization process is if they are the same person...because the first normalizing measurement/resizing is the base measurement. It's like the control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yikes...I just don't know how to get through to people if you don't see this, the most basic component of comparing two photos. Its...just...so...obvious. That's why I encourage you to do the same with two photos of yourself taken from different distances from the camera. You will see very quickly if you do that to normalize the size of the photos you need to render one measurement synchronous. How can I make this more clear, lol?!
      </p>
      <p>
       Since everyone is being so damn stubborn about this I ran the photos through a facial comparison API...check out the result...

       This only works to "normalize" the photos if all human beings have the same amount of space between their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And beside that point, the distance between the eyes and the nose is not the same, and neither is the distance between the nose and the mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like some of the distances matched up, and you decided to use those numbers and throw away the ones that didn't match.

       You literally do not get it! This is how you normalize two photos of the same person---if you do this and they are NOT the same person, then all the subsequent measurements will be totally off. If you cannot grasp this then you are a lost cause!

       The eyes are the same shape, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no...you flubbed the line on the left. You made it longer so that it went past the center of Susan Bro's lips. Therefore your result is not accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regard to the Alia/Ilana comparison, I just did several comparison's of them using faceplusplus, every single one came up "probability normal"--so congratulations, you have exposed yourself as a liar, manipulator...and shill. Where you went wrong is their eyes are completely different distances apart, and that is blatant with just the naked eye. So there is no way a facial recognition software would rule them "probability very high" no matter how much zoom or whatever nonsense you are claiming made the difference.

       Whats funny is that you thought I would be stupid enough to fall for that. We're done here.

       Dude it still only says probability high...not very high.

      <p>
       This illustrates an important point though. You need to do comparisons of multiple pairs of photos and see what result you get the majority of the time.

      <p>
       I got "probability normal" 4 out of 5 times for those two individuals. That's obviously not perfect, but pretty good. Now if I try multiple pairs of Soto and Bro...stay tuned.

       Okay now I've compared 5 photos of Susan Bro to the only photo I could find of Donna Soto not wearing glasses. 4 produced "Probability Very High" and one in which Susan Bro was looking particularly harried, produced "Probability High"...are you ready to start giving an inch, DooDoo?

       No, as I said 4 out of 5 were probability very high. I challenge you to reproduce more than one comparison of them two that says probability very high. Like I said, the two photos you gave me only produced "probability high"

       Why do you use the same photo every time? Why don't you mix it up and use different photos of both women? If they're the same person you should get "probability very high or high" for each pairing, right?

       like I said I only found that one photo of Donna Soto without glasses. Obviously the glasses obscure things by changing the size of the eyes. What is your issue exactly? I varied the photos of Susan Bro so it is still a varied sampling. Like I said...shifting the goal post Doo...

       Obviously not...Ilana's eyes are a lot closer set together. That's obvious from a cursory glance.
      </p>
      <p>
       And 80 percent of photos of them compared through faceplusplus turn up "probability normal"--your "very high" result, which I was not able to replicate, was an outlier. Just like the "high" (as opposed to "very high") comparison of Soto and Bro is an outlier.

       Of course, I've explained a few of the more outlandish theories before that, so he thinks it's just another theory. If they already think

       When it comes to mics powered by the sway of skyscrapers, it's entirely plausible, because such things do exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The piezoelectric effect is basically an internal electric charge generated by mechanical force.
      </p>
      <p>
       I first heard of it over 20 years ago when I wondered why the stylus for my Wacom ArtPad II didn't need a battery, then found out that contact mics for guitars (and probably other instruments) also used piezo-electricity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd actually be surprised if the Russians (and other countries) DIDN'T use piezo-electric mics.

       Exactly. And under this logic, there should be literally no political partisanship. The truth is that no matter who's in office, the common man's best interest will never be pursued. But unfortunately the majority of this sub now consists of partisan bickering, which Trump has amplified.

       I've followed this sub for years before becoming a fan of Trump. I think the truth is bound to come out in our time, and if Obama had been the guy to un-fuck humanity I would have cheered him on, but he sold out instead. Trump may not be your cup of tea, but if any president was ever going to blab on the big conspiracies, I would put my money on Trump.

        A man-made catastrophic event is happening right now. Its a purge of power and oligarchy. Trump is the saviour of humanity. He has put the corruption and crimes of humanity in the spotlight. He will go down too but that is because he is the epitome. He is a fucked up Jesus. He is an accelerant of evolution. He is helping us realize our complacency and greed. We had no reason to act until the very of fabric of society was being threatened. Regardless of what his sycophants say about how society is broken, it was much more broken before and we have been getting better but he points out the serious flaw of the system that turn us into a leaf instead of a branch in time but we will persist because of diversity. Evolution is amazing.

       It's pretty nutty, but I saw this posted on here a little while back and really liked it. I absolutely despise Trump. But I do believe that (if we can get through these next ~4 years) we will be much better off as a society in the long run than if Hillary were to have won. He's exposing how fucked up our society truly is.

       Fucked up Jesus.  I like that.  Basically whether he's genuine or not, ordinary people are more engaged than ever. It's the rude awakening we all needed.

       Mah, it usually is due to brigades. Look at any top post like the one yesterday, there's one crafted narrative that gets upvoted and any dissenting comments are always downvote brigaded to the massive graveyard(which also usually only appears when a post is brigaded here).

       I'd change one thing in what you said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This sub should care about the
        <del>
         truth
        </del>
        facts and nothing else.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The truth is subjective, bent by our personal biases and perceptions. In essence, it is what a conspiracy is born from; our perceptions seeing what lies beyond what we are told. Our ability and
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       to see beyond the narratives and explanations to find the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is what bends science into ideology; it takes the emotional need for explanation, for our desire to know why and rejects what disproves our suppositions in favor of delusions that uphold what we cling to. Of this, I have seen more in this sub than anything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       2+2 will always insist, invariably, that it equals 4. It is to this that we must resolve the inconsistencies in the official explanations, the taking of 2+2's that we are told equal 4, but upon examination, we learn are 3's masquerading as 4's and exposing them for the frauds that they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything, we should be taking the "truth" and stripping away the lies to find the facts, if any exist at all.

       It's not the first time they used such a tactic to make people think someone was the good guy. A perfect example of this was the Aldrich bill, aka the Federal Reserve Act. After the Aldrich bill failed because people saw it for what it was (a bill by bankers for bankers), they created a huge propaganda effort, even paying economists at universities and such, to cry about how much the Fed act would "hurt the banks", etc. The people bought it, thinking "If it's bad for the banks it must be good for us!", and that's how we got the fed.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are falling into a trap, being played. It's ok though, we've all fallen for their tactics at some point or another. So please, don't be so quick to tell someone else to think for themselves, when it's you who needs to think for yourself.

       I agree that there is a lot of time wasted on disinformation, and there is a lot of argument over stupid things. While it may not be fair, or in the spirit of this post, I'm pretty sure most of this sub can agree to just ignore the flat earthers. Also, if someone is arguing a point that you think is wrong, throw some evidence out there. If they claim bullshit, ignore them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone is throwing out ad homs to your backed up claim, they are just trying to start a flame was to distract everyone. So, yeah, don't argue with the people who are insulting you, and don't argue with the people who are throwing out disinformation. Ignore or downvote and move on.

       I usually check people post histories to see who is posting, and the ones I usually check are people who post several hours a day, crossposting to other subs. I don't think they're shills but there's definitely people here trying to muddy the waters. There's also a lot of people that hate the MSM but are quick to post Fox News.

       I agree. Yet, there seems to be a large cadre on this sub that does not even pretend to care about the truth. Just look at all of the highly upvoted Q thread with posts like, "I don't even care if this is true . . . " That kind of thinking is cancer to a sub, or a movement, that purports to be anti-bullshit and pro-truth.

       Agreed. However, this sub was taken over 3 months ago after the original founder/mods became inactive. You can confirm yourself by looking at the list of moderators and they're post history  I'll probably be banned for this but please look.

       Maybe this sub should assume that any ad hominem attacks are shills trying to silence discussion and discredit this subreddit as a place of meaningful discourse. By making ridiculous attacks on people, as opposed to their ideas, we negate any meaningful discussion. In the end, that's what this sub is all about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attacking people halts discussion, halting discussion necessarily hurts this subreddit, and anyone making vagrant personal or ideological attacks clearly does not care to preserve the integrity of the platform.

       i don't know who those people are so i decided to google it.
looking at the pictures, they look similar.  you have to wonder though, if it is the same person... the balls on the people setting it up to use the same person for both instances is pretty out there and unlikely.  it'd be nice to get them both in a room to unlock an iPhone X, that's for sure.

       i wouldn't dismiss you as a kook.  if the women sounded similar it'd be worth taking another look.

       sandy hook is a weird one for me.  while i dont go the whole alex jones route that it was a false flag and it didn't happen, certain things about the investigation stick out to me as odd.

       What you seem to fail to grasp is that there are things for which cold, hard evidence simply doesn't exist. All there may be is circumstantial evidence, where your intuition is the best tool you've got when searching for the truth. Some people here seem to have a lot of trouble with that concept, and want to convince others that they are wrong just because there is no smoking gun.

       Quite common for people to loom "the same" ? How does that apply to my analysis? I identified at least 10 IDENTICAL metrics.  If you think random people on the street regularly share this degree of similarity then I'm sorry but you have prosopognasia.

       I am not "measuring some lines" I measured and matched exact facial synchronicities. Clearly you are unaware of how facial recognition software was developed. You should get that prosopognasia looked into, compadre.

       This is exactly what I'm talking about. People upvote this comment indiscriminately. But that's the issue, most people are not good at distinguishing faces, which is why I took it upon myself to make this analysis. To help people to see what I see, as I've always been preternaturally good at identifying and distinguishing between faces. Essentially I have never though anyone looked substantially the same unless they were identical twins and even then I can always distinguish between the two after I am initially introduced to them. Take it or leave it (looks like most are opting for the latter...so it goes.)

        Second of all, the distance is normalized by resizing one or both of the photos until the distance between one or more of the facial metrics match. Once an immutable facial metric matches, such as the distance between the eyes, then you can proceed to analyze the remaining metrics.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So basically, your initial data that you based everything else on was your resizing one of the photos until the distance between their eyes matched? And you're surprised that you're finding other things now match?

       like I said I only found that one photo of Donna Soto without glasses. Obviously the glasses obscure things by changing the size of the eyes. What is your issue exactly? I varied the photos of Susan Bro so it is still a varied sampling. Like I said...shifting the goal post Doo...
