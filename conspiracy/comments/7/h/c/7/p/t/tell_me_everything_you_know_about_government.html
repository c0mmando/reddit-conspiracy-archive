<p>I&#39;m trying to expand the story to include references to legislators, judges, or other government officials that have benefited somehow from sex trafficking and child pornography in the US. I believe it&#39;s a common and possibly systemic problem, and it may be the reason for their lack of real action on the issue. But I don&#39;t have enough references to make that claim.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s one, about <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/sep/27/daniel-rosen-former-state-dept-official-convicted-/">Daniel Rosen in the state department.</a>. I don&#39;t intend to mention Judge Roy Moore&#39;s case (I think we all know that story by now) but similar cases would definitely be interesting.</p>

<p>So tell me. What do you know?</p>

<p>According to James Patterson&#39;s book &quot;Filthy Rich,&quot; about Epstein, Trump and Epstein had a professional acquaintance that ended when Trump tossed Epstein out of Mar-A-Lago for hitting of a 15-year old, and barred him from ever coming back.</p>

<p>As for the creepy pix of Don w/ his daughter, three of the four are posed and we all know Trump&#39;s a media whore who will do anything for attention. A sly photography could&#39;ve easily gotten him to pose that way for any of them--they take THOUSANDS of photos and can pick the one that suits their narrative. </p>

<p>Look into Senator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TcDTJlPWbE">Nancy Schaefer</a> and her work on exposing CPS for the evil that it is. Many believe this is what got it her killed. </p>

<p>Did you know that President Bill Clinton flew numerous times on Jeffrey Epstein&#39;s &quot;Lolita Express&quot; to the billionare&#39;s island located in Virgin Islands affectionately nicknamed &quot;Orgy Island&quot;? He even ditched his Secret Service detail several times <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/14/bill-clinton-ditched-secret-service-on-multiple-lo/">[source]</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>Heavens. This is a fantastic and gruesome trove of information. I&#39;m so grateful.</p>

<p>So far, I intend to stick pretty closely with my PD story, since I was one of the victims of that police officer - it&#39;s the angle I&#39;m using to tell the story. I was compelled to work on this when I found out he informed the FBI he&#39;s moving to another country so, incredibly, they do not track him on the sex offender database anymore. The US exported an unrepentant child predator, and although I don&#39;t know what the solution is (I don&#39;t know the full story about those laws yet) I assume I&#39;m not alone about being outraged about it.</p>

<p>All this info you provided will be an enormous help in explaining the broader story, that this is a much bigger issue and why perhaps the folks in power aren&#39;t entirely motivated to fix it. I was missing that piece, and I came here looking for exactly what you gave me. I really appreciate all the time you took on this. Thank you again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure this fits what you&#39;re looking for, but the murder of Sister Cathy Cesnik in Maryland. Here is a link to a post about it...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/3sin9h/what_happened_to_sister_cathy/">https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/3sin9h/what_happened_to_sister_cathy/</a></p>

<p>Netflix has a doc on it called The Keepers. Very creepy show. For those who aren&#39;t familiar, Sister Cathy was a teacher at a Catholic school in Baltimore and was murdered. It looks like a giant conspiracy cluster fuck that includes cops, the Catholic Church and large scale sex abuse. </p>
