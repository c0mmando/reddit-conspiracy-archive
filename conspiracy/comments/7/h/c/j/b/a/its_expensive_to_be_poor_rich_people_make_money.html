       If on the other hand, you are poor, then it's expensive because you can't really own anything and you have to pay rent to a rich man to have housing, transportation, loans, etc. It doesn't matter what kind of economy, it's the same in every country.

       The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer
And in the final hour many heads will lose power
What does the rich versus the poor really mean?
Psychologically it means you got to pick your team
When someone says the rich gets richer
Visualize wealth and put yourselves in the picture
The rich get richer, cause they work towards rich
The poor get poorer, cause their minds can't switch from the ghetto

       They over buy things because they're afraid they'll run out. Supplies were scarce as they grew up, so they spend to compensate, wasting money.

       If you actually believe the scarcity mentality exists you're an idiot. Poor people don't buy too much of anything they just buy things they can't afford. If you are ignorant enough to believe we will run of out anything in the modern day there should be no further explanation needed for why you are poor.

       My ex wife has scarcity mentality. She, specifically, used to over buy food and it ended up going bad. I lived with it, so don't you dare call me an idiot or delusional. We we're on food stamps and welfare for a time. We had periods where we had food and we're fine, then times it was tough. She had issues not having enough food growing up and it stuck. Even once we were doing better financially, she would stock up on food to the point the bottom half of our freezer was freezer burnt/wasted food almost all year round. So, screw your egotistical notions, jackass. There are people in this county who suffer regularly.

       Well, it starts with the premise that everything is made of energy... Money is no different if you think of it as a sort of green energy. Humans are very capable of working with the energy all around us, but it takes a complete change of the way you think if you grew up with a scarcity mentality, i.e., there is never enough. Scarcity mentality is believing there is only so much to go around which is not the case at all. The universe is actually quite abundant, there is more than enough to go around. When you grow up poor, you are always being told that there isn't enough. You end up chasing low paying jobs working for someone else to just get by instead of trying things like starting your own business and being your own boss. A scarcity mentality makes you scared to break out of the box of your family programming, fear of scarcity keeps you quite limited. There is lots of reading out there on this subject, some mentioned in this thread. Even a book like Rich Dad Poor Dad... the idea that poor people are always chasing cash whereas others chase assets, it's a totally different mind set. One that you yourself can create and change.

       Unselfishness is the key to an intelligent race becoming immortal.  Unfortunately humans are taught scarcity, fear and individuality which ultimately has led to seclusion and depression. Our 8-5 leash and blue or white collars have entrenched our human race to devolve. We have been breeding greedy and dumb poor people because of this system instead of teaching how the earth works and looking up at the stars as one race.

       I didn't say I was poor, I said I was broke. However, as a paycheck to not even my next-paycheck guy with no savings, a car that will not be running very much longer, and a heroin habit... Yeah, I'm poor. It doesn't matter how much you make, it matters how much you have. So, I pay $800/month rent but that's really cheap, I'm just renting a room. If I wanted to get a 1 bedroom apt it'd be around $1500/m. And about the dope, I never have enough to get me through to my next check, so I'll get fronts and then that's like $250-300 right off the top of my check when I get it.

       How are totally gonna look at your situation and make generalizations about poor people. I don't make enough in a month to cover your rent, cigarettes, and energy drinks alone. You're not poor, or paycheck to paycheck, you have a spending problem. There's a massive difference, and you're so wrapped up in you own little bubble you can't even see it.

       And that's basically what my first post boiled down to: people who think and tell people they're poor, but they actually never learned to manage their money; and it's even harder than just learning, I mean I know what I should be doing but I just don't have the willpower.

       Could you afford your rent, 1 pack of smokes every day, and 4 energy drinks every day, plus have some money left over? Because maybe you can't afford what I spend on that stuff, but I live in a high cost of living area where everything costs more, the $20/hr I make isn't a great wage here; I might qualify as the very bottom of lower middle class.

       I didn't say I was in poverty, I said I was broke due to budgeting issues; of course the only difference between them is it would be quicker and easier for me to improve my situation, otherwise there isn't much noticeable difference: at the end of the day I get and spend more money, but I don't have anything to show for it because almost everything I buy is consumable; in fact growing up in low income housing there were a lot of Mexican families there and I'd go over to my friends apartments, and even though those people probably made less than I do now, they were much better off than I am now. They budgeted and shopped for deals, bought real food rather than packaged stuff and always had delicious home cooked meals, but not everyone around there was like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my point was in response to robaloie saying "Poor people can’t afford the nice products so they buy the cheap ones that break faster so they end up having to buy more of the same cheap product", and I countered with they can do it, but it takes ingenuity, sacrifice, will power, brains, and especially be aware of programs meant to help you(welfare).
      </p>
      <p>
       Like say nowadays cheap microwaves have planned obsolescence built in and you need to buy a new one every year as a poor person. Waste of money, just like Vimes boot theory. So you should buy the expensive model that will last longer, that way you won't have to replace it as often;
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       at a Thrift Store or garage sale buy one of the old ones that not only run forever but also work much better than modern ones, buy a little tool kit, and when it breaks learn how to fix it on Youtube. Boom, you just spent less than the shitty model costs for a microwave that will last at least 10x longer than the expensive one! Set aside the money you saved. Keep doing that sort of thing every time you see an opportunity, keep socking the money away.
      </p>
      <p>
       After a year or two not only will you have a nice little chunk of change saved up, you won't have anymore upcoming expenses like you used to; take that money and invest it in an index fund. Keep adding to it with the money you would have spent on your yearly microwave and whatever else. That index fund will go up 3-6% quarterly, even when we have a recession the overall economy still grows albeit slower, and you're invested in a little piece of every company on the stock market, so your ETF will match the market's growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's how a poor person could claw their way out of the cycle.

       I agree.

      <p>
       Without Capitalism most of these people would be dead or never born in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Historically in societies that value labor people who don't or cannot contribute to the economy and society are killed or left for dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capitalism is the only economic system that allows for millions of people to exist and survive in a society while not producing or contributing to the overall good of the society.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in almost every other human society, and every animal system. If you don't produce, you would have to either 100% take care of all your personal needs, want's, and desires, or you die.

       If you invest your money wisely, then it makes you money. But not always. And many people diversify their money in different stocks, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how do you think they got that money? Most of them worked their butts off and sacrificed for many years. (Although some do inherit money though).

       Right, but I'm saying that often the kids of those people are the ones making exorbitant amounts of money. People who work hard and make it rich are often satisfied with their success, and it's the kids who start off with real estate and house flipping instead of working low wages at grocery stores.

       So why are you mad that they're making more money? Once you have your few million, maybe your kid could build on that and get to the hundred millions level, and so on. Or maybe no, it doesn't really matter in the big picture..

       The idea is that, the people who have made it before us make it harder for us to climb. One of my neighbors is 51, and he just finished paying off his student debt. I'm fine if we can all do the same things to get rich, but that certainly doesn't seem like equal opportunity to me...

       Why are you going into debt to go to college? Do good in HS, get a scholarship at a state school, go there. You don't need some fancy Ivy shit unless you're going to wall street in which case you can pay the debt off real quick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even then, if it takes till 51 to pay it off then you didn't pick the right major. When you're borrowing money for college you need to make sure you're picking a program where you know you'll make enough money to pay it off quickly.

       Now that I've given it more thought, I can see that you're right, a lot of it comes down to financial choices. We had an air conditioner repairman come by a few months back, and he said he was making nearly 100k a year just four years out of vocational school.

       The student debt was probably a bad example, as well. My neighbor is an older white man, and I myself am Asian. It seems like the mentality of letting your child fend for themselves as soon as they turn 18 is mainly seen in America, which is kind of harmful imo.

       I'd like to think most 18 year olds are capable of making the right financial decisions for their future on their own. And those who aren't likely won't change.

       Hmm, I guess it is a little sad how high school had taught everyone around me to get to the best college possible...I feel like other perspectives, like vocational schooling or JROTC, are underrepresented. Maybe that will change when the next generation gets disillusioned with expensive universities.

       I'm 18 and lots of extremely smart people in my class chose scholarships over good schools. Probably a good thing since they all wanted to do STEM shit. Imo Ivies are a waste if you're not going into investment banking.

       Nah, I don't want to go too far from my home. My parents are worried about me cause I have asthma and food allergies, which I can understand. I have like a 4.0 GPA, 4.2 UC GPA, so I'm just applying to UCs. By some will of God, I scored a 36 on the act, so I'm not retaking it even though I got a 9 on the essay :V.
      </p>
      <p>
       My sister also applied to ivies with high everything and got rejected, so if I* really* want to go, I think I'll just transfer in once I improve my track record. I've never had all A's until last year, so I won't stand a chance against my classmates, some of which are still applying to ivies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hear the Haas school of business at UC Berkeley is also good for econ, and that's what my sister did, but she says those jobs have no room for personal growth. I'm probably going to major in math or computer science, and get one more degree based on whatever field is hot at the moment. Thanks for the advice, by the way.

       Good on the stats. Don't worry about your parents do what's best for you. You can get into Cornell or better with those stats though you might need to resort to ED. My friend got in Cornell with a 3.8 UW and 2270 SAT. You're an Asian in Cali so I'm assuming your parents can pay for it either way, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to transfer, Cornell and Vanderbilt (technically not Ivy but whatever) are your best bet for transfer-friendly schools that are good on the Street.

       My sister works for Citibank, in New York. I'm not to clear on what she does, but apparently it's important enough that she had to stay in New York for it? Idk. But she did tell me that she has started wondering how the people around her even got their jobs, so there's probably not much she could learn from them.

       This. People need to realize that a: not everyone needs to go to college, and b: if you do end up going, understand that you're paying to be there, and that's it. It doesn't entitle you to anything after you graduate, so unless you're independently wealthy and just going to learn something that interests you, you had better make sure that what you major in will get you a job in a market that has openings and will pay enough for you to live while paying off your loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kids these days think the world owes them something, so they should be able to go to college and party all the way through while majoring in something that either has an extremely competitive job market or low lifetime earnings, and once they finish and realize they're going to have to make sacrifices to pay the loan off it just proves that life is
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       unfair and something has to change, even though they should have expected this from the time they started college.

       Whoever told you life was fair and equal did you a big disservice. Poor choices lead to poor outcomes and good choices lead to good outcomes. I screwed myself over on my first two years of college and even flunked out. That was my fault, I learned from it and I’m doing a lot better. Even now I have no debt in school because I made a smart choice and joined the military to get my way paid. Your 51 year old neighbor made poor choices.

       No, it is not their fault if they are born poor. Just because people are born poor, doesn't mean other people should be forced to be born with less money. But they have years to fix it. It is unfortunate for people to be born into a poor family, but I think this is a reason people should think more philosophically in general. Would it be moral to have a kid knowing they will have to be poor? Many people that are poor or borderline living paycheck to paycheck are not just stuck there against their will.  I think people can control more than they think.

       Absolutely agree. A study was done that found most rich people (net assets over $1,000,000) are just average joes living In middle class neighborhoods who live frugally and own small businesses that they founded. Most people who inherit money end up losing it within 3 generations.
      </p>

       It's all about making sacrifices and working hard. Save your money and put all your effort into bettering yourself. Whether you start a business or work in retail, nothing is stopping you from being driven and willing to take initiative.

       Depends on the business plan.  I suggest start small if you plan to fund it yourself.  However you should always consider crowdsourcing options like Kickstarter.  There are also many funding options.  Banks today are giving money away so its a great time to start.

       I'm poor, the reason I'm poor is I bought dumb shit. Never really saved my income.Now once again jobless because of my own inabilities. At least now I can blame the actual problem which is me. My thinking, the way I don't respect money because I look down upon it, view as an evil thing. Money is just a tool, can't be evil. Yet some how I was lead to this conclusion. Might have been from the TV, might have been from my peers, or just from my parent. I don't know. But I know I came to the wrong conclusion. After some introspection my lack of respect for money, my lack of knowledge or rather willingness to balance my budget is the problem. But at the same time it doesn't end there. My habits, the way I consume things is the problem. The way I can only see the problems in my surroundings and not my own is a problem. The problem I make excuses instead of changes is the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       TO be honest I don't know how to change or where to start, but I know I need to.

       Hey man, just start putting a tiny bit away. Like 10 bucks a week. Sell off the high-ticket stuff you bought &amp; use the money, but put like anything into savings. Ditch your bank account and get up with a credit union which if free, but requires you to keep like 5 bucks in savings. When you get a job, go ahead and get direct deposit &amp; have a tiny percent deposited directly into savings. If you find you have a couple bucks left over from the previous pay period, come payday, go ahead and transfer that into savings too. Keep doing that forever until you have $500 in savings. Don't touch that money. Keep working &amp; adding to that no-spend account.

       Go thru your belongings &amp; do a major cull. Get rid of everything you haven't used or worn in the past year. Donate it. Get it to someone poorer than you and do it with a grateful mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
       File your taxes. Take every bit of the money (even if it's 3 bucks) you don't need &amp; sock it into savings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cook food at home, buy rice in bulk, get some seeds &amp; pots and start a salsa garden outside or near a sunny window. Take care of that shit &amp; freeze anything you can't eat right away. Give any over that to neighbors or friends. Don't eat out til you feel wealthy - not even fast food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cut your utilities &amp; electronics to nada. You can live off just your phone. Don't add luxury utilities back until you can afford to eat out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't even think of credit. Make it your goal to become a zero credit score. Carry cash only. Pack food &amp; water. Know that you have that spending cap &amp; if you need food, a drink, whatever beyond what you're carrying - you'll have to get your ass home before you can have it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make this happen as a form of self respect. It's massive suckage to be poor. Do everything you can possibly think of to keep that from being your norm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hang in there, friend. Money is not evil, but being poor sure as fuck is.

       It's been my norm for all my life, really but I've been getting my act together so to speak in the last few years trying to bring awareness to my own situation instead of neglecting it like I had been for so long. Thank you for the advice. I will look at the credit unions in my area, I haven't really thought about changing banks.

       You can do it bro. You acknowledge all your problems, which is the start.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deep down you know the solution, which is to do what you have to do. The hardest part is starting. Take any of the thing you posted and do something,
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       to change it, even a little. It doesn't take a master plan, it's momentum more than anything else. Just try to step outside your comfort zone.

       I see that ^ this post got downvoted, probably because people are thinking "oh sure, I'll just go buy a house, why didn't I think of that?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Another option for investing in real estate with a low cost of entry is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_investment_trust">
        REIT's
       </a>
       , or Real Estate Investment Trusts, it's just like buying stock, but instead of a company that makes products you're investing in a company that buys and sells real estate such as houses, apartment buildings, hospitals etc. So instead of buying a house, you'd be buying a fraction of multiple different properties.

       REIT's often pay nice dividends as well. My brother has his Netflix for free forever as long as the company stays at the average.  And it gives him a little bit more every year.

       What sarcasm, I'm serious. Look I've made poor decisions based on events that happened in my life. It really just comes down to whether or not if I'm willing to accept that. If I neglect to do any sort of self reflection and then actual change from that reflection. I won't be able to change my position in life. This is new understanding to me. Some people already have this figured out. Although I've tooken responsiblity for my actions in the past, i've never truly changed. I just continued to make the same mistakes over and over. Still yet.

       I've found literally forcing myself to do things especially when I'm feeling like you, that I feel so glad I got off my ass and did XYZ. I'm in the same situation and understand where your coming from. Changing yourself isn't easy if you don't really want to change. Sometimes finding something worth being motivated for is a good tactic too.

       Among other books, the Dave Ramsey total money make over changed our lives. Wife and I in 2005 were 22-24 trying to "play life".  Bought a house , had a kid, went into other debt and did other stupid stuff. By 2007-2008 we were going backwards $200-500 every month just to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had enough one day and read the book, listened to stories of people who sacrificed a few years of thier lives to live on rice and beans and maybe work 2-3 jobs.  We eventually came out of it and started paying cash for the things we bought, through those years of hard work a business blossomed and eventually supported us.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're still learning, few of us arrive , but there is hope.   With that said, even today is different, automation will be taking over more and more jobs.  If you're willing to work harder than anyone else you'll do ok.  That's really all any company wants.

       I'm poor and can relate with you on how you don't know how to change it. Have been below poverty-level my entire life, but when I was a kid, I didn't realize we were what society considered "poor" since my parents always worked 12hr days and provided for us--we never went without.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I became an adult and had my child (I'm a single mother and now 30yo), I worked minimum wage jobs until I got into college. I went for 2 1/2yrs, then a vast number of circumstances occurred with the program and my loans, and I was advised to drop out and re-enroll. 
I dropped, then they told me I couldn't re-enroll until I paid off what I owed the college itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was five years ago. 
I plan on going back as soon as I'm able to pay them off, but I've been unemployed since Sept, and have always been a penny-pincher. But, I live in a small rural town in TN. Little work is available, I drive a 1990 Tempo that's on its last legs, but I've put in at LEAST 100 apps in surrounding towns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a single call back or email. I've contacted them, but they haven't replied. 
And since I don't have a degree (although I attended long enough to be at the same educational level as an Associate's degree, esp since I took many business courses--it still doesn't count), no one even wants to interview me. My boyfriend and I have a plan(he is publishing his 5-book series), but said plan will not kick in until next fall, so that will at least help to get us on our feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it may sound mundane or ridiculous and I'm not going to make this into a religious/spiritual post, but I have the utmost faith that my family will come out on top, and those who fight for their place in this world will as well. I have to believe things will get better, it's all I know how to do anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'm just trying to learn how to survive until then, and let me tell you, I've been so broke that I didn't have a phone or hot water or a vehicle(at the same time) and was then kicked out of my old house, but now it feels more
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       than it did then. I guess it's because of the reality of my age (I'm not getting any younger) and the fact I have no way of investing any money, and just barely being able to pay basic bills is scaring the crap out of me since I don't want to get evicted. I don't ever want to relive the horror of that experience again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chin up, buddy. We are virtually in the same boat, but different circumstances. Back when I was 20-22, I had to learn how to cut back on my spending by not going out and only buying necessities and shopping at the thrift store for clothing. It can be done.
       <em>
        We can
       </em>
       get out of this mess. There were a few books mentioned on here, I'm going to check them out to see if they help. In the meantime, I'm just going to keep looking for a job until next year. That's the only way I know how to change my current circumstances, and through knowledge, I know we both can learn how to adapt and thrive in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       We cannot do it overnight. Just look at it as a work in progress. We may never become millionaires, and I honestly don't want to be. All I want is to get to a point where we aren't struggling, BUT if given the tools and resources through knowledge and the willpower to continue, you and I both will be light-years away from where we are today.

       Thank you for such a lengthy and heart felt response. It illicit a reaction in me to write. And I'd like the share the product of that inspiration with you. A message I was able to write to myself, and now share with you and others that care to read.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seek to find your self within yourself and you will find that in which you seek. But look to find yourself in the sea of others and you will forever be searching. When You say you are searching for yourself, this thing means nothing. For you have gone no where. You are you and will always be you. The actions you do, are just a part of you. But doesn’t equate to being you. There is no predefined version of you. No other can define you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are the sole person who can define yourself. So if you think yourself incapable then you will be so. If you think yourself worthless then it shall be. If you can shape the way you view yourself and there by so doing it will shape your reality. So do not ponder too hard on past mistakes. For there are lessons in mistakes but if you don’t not heed the lessons you are bound to repeat them. The guilt will compound and you will begin to hold ill views on yourself. So look at the mistakes in your life and see which keep popping up time and time again. Why do they keep reoccurring what lesson have you not learned? Kind of a riddle huh? But truly you are the only one who can teach yourself to change. No other can correct your mistakes. You, the individual you the awareness. You. If you ignore this fact then you are destine to not elevate yourself. You will forever be ignoring your own problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’ve nothing  in your way, so do some good stop being an asshole and feeling sorry. Start being and stop feeling. Start accepting that which you are. Be concise in the manner of which you up hold yourself.  Change your ways. Become yourself. Stop being what you think you should be, stop being what you think others want you to be. And just be. Just be yourself. You can’t be anything but that. So have faith in the things you do. If you are doing things you feel guilty about perhaps it isn’t something you really want to be doing in the first place. Correct the behavior that leads to self hate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Learn to communicate and be present in the now. Don’t retract yourself from the present moment when others are speaking, make eye contact and listen. You hide your gaze because you lack that ability to be grounded in the now. SO just do it. You will be able to follow the conversation more easily and understand it more fully. Bring your awareness to all situations. This is your life you should be present in the moments of it. IF you have your mind to far in the past or to ahead in the future you aren’t going to be  present for what is happening now. The things you do now are the seeds of the future. So if you remain present in the now you will be able to create that future and design it along each step.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how do you bring yourself out to the present moment? How can you do this? I mean you’ve been stuck in the past for so long, or so worried about your future or lack there of. That you haven’t even addressed what is right be fore you. You need to address it. No more putting it off, no more excuses or tomorrow. Because the fact of the matter is it is today. You are here right now. You can do something about it right now. SO why aren’t you? There is no valid excuse. Only things you accept, because it aligns with your thoughts. But you need to change the way you think. You need to be productive. You need to be proactive. Stop being reactive. You wait for things to happen instead of making things happen. Why? Seriously why do you not take action. You are afraid. You are afraid  but why? It will make life so much easier than it is now. Yet you refuse. You refuse because you have no faith in yourself. You don’t believe you can do it. Why? Who brought you down? Oh right you brought yourself down. Who can bring you backup? Who has to be the one to do it? You? Yes that is who.
      </p>
      <p>
       SO rise up out of the self hate and pity. You need some self love and respect. You are alive. You made some mistakes and you understand that those mistakes are yours. This is a positive this a great thing in life. You have the opportunity to change your life now. You just have to start. If you don’t start it will never happen. If you choose to ignore your problems continue to push it off on others and on circumstance then you will never change your life. This is true to anyone of any standing. Things change because of action, that action is backed by will. And it is in that essence our will can manifest reality. If you lack the will, then you will never be able to bring about the world in which you wish to see. You could only hope that another might envision something similar. You will critique it because it isn’t exactly how you want it to be. So why not try to enact your vision of the world. You know that you’ve a good heart and your vision of the world isn’t to see it burn. So try to bring it about. But if you do nothing You will be nothing, Your world will never look the way in which you want it to look and you will be bitter because of it. SO stop doing nothing, start doing something. You want to bring about change you want this world to be different well than do something about it. Because I guarantee nobody else is going to have your vision of the world but you. They might share aspects of your world. But it wont be the same. SO bring about that inner world that is in your mind. Share it with others. Let people be able to expand it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the end of it. Thank you for the inspiration. Might just be babbling but needed to get it out.

       Between hospital bills, cost of living, random accidents and such, people can go bankrupt for apparently no reason. While it doesn't happen to every generation. Inevitably it will happen and anything you secured for your family will inevitably be lost.

       What do you mean by wealth though? If you saved three million expect that to be dispersed between two families, your children. Now 1.5 million. We know that their kids, maybe if your lucky only one each but not as successful as you. It's slowly disappears.

       This is the way economics work.  It's a shame people think they need to go to college and have car which require loans and holds them down.  An honest critique of the system is when lawmakers are influenced by rich people, which happens 70%+ of the time.  Another critique I have is when global companies and foreign work take over your local markets.  There are other schemes that hurt the average person in areas, but you can't just blame rich people.

       Costco, you're all poor compared to Chinese millionaires.  New Zealand closed it's borders to outside purchase of real estate, Canada's considering it next.  Whether you shop at Trader Joe's or Walmart, you're a tiny degree away from poor being buried alive like Superman's girlfriend in that car scene.  China owns the manufacturing market and until we stop sending away productive jobs that could have made American products well and restored our reputation, you'll be getting poorer by the day, bootstrap guy.

        It's expensive to be poor.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes it is. It's not just a lack of money that screws poor people. It's the fact that there are myriad fees on being poor, from late payment fees to high interest rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poor people generally can't afford regular doctor visits, so their health suffers to the point where serious medical intervention is necessary, which is very expense. If the poor people can't pay to keep themselves alive, they go into extreme debt. Their credit suffers, which makes getting a car or a job or an apartment/house much more difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Society would benefit if we helped keep the poor afloat so that in their desperation they don't turn to crime, as well.
      </p>

       Automation is increasingly making low-skill jobs scarce that would ordinarily be available to poor people.

       They were both probably white men from a decent public school system. Usually you are born into poverty and homelessness. It's harder to fall then it is to rise. For me, I could throw everything I have away, go out the next day and get a job after a few visits and be back on my feet. Not a lot of people are that lucky. They weren't raised to have critical thinking skills, they were raised to turn to drugs, drinking, or violence. They never had a luxury, something like snacks to eat or the freedom to explore.

       I can't stand the camp of homeless people that has popped up suddenly in my neighborhood. They are disgusting. They use to come to the gas station where I work and use our bathroom to use and hide their drugs and drug paraphernalia, use our parking lot as a meeting place to buy and/or sell drugs, harass our customers for money, or just harass any and everyone because they are fucking tweeting hard and often become violent. We, the employees, have done what we could to stop them from stepping foot on the premises by calling the police and having them trespasses.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish there was more that could be done to flush them out of the neighborhood for good though. They leave trash everywhere, piss and shit everywhere, constantly beg and harass people for money and/or drugs, or they are currently on drugs and have become paranoid everyone is out to get them. When that happens, it's scary. It's happened to me a few times. Minding my own business and then suddenly a dirty, drugged up homeless person gets in my face threatening to kill me because they believe I want to kill them or whatever. And it's not like you can talk these people down to a calmer state of mind. They steal from surrounding businesses and are destructive.
      </p>
      <p>
       These homeless people don't want help to get off the streets. It's becoming a trend and keeps getting worse. And it makes it very difficult for the true homeless that want and need help. But because you got these ever increasing camps of homeless people that want nothing more to get high and harass people and are dirty and disgusting, I, and a bunch of other people, now ignore any and all homeless people seen on the streets. I'm sick of stepping over their shit, getting harassed, putting up with their drug fueled paranoia, picking up after them, chasing them off private property, constantly having to watch my back wherever I go, and listening to their fake sob stories to emotionally manipulate people to give them money.

       It's a big problem in austin as well.  Because we are so welcoming to the homeless (shelters and housing assistance) we have a huge homeless population. So the more taxes we spend on helping them, the more they flood in.  Which tells us the problem runs deeper. It comes down to societal and mental health problems

       Same here in Denver. Lax drug laws (not weed, I'm talking hard shit) has caused many homeless to settle here. Now no matter what night of the week it is, you can expect to see massive amounts of drug addicts in the same areas. I think cops patrol certain areas and only allow the zombies to congregate in commercial areas with no houses around. It almost feels like police have given up enforcing drug laws here.

       The war on drugs is a failure, enforcing it is just a waste of money. The money spent imprisoning a homeless drug addict would be much better spent helping that person instead.

       I haven't seen anything backing it up but form what I've seen homelessness seems to be a much bigger problem in the Southwest and west coast than on the east coast. Sure I've seen homeless people in NYC and Philly but they werent everywhere and as violent and crazy as they seem to be out here in ABQ. But that might also just be because I have to assume that NYC police are just better than anyone down here because they have to be.

       A lot of it depends on the location of the shelters. For instance, Jacksonville has homeless shelters downtown where it is easy for them to panhandle by day and have the opportunity for food and shelter at night. They congregate there and it gets quite sketchy after dark. Tallahassee has most of them way out to the west side so downtown doesn't get bogged down.

       I am all for supporting the poor and getting them on their feet again but don't make it easy for them to abuse the system.

       I’m not saying that, but when I was hanging and skating with some homeless kids, they were pulling in 100-200 a day. People would give them a cart full of groceries, they’d send someone to go stash and keep it going.

       I realize it's been a while but I want to hot you up. I'm not stupid or ignorant. I've just been unfortunate enough to be in a position where I can understand what those less fortunate than us may be in. I realize wish you could too but you seem more like the see no evil type. I hope I'm wrong though. Try to imagine what living like that is like and who would willingly choose to do so.

       Sure, but sometimes it is factors completely out of your hands. Huge medical bills for one that force you to sell your home and live in your car, mental illness can stop someone from being able to keep a steady job, the current opioid crisis also.

       Sure there are bad-luck set backs. We've all had them. I've had plenty. But most of the factors are daily choices to do stupid, self-destructive shit like drug use. Or daily choices to do stupid, time-wasting shit like recreation instead of investing in your ability to earn more money.

       Take someone studying for school every day vs. someone smoking pot every day and I can tell you which one is more likely to end up with mental illness and homeless in 10-20 years.

       You say "opioid crisis" and I hear drug addict. It's only a crisis if you think people are unable to make their own choices.

       Anyone who knows about the so called "opioid epidemic", which is really just escapism and drug seeking behavior.  Or anyone who knows that doctors get a kickback from narcotic suppliers for prescribing their drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last year, I broke my right foot, and the pain was immense.  The GP gave me 4 Oxys to hold me until I could see the specialist (1.5 days later, yay non-socialized medicine!) and after taking the first, I had had enough.  It was better to hurt than to feel disconnected from your body.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the ortho doctor offered me 6 WEEKS of oxys I actually asked him if he was a real doctor.  I requested tramidols instead, and stopped taking them after about 2 weeks.  Yea, it hurt, and I'm not super man, so I was a baby about it, but it was better than some doctor getting me hooked on faux-heroin and then keeping me as a "pain clinic patient" until I die, or graduate to real-heroin.

       Okay, maybe more people are aware of it now and don't necessarily trust everything a doctor prescribed. But the Opiod crisis has only been common knowledge for a couple years at most. These opiates have been being prescribed for a LONG time,  long before the link between prescriptions and heroin use was ever established.

You can't, unless you are educated on it ahead of the time you are in a car accident, or start having chronic pain that doesn't let you work. Thankfully these past couple years that education has started working, but the addiction crisis was created before we learned about it. It's easy to avoid when you have Captain Hindsight and haven't yet started taking the drugs.

       You've obviously never dealt with everyday mind numbing pain. The kind where you can't walk or sit or lay down without screaming a bit in your own head. You think your foot pain is comparable? Look up Hidradenitis Suppurativa

       If that's the case, there's something wrong with you that pain meds won't fix.  If pain meds are the only thing keeping you alive, then it doesn't matter if you're addicted then does it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, being addicted to anything is a choice.

       This just represents that the problem is on both sides. Why the hell should a doctor give anyone oxys for a broken foot? These were drugs designed for cancer patients with extreme pain, but now they are being handed out for the simplest things. There are so many weaker drugs he could have given you, why start all the way near the top of the pain killer chart? Probably because he's so used to people coming and asking for oxys that he just prescribes them now anyway, figuring thats what people just take now. Most addicts know they are addicts and go out seeking the drugs. The doctors may make it easier to get them, but the people are the ones pushing for them.

       I've been prescribed opiates for recovery from surgery, injury, car accidents. I never finish the prescription. I stop when the pain is tolerable. I'm familiar with the effect, but prefer to keep my head clear.

       I have been making six figures per year for the past ten years. Never tried cocaine or other illegal drugs. I realize this is an anecdotal correlation, but it works for me. I'm still investing time learning more skills and well on my way to earning seven figures per year.

       That doesn't matter. There are enough factors in your control that you can turn it around unless you are completely disabled and then Uncle Sam takes care of you so you still have to be a huge pos to end up on the street.

       I can say that its a combination of whats happening in USA right now. Abuse of H1B visas to bring in educated foreign workers at lower wages, due to high taxes in USA and highly competitve global market, mainly from Asia, illegal invaders from South America taking low education jobs and social programs that literally cut North Amwrican citizens out of what few jobs that might be available.

       Americans don't want to do that work. By and large we're too lazy.  When Alabama started enforcing no hiring of illegal immigrants the crops they had rotted in the fields.  How many Americans will go work 8 hours or more a day in the heat, picking fruit for .75 cents a barrel?

       Our agricultural industry is built on cheap, illegal labor.  But they will do it as they have nothing in their home country.

       I guess I should have quoted the section "illegal invaders from South America taking low education jobs"  to show that I was referencing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you mention is something that is abused. Companies go through loopholes, like placing ad's in tiny circulation papers, to show that they intend to hire American, then remove them and use H1B's.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is definitely an issue. And one that I feel needs to be fixed. Not just in IT, (and I'm marginally employed in that at the moment) but in hospitality and certain finance institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we also need to get more detailed and competitive education standards in our country. So we can compete against them in our global economy.

       As far as I'm concerned, the H1B visa program needs to be ended, and replaced with absolutely nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason H1B is "necessary" is because employers
       <em>
        CHOOSE

       not to compete on pay/benefits.

       They are refusing to engage the employment marketplace as it stands, choosing instead to lobby congress to get a "cheaper option" - so they don't have to increase the wages they are paying Americans.

       But if we helped the poor so they wouldn't be in debt, "cause problems", turn to crime, then the politicians and activist/charity groups etc. wouldn't have a reason to exist and talk about how good they are trying to fix the problems they help create and maintain!

       Poor people pay high interest not because bankers are greedy, but because poor people often don't pay off loans. Therefore, they are charged a risk premium for borrowing money. This isn't mean, cruel or exploitative. It's just business. If banks did not charge high interest premiums for loans to poor people (or were prohibited by legislation) then lending to poor people would not be profitable and no one--NO ONE--would put their money at risk lending to poor people. Then poor people would truly be fucked when they needed credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for turning to crime, this is another example of short-term thinking. Don't have money? Why study and invest in yourself when you can just take money from someone? Won't that piss them off? Who cares? I might not get caught. Win for me! Crime is the ultimate self-indulgent short-term stupidity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to be poor. I used to really resent the high interest rates. Now I have more money than I need (for the short-term) and a crazy high credit score. Banks compete to loan money to me by offering lower and lower interest rates.

       Debt is slavery and people make bad decisions by buying things they can't afford with credit.

        If you can't pay for it in cash, you can't afford it.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       A common way "rich people make money by having money" is due to compound interest. Interest is earned and if left in place, your original $ plus interest earned will make even more interest next cycle making the money "grow."
      </p>
      <p>
       The opposite is true when you make a bad decision and use credit for something you can't afford. But instead of the money making more money, the debt is creating more debt on itself.

        A common way "rich people make money by having money" is due to compound interest. Interest is earned and if left in place, your original $ plus interest earned will make even more interest next cycle making the money "grow."

       Interest isn't some magical thing that "just happens".  There is an underlying financial process that generates returns on capital at work.

       Calling debt "slavery" demonstrates a lack of understanding of how the system works.  Show me a wealthy person who got there without debt.

       Correct. I oversimplified the concepts in my post in an attempt to match the tone of the OP.

       Debt is a form of slavery. It keeps you on the work/spend treadmill.

       my roommate and I calculated the cost of getting a washer/dryer vs. going to the laundromat for a year.  Laundromat was way more expensive, not even factoring gas or our time going there, or the possibility of getting our clothes stolen or whatever.  Its just you have to have that initial bit of money to get the washer and dryer.

       Best way I've ever heard it described was in Terry Pratchett's Discworld book, Men at Arms:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.
       </p>
       <p>
        Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       I agree and a lot has to be done to invest in education.

      <p>
       $40k year tuition for everyone is America isn't feasible. But trade school and other training programs are great.

      <p>
       There's a lot of ways to climb out of poverty and a lot of trades. HVAC, plumber, electrician, pharmacists with relatively low costs OR no training costs, but you start out at like $12 when you're starting as a plumbing apprentice.
      </p>
      <p>
       They'll take care of you and provide benefits, but many Americans are too lazy/entitled to do any of that. They want a low-skill high-paying job which are all gone. Or they want it in destitute economic dead zones where jobs have left.

       I see most of my friends buying brand new range rovers, and getting insane mortgages for houses to show off. It's the materialism ego that keeps them in great debt. Then they think they're hot shit because they're willing to borrow more money from the bank. I'd rather live modestly and find happiness in things that are free, that way my money can go to actual investments.

       Nice book suggestions, but how many people do you know who actually read books regularly?
      </p>
      <p>
       And by read I mean
       <em>
        genuinely
       </em>
       read, not just flick through a few chapters and then put on the shelf.
      </p>
      <p>
       It reminds of a relatively-unknown (but legitimate)
       <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/hkI9W">
        Aldous Huxley quote
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Good on you for reading. You are probably much further ahead of the curve than you realise.

       It's funny that you say that because my wife and I were heading to the bookstore today, and one of her friends started calling us losers and nerds for it. She didn't think we were serious!

       I know what you're saying but my point is that people stretch themselves out so thin to where every dime made goes to some needless 'thing', all in the name of impressing others, not because they're vehicle enthusiasts. Some of them act like they're better than others because of it.

       You don;t have to read that stuff. Just put all your money into your 401K. Hold 20-30k in cash for emergencies and the rest = 401k or investments in another account.

       Well the goal in Rich Dad, Poor Dad is to get out of the whole 401k rat race. The idea is that you invest in assets. Assets that pay you an income. For example, starting out with a few rental properties, then moving up to apartment complexes. Minimal work is required to do this and you can basically retire while the cash flow keeps rolling in.
      </p>
      <p>
       If filling up a 401k is the goal, you have to slave away at a 9 to 5 until your golden years to have enough for retirement. By then, who knows what will happen in life.

I was living in a shitty little apartment before that, barely scraping by. With your kind of thinking, you'll stay in the rat race.

       It is in the sense that once you're set up with a tenant, you do nothing while gaining equity and positive cash flow every month. It really doesn't get any easier. This is all done with the banks money.

       I see. Like all the GFC "landlords" who bought rental property on the assumption they'd have to "do nothing", then costs arose, realized they couldn't

        actually

       If they don't pay on time, you kick them out. I've done it, it's not a big deal. As for the other costs, you use the capital from the rent to save up for that stuff. Jeez man, you're acting like this is so hard and complicated when it's really just like running a simple business. It's all about selecting the right tenant.

        I see. Like all the GFC "landlords" who bought rental property on the assumption they'd have to "do nothing", then costs arose, realized they couldn't actually afford to be a landlord, went bankrupt and blamed the banks.

       Costs can arise in any business venture. Of course there are risks involved. If everyone always took the easy way, accumulation of wealth would be non existent. I guess you think I should just slave away at a 9 to 5 hey.

       I have no reason to lie. Ive been investing in real estate now for 6 years, is that long enough for your standards? In that time I've accumulated alot of wealth that I'd otherwise not have. I could sell it all right now and pay off my house and still have some left over, and I'm in my early 30s. How many people who started with zero can say that? An overwhelming majority of people never pay off their mortgage. So for you to say real estate is a bad investment is fucking laughable to me. You reddit armchair investment gurus kill me lmao.

       I take issue with the claims Robert Kiyosaki (and you, perhaps) make about real estate returns, which isn't what both economic data and theory says.

       If you describe the duties of being a landlord as "doing nothing", then no.

       "Doing nothing" means going to the bank, borrowing money and buying a house. If I add up the time it took me to do everything and get a tenant in, it equaled less than an 8 hour shift of work. I visit the properties once every quarter to inspect and repair anything and that's it. Otherwise I collect a monthly check, some of it cash in my pocket, some to equity, the rest to cover other costs. Now I have multiple people building equity for me, and it's the banks money to begin with.

My whole point here is that saying there's no "answer" to the question "how do I build wealth". Hard work, luck and circumstance are what matter, not the investment vehicle.

       Yes I agree to a point. There are people out there who can do what ive done who won't because they think it is too hard or they're too lazy.

       I was poor once. I worked hard and now I have a nice home, nest egg, and yes, my money is making me money in mutual funds and equities. About 34 years ago, when I was dirt poor living in a rooming house, I had an awakening. I realized that there is no separation between me and my experience, and that I could create experience through mental and physical action. I learned how to hold a vision in my mind, and then take action towards manifesting it. I believe we all have this power. I think it's best to empower rather than create things that essentially tell the poor that there is no way out. Sure there is.

       Being self made today vs 30 years ago is a completely different journey, much due to rapidly increasing scarcity, and the rich basically holding a monopoly as an aggregate. For example, housing is skyrocketing in Northern California; I went to an open house in prospect of maybe buying a house to live in and start a family. But, I got there, and its a dozen other people throwing around the weight of money they've already made off investment properties, to then buy this property, turn around and rent it for $1k+ on top of the mortgage cost to those who aren't able to penetrate into the "homeowners club".

       Your beliefs form your personal reality. If one wants to own a home, then maybe Northern Ca. is not the place to be. Plenty of places with affordable homes. Probabilities come into play. At 5'8" and 58 years old, I can dream of being the center for the LA Lakers, but it won't happen no matter how hard I practice. Owning a home is likely for almost anyone, if they hold the vision and act towards it. It takes continuous action, and also being open to opportunities that present themselves. I don't believe in scarcity, and also don't present that picture or belief system to other people's minds.

       It's still probable if you choose to stay where you are and create a reality in which you have a community of loved ones. If owning a home is something you desire, just hold the vision and get moving toward it, while accepting the details of the present as they are. With each action it becomes more probable. The creative orientation is a wonderful place to be.

       Being self-made today is the same as 30 years ago and 30 years before that. Now as then, people who believe they are victims and require special assistance are not going to make it. Those who bust their ass and invest in themselves will rise above.

       This post could only have been made out of complete ignorance with regard to the current economic climate, wage prices, inequality indices, and the relationship of earnings to CPI to property prices over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The capacity of the average person, starting from nothing, to be "self made" is
       <em>
        completely
       </em>
       different from thirty years ago. If you'd like evidence,

       's some longitudinal research about housing affordability vs CPI in my country, and

        here

       are some data about wage growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you'd like to argue that things are "the same as 30 years ago" then you're more than welcome, but the evidence is against you and I think you'd have a pretty tough row to hoe. Why not actually engage with the economic data, rather than just spouting platitudes?

       Buddy, that’s beside the point. You made it, sure. But 99 other poor people worked just as hard as you, but didn’t make it. There is a limited number of slots at the top, and you got lucky and snagged one. That’s the point. By letting the occasional person win the lottery, so to speak, it justifies the whole system, but we all know the lottery is a scam.

       What make you think I'm at the top? I have many friends with whom I grew up with in lower to middle class families that now own homes, have money in the bank, and who have
       <em>
        created
       </em>
       nice lives for themselves and their families. None of us are
       <em>
        elite
       </em>
       or part of the 1% that people vilify so much. I don't buy into the narrative that everyone but that 1% are somehow impoverished and living horrible lives void of creativity, love, adventure, fun, etc...in some dark Orwellian nightmare in which we're all oppressed by a group of fascists, leaving us without any freedom. I don't buy it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've
       <em>
        created
       </em>
       my life to be what it is through imagination and action, and being frugal and not getting in debt. For the last 34 years I've dedicated myself to living in a creative orientation, not a reactive one. I don't worry about money because I didn't spend more than I made. I lived within my means, and invested the extra in safe vehicles available to anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all quite simple. You get what you focus on, and your beliefs about yourself and the world shape your life and are usually the limiting factors in terms of your imagination and vision-making and actions. If I believe in an Orwellian nightmare in which everyone but the so-called 1% has no chance to
       <em>
        create
       </em>
       a rewarding, worthwhile life, then I most likely will
       <em>
        create
       </em>
       that world and live accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a great disservice to others to try to make them believe that they have no chance in life. That the limitations are so great they can never have a fulfilling life. Rather, if one really wants to create a different world, then one should dedicate one's self to waking people up to their creative powers. To the vast pool of creative energy available to them in the present. Which is very real. There is no space between me and my experience. No separation. I'm responsible for most of what I experience due to action or inaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all have the power to create experience. Every one of us.

       <em>

       were lucky.  I didn’t say you were a millionaire. But you said you got out of poverty, and I’m saying that 99 other people just as good as you also tried and failed. You aren’t special, sorry.

       I'm not special. That's my point. This creative power is available to everyone. What's so lucky about making good decisions? That power is available to me and everyone. What's so lucky about saving up to buy a home?
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was poor, after I had left home, and was struggling, I didn't realize the power of my actions. I was asleep. I made poor decision after poor decision. I stayed poor because of them. I stayed messed up on alcohol because of my decisions. I stayed lonely because of how I treated people. I stayed poor because I spent more money than I made, which there is only one way to do that: debt. No one can save money if they're paying more for a dollar than a dollar can make in some kind of interest-bearing investment vehicle.
      </p>
      <p>
       After my awakening, and taking responsibility for my current experience, the world I had created, I moved forth in a creative manner with a vision, one step at a time, keeping a moral and ethical framework. This ability to act is available to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't buy the 99 out of 100 perception and belief system that some hold. Millions and millions of people create good lives for themselves, because they took responsibility for their experiences and took action in the present that made that reality more probable. They might not be millionaires, as I am not one, but they live good lives. Should I as a 58 year old tell a youngster that they have no chance, that this is all a random crapshoot, and if you aren't lucky, you'll always be poor? No. Because it's not true. To do so would be irresponsible. My words are actions. My actions create waves. Why would I want to create a wave of despair?
      </p>
      <p>
       I find that there are many posts that try to solidify the belief that we are all oppressed and that the answer is to go to some kind of war with the 1% or anyone who is rich, instead of looking to one's self and shifting to a creative orientation in which one takes the responsibility in creating a new experience for themselves. It's my responsibility to speak to something completely different that is actually real.

       Actually, you keep saying I'm special due to your own perception and belief. I haven't said that, especially when I've written that millions of others have gone from little money to eventually owning a home and having a good life. They understand vision and creative action---millions and millions understand this--all a person has to do is look around and see this--someone is living in all those millions of homes.
      </p>
      <p>
       A poor person
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       stop being poor. It happens all the time. Why would I ever write something that basically says that a poor person is trapped forever in their current experience, when I know it isn't true?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were to go up to a poor person and say "don't even try. There is no way out," it would be a violation on my part as it is an attempt to keep someone asleep to their own powers of vision and creative action--to keep them poor. It's one of the worst things a person can do to another--to make them believe that the limitations are so great that they should give up on themselves and just do nothing about it.

        “The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

       <p>
        Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

       Walmart actually does this from both sides of the equation because they also underpay wages, break unionization attempts and offer shitty or no health insurance so the state has to step in and cover the costs when something catastrophic happens.

       Walmart is a great job if you are a kid, living at home, using your parent's health care plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you think it's a career you can raise a family under, you're participating in some seriously wishful thinking and should really get some new skills so you can get a better job.

       I do not begrudge Walmart its hiring practices.

       Problem is in a lot of places there aren't "better jobs" and generally if you're from a poor background you're not in a position to upskill.
      </p>
      <p>
       You get a job, any job so can help you're folks make the rent and buy food and maybe just maybe put some money aside for a rattler.

       Except the real reason that the boots lasted ten years is because the rich man took care of them because he bought the best boots money could buy and was proud of them. He cleaned the salt and slime off of them when he got home. He had the heel fixed as soon as he was aware it was a problem. He conditioned the leather once a month.
       <br/>
       The "poor" man will do none of these things then proclaim it's not his fault; he just can't afford the expensive boots that last.

Yes that is the point, a poor person couldn't do that. It also costs money and time to maintain those boots, of which poor people are generally in short supply.

       One way to think about it is like a garden .  A flower begins to sprout and grows taller , has larger pedals and therefore gets more rain , more sun etc... while keeping the others in its shadows with less opportunity to grow . The bigger the flower grows , the more opportunity and easier it is for its growth , and harder and harder as the shadow gets bigger over the rest .

       IPL defines poverty as "the absolute number of those living on $1 per day or less."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Given the fact that with most "communist" countries like the Soviet Union are gone, and almost every country in the world has a system of capitalism set up, how do you explain the fact that by 2014 1.5 billion people were living on a dollar a day or less?
       </strong>
       Compare this to 1987 when it was 1.2 billion.

       This has been deliberated to death. You've already made your mind up, I don't care to try to convince you otherwise. Socialism/communism doesn't work, capitalism can be awful for some, but it works overall.

       all I asked for was an explanation as to why you think capitalism works overall when: 
a) most countries in this world, at the core of their economy, are capitalist societies
      </p>
      <p>
       and b) you only mentioned 2 "communist/socialist" countries out of the 195 countries that exist today, yet you say that capitalism gets rid of poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
       if those two facts get to you, think them over. You also seem like the type of person who has your mind already made up!

       I'm at work for fuck sake. Do you seriously expect the rest of the world to NEET around all day waiting to argue about he merits of the rest of is supporting the unemployment class? Yes, I believe that social welfare is required, no I don't believe in equal outcomes. Capitalist countries with a safety net that prevents people from dying in the streets are ideal.

       I mean, it sounds like we agree on this point at least.

       But to be fair, you did ask me to look at the poverty reduction worldwide over the past 30 years, and I did, and found that capitalism does not = less poverty. You haven't even provided sources or examples, just opinions. There is nothing dishonest about what I am saying, but it sounds like you're mad the facts don't agree with how you see things.

       Capitalist countries with safety nets depend on capitalist countries like China and India where goods are produced cheap enough for you to buy them. The moment that poverty in these countries goes down, the price of their produce will increase and you will no longer be able to afford it. Capitalism not only encourages but trived on regionalized poverty.

      <p>
       Abolish it and you abolish capitalism.

       Your so dumb, of course folks living on 1$ a day is increasing, most families that poor have 4-8 kids, which is why fertility rates are so high in many sub Saharan and Asian countries. The worlds population grows by a billion every 15 years... why wouldn't the number of impoverished grow, it's not like there is world peace and economic security worldwide. why don't you go look at a country like South Korea, which went from a poor agricultural country on par with North Korea to a 1st world, prosperous industrialized country in a capitalist system.

       I'm sure that even though China is one of the five "official" communist countries that still exists, he discounts them as being "truly communist" because they have a successful economy.

       Every successful communist or socialist country is actually really a secret capitalist country and every failed capitalist country wasn't using "real" capitalism.

       ITT: lots of self made people who think that all poor people are just bad with money. I know lots of sick people who don’t fall below the poverty line but live paycheck to paycheck trapped in jobs they hate just because they need the insurance, and they’re still accumulating shit tons of medical debt every year because that’s how chronic illness works. I’m not saying there aren’t poor people who are poor because they’re bad with money. Of course there are. But there are plenty of flaws in the system too.

       Being poor is a consequence of short-term thinking. Spending time and money on instant gratification or immediate issues, instead of investing time and money into long-term problems or gains.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see this over and over again. People buying entertainment and luxuries with money they don't have, burning time on those things and paying off interest on their debt... instead of studying, saving and working their way into a higher income job.

       Okay, here is another example. Poor people buy coffee at Starbucks or buy a $100 coffee maker and schlup it from home for 1/10th the cost?

       If you want to get out of the poor house, you stop spending money on high mark-up luxuries like starbucks, cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, etc. and save your cash.

       Every bank does this now! If there is no minimum amount held and a direct deposit they rape your ass for fees. Then the overdraft fees on top of it which compound daily if there is a mistake made. They literally make money on overnight loans with our money and charge us to hold our money with the laws making you a criminal if you deal with cash. End game on poor people in Merica and we keep letting the rapists get a way with it!

       I was near-poor for the whole 20 years of my working life. Then I married and my wife had a few hundred thousand that we used to invest in the markets while I worked to help save up for a house. It went so well that I retired within 2 years and now we're millionaires. I've never had it easier. You need money to make money. And it's 50 times easier to do than working a regular job. Sorry if that's depressing but it's what I've discovered through experience.

       In the world of finance 20 or so companies, called "axes" move the stock market every which way. Day traders and others know they often disguise themselves. They largely influence how things go on any particular time period.

       You can make money whether the stock goes up or down. Making money off a stock when it falls is called shorting (put if you take an option, another method of trading).
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't need a relative lot of money to make money, but you'll need knowledge of how it works. It's expensive to be poor when your educated into dependence. This is, to borrow the title of a great documentary, a rich man's trick.

       Your money only makes you income if you have a business, rental property, or stocks that pay dividends. Owning things, in and of itself, isn't necessarily profitable, although rich people tend to buy a lot of stocks and real estate, neither of which go up forever but both of which tend to be popularly sought after in the market.

       I'm "poor" now, but I'm focusing on education, I have less than $1K debt, and I will flip homes and invest in rental property so in the future, the only thing I'll have to worry about finding tenants who aren't poor.

       You never really own anything even if you are "rich". Unless you hit the lotto or are a billionaire, you're probably getting loans for things like cars and houses still. They use words like you "own" your house, but does it really matter whether you're paying the landlord or the corporate mortgage lender?

       that's pretty much how life works. It's called "compounding" in economics and it results in the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. It's why 100% free market capitalism doesn't work nor libertarianism. Poor guy can be more talented and harder working than rich kid but if rich kid doesn't have to work or struggle to survive he's going to go a lot further in life unlike poor guy who has to work 2 jobs to pay rent.

       In Australia we have a lot of old people who got wealthy off of booming real estate. Unlike millennials, the baby boomers had easy access to large houses on decent sized blocks close to the city 50 years ago but today those same houses cost millions of dollars. The oldies now have the capital to invest and buy up all the surrounding houses causing real estate to sky rocket thereby pushing out the millennials from ever owning a house in a decent area. And when the market crashes the oldies won't lose anything other than excessive profit from their investments whilst the millennials will have to declare bankruptcy because their only property has big fuck off mortgage on it.
      </p>

       Regulations put into place by governments help curtail this. They put stamp duty on purchases to discourage speculative investing (it didn't).

       You do not have to pay anything to play and once you reach 10USD you can cash out through PayPal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quick Summary
You play in rounds where you predict different plays/scores/outcomes during live sports games. You are given two options - a yes or no and each has accompanying odds. You play in rooms with up to 20 people with the top ~8 players getting paid in cash or tokens. Each game seems to have levels – you can enter a free room with lower payouts and paid rooms with higher payouts. You can win tickets from competing in free rooms to enter the paid rooms and try to win a bit of money. Questions usually popup with a change of position in football or every ~5ish minutes for basketball, with an accompanying notification. This means you do not have to be on your phone constantly, so you can multitask quite easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tips (aka reasons to use my ref link)
Use the tickets you win from free rooms to enter higher payout rooms that require a ticket pay-in
Watch the game! For example, a prediction for “Will the play be overturned?” is much easier if you are watching the game.
In free play rooms, enter the room a few minutes after the start of the quarter. The number of people in the room will be less and it will take longer to fill up, letting you get in a few predictions while you compete with less players making it easier to win!
Play in the mid-tier room to win a decent number of tickets before going into the high-tier room. Payouts in the high-tier room are great but even if you do well you do not win very many tickets.
Look at the ongoing tournaments and enter them! They have high payouts relative to the normal game.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why Does WinView Pay? You get a few bonus points for watching ads and PepsiCo seems to be funding most of the business right now with the intent on moving the service to a live betting system where everyone has to pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       (HOWEVER, it is still free to enter and will be free for the foreseeable future)
Once you have 50 tickets you can play in the money rooms. The setup is exactly same. The only difference is you can win money and tickets. First place in a football room wins $8 unless there is a tie. In which case, it is a dollar less as the 1st and 2nd place pot is split.

       It even comes down to everyday things like not being able to buy toilet paper and other consumer goods in bulk to save on per unit costs and buying cheap work boots instead of better quality ones that will last longer and in the end cost less.
      </p>
      <p>
       These things along with late fees, account deficit fees, other associated financial punishments for not having money on time, poor eating due to financial constrictions, I'll health due to poor eating, over work, stress and other factors. It seems as though the poor are locked on an inescapable cycle of poverty and deprivation that begins at birth and ends at death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a baby born into the cycle with a lowered chance of a good education, little access to good nutrition, growing up in a neighbourhood with less community amenities, less support networks to achieve, and couple that with being surrounded by others of various generations who are also caught in the cycle. It's no wonder they seem to go through life with a metaphorical ball and chain attached to their ankles.

       Your beliefs form your personal reality. If one wants to own a home, then maybe Northern Ca. is not the place to be. Plenty of places with affordable homes. Probabilities come into play. At 5'8" and 58 years old, I can dream of being the center for the LA Lakers, but it won't happen no matter how hard I practice. Owning a home is likely for almost anyone, if they hold the vision and act towards it. It takes continuous action, and also being open to opportunities that present themselves. I don't believe in scarcity, and also don't present that picture or belief system to other people's minds.

       Absolutely agree. A study was done that found most rich people (net assets over $1,000,000) are just average joes living In middle class neighborhoods who live frugally and own small businesses that they founded. Most people who inherit money end up losing it within 3 generations.
      </p>

       It's all about making sacrifices and working hard. Save your money and put all your effort into bettering yourself. Whether you start a business or work in retail, nothing is stopping you from being driven and willing to take initiative.

       Being self-made today is the same as 30 years ago and 30 years before that. Now as then, people who believe they are victims and require special assistance are not going to make it. Those who bust their ass and invest in themselves will rise above.

       As far as I'm concerned, the H1B visa program needs to be ended, and replaced with absolutely nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason H1B is "necessary" is because employers
       <em>
        CHOOSE
       </em>
       not to compete on pay/benefits.

       They are refusing to engage the employment marketplace as it stands, choosing instead to lobby congress to get a "cheaper option" - so they don't have to increase the wages they are paying Americans.
      </p>
