They used the same tactic used by the DNC to screw Bernie Sanders out of the nomination in 2016. Politics has become a disaster. I am now a Libertarian and an American!!!
Now I think all politicians should be removed from office and jailed, at the least and tarred and feathered at the most.They are stealing from us, the American people. What can we do???? Vote them all out!!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do. It depends on the state. In my state I can vote in either primary. But not both. That&#39;s really fair. Personally I think parties should not be able to use the state voting systems. They are private clubs. The primaries don&#39;t really matter anyway. At the convention they can vote for anyone they want to. They follow the voters but they don&#39;t have to. And at the convention there&#39;s a lot of politics involved where delegates will change their vote. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be nice! I think the internet really died when the facebooks and googles took on an active role instead of providing pure service. When IPOs for garbage apps became a thing and controlling the narrative became the focus rather than it being an empty table for the user(s) to fill on their own. I call it &quot;web 3.0&quot; and consider the slick, featureless mobile-friendly UIs(which look nice on small touch screens but offer no actual usability or options) the death knell. Now we are no longer active participants, but subscribers; the internet is just another TV channel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At least the internet provides a platform. Most of what you see on reddit for example would have been a &quot;letter to the editor&quot; in the newspaper days. And only a few of those got to publication. Voices are getting heard now. But what&#39;s missing is legitimacy. A Podcaster can have an audience bigger than CNN but it doesn&#39;t count politically because it&#39;s not mainstream media. Remember the movie hackers? The ending of the movie was all about them getting some documents released on the internet so that the government couldn&#39;t squash it. Once the information was out there they were safe. I don&#39;t think that sort of scenario even matters anymore. You can put something out on the internet proving a politician broke some laws and nothing will happen. And an older movies a frequent technique was the hero the movie would have to get his documents to the newspaper so that he would be safe and save the world. I have a feeling if you had something serious and gave it to a newspaper they would just sit on it today. They don&#39;t want the legal liabilities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, both the DNC and RNC are controlled by their corporate overlords. That&#39;s why I&#39;m an Independent and vote for people like Ron Paul and Bernie. </p>

<p>Two things need to change. We need to cut the monetary strings that TPTB use to control their politician. When asked about the tax cut for the rich, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chris-collins-donors-trump-tax-plan-bill-2017-11">My donors told me to pass the Republican tax bill or &#39;don&#39;t ever call me again&#39;</a></p>

<p>To fix this we need to repeal Citizens Untied. Check out <a href="http://www.wolf-pac.com">Wolf-PAC</a></p>

<p>The other issue is the revolving door between government and corporate lobbyist. Good examples of this are the Goldman Sachs executives Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn. Or the GOP megadonor, Betty Devos, or the Verizon lobbyiest Pai who is going to take away our Net Neutrality protections. </p>

<p>To fix this we need to vote for candidates from both sides that pledge to end the crony capitalism. Judge them by their actions, not their words. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In any ism there are elements of the others that always creep in, in Socialism or communism there&#39;s still always money. You still have people buying and selling things which is capitalism. In a purely capitalist state you always have social programs, that have nothing to do with capitalism. I think in the end the best solution is to have a mix of the best part of all them. Sometimes Society pulling together to help their fellow people makes the most sense.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m hoping for the day that the frustrated and those who don&#39;t vote because they are tired of the 2 party trope go 3rd party. That would be some fireworks the media couldn&#39;t effectively hide, but nobody does it because almost everyone has the lesser evil bullshit drilled into their minds, along with being taught to identify with their party like it&#39;s their &quot;team&quot;. I think we&#39;ll have to wait for the boomers to die off for that though. </p>
