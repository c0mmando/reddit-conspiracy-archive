<p>The city article as it follows: </p>

<p>&quot;For over a year, an undercover investigation has been conducted against criminal elements.</p>

<p>During the course of the investigation, connections were apparently identified between criminal elements and various officials in the local municipal and national government.</p>

<p>In the morning, the open stage of interrogation began, during which 17 suspects were detained.</p>

<p>The police arrested 17 people, including senior officials of the Rishon LeZion municipality, as part of a covert investigation in which connections between criminal elements and officials in the municipal and national government were discovered.</p>

<p>Until the detainees are brought before a judge, it is not possible at this stage to specify who the detainees are and what their role is. We will only mention that apparently these are very senior figures in the municipality. A famous restaurateur, the daughter of a very well known public figure, a very senior contractor in a crime organization.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t blame you...</p>

<p>the &quot;what&#39;s the conspiracy?&quot; line is one of the oldest forum sliding tactics in the history of the sub.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll notice that 99% of the users who spam this question never actually contribute anything else of substance to the sub. </p>

<p>Whenever they show up to spam that comment, you know you&#39;re asking the right questions.</p>

<p>FTR, I automatically delete comments that <em>only</em> say &quot;what&#39;s the conspiracy?&quot;</p>

<p>Those users clearly are ignoring the rules, as it completely contradicts everything this sub stands for to limit discussion to things that are <em>unanimously</em> considered to be a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; (an impossibility). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post.  Sadly I am not at all familiar with Jerusalem politics.  Are the people arrested shady individuals, ones you would expect to see arrested, or is this a surprise?  I ask only because if I saw the same article about where I live, Chicago, I would think nothing of this due to corruption being common knowledge.  At first blush it sounds minor, someone took bribes for zoning changes, but the Post article seems to be hinting there is something else going on.  </p>
