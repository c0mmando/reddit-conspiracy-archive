       Now you may ask, what this has to do anything with "Conspiracy"? Well, there have been alot of discussions of "storms" hitting several countries around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The city article as it follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       "For over a year, an undercover investigation has been conducted against criminal elements.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the course of the investigation, connections were apparently identified between criminal elements and various officials in the local municipal and national government.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the morning, the open stage of interrogation began, during which 17 suspects were detained.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police arrested 17 people, including senior officials of the Rishon LeZion municipality, as part of a covert investigation in which connections between criminal elements and officials in the municipal and national government were discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until the detainees are brought before a judge, it is not possible at this stage to specify who the detainees are and what their role is. We will only mention that apparently these are very senior figures in the municipality. A famous restaurateur, the daughter of a very well known public figure, a very senior contractor in a crime organization."

       the "what's the conspiracy?" line is one of the oldest forum sliding tactics in the history of the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll notice that 99% of the users who spam this question never actually contribute anything else of substance to the sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whenever they show up to spam that comment, you know you're asking the right questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       FTR, I automatically delete comments that
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       say "what's the conspiracy?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Those users clearly are ignoring the rules, as it completely contradicts everything this sub stands for to limit discussion to things that are
       <em>
        unanimously
       </em>
       considered to be a "conspiracy theory" (an impossibility).

       I for one am always asking this question. I don't want this to turn into r/news or r/T_D.  We should stay away from stating basic accepted news facts and political leanings. If you make a post in r/conspiracy I think you should be required to explain why it's relevant to this sub.

       Great post.  Sadly I am not at all familiar with Jerusalem politics.  Are the people arrested shady individuals, ones you would expect to see arrested, or is this a surprise?  I ask only because if I saw the same article about where I live, Chicago, I would think nothing of this due to corruption being common knowledge.  At first blush it sounds minor, someone took bribes for zoning changes, but the Post article seems to be hinting there is something else going on.

       For me it's not surprising, I knew for quite a while that the whole country is corrupted...so nothing surprises me at this point. I just wait for the arrests with excitement! 
Not all names are revealed yet, when they will...I will update. 
Some people are asleep and it might be surprising for them, some are awake and just wait for good results as I do. that's just how it is.

       Ten comments now( all mostly positive)yet level on upvotes? So even if half the people here had given an upvote that would mean five people who didn’t comment downvoted.  Conspiracy inside the conspiracy? Great post btw.

       Sometimes people down voted and move on. You're talking about less than 20 votes total. That is not enough of a statistical base to say anything except 20 random people voted a certain way. Even now it's about 100 points and it's still not a good base for anything.

       I'll tell you what I was really surprised yesterday at the amount of people participated in the protest against Bibi in TA. I was kinda sure people are asleep in this country and won't do anything about the corruption...but when I saw what was going on yesterday made me rethink the situation and the collective consciousness. People are "Awake" and "Aware" to what's going on. I really hope these people will continue pushing on the government and it's associates. We NEED to take them down. the sooner the better.

       Israel not being corrupt is too far of a stretch.. If they are really going for it though, more power to them. It will help us out in the long run if this leads to a blackmail ring or two going down. (hopefully)

       As a former Israeli citizen, I have been following the Netanyahu affair, and I saw the news about the arrests in Rishon.
      </p>

       Yeah that's a promising protest! And the Zionists in DC aren't doing so hot right now either. Maybe there's hope for the world and we can keep it together afterall.
