       It is illuminating.
      </p>
      <p>
       It follows a pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
       Posts deemed guilty of exacting 'Rule 10' are often removed too, so it makes it harder to see if there is a particular similarity - this deletion of context can hide bias if there is any. However, you can still read between the lines and understand the context when you see what post they were replying to and the similarity in post history of those who they are accusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who slide forums, who use bots, who come in organized groups, understand the rules and know that this rule can be used to their advantage. Banning a particular group in favour of another can lead to dilution - users can create new accounts and wait 1 week to post, though just as many, if not more, will leave - this reinforces the strength of a particular group at the expense of another.

       I'm starting to find it interesting as to which threads have the AutoModerator "archive this" comment deleted from them... like this post for example. If you look in New, you'll see every single new post has it, but then in some they disappear. See if you notice a trend.

       I started res tagging people who broke rule 10 to help see the patterns. Some do it blatantly and many others use not particularly subtle code language.

       no...can you cite an example?

       The public mod log is a great feature, and one that many folks take for granted. However, if it's not working properly then that's definitely a concern...

       Hmm the last one I can think of was a self post one user of that troll/shill group posted about vampires. I was trying to find it in the logs to add that user to the sock puppet list and couldn’t see the removed post or banned user, but maybe I missed it.

       I greatly appreciate the overall transparency of the logs, btw!

       hmm, I’m not sure I can explain what I mean either yet. I’ve just been trying to figure out why some removed comments are now visible but others aren’t. Like maybe on self posts when it won’t show who was the user or what it said. Sorry that’s probably not helpful.

       Actually I just realized this. I was able to see who the user was through google searching the title of the post and saw you added them. Looks like they deleted everything. I am really curious how many accounts they made on 10/16. It’s crazy.

       I had gotten most of these a few days ago, and some other mods had gotten some of the others.

       Who's doing it? Hard to say. I don't doubt some of it is just common garden trolls as I call them, but the persistence of some make me think some are being paid by some institution, or likely several of them.

       Well you need some rules. Some of the rules e.g. 3,4,5 can go without saying. However, some other rules are open to interpretation and potential mismanagement. I could be wrong, but I think rule 10 was enforced around the election when coincidentally there was a spike in CTR/Shareblue/Donald shills - and let's be honest and look at the state of this reddit.. it isn't like this rule has had a positive impact on anything.

       See no shill speak no shill is detrimental to a conspiracy community; it doesn't take a genius to notice posters here with an agenda and hard on for toxic behavior. Post history often makes it too obvious.

       Just sounds like an easy way for a group with a new interest to clean-house, sort to speak. Wouldn't getting rid of people holding the anti-MSM narrative be the easiest way to introduce a new MSM narrative? People have noticed a change here with a more MSM touch being added and tolerated here. Often it is used for a shill to disguise himself among the rest of the sheep.

       You don't need to call a shill a shill to identify them as such.  You can highlight their behavior and liken it to those who fill that role, without ever actually issuing the charge directly, and this has the exact same effect.

       If somebody uses racist slurs, they face getting banned too. However, legitimate criticism of Israel, or observations about Jewish influence in US politics, or Hollywood are valid conspiracy themes, and are fine as long as they impinge on Rule 1.

       That sub is scary. They act as if we have history 100% understood. Anything that questions their narrative is seen as an attack. There is so much legitimate evidence behind Hancock's claims, probably more so than the mainstream narrative.

       The mods here are some of the fairest I've come across. They have to deal with a lot of shit, and it's pretty much impossible in most cases to figure out who's a shill and who isn't unless you have time to dig through every post history. And a mod doesn't have time for that, so without rule 10 every discussion would devolve into everyone calling each other a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are creative ways of calling a shill out out subtly. Do it and move on.

       Oh yea, at least some of the mods are compromised. My friend has been banned twice for “trolling” when he responded to a top minds shill who was actually trolling. They want to turn this sub into another r/politics, r/news, r/worldnews, or one of the other many subs with the same MSM propaganda.

       I was once banned for posting a video about the Mandela Effect. The reason I was given: "Trolling". It was no troll what so ever. It was a video about C3-PO having a golden leg vs a silver leg. I asked the mod to watch the video and consider unbanning me but was given no response.

       Hmm the last one I can think of was a self post one user of that troll/shill group posted about vampires. I was trying to find it in the logs to add that user to the sock puppet list and couldn’t see the removed post or banned user, but maybe I missed it.

       I greatly appreciate the overall transparency of the logs, btw!
