        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is illuminating.</p>

<p>It follows a pattern.</p>

<p>Posts deemed guilty of exacting &#39;Rule 10&#39; are often removed too, so it makes it harder to see if there is a particular similarity - this deletion of context can hide bias if there is any. However, you can still read between the lines and understand the context when you see what post they were replying to and the similarity in post history of those who they are accusing. </p>

<p>People who slide forums, who use bots, who come in organized groups, understand the rules and know that this rule can be used to their advantage. Banning a particular group in favour of another can lead to dilution - users can create new accounts and wait 1 week to post, though just as many, if not more, will leave - this reinforces the strength of a particular group at the expense of another. </p>

<p>no...can you cite an example?</p>

<p>The public mod log is a great feature, and one that many folks take for granted. However, if it&#39;s not working properly then that&#39;s definitely a concern...</p>
