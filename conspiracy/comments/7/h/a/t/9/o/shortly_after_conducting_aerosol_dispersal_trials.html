       And you'd have to be a hardcore science denialist to believe  chemtrails even exist. Proof that governments did evil stuff in the past, and still do so today probably, is not evidence that simple contrails made of ice crystals are somehow an evil chemical plot to harm us.

       What a weird point to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the premise of chemtrails existing is unscientific?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would you assume all contrails are or aren't chemtrails? It would make sense to hide the dispersals in plain sight, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is disputing the existence of contrails. I'm suspicious about persistent contrails, but I'm not gonna claim anything based on visual identification alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       What really does make a point that can't be easily ignored is the number of
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPnWaBsMYnY">
        tiny metals found on glaciers and in soils and in the oceans, primarily barium, aluminium, strontium and a few others.
       </a>
       Particularly the glacier studies are alarming, as there really isn't any other useful explanation for how the stuff got there than that it descended from the atmosphere. And the only way the metals could get there in the amounts that they're found, to my mind, is if the stuff gets added to the fuel supply for airliners at big airports around the world on certain days.

       Who decides when are 'Spray Days'. And who pays for all of this? How come in all the time people have been shouting about chemtrails, not one aircrew, ground crew, or office staffer has ever come forward and blown the whistle? Adding stuff to the fuel is not as simple as you think. I am an ex aircraft engineer and I know that putting the wrong thing in fuel would cause the engine serious harm. Plus, anything you add to the fuel makes it less efficient, so you need more to cover the same distance. I think the aircrews might just notice the discrepancy, especially as Easyjet pilots can get fined for over-fueling their aircraft and landing with more than a set minimum amount.

       Lead was added to gasoline to make the engines more efficient. I'm not sure about the effect that nanometal particles have on jet-fuel or jet engines but it's not certain that it's negative or noticeable.

      <p>
       Spray days would be decided, probably per airspace, by some commission of climate change. Russia might have a different schedule than the EU, to serve their own climate needs. Who knows.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be interesting to test jet fuel samples just before they enter the plane. It's a theory to explain a fact. I'm open for my theory to be disproven, but the fact remains that there are particles in our soil, our air, on our glaciers, in our water supply and eventually in us that shouldn't be there. Any damage that might cause is probably considered a necessary cost of progress or something like that.

       Then blame a more logical source for the pollution. The mines, the refineries, the smelting and chemical works that are polluting the entire world. Why do you point to the sky and blame all this on something that is impossible to describe because it couldn't possibly exist?

       These nano-aluminium particles and so forth aren't pollution per se in the sense that they are the byproduct of some unclean industrial processes. They exist in a state that isn't found in nature or by happenstance. Particularly the aluminium particles have a structure that suggests that they were deliberately manufactured for dispersal as an aerosol. So from the folks I've read and listened to, planes are the more logical source for these particles.

       If 'nano' aluminium (i.e, not natural aluminium trioxide) was to go into a gas turbine it would burn very fiercely leading to catastrophic turbine blade failure through overheating, and what came out the back would now be aluminium oxide.

       It's talked about in mainstream scientific papers. It's not referred to as chemtrails in the papers from what I can tell though. If you go on Google Scholar and search for "solar radiation management" then you'll find lots of published papers from respected institutions discuss it in detail,

       The claim seems to be that by spraying chemicals into the atmosphere it's possible to reduce the impact of global warming. From what I've read, the idea is that the chemicals will block out the sun's rays to some extent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if that delivery system for spraying the chemicals are commercial airplanes, but it's not to say there aren't non commercial planes that put them into the atmosphere. I didn't read enough papers to say for certain how the chemicals are put into the atmosphere, only that it does happen. If you search for the keywords you find in the papers you might be able to confirm how it works. I don't to mislead and say this is 100% how it works, I've only looked at enough papers that confirm chemicals have been sprayed into the atmosphere.

      <p>
       It seems that most of the conspiracy type claims aren't known by the names people commonly refer to them as, but if you do a bit of digging and find the right keywords, there's often some truth to the claims, it's a matter of determining to what extent

       I do understand the subject; chemtrails are a myth. Stratospheric Aerosol Injection is just a proposal (and a really stupid one) that would involve spraying sulphides into the upper atmosphere at about 100 miles altitude. The airliners making contrails are flying at about five miles altitude. There is no connection between SAI and aircraft whatsoever.

       Fair enough, as I say, I couldn't really find out how the chemicals were being put into the air. I'd imagine that it's pretty unlikely that commercial aircraft are being used to put any chemicals in the air. The idea of the solar radiation management does seem a bit ridiculous though. I'm not sure how it's going to reduce global warming. As I said, I only read a few papers so do you know how they plan to deliver the chemicals then?

       SAI as proposed could only be done using rockets or balloons as there's no aircraft that could reach the 50 - 100 miles altitude needed. That would severely restrict the amount of payload. There is now an idea being floated which could use modified aircraft to reach the lower Stratosphere and do the spraying there..... but it's just an idea (and  really bad one, IMO).

       That is actually the chemtrailers' favourite bait-and-switch :), so it's easy to be misled into that idea. They like to present evidence for, say, Stratospheric Aerosol Injection, then claim it also makes chemtrails real.

       I don't find it surprising at all that they are finding elevated levels of aluminum in people's brains and Alzheimer's disease is sky rocketing since they have been spraying the barium/aluminum cocktail on us non stop.

       These nano-aluminium particles and so forth aren't pollution per se in the sense that they are the byproduct of some unclean industrial processes. They exist in a state that isn't found in nature or by happenstance. Particularly the aluminium particles have a structure that suggests that they were deliberately manufactured for dispersal as an aerosol. So from the folks I've read and listened to, planes are the more logical source for these particles.
