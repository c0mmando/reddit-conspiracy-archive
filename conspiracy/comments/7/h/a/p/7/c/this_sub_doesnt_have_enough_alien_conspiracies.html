        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The story begins in 1946, when Scandinavian observers in over 2,000 seperate encounters saw what they called ghost trails, which were rocket-ish objects that flew at amazing speeds and made impossible maneuvers, and sometimes were reported to travel into the water of the Baltic sea at amazing speeds. They have still not yet been explained.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the 1970s and 80s, when USOs were spotted off the coast of Stockholm by hundreds of people over decades, and were even tracked by the Swedish military. They were described as traveling at impossible speeds, and none were ever found, even by the Swedish military. The last time this happened, to my knowledge, was 2013. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Swedish treasure hunters in the Baltic sea found what they called the Baltic sea anomaly, a spaceship looking rock, from which some people supposedly took samples. Scientists said the anomaly was naturally formed, but apparently the samples showed layered metal, which would mean it was clearly artificial, and could connect to the above sightings.</p>

<p>I remember some story about a NATO exercise in 1946 or 1947 in the north sea that saw a lot of UFOs, and another one about some US navy submarine that took pictures of what looked to be an alien in the Arctic ocean north of Norway</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first thing on the site that OP linked about that signal says </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you see and hear sometimes a strong continuous signal that runs for more than a minute or so, that is unlikely to be a meteor echo. VHF radio waves are sometimes affected by an unusual form of ionosphere propagation called &quot;Sporadic E&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was actually thinking that recently. The ancient aliens hypothesis is fascinating, and there is decent evidence for it, however that evidence could just as easily point to an ancient global advanced society of multiple species of human living alongside each other.

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. There&#39;s more than enough material and information on ET&#39;s. They exist all throughout the universe and throughout the dimensions. They also exist in hollow earth and also live among the stars. There are many types of ET&#39;s. It looks like you haven&#39;t done much research on the subject because there are countless books and information on the subject itself.</p>

<p>Advanced technology also exists, much of it originating from ET species that have exceeded our technological capabilities </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From everything I&#39;ve researched and studied.. Literal high up ranking military officers. Naval officers. Intelligence officers. Even Philip Corso head of the intelligence division, literally reported to the general and the president on a daily basis, has a book out describing what we gained from crashed craft at Roswell. There are many that have spoken about it and touched on the subject, you just need to look and research into it. Take the time and dig in. There&#39;s many books. Files, declassified files, PDFs, videos on YouTube, you name it of these types of testimony. Not just from Joe Blow down the block but actual first hand high ranking military and government officials. This all started in the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s. Why do you think we had such a technological leap and have progressed so rapidly from computing, to fiber optics, lasers, even night vision and Kevlar all originate from crashed ET craft and this can be verified by yourself. Seriously man. It&#39;s obvious you haven&#39;t looked around much, because there&#39;s tons of data. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you aware of how the ufos work? They don&#39;t obey the classical laws of physics. That means they can travel faster than light. Teleport if you will. That means they can reach us in a reasonable time and way. Check out r/holofractal. Check out the documentary &quot;Zero point: the story of Mark McCandlish and the Fluxliner&quot;</p>

<p>I agree with you that most ufos we see are man made, paid for by black budget secret government programs mostly operating in deep underground military bases. And I agree with you on the infinite size of the universe. But you have to start thinking outside the box a bit and consider learning more about the tech ufos utilize and how it applies to the bigger picture. </p>

<p>Nature of reality/existence is of Oneness. Everything is Divine, there is only truly Freewill. Law of One also talks about the creation story of &quot;God&quot;/existence as well:

<p>Here are some favorite Law of One quotes from Q&#39;uo:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The heart of your journey is to seek the Creator that is within you, the Creator that you are, the Creator that is all things. There can be no other way of looking upon an infinite creation of unity. The Creator took pleasure in making this, what you call creation, in order that it might know itself through the free will of each of its entities that it has created. From the Logos of every star within your skies, to the planet upon which you dwell, to each of your entities that you share the illusion with, each of you has free will to exercise however you wish. Each exercise of free will teaches the Creator more of itself, and fulfills the purpose of the illusion. Each of your actions reveals more to you of yourself, and if you are conscious of the seeking process, of the Creator itself, it is a journey of lovers, the creator loving you with unending love, you seeking and loving the Creator with a growing love. At some point, you will find the Creator, there is no other outcome for the end of this journey. At some point, the creator will know all that you know and will thank you for all that you have taught it of itself. At some point every entity within this great one infinite creation will coalesce again into unity, bringing home to the Creator the fruits of this journey through the octave of densities in which you now travel. Q&#39;uo transcripts September 4, 2016</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as well as </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let us look first at the first choice and that was the choice of the Creator to know Itself. In choosing to know Itself the Creator flung from Itself innumerable and infinite sparks of love which coalesced into each awareness that dwells within the infinite awareness. Each of those sparks of awareness is the Creator, and yet, because the Creator chose free will in the manifesting of sparks of self, each spark is unique and has been unique since before time began. Each of you is eternal and in many ways immutable, a citizen of infinite nature, worth and value. Each one a holograph of the Creator and yet each one different.
Thus, the choice that birthed each of you was a choice to know the truth, to know the self, and as the Creator is love, so is each entity love. This is the central truth. This is that which does not change. Yet this is that which is ever wrapped in mystery. Each within this circle has come through many planes of existence, has learned a great deal, and each within this circle chose not only this incarnation now being experienced but also that cast of characters with whom each entity interacts in the family, in the close associations of friends, and all those who have significant connections with the self. There were agreements made before incarnation, most notably with the parents and those within the bonds of kinship of blood and of commonality of interest. Each difficulty, each crux that leaves one in a position of being forced to discover the self has been placed not with a hand that desires to punish but with a hand of loving self that wishes to serve ever more deeply, ever more purely. -Q&#39;uo @the_law_of_one (May 18, 1997)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see two currently likely scenarios at the moment (based on what I&#39;ve personally seen and read so far, that is). I get the feeling that podesta is either just as in the dark about aliens as the standard conspiracy normie is, or he knows the lot and is working in conjunction with bluebeam. He has a fair bit of political power, but he&#39;s no political giant. And why would whichever military groups who work on ufos tell him about it unless it was a need-to-know? From the emails to and from him regarding ufos there&#39;s not much real juicy info in it other than in an email to podesta from Edgar Mitchell urging disclosure, but there&#39;s no reply. And all of the Tom Delonge/John Podesta stuff seems disinfo as all hell!<br/>
I know this bit may touch some nerves, but regarding pizzagate... The overwhelming number of occult references surrounding all the key players and locations related to pizzagate sent major red flags up for me. It got me wondering if - firstly, supposing these demonic entities that it&#39;s theorised they worship are true/real - then what are they? Aliens? What if Moloch, or Minerva, or Baal are aliens? What if Satan is an alien who shows himself through these different forms? What if they&#39;re reptilians? What if they&#39;re not real on the physical sense and it&#39;s all metaphor? What&#39;s the relevance of occult symbols and why do they matter? Do they have power? Is it just that they&#39;re used for the negative purposes they currently are that they&#39;re perceived to be evil things, and that really these are neutral symbols representative of universal properties and laws and that application of them for benevolent/loving use can bring about benevolent/loving effects instead of malevolent/evil ones? I don&#39;t exactly know...<br/>
But there&#39;s a relevance to the occult in respect to aliens I believe. I think it may hold the key to unifying science and spirituality, and I think that the elites want to suppress that so they can get the most out of us as ignorant pawns. I don&#39;t hold any beliefs concrete, but rather as potential realities with respective probabilities to the evidence supporting them. I try to stay open minded and I&#39;m always curious as to what impact new information may have on my current understandings, but yeah, there&#39;s my 2 cents thrown in there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please don&#39;t try to attempt to put words in my mouth. I never said they&#39;re &quot;space ghost reptiles&quot;, I just laid out a bunch of potential possibilities that I see based on the evidence I&#39;ve seen. It&#39;s fine if you wish to believe one of these over the others, and I do agree that simple child traffickers surrounding themselves with power and money is far simpler and in some respects much more probable that other possibilities, but from our position it&#39;s simply impossible to know and say for certain that it&#39;s any one over the other.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a fair assumption. But then again, as a counter point how often do humans make stupid mistakes? Either humans on an individual level or on the scale of the whole population. Anything is prone to make a mistake. No one is (at least im personally not) arguing that alien races are perfect beings, just relatively more advanced than we are. At least technologically. But I think when I make the suggestion for their possibility of merely existing, then that opens up so many new avenues of exploration regarding their intent, origin, mechanics... Just so much more in regards to &quot;the bigger picture&quot; and I don&#39;t think normal human reasoning applies very well at that scale. The only thing that&#39;s definite is that it&#39;d be very hard to prove, so I totally recognise that.<br/>
What we&#39;re your thoughts on when I mentioned that these supposed demons they worship could be metaphorical? I&#39;ve definitely read that theory concerning reptilians and that when it&#39;s referenced it refers to the primal/reptilian aspect of the human psyche. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe strongly that the singularity will be an important advancement in the human species, in that AI will minimize the destructive mistakes that humans are prone to make. If aliens have made contact with humans in the past I believe they were primitive aliens that were from our solar system.   I don&#39;t know about &quot;demons&quot;, that word seems like a vague charged word to use that will mean different things to different people.

    <div class="md"><p>Personally I believe the &quot;aliens&quot; are already here, have been here, and have been in contact with some people for centuries.
One of the most telling features of our planet is what we place value in. Look at precious metals. They are only made when stars are formed. Why would humans covet it beyond being shiny? How would ancient civilizations have placed so much value in something unless instructed to collect it?
The ancient peoples were instructed to bring gold to the gods.
There is also a good amount of information claiming that USA officials encountered a crashed vessel, found a survivor, communicated and brokered a deal, and were given mostly non violent technology in exchange for...??
Here we enter into mystery and conjecture. It&#39;s hard to say what has happened and why.
Often you hear these claims about religion being overwritten by these beings, but it doesn&#39;t seem far fetched to imagine a God head figure arriving on the planet and helping us to understand our origins. Suppression is always about power and control, and those who know these kinds of deep seeded knowledge will not easily relinquish it.
I&#39;m also wagering that our technology is so trivial relative to these beings that we can&#39;t exactly do much more than their bidding. Pilots, military career persons, and countless other official individuals have encountered these craft and they vary in many regards.
We may see the information released, but who knows when?
The first astronauts to go to the moon saw and reported UFOs while doing so. They&#39;re regularly seen in the ISS cam and Nasa cuts the feed abruptly.
I wish I had more than conjecture. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Making know to the public that ET&#39;s already are here also would mean &quot;they&quot; would also need to explain the zero point energy the ET&#39;s introduced and &quot;they&quot; are using against humanity. It would also mean the complete history of humans and all science books need to be re-written and wour actual history is not very flattering for &quot;them&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;their&quot; next level is the complete take over of any humans left after some created &quot;natural&quot; events. &quot;they&quot; are trying this by means of creating a complete new matrix. This new matrix will use 5G, rfid chips the internet, AI and other technologies to cut people completly off from nature&#39;s energy, the subconsious self and the universal consiousnesss of humanity. AI will run this artificial frequency based matrix and people will be pushed or forced to keep within &quot;their&quot; limits by all means possible. We are already feeding the AI with all the information it needs and soon everything involving you is monitored and/ or controlled.</p>

<p>The artificial extraterrestial matrix we are now living under has some controll over people, but people are still able to get in contact with their subconsious self and the universal consiousness we are all part of. This is now difficult already, but with Love or some knowledge most people are able to get in contact. The new digital matrix will try to cut this contact completely, leaving humans even more &quot;lost&quot; and in chaos than we are now.</p>

<p>The reasons? Well, it is not only controll over people, power and money. We humans are way more powerfull than we know now and if we ever find out what we are actually capable off &quot;they&quot; literary can&#39;t excist along us anymore. The reason for the matrix is to keep people and this &quot;reality&quot; in a low vibration state. &quot;they&quot; need it to be like this becouse they &quot;live&quot; of  the negative energy of people and resonate with the lower frequencies we emit when we are negative. Once enough people wake up and resign their fear for &quot;them&quot; and start living according our natural state of Love &quot;they&quot; will soon run out of energy and the artificial matrix will collaps.</p>

<p>This also explains all the pushback against the truth in all area&#39;s of our life. &quot;they&quot; absolutely do not want us to start thinking and waking up, their existence in this &quot;reality&quot; is at stake and &quot;they&quot; are literary fighting for their lives here.</p>

<p>Ignorance, fear, ego and the designed matrix interfearing with our &quot;reality&quot; try to keep us from using the tools and power we have inside to create our &quot;reality&quot; out of Love and live according to a more evolved consiousness level of life. Knowledge can free you of ignorance and fear. Love, truth and intuition will lead your way, fear, ego and the matrix will block you in by any means possible. Please study the tools and information we all have acces to and learn how to use this knowledge for your benefit and the benefit of us all in this 3D &quot;reality&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, tbh I don’t really do much conspiracy research these days; I’ve kinda had my fill. Off the top of my head, there’s David Icke (I’d try and get some of his books used- huge volumes, and probably cheap), Graham Hancock’s “Fingerprints of the Gods” (I think), there’s Zechariah Sitchin’s book about the nephalim (I think I’ve heard that book isn’t standing up well over time, but I don’t know, I’ve never read it), and then some YouTube videos from a guy named Michael Tsarion, who is a real hoot. Oh, and then there’s the Illuminatus Trilogy from I think Robert Anton Wilson, that book is ridiculous and silly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does Steven Greer try to sell? I personally disagree with his &quot;no bad aliens&quot; theory, as I think that just like with humans there are both good and bad aliens, but I think many reasons he suggests for the ongoing ufo/alien coverup are relatively accurate (eg: gatekeeping of advanced energy and propulsion systems, and their link with consciousness). Just like anyone else, I don&#39;t think he has all the answers. I don&#39;t believe anyone has all the answers. But people do have their own interpretations based on what they&#39;ve seen and experienced, and so I do believe that what he talks about at least has some substance and merit to it.<br/>
I&#39;m interested in your thoughts/agreements/disagreements if you don&#39;t mind. Also, you got any theories you suggest, or currently subscribe to/think there&#39;s substance in? </p>

<p>You can watch Steven Greer&#39;s Sirius documentary on youtube now. He&#39;s about as &quot;mainstream&quot; as UFOlogy gets and while he&#39;s paraded a bunch of retired generals and military people, nothing has ever come of it. Mostly he seems obsessed with Project Bluebeam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t heard of Al Bielek before either but thanks again for mentioning so I can look him up. His story definitely sounds interesting at the least! Uh huh, yeah I follow. I have watched Unacknowledged but I haven&#39;t seen Sirius. I appreciated everything in Unacknowledged, despite how I thought there would be more, but it definitely came off as holding something back... Or recycling old material. I dunno. I suppose I was just slightly disappointed that it seemed more tailored to those just being introduced to the ufo field of research, not those who have already done a reasonable not of research.<br/>
Ah yeah, that was a very curious comment and I offered an alternative interpretation to the religious one of Edgar Mitchell&#39;s words the other day. I think you might find it interesting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7e6yr5/z/dq3n692">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7e6yr5/z/dq3n692</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t, does it? </p>

<p>The fact is that even a few years ago, this sub had a mix of political with traditional, and it was fun and entertaining and often thought-provoking and a little scary. </p>

<p>Then Trump got elected. And suddenly, a lot of conspiracy theories and crazy ideas turned out to be true and really scary, and we&#39;re looking at a very different country than we thought we might have had three or four years ago. Y&#39;know, if you weren&#39;t paying attention. </p>

<p>There&#39;s two theories about extraterrestrial life I keep hearing about in certain academic circles. The first is that there isn&#39;t any life, because every civilization that develops space travel also develops the means to destroy themselves in some way, and we haven&#39;t heard from anyone because they weren&#39;t able to stop from killing themselves off. We&#39;re all alone because we can&#39;t stop fighting. </p>

<p>The second, more optimistic way, is that if that&#39;s true, then there&#39;s probably at least a few civilizations that DID make it out, and they&#39;re simply staying away from our planet until we demonstrate we&#39;re not a threat to ourselves anymore, and by extension willing to go to war with them. So they&#39;re just hiding and watching, waiting for us to actually step foot on Mars, or Pluto, or outside our system. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. I hope for the second. We&#39;ll see.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen a low flying black cube UFO. </p>

<p>This event occurred in 2011 and has haunted me everyday since. I work in networking and all of ours are late. I usually get off around 2am and then I am up for a few hours before I go to bed. This evening I got off work and it was raining really bad on my way home. When I got home, by chance, the clouds broke and I stepped outside to have a quick smoke. One of my buddies called me and we were chatting about work. It was still not raining and there were low lying clouds. There are orange street lights in Allen and they were reflecting off the bottom of the clouds creating an artificial light. There was a pretty good breeze whipping around, but no rain. I was facing the west and I look to my right and I see a black cube moving out of the north and traveling south at about 60-80mph. It was moving with a corner forward. This thing was huge. I was astonished to the core of my soul. I sat speechless for a few seconds knowing that I was seeing something amazing. It was 80-100ft tall. It was a black cube in shape and looked like a rough stone surface. On the side of the cube was a border and within the border was a circular symbol, if that&#39;s what it even was. It looked like if you were to draw a circular maze. It was disturbing the air behind it and created a vaporous trail spinning behind it and then disappearing. There was absolutely no sound. None. If you know Dallas, it was traveling in the direction of southbound 75Central Expressway towards downtown. I told my buddy what I had seen and he lives a few miles south. I fumbled over my words telling him and asked him to go outside to see if he could see it. He went out to the middle of his street and looked in the direction that it was coming from. After about 5 minutes it started to rain again. He stood out in the rain for another 15 minutes but never saw it. Good friend..lol.. Anyways, no one can ever tell me that I didn&#39;t see what I saw that night. I have been ridiculed and laughed at, but I know what I saw. It is almost a relief at this point to know that they are really here. I have been a long time lurker and I had to get this off of my chest. I have been searching &quot;black cube ufo&quot; for years now, every single day. I cannot stop thinking about it. I have to see it again. Thanks for listening. edit:Allen, TX (near Dallas) It looked like the entire cube was carved from a single stone. It had a border along its edges and a circular pattern in the middle. Think of a view of a circular maze from above. Also of interesting note, no lights from the craft either. I was expecting a light show, but I will settle with what I got to witness any day. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/2pgjxw/i_have_seen_a_low_flying_black_cube_ufo/">https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/2pgjxw/i_have_seen_a_low_flying_black_cube_ufo/</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/5q6uwf/my_low_flying_black_cube_ufo_encounter_in/">https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/5q6uwf/my_low_flying_black_cube_ufo_encounter_in/</a> I think they are the Archons... P.S. The &quot;Texas Black Cube&quot; pics you see all over the internet are a proven hoax. It always bugs me that it gained so much traction.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The story begins in 1946, when Scandinavian observers in over 2,000 seperate encounters saw what they called ghost trails, which were rocket-ish objects that flew at amazing speeds and made impossible maneuvers, and sometimes were reported to travel into the water of the Baltic sea at amazing speeds. They have still not yet been explained.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is there any proof that it happened?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fast forward to the 1970s and 80s, when USOs were spotted off the coast of Stockholm by hundreds of people over decades, and were even tracked by the Swedish military. They were described as traveling at impossible speeds, and none were ever found, even by the Swedish military. The last time this happened, to my knowledge, was 2013.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>any evidence?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Swedish treasure hunters in the Baltic sea found what they called the Baltic sea anomaly, a spaceship looking rock, from which some people supposedly took samples. Scientists said the anomaly was naturally formed, but apparently the samples showed layered metal, which would mean it was clearly artificial, and could connect to the above sightings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From everything I&#39;ve researched and studied.. Literal high up ranking military officers. Naval officers. Intelligence officers. Even Philip Corso head of the intelligence division, literally reported to the general and the president on a daily basis, has a book out describing what we gained from crashed craft at Roswell. There are many that have spoken about it and touched on the subject, you just need to look and research into it. Take the time and dig in. There&#39;s many books. Files, declassified files, PDFs, videos on YouTube, you name it of these types of testimony. Not just from Joe Blow down the block but actual first hand high ranking military and government officials. This all started in the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s. Why do you think we had such a technological leap and have progressed so rapidly from computing, to fiber optics, lasers, even night vision and Kevlar all originate from crashed ET craft and this can be verified by yourself. Seriously man. It&#39;s obvious you haven&#39;t looked around much, because there&#39;s tons of data. </p>
