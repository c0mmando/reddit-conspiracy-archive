    <div class="md"><p>If you go back in the first weeks/months of presidency, this very topic was discussed, or at least reporters asked about it, and the answer was always the same. 1. Paraphrasing: &quot;Yeah, yeah, we&#39;ll do it, sure&quot; and 2. They wanted a 2 state solution to the palestino-israeli conflict</p>

<p>At the time people were angry and people here were calling him a zionist as you&#39;d expect I guess, it was around the time of his trip iirc</p>

<p>But I&#39;ve always said, what he says and what he does are generally 2 things, so yeah, 4D chess is possible, I don&#39;t think he answers to netnyahu</p>

I don&#39;t feel like anyone had explained the repercussions this could have, or if they have explained it to him, have other didn&#39;t listen or didn&#39;t care. I don&#39;t know if this is 4D chess as much as it is him trying to prove he can do something that had been talked about but no one had done. For him this would be an ego boost and he&#39;ll be able to tell the world he made a difference in the Middle East. Whether this is a good or bad difference he doesn&#39;t care, as long as he does something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a Trump supporter, but if you research the history of the Mormon church and their dealings in uranium, you see a blueprint of the Uranium One scandal, except in the 1960&#39;s Australia was the proxy and Israel received the uranium to make their first bombs. (As opposed to Russia being the proxy where NK and Iran are getting the uranium.)</p>

<p>Note that Trump went to Utah and the next day this Jerusalem announcement happens?</p>

<p>Well, I know everyone wants to know what the Mormons have to do with Jerusalem... They want the temple to be rebuilt there.</p>

<p>So, amdist all of this, ISIS starts threatening the Mormon temple in San Diego.</p>

<p>So, even if you don&#39;t subscribe to some of those ideas... something is really up, right now, in the world of Mormondom.</p>

<p>Nevermind the cult inside the Mormon church known as the &quot;School of the Prophets&quot; has a mine in Salem, Utah... or their weird connections to murderers and US intelligence.</p>
