       <strong>
        Fluoride effects on the Thyroid
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerns have arisen about whether current fluoride exposures could be contributing to the increased prevalence of under-active thyroid -
       <a href="http://fluoridealert.org/issues/health/thyroid/">
        http://fluoridealert.org/issues/health/thyroid/

       <strong>
        Fluoride vs non-Fluoride
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “We found that higher levels of fluoride in drinking water provide a useful contribution for predicting prevalence of hypothyroidism. We found that practices located in the West Midlands (a wholly fluoridated area) are nearly twice as likely to report high hypothyroidism prevalence in comparison to Greater Manchester (non-fluoridated area).” -
       <a href="http://fluoridealert.org/issues/health/thyroid/">

       <strong>
        Underactive Fluoride symptoms
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Symptoms usually develop slowly and you may not realise you have a medical problem for several years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Common symptoms include:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        tiredness
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        being sensitive to cold
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        weight gain
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        constipation
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        depression
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        slow movements and thoughts
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        muscle aches and weakness
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        muscle cramps
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        dry and scaly skin
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        brittle hair and nails
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        loss of libido (sex drive)
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        pain, numbness and a tingling sensation in the hand and fingers (carpal tunnel syndrome)
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        irregular periods or heavy periods
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Elderly people with an underactive thyroid may develop memory problems and depression. Children may experience slower growth and development. Teenagers may start puberty earlier than normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have any of these symptoms, see your GP and ask to be tested for an underactive thyroid.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conclusions: Why?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is Fluoride in our water? Do we really believe it's to help maintain 'healty teeth'?. The health risks are much higher adding Fluoride to our water than the benefits it gives us. Are they creating customers for life? Are they adding it in to keep us tired and delirious? Maybe it could be to help us start puberty earlier? 
The health risks are to much for us to ignore as Fluoride affects us in many ways that hinder us.

       There has been talk of gut fiora in relation to autism as well. These bacteria break down all our food and neatly ship the specialized fuels to different areas. It makes sense that when you fuck with the microbacteria biome it could alter/hinder other processes in the body.

        Hijacking to help users detoxify
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Start eating organic produce. I'm talking whole produce, no canned or prepackaged shit. Drink distilled or reverse osmosis water, and cook with this as well. Don't ever take another swig of tap water again in your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, get an iodine supplement, and consider doing a full body detox (the diet and iodine will help with this as well)
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, look into the supplement called "Borax". It's a natural element that is used as an additive for removing stains from clothing. There are tons of health forums and alternative remedies for detoxifying the pneal gland that mention this as an effective way to decalcify your gland.

       I think you're at least better off getting frozen organic vegetables. If you're gonna get frozen, at least get organic. Read the ingredients of everything you eat too. Good rule of thumb, the fewer ingredients, the better. And avoid anything that has a ridiculous chemical sounding name like, "azobizocadmiumocarbonatiumoxide" or some shit. No high fructose corn syrup. Hell, avoid anything with corn and soy in it honestly, because those are the top 2 GMO crops.

       When a food is flash frozen ice crystals rapidly forming at the cellular level damage the individual cells of the food. The structure of the cell remains damaged, though intact for the most part so long as the food remains frozen. Thawed for consumption however the damaged cells do not repair themselves &amp; are instead ingested to be used as fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       You wouldn't put bad gas in an engine &amp; expect it to run properly would you? I'm not saying never eat frozen foods. Everything should be experienced but in moderation.

       If u wanna hyperhydrate your cells and get things like brain swelling and stuff, I definitely recommend only RO or distilled water in combination with a non-processed (aka low sodium) diet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not saying you’re wrong in trying to eliminate these things from your diet, because I agree that humans eat WAY too much processed stuff, I just think people need to personally look at the side affects of certain detoxifications and diets and make sure they are doing it safely for them. Iodine is GREAT for hypothyroidism but for someone with hyperthyroidism, an iodine “detox” could be worse. I have kidney problems due to a birth defect and an excess of RO water would probably make this issue worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what it’s worth I use a fluoride free toothpaste because regular toothpaste often makes me ill and seeing the ground water level of fluoride is 0.3ppm and tap water can be up to 1ppm is concerning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it on purpose? Yes because they think it increases dental health. Does it actually? We’re not really sure. It could be super dangerous to us but the government doesn’t know, just like using leaded fuel or mercury in vaccines. Hindsight is not really the government’s forte when it comes to the public’s health.

       Are metals necessary in vaccines? Are you bound to get a little or can they be avoided if people put in the effort? Just wondering.

       What is necessary in most vaccines is an adjuvant. Basically, vaccines contain an inactivated virus, so the body may not respond to the virus/disease with an immune response. An adjuvant like aluminum is present to actually irritate or inflame the immune system to a certain degree, so that the body will respond with immunity to the antigen in the vaccine. (Problem is, it indiscriminately inflames the system, which is very likely where the huge spike in food allergies and some other ailments in kids is coming from,  but that's a whole other story). But aluminum is not always what was used as am adjuvant, I recently learned. This journal article explains that calcium phosphate was originally used as an adjuvant, which is likely far safer.
       <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14760584.2017.1244484">
        http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14760584.2017.1244484
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The interesting part I learned here too? The change to aluminium occurred in the late 80s -- the same time the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 was passed, which made pharmaceutical companies immune from any liability to injury from vaccines. Convenient to say the least. My guess is that aluminum is somehow cheaper. Also, they use more adjuvant, (more alumimum) and less antigen than they used to, which also saves them cash.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe your question about metals may also be referring to mercury. Mercury has been used in vaccines as a preservative, which is different. It is still present in flu vaccines, and is definitely not necessary unless it is a multiple-dose vial. The mercury allows you to use the same vial again without contamination. Oh, and it's definitely not just saline and water and such in there, I wish. It's ingredients like polysorbate 80, aborted fetal cells, and traces of the pesticide glyphosate have been found in there. All sorts of great stuff.  A lot of info but hopefully this helps.

       My grandma from Bangladesh only brushed with a neem stick her whole life and has perfect healthy teeth at 65. Never touched fluoride toothpaste. I think there's a deeper reason as to why they put fluoride (which is toxic when ingested) into our water. I agree that there's no possible way that the govt gives that much of a shit over Americans having healthy teeth if they don't also take the same precautions to prevent obesity, alcoholism, diabetes, etc. The health concern is a very flimsy excuse.

       Nope. And stay away from plastic too. Even bpa. You wanna distill your own water. Even reverse osmosis doesn't get everything out. If your tap water is chlorinated and not fluoridated then you can boil tap water.

       Fluoride is found naturally in almost all water. A lot of times higher than tap water. The amount of fluoride in drinking tap water is harmless. Arsenic is found in apples. Why isn't anyone talking about that? Because it's harmless in small doses.

       True. In high enough doses. My point is there is often times more fluoride in natural well and river water. So we have been consuming fluoride in our water since ever. But only now these symptoms come up. So it's more likely to have a different cause.

       Do you know what the levels of fluoride are in breast milk? I'd imagine it's very low in breast milk, and very high in formula. I'd also imagine that it's very low in well water, and very high in baby water. Are we doing enough research to see how this affects infants? How do you know we haven't had these symptoms for a long time? Maybe we're just now realizing that these symptoms could be correlated to fluoride. Regardless of your viewpoints on the overall effects of fluoride, would you agree that more research should be done? Preferably conducted by those that wouldn't be the ones facing lawsuits if it were to come out that fluoride is detrimental to our health.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that there are some people very sensitive to fluoride. What is your biggest reason why you believe fluoride should added be in our drinking water. For our teeth?

       You're right that breast milk has lower levels of fluoride than formula with tap water. You are wrong about well water. Well waters can be dangerously high with fluoride.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good point on babies tho. Kids are at the moat risk for fluorosis (mostly from swallowing tooth paste) So filtration in those cases may be needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dangers of fluoride in drinking water has been researched. Extensively.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that being said... I see very little reason to add it to water besides healthier teeth. I'd be fine if they stopped adding it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the anti fluoride movement is just a scare tactic to get people to buy unnecessary expensive filtration systems. Even in ops sources there are links to buy them. Tell me that's an unbiased source.

        levels of fluoride are in breast milk
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Since breast feeding is not always a feasible option, infant formula must sometimes be used. When this is the case, it is critically important that you do not use fluoridated drinking water to prepare your baby’s formula. Fluoridated water, which contains up to 300 times more fluoride than breast milk, is by far the single largest source of fluoride for infants. When formula must be used, therefore, make sure to use a water source that has low levels of fluoride (less than 0.1 ppm). Low-fluoride water can be obtained in one of three ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        purchasing bottled water (most bottled waters have low levels of fluoride);
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        filtering the water with a system that uses reverse osmosis, deionization (with ion exchange resins), or activated alumina technology;
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        distilling the water with a countertop distiller.
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Children may experience slower growth and development. Teenagers may start puberty earlier than normal.

       Fluoride helps make sure teeth decay doesn't occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on what I've looked at, I don't think fluoride is harmful to the body. The only problem is it is just another one instance of hiding a problem instead of solving it. There is enough evidence that tooth decay among many other diseases are caused by a poor diet and it is only getting worse.

       Damn do you know how old this thread is hahahaha. I wish I had these answers for you friendo. I can only assume that a healthier diet will result in healthier milk. Is breast milk beneficial for adults? I'm not sure but you just made me gag. My guess is that breast milk is very good for babies, because babies need rather low levels of nutrients to survive. So for a baby, breast milk is like WOW! For adults, breast milk is like meh. How did you find this thread? I kind of have no idea what I'm talking about so tell your friend to talk to a nutritionist

       Naturally occurring fluoride concentrations in surface waters depend on location but are generally low and usually do not exceed 0.3 ppm. The Fluoride found in our drinking water is usually 3-4 times as much as is found in natural water sources.

       Becuase the lies were perpetrated and the science was twisted over fifty years ago.  Have you ever considered who first fluoridated their water and in what pretext?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also these studies use past studies as evidence so they really don't prove anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to that there is absolutely no explanation on how DRINKING a known toxic compound is good for our teeth.   It's been proven to help as a topical application; but the science behind how
       <em>
        ingesting
       </em>
       the substance is helpful, is missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       One would assume that if your body ends up putting the fluoride in your teeth via ingestion then why wouldn't it be distributed to the rest of our bones?

       The fluoride found naturally is a different compound than the industrial waste version that they dump into the water. Besides, adding fluoride to drinking water to prevent tooth decay is about as effective as putting sunscreen on your skin then immediately washing it off.

      <p>
       Bottled water products labeled as de-ionized, purified or distilled have been treated in such a way that they contain no or only trace amounts of fluoride, unless they specifically list fluoride as an added ingredient.

       Ive been told as long as the plastic has been "burped" out its ok thats why you see a 1 on a plastic water botttle but a 5 or 6 on a 5 gallon jug.. Ill try and look this up and find a source.

       I believe the idea is to prevent diseases. Think birds crapping into the container or collection surface. You're typically taught to never get drinking water from non-running surface sources for similar reasons.

       No, in almost EVERY location it's merely against the law to harvest more than an allotted amount (let's say, two or so rain barrels worth). This is to prevent some in a community from completely decimating the natural aquifers as used by others in a community.

       avoid plastic entirely unless it's a bioplastic (even then if the stuff used to make it wasn't organic or was filled with pesticides and watered with fluoride, shit you can't away from this stuff)

       Processed food is the biggest conspiracy of all yet no one wants to talk about it. Why? Because thats something that people can actually control, yet dont, for whatever fucking reason. They will blame everything to the sun and back before they blame their issues on the shit they put into their mouth. If only everyone knew what 1 week of being vegan felt like on your body! Im not vegan, but I tend to do vegan lifestyle for a few weeks every other month or so. It really helps my body recover.

       I've been vegan a while but didn't do much. still feel like shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe i feel better than when I was drinking milk (i probably, maybe it's been too long for me to notice)
      </p>
      <p>
       even if there's improvement maybe I'm just a depressed person. did try medication, still trying. next script comes in a few days so i have to go without it for a bit. it's bleh, not that great. doc did raise the dose.
      </p>
      <p>
       i asked for amphetamines but i have to spend 300 bucks to take an adhd test before he can prescribe it since it's a controlled substance. what a joke.

       Over two years since I ran. Used to run in high school. Loved it. Something wrong with my right hip, can't atm. You're right about cardio being basically magic though. lol, idk about

       Sorry I overlooked your question. Bromides are added to flour and processed foods. You will see it listed as brominated flour. I believe it is to increase the shelf life but have not been able to confirm that. Bromides are in the same family as flourides and iodides. The problem is that Bromides bind to cells in the same way flouride does and ( iodine does too) and damages the glandular system. So whatever iodine is available is crowded out by the flouride and bromide ions. Now Iodine is a critical nutrient flouride and bromides are not. 
Interestingly, I came across a USDA livestock breeding guide when I was researching iodine and USA meat cannot be sold in Europe because USA does not supplement meat with iodine. This is considered substandard by Europe and other countries. The reasoning behind not supplementing with iodine by USA meat producers is the animal is leaner although will encounter more sickness. It doesn’t matter to them because the animal is slaughtered very young. Iodine is critical for health and well known but apparently docs never test for iodine they just hand out pills. Such as thyroid meds. Breast cancer too is associated with iodine deficiency. Obesity is at epidemic levels too. 
Just food for thought (pun intended) 
Dr. Brownstein has some great YouTube videos explaining this. 
I can give you more links if you like. Just don’t want to inundate you.

       I've been worried about this for years, have lived in a flouridated area for most of my life and I'm almost 50.
      </p>
      <p>
       My 25 year old daughter is waiting for an appointment to the cancer clinic as they have found nodules in her thyroid, a shadow under it and an enlarged area above her collar bone which has been getting bigger for several months. I'm utterly terrified.
      </p>
      <p>
       She has been unwell for at least 18 months but unable to lose weight and rapidly gaining for about 3 years. All thyroid tests came back normal so the doctors didn't take her serious at first.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a lot of long term health issues and always suspected my thyroid, but like my daughter all my tests are in the normal range too. As far as I know I don't have any nodules either just permenant enlarged lymph nodes and most of the symptoms of hashimotio's.
      </p>
      <p>
       My much younger sister has also started having similar problems around 7ish years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all drink an enormous amount of water and are constantly thirsty, from being very young, drinking tap water until recent years. In my constant search for answers that began in the late 90's flouride displacing iodine amongst other things is something I keep seeing.

       Thing is, even if that were true, the advice I'm seeing seems like bullshit. Anyone telling me to eat meat is plain wrong, especially raw meat. Cooking allowed the human brain to evolve, and that was cooking plants. the vegan diet is healthest, and raw food is good but so is cooked. being honest.

       Thank you for the link I'll have a read of it. Does he recommend taking iodine though as I have atrial fibrillation and suspect my daughter does also and I'm concerned about how that may be effected?

      <p>
       I'm supposed to be on beta blockers and warfarin but stopped taking then add I was barely able to function on them, they massively increased the fatigue, brain fog and low body temperature.

       warfarin is a blood thinner right? are you taking it for HBP, or to counteract another medication? if it's for HBP, he addresses ways to thin out your blood naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know anything about atrial fibrillation, but iodine is only one of the many things he recommends for thyroid / fluoride. he actually recommends an herbal tea for fluoride/chlorine.

       No hbp but I had a pulmonary embolism and almost died when I was 28, non smoker and no generic reasons they could find at the time. It was put down to the long periods of inactivity, sitting and laying down when I'm bad and can hardly move. The warfarin thins the blood like you say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward another 12 years and they find that my heart doesn't beat right, more like vibrates add the doctor put it. They put me on a beta blocker to slow and regulate my heart and wanted me back on warfarin as there is a possibility of blood pooling in my heart and clotting, which can lead to a stroke. I don't take either, just asprin (when I remember) as if rather live a shorter life to the best I can than be the zombie that they made me be.

       I have tried Lugol's iodine in water myself in the past for a couple of months but either that wasn't my problem or I was missing something else that it needed to work. However I am very reluctant to try anything on my daughter that may excaberate things, a lot of websites dealing with thyroid issue stress that when not taken under medical supervision that it can actually make things worse.

       Sorry to hear you've struggled so much with your health. I am in a similar position, dealing with chronic illness that went undiagnosed for many years before we finally got some objective labs to point us in the right direction.

       Anthony's books are what I've been following and seeing results with for the last year. I think you'll like his approach, it's by far the least risky and least expensive alternative I've tried.  For iodine, you may want to try something like
       <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZG7LM/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1">
        dulse flakes
       </a>
       which contain good amounts of iodine instead of a supplement. I put a tablespoon or two in a smoothie in the morning and you can't really taste them.

       So, I don't want to be offering unsolicited medical advice, but if you have any interest in random suggestions from a stranger I have a few.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may want to look into the details of medical fasting coupled with a whole foods diet, my experience has been with a high fat low-carbohydrate one, but people have reported similar stories to mine from other approaches as well, the biggest thing is learning how/when to fast productively and cutting out every source of poison/toxicity/trash in your diet you can get away with. It would take too long to go into the specifics, but the whole foods approach is key. I'm partial to paleo/primal approaches, but other approaches work too. there's a ton of people online who talk about similar dietary approaches for thyroid issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the fasting, there's a lot of anecdotes online about people finding it helpful to well nigh miraculous for thyroid stuff, but he actual research and evidence isn't there positive or negative so it's one of those things you have to decide to test or not test based on your own hunch. You may want to look into a guy named doctor Jason Fung who runs a clinic dedicated to using fasting to reverse type 2 diabetes. I know you're not dealing with type 2 diabetes(probably), but about a year ago he started working with patients with thyroid issues and claims that while it's too early for him to talk about it the way he does diabetes, he says he's been amazed at the early positive benefits they've been seeing in their clinic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, try to learn as much as you can about the most common problem vectors for health in terms of specific foods/food contaminants and what can be done to combat that and see whether your daughter would be willing to spend a month or two giving it a shot. It's not as hard as people think once you get the hang of it and in many cases it has changed people's lives. I used to be on death's door and weight 465 pounds, I'm 220 now and haven't been actually seriously ill in well over two years. I credit that to learning about just how bad grains, sugar, food additives and what passes for meat in most stores are and coupling that with fasting. I can make no guarantees, but it's a good avenue to explore if you feel up to it.

       Thank you for such a long well thought out reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the biggest barriers at the moment is financial. The only full time salary coming into the home at the moment is my oh, my daughter has her own micro business which was taking of very well before she became too ill. It involved making and selling bespoke items by hand which she was shipping all over the world. But now trying to make them (very fiddly process) causes her too much pain and then her hands go red and balloon. I suspect something to do with the mass above her collar bone putting pressure on nerves or something. I work from home (freelancing) intermittently as my health allows but the brain fog has become a major issue lately, not easy building e-commerce websites like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have experimented with diet and supplements since around 2004. I know I tend to do better (or did) on a low carb high fat diet and zero gluten.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years ago when money was easier I faithfully followed Dave Asprey's bulletproof diet. I know it is rather polarising but it was a semi miracle for me. It took at least 3 months before I really saw any major difference but then it escalated quickly. I lost 7 stone in under a year and felt better than I ever have. The only things that didn't improve at all was my memory, stamina and intolerance to exercise, which was incredibly frustrating as I felt as though I could do anything but kept overdoing stuff and collapsing.
      </p>
      <p>
       However the diet even when you substitute some things is very expensive and when I had a fall a ended up laid up (caused a relapse after the injury ) I couldn't work again and could no longer afford it. Plus my daughter who was younger then was doing all the cooking etc and I ended up back on a standard British diet of carbs and crap.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have experimented since with trying to suck to the regime on a tight budget, trying to cut corners but never managed to feel as well as that again. I think the food, supplements and whole body vibration training were working synergistically.

       Oh cool, yeah, bulletproof is a good diet, but it's not cheap. This is part of why I like to mention fasting. One cool thing about it is if you're fasting 3-4 days a week you get to save the money from eating and eat higher quality food when you are eating. Of course, it only really seems to work well for some people, but it's well worth looking into. Fasting combined with something similar to bulletproof(bulletproof is really just an extra rigorous paleo) helped me lose ~100 pounds and get rid of my psoriasis and a few other conditions to boot.

       The first time I fasted for just 30 hours and I was blown away by how good I felt. I had tons of energy and thinking clarity. It did make me really thirsty, cold, and I had to keep cleaning my teeth it seemed, but otherwise pretty euphoric.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I broke the fast I was craving a garden salad so bad, it was the most delicious food I've ever eaten. The fastimg seemed to reset my palette, as prior to it I was eating like shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I fast intermittently and basically just give myself an 8 hour feeding window every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's quite the weight loss you did there. How long did it take you from when you started to where you are now?

       Around new year's three years ago I was 465, may of this year I hit a low of 195 and I bounced back up to 220 following some life disruptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't been able to confirm it, but I have that thing happen with my teeth too sometimes and I suspect it's some sort of heretofore unrecognized internal cleaning mechanism. If I had to guess it's part of some sort of ill understood internal 'detox' mechanism, but I honestly don't know. I've seen some weird shit happen during my longer fats where by body does stuff in terms of venting substances and excreting things that I've never really seen it do before.

       As for the teeth, they actually get cleaned when you eat, so not eating just allows the plaque to build up.

       Yeah, but that's the thing. I'll go for 7 days at a time eating nothing and some days there will be tons of slime generated and some times for several days they'll be completely grime free. It's like the plaque builds up in cycles somehow where some days I'll go to bed and they'll be grody in the morning and other days they won't feel like anything's going on for a whole day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumably the plaque would have to be coming from bacteria living off of just what's in the saliva so maybe the saliva's chemistry changes day to day? I've noticed some days my saliva is more acidic than others but it also ebbs and flows. Whatever I'm rambling I guess. haha.

       Another thing I've been wanting to know is how is all the flouride being washed into the oceans effecting the incredibly delicate crustaceans and corals there or is it still so low that it isn't doing anything yet? What happens to it? Does it bind to anything else and become inert or is it damaging our seas?

       The fluoride ion is insanely reactive. It reacts to nearly anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure if the concentration is enough to alter ocean water, but there's no doubt it reacts with stuff and displaces things such as iodine.

       I didn't know that, I wondered about the concentration but I do know just how sensitive marine invertebrates are and the levels will rise if is not becoming inert.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of my pet theories is about the mass die offs of the corals not only being due to the rising temperatures but also all the chemicals (pesticides &amp; fertilisers) from farming run offs, drugs (prescription/recreational in urine) and chemicals being flushed into the oceans from our treated water and sewage, including chlorine, flouride and copper that has leeched from water pipes (copper is deadly to invertebrates but again in the ocean it must be super dilute)

       Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought it was the element fluorine that was incredibly reactive (being a halogen and all) and fluoride was the (relatively stable) ion it becomes after reacting with oxygen.

        Another thing I've been wanting to know is how is all the flouride being washed into the oceans effecting the incredibly delicate crustaceans and corals there or is it still so low that it isn't doing anything yet?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The ocean is naturally fluoridated at 1.3 parts per million, which is LESS than the standard fluoridation of drinking water. If anything, the drinking water  is DILUTING the fluoridation of the ocean.

       To attempt to answer the question, people also don't seem to care that about 80% of sexually active North Americans catch the HPV virus, which can lead to various cancers. In other words, a lot of folks don't really care about their health a great deal. The paradox is that those that do, also care about those people's health too. I leave you, gentle reader, to figure out exactly what's going here...

       Are the exact overlap of the ultimate effects of not getting enough exercise or physical activity in your day-to-day life. Americans don't exercise, or get physical activity, NEARLY in the amounts they need to. Now, that is it's own conspiracy there (infrastructure built around cars, food manufacturers selling faux-diet products, workplaces forcing their employees to sit or stand in one place all day, it's a whole societal mess)!
      </p>
      <p>
       But as with so many ailments and toxins and whatever, when the symptoms just happen to overlap with "not exercising", I get very wary of taking the thing at face value.

       Virtually every "symptom" listed can be counteracted, to some degree, by regular exercise. This is the case with a LOT of nebulous "toxin" or "syndrome" semi-New Age maladies. I don't think it's a coincidence.

       Sources of water that are
       <em>
        naturally
       </em>
       VERY highly fluoridated should be avoided. But drinking water is fluoridated to an amount around 50% of the
       <em>
        natural
       </em>
       fluoridation of ocean water. And artificial fluoridation levels are even below the fluoridation of some naturally-occurring FRESHWATER drinking sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm trying to say is, perhaps it's not fluoridation at all. Perhaps it's the far more obvious and common sense problem that many Americans simply DO NOT EXERCISE with any degree of regularity or strenuousness, then they feel bad, so they continue to not exercise, so then then feel worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easier to not exercise and blame fluoride for physical and mental illness, than it is to exercise. Same with a host of New Age maladies.

       Fluoride has absolutely zero health benefits, it even causes Fluoridization which erodes the teeth which is the reason they put it in the water in the first place.

       Fluoride does indeed provide health benefits, for the teeth, in the prevention of cavities. Whether drinking water is the best delivery method for this...that is very much up for debate. I think it is not, and studies have shown that drinking water fluoridation may not be worth the cost or hassle, and that funding should be put into regular fluoride treatments delivered via periodic rinses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The levels of added fluoride in drinking water, in the end, simply are too low to provide positive benefit OR ill-effect. It doesn't have much of a point and I think it likely should stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       In doses that are WAY TOO HIGH, either because of high natural fluoridization levels in local water supplies, or errors in calculating how much to add to drinking water, can cause discoloration of the teeth (not erosion, discoloration), though I don't believe there's been a link shown between that and other adverse health effects.

       Good, as long as you make a statement of opposition. Fluoride added to water causes loss of IQ and loss of dental enamel, you've been fed a lot of junk science and you were making it seem like you were in support of fluoride.

       maybe people would have more energy and motivation to exercise if they were healthier to begin with, meaning access to clean water and food rather than processed junk and poison. it does make a difference.

       Lack of energy is a symptom something is wrong you are using the same tactic the sugar industry used. Labeling a person lazy for gaining weight when it is sugar that was the culprit. A person who is weak from toxic levels of flouride cannot effectively exercise. Their weakness is a symptom of poisoning. Don't spew industry talking points here.

       Lack of exercise is an enormous public health problem, both for physical and mental health.
      </p>
      <p>
       That there are OTHER issues can also be true. Like sugar, for instance! There are lot of studies showing sugar is one of the more harmful substances to consume in excess. However, that some substances are bad for us doesn't mean we should ascribe to New Age "toxin" chain mail fodder maladies which are much better explained by people being increasingly sedentary at work and home.

       I think we agree more than disagree. People with compromised immune systems can be more suceptible to flouride than healthy individuals. Suceptible people include elederly, children, kidney disfunction or liver disgunction, cancer, or on chemo. There are many individuals who would be contraindicated to mass dosing. Flouride terrifies me and its unknown effect on children especially. When in doubt, don't is what I say. Did the chicken or the egg come first? Do you abstain from exercise because you feel tired and weak? Or are you tired because you don't exercise? As someone who loves exercise I can say that the benefits of exercise out weigh the risk. I am a huge advocate for it and I consider fitness a hobby. But I also know that weakness and lethargy are a symptom of weakness and healthy people cannot sit stil. Yet we dismiss mass levels of lethargy as simply laziness. It's a pleasure chatting. Even though we disagree on some points at the end we both want to see humanity healthier.

       You're implying that people need to just tighten up their bootstraps and head to the gym? Lmfao. What makes you think they're not already? Maybe they don't have the energy to go because of the flouride? Maybe they go to the gym and STILL feel like shit.

       Nothing to see here folks. Let's up the flouride levels and head to the gym!

       Which came first the chicken or the egg? Healthy people enjoy exercise. When I became sick a couple of years ago one of the first symptoms was exercise was draining rather than invigorating. Sick people don't want to exercise, I believe it is a symptom of illness.

       It seems to me to be something like compound interest, but with health.

       We should start fixing it at its start by ensuring kids have adequate time outside of the classroom to run around and start off healthy, so they don't "invest" in illness and a sedentary life.

       This is very true as well. However kids also seem very tired too and are obsessed with electronic media. In my neighborhood only the youngest play outside. Past 9 they seem to want to isolate themselves. It's really sad.

       Exactly my point!

      <p>
       It starts young, and it's a very pernicious part of our culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then when you're in your 20s, and you started off that way...yes, you're tired a lot. You exhibit a lot of well-known symptoms of a sedentary lifestyle. And you may feel too tired to exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's still possible! And it would still solve a lot of issues, if not all of them, and if not completely.

       Maybe they're too depressed to exercise and would want to exercise more if it weren't for the biological attacks and chem trails. just a thought.

       exercise is a necessity definitely, but not everyone will even want to begin if the fluoride has them drooling and their brain is literally running on a lower fps

       it's the brushing that cleans your teeth, doesn't matter what you use. wouldn't use flour or anything, but baking soda's cheap and does the job. you could use a toothbrush by itself, recommend strong bristles though.

       Oh, I forgot the uranium industry which probably has the most surplus fluoride. They're so economical! They even use the "depleted" spent fuel form nuclear reactors, melt them down into shells, bullets, warheads, still radioactive, we shoot them at whatever poor brown people are next on Israel's list, birth defects for generations. The oligarchs see this as a "two-for", you know kill them plus keep killing them.

       Is it possible that the flouridated water is a result of an old standard that's yet to be changed, and won't be until serious problems arise that can be directly linked back to the flouride? Something akin to how asbestos was used in everything for a while until we realized it was causing massive damage across the board.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many standards in the US that were drawn up 50 or more years ago that health officials look at as if they're unchanging laws of the land, when in reality we should have been updating them when new science comes out at a constant rate. There are examples of this everywhere as well, with saturated fat and diet as a whole, with many prescription drugs, the list goes on. And of course some things have clear money ties with big pharma etc. but a lot of it is just complete incompetence on our governments part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any way to change at maybe a small community/city level the standards on water treatment? Or does this go so high up that we will have to rely on the government waking up before we see this change?

       You raise a great point, but pull evidence provided by the same people who you think are leading an international conspiracy to poison all citizens.  The true story is though there are negative effects, it's a net positive and easy thing to maintain so utilities put fluoride in drinking water.

       It's not hard to understand why these people do what they do. They have no concern for others. They are self-serving machines. You are just like them, but you have concern for others keeping you from being a useless parasite. You can understand them. Just don't avert your minds' eyes as your heart aches and you can see it. They are simple, self-serving machines.

       So, this is done for two big hidden reasons, but sold as beneficial for teeth. They are, to dispose of industrial waste in a profitable manner and to subdue the free human spirit by corrupting the brain. The pineal gland and behavior is affected in a way that helps their pack if parasites, offworld and onworld, control their slaves, their hosts. They are useless eaters.

       Fluoride is one of the deadliest poisons known, right up there with cyanide and arsenic. It's mainly a by-product of the fertilizer industry that used to pay enormous sums of money in order to safely dispose of whatever they couldn't use for insecticides before the bright idea of putting that very same fluoride into everyone's water supply under the pretext of improving their dental health came along and turned it into a money maker for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the same sort of way that big oil got rid of carcinogenic by-products in refining oil like benzene that they originally had to pay hefty sums to dispose of in the changeover to unleaded gas by getting the car manufacturers to put in catalytic converters that their customers would have to pay for to dispose of those toxins that way and save themselves the cost of having to do it by adding them to the unleaded gasoline they produced.

       Don't know how you can say "we fucked-up". Most of us were clueless, born into a pre-existing culture we had no hand in creating and already well on it's way to wherever the fuck it was going full-speed ahead and simply dragging us right along with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The natural world still is thing of great beauty and a magnificent diversity of life that has been used and abused due to human ignorance, stupidity, and pure unadulterated greed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority of us are aware of that and have had no direct hand in that. We've done our best to find a loving and considerate mate, some meaningful work, put a roof over our heads and food on our table and raise our children as wisely as possible to do likewise.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah it would be incredibly bad and unjust for so many good decent humans to get nuked especially by the utterly corrupt and murderous villains who would do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those villains certainly deserve that fate, but not any of the ordinary people they think nothing about destroying in order to prove how much better and more powerful they happen to think they are.

       i mean we're just thrown into this world, we can either give up or try to play the cards we're dealt. idk, guess we'll see what happens. when i read all this stuff and see all that's going on though it's hard to imagine a good future, especially when anyone who tries to do good always gets murdered or stopped by TPTB

       We can't change the world. We can only change ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to be the kind of human being you yourself would like to meet and have for a friend... look for the opportunities to be kind and helpful to others and don't pass them up or ever tell yourself that they're too small or inconsequential to make a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each time you help others like that you set an example that shows them that they can, too and that it does make a difference and life always gets a little brighter and better whenever you can.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have faith that every little bit helps and stay in touch with nature and pay attention to just how beautiful it all really is. Remind yourself that you belong to it and that it belongs to you. It's completely free and comes with the package... your real birthright as a human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't worry about what others think or believe. What matters is what you believe. Good things don't happen all by themselves, they simply need a little help and it doesn't take much for any of us to provide that little extra and see it work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about all the people who despite all kinds of problems of their own get up everyday and go work keeping so much that we all depend on working the way it should and life as normal and reasonably pleasant as it actually is and can be most of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short... don't dwell on the dark side or forget that there's so much more that is bright and good that persists and will always persist... and that your rightful place is in being a small part of that.

       If Gandhi hadn't opposed violence he would never have succeeded in freeing his country from the colonial rule of the British Empire. He was assassinated in broad daylight in a set-up by his political opponents and people around him that he trusted. Nothing could have saved him, given that.

       If you're not armed and compliant chances are no one's ever going to shoot you. If they think you're armed and look the slightest bit like you're going resist or fight back they won't think twice about filing you full of holes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some drug addict with a gun simply wants whatever money or valuables you have not your life. Is it smart to put it on the line for no more than that? To provoke instead of being calm and trying to keep any assailant from losing it and freaking-out?

       I'm not talking about provoking, I'm talking about having the tools, even if they're weapons, for self-defense. Violence is okay if it's initiated first by someone else, isn't it? I would think so. And I'm not inviting violence, I just want to be prepared in case it happens. You don't wear a life jacket hoping you almost drown, it's just there because there's a possibility you may and you need protection from that.

       I mean the natives were fair but the white man killed them and violated treaties. Kindness and empathy only go so far when others don't have it. The airbenders disappeared in the avatar universe. You get what I'm sayin. Monks in tibet set themselves on fire. I don't wanna be in that situation. Even firefighters use controlled fire to stop wildfires from spreading too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe controlled violence has a place? I don't know. I don't know what the answer is man. It's easy to romanticize but you gotta be practical and think about what you're working with. When others don't have empathy or are evil then your empathy and understanding won't always make up for it. They may just be violent towards you and then your empathy and understanding are eliminated from the world, leaving their evil and lust for power still alive and thriving. What good is that?

       Usually natural water sources contain plenty of Fluoride.  Where I live it is half of the amount of water treated with Fluoride.  Lookup your natural water table stats and see how much you have.   BTW all symptoms listed are also associated with binge watching GOT or Stranger Things etc. however Rick and Morty binge watching does not have these symptoms.

       It's more than just the fluoride. If you want to save your family read the book "we want to live" - the author was assasinated for the truth he spread in relation to these things.

       So, I don't want to be offering unsolicited medical advice, but if you have any interest in random suggestions from a stranger I have a few.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may want to look into the details of medical fasting coupled with a whole foods diet, my experience has been with a high fat low-carbohydrate one, but people have reported similar stories to mine from other approaches as well, the biggest thing is learning how/when to fast productively and cutting out every source of poison/toxicity/trash in your diet you can get away with. It would take too long to go into the specifics, but the whole foods approach is key. I'm partial to paleo/primal approaches, but other approaches work too. there's a ton of people online who talk about similar dietary approaches for thyroid issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the fasting, there's a lot of anecdotes online about people finding it helpful to well nigh miraculous for thyroid stuff, but he actual research and evidence isn't there positive or negative so it's one of those things you have to decide to test or not test based on your own hunch. You may want to look into a guy named doctor Jason Fung who runs a clinic dedicated to using fasting to reverse type 2 diabetes. I know you're not dealing with type 2 diabetes(probably), but about a year ago he started working with patients with thyroid issues and claims that while it's too early for him to talk about it the way he does diabetes, he says he's been amazed at the early positive benefits they've been seeing in their clinic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, try to learn as much as you can about the most common problem vectors for health in terms of specific foods/food contaminants and what can be done to combat that and see whether your daughter would be willing to spend a month or two giving it a shot. It's not as hard as people think once you get the hang of it and in many cases it has changed people's lives. I used to be on death's door and weight 465 pounds, I'm 220 now and haven't been actually seriously ill in well over two years. I credit that to learning about just how bad grains, sugar, food additives and what passes for meat in most stores are and coupling that with fasting. I can make no guarantees, but it's a good avenue to explore if you feel up to it.

       Around new year's three years ago I was 465, may of this year I hit a low of 195 and I bounced back up to 220 following some life disruptions.

      <p>
       I haven't been able to confirm it, but I have that thing happen with my teeth too sometimes and I suspect it's some sort of heretofore unrecognized internal cleaning mechanism. If I had to guess it's part of some sort of ill understood internal 'detox' mechanism, but I honestly don't know. I've seen some weird shit happen during my longer fats where by body does stuff in terms of venting substances and excreting things that I've never really seen it do before.

       That there are OTHER issues can also be true. Like sugar, for instance! There are lot of studies showing sugar is one of the more harmful substances to consume in excess. However, that some substances are bad for us doesn't mean we should ascribe to New Age "toxin" chain mail fodder maladies which are much better explained by people being increasingly sedentary at work and home.

       Nope. And stay away from plastic too. Even bpa. You wanna distill your own water. Even reverse osmosis doesn't get everything out. If your tap water is chlorinated and not fluoridated then you can boil tap water.

       I sorta had that thought because i'm a bit depressed and tired, probably from withdrawal. i won't get my med refill until tuesday. when i'm in a more positive state i'll probably feel different, i'm a bit bipolar like this. go from thinking it's all hopeless to trying to think of ways i could help in my own way in the future.

       i mean we're just thrown into this world, we can either give up or try to play the cards we're dealt. idk, guess we'll see what happens. when i read all this stuff and see all that's going on though it's hard to imagine a good future, especially when anyone who tries to do good always gets murdered or stopped by TPTB

       If Gandhi hadn't opposed violence he would never have succeeded in freeing his country from the colonial rule of the British Empire. He was assassinated in broad daylight in a set-up by his political opponents and people around him that he trusted. Nothing could have saved him, given that.

       If you're not armed and compliant chances are no one's ever going to shoot you. If they think you're armed and look the slightest bit like you're going resist or fight back they won't think twice about filing you full of holes.

       Some drug addict with a gun simply wants whatever money or valuables you have not your life. Is it smart to put it on the line for no more than that? To provoke instead of being calm and trying to keep any assailant from losing it and freaking-out?
