<p>The devs seem to be pretty tolerant of people posting absurdities, judging from what I saw during the last few days. Take that fractals guy for example.
As this is reddit you can be sure there are always people who have a different opinion and they are going to voice it even if it from time to time feels like an echochamber especially in the political subsections.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also imagine users may be justifiably wary about ascribing their name to a movement comprised of members of such varying ideologies however, and all that says nothing of the risk of outside infiltration, or someone using information against the group. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the rules are fair. Their transparency with open mod logs is very unique on Reddit. There aren&#39;t many threads I click into that have &#39;removed&#39; comments. I think they avoid censoring users. Inherently, a conspiracy forum will always have users ask about the moderators, and questioning is always a good thing. I have not seen any behaviors from the mods that push me to question motives. This subreddit is mostly controlled by voting. When it&#39;s being influenced, it&#39;s mainly because the post reached the masses of Reddit.</p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome but allow me to clarify a bit. If you watch /new or /rising throughout the day you can definitely see manipulation happening in real time. In my opinion, this happens from the left and the right. Either to push a story/narrative or to distract from another story/narrative. It&#39;s rare to see something considered &#39;neutral&#39; to be pushed to the top of the sub quickly.</p>

<p>As far as the mods are concerned, I don&#39;t think there is anything for them to do when this manipulation of the sub happens. I&#39;m sure they can recognize a narrative or a brigade, but taking action on those threads would only lead to accusations of censorship. Instead, the threads are allowed to remain. It is what it is. I will only look at /hot a couple times a day, just to see if I missed something. </p>

<p>I try to make sure my &quot;passion levels&quot; don&#39;t go to 100% when moderating here, otherwise I&#39;d be jibbering wreck. But the non-hyperbolic answer is &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you prove that they are fighting the good fight by not being swayed from revealing the truth?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not swayed from revealing (what I believe to be) the truth, and I don&#39;t think any of the other mods are, but that would be impossible for anybody to &quot;prove&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>who are they?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You won&#39;t find answers to that question here, mainly because the rules of reddit prohibit the doxxing of other reddit users, and the mods won&#39;t be doxxing themselves just to make you happy.</p>

<p>However, most of the mods were regular users of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> before we got elected as mods, and you have our individual posting histories at your disposal to see if we meet your exacting criteria (11 years in my case, so knock yourself out). </p>

<p>You also have access to the modlog (see sidebar) - all actions taken by moderators of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are public record. Most subs don&#39;t have that level of transparency.</p>
