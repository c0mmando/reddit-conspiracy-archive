       I understand but what the point of having a conspiracy sub run without actually knowing if the mods are dedicated?

       I think the fact that censorship of ropics is far and few between is an indication they are doing a good job.  It's not their kob to be dedicates to conspiracies, but to moderate a sub that fiscusses them.  I'm not sure what your purpose of attacking the mods is, but it's suspicions the angle you are coming at them with.

       All they have to be dedicated to is keeping an open sub that allows the free  discussion about conspiracies.  Shit, I couldn't give a fuck less if they hate conspiracies, so long as they don't censor topics.

       So what, you want the mods to come swear their loyalty to you and the cause? They aren't going to do that, the ones who are working hard are working hard. The ones that don't are there, but I'm not going to call them out. Stick around, because it isn't hard to learn the pecking order.

       I’ve been lurking and commenting on this sub since Paddock and have noticed that from time to time when something is blatantly obvious like Pizza Gate you will find people commenting that it’s not.

       This is a conspiracy sub right?

       If you spin it that far you could say every person on this planet you have not yet met in person might not truly exist or is not what it is said to be. There is a healthy distrust and there is paranoia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The devs seem to be pretty tolerant of people posting absurdities, judging from what I saw during the last few days. Take that fractals guy for example.
As this is reddit you can be sure there are always people who have a different opinion and they are going to voice it even if it from time to time feels like an echochamber especially in the political subsections.

       The reason I question this is that I don’t feel that any conspiracy that holds water will flourish here.  To much evidence and nothing seems to go anywhere.

       That’s why I ask if the mods are definitely dedicated or just passing time and who are they?

       I get it, like mobilizing on information discussed. I can dig it. What do you think would be the best first steps to take? That line of thinking is a deviation from the status quo, so I'd imagine many would be on board, but wouldn't know where to start.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also imagine users may be justifiably wary about ascribing their name to a movement comprised of members of such varying ideologies however, and all that says nothing of the risk of outside infiltration, or someone using information against the group.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's going to be a hard sell, but I could see it potentially working on a case by case basis

       I think the rules are fair. Their transparency with open mod logs is very unique on Reddit. There aren't many threads I click into that have 'removed' comments. I think they avoid censoring users. Inherently, a conspiracy forum will always have users ask about the moderators, and questioning is always a good thing. I have not seen any behaviors from the mods that push me to question motives. This subreddit is mostly controlled by voting. When it's being influenced, it's mainly because the post reached the masses of Reddit.

       You're welcome but allow me to clarify a bit. If you watch /new or /rising throughout the day you can definitely see manipulation happening in real time. In my opinion, this happens from the left and the right. Either to push a story/narrative or to distract from another story/narrative. It's rare to see something considered 'neutral' to be pushed to the top of the sub quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the mods are concerned, I don't think there is anything for them to do when this manipulation of the sub happens. I'm sure they can recognize a narrative or a brigade, but taking action on those threads would only lead to accusations of censorship. Instead, the threads are allowed to remain. It is what it is. I will only look at /hot a couple times a day, just to see if I missed something.

       I try to make sure my "passion levels" don't go to 100% when moderating here, otherwise I'd be jibbering wreck. But the non-hyperbolic answer is "yes".

       I'm not swayed from revealing (what I believe to be) the truth, and I don't think any of the other mods are, but that would be impossible for anybody to "prove".

       You won't find answers to that question here, mainly because the rules of reddit prohibit the doxxing of other reddit users, and the mods won't be doxxing themselves just to make you happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, most of the mods were regular users of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       before we got elected as mods, and you have our individual posting histories at your disposal to see if we meet your exacting criteria (11 years in my case, so knock yourself out).
      </p>
      <p>
       You also have access to the modlog (see sidebar) - all actions taken by moderators of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       are public record. Most subs don't have that level of transparency.

       The mod team is tiny for a sub this size, and 80% of mod actions are performed by 5 people (not including automod). Combined, they average 400 to 700 mod actions per day.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, they have to deal with a constant influx of alt accounts and trolls from the meta subs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say anyone willing to do all that is pretty dedicated.
