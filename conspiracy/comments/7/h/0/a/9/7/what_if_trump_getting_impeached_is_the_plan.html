        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>What if the whole point of this shit show is to impeach Trump while the emotional instability of &#39;the people&#39; is at a crescendo.  Specifically to cause a massive war here.  We already have the weapons, they&#39;ve been selling them to us for years.  Why are we any different than Iran or North Korea in the eyes of the global military industrial complex?  </p>

<p>I guess what I&#39;m saying is what if the military industrial complex has evolved into the global military industrial complex?  MIC---&gt;GMIC.</p>

<p>How does the CIA or other agencies initiate the destabilization some country somewhere? They take down the leader and destroy the existing government framework, then the country does the rest while weapons are sold, resources squandered and massively corrupted subservient puppet leaders are installed to sign over all the stuffs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting theory, I get what you&#39;re saying how the CIA destabalizes other countries. But if they did that here that would be like a parasite killing it&#39;s host.</p>

<p>If they could, I&#39;m sure they want to impeach him somehow, . He&#39;s too unpredictable. Pence is predictable and that makes him easier for them to control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is nothing new here. This is just a partisan pro-Donald Trump reversal of the original idea: that Donald Trump was put into office to do the bidding of reactionary overlords with their usual agenda of deregulation and tax cuts,  only to become expendable if conditions warrant -- to save the Republican Party -- to make the Republican Party and its &quot;deconstruction&quot; agenda move from &quot;conservative&quot; to &quot;moderate&quot; -- to save Republican ass.</p>

<p>As for war and destabilization, those who attack identity groups and support &quot;white&quot; rights are exactly the fools who would take the actions that would insure such a crackdown on everyone. It is hilarious that OP would make such a suggestion and fail to realize that he is the fool who would cause all these terrible things to happen.</p>

<p>Or maybe it is just the usual dishonest projection of Republican partisans that we see so frequently, for example, where</p>

<p>Two years of Pizzagate fizzles upon an actual pedophile running for the Senate -- whose support remains high despite pedophilia, or</p>

<p>A Fake News story by James O&#39;Keefe who receives money from Donald Trump and Robert Mercer -- a story designed to discredit both WaPo and any woman who would make a claim of sexual harassment.</p>

<p>We are well beyond Orwell&#39;s dystopia now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ive thought about this myself. But I would think they would play up Trump more. I mean like he&#39;s not really loved by THAT many. At least from what I&#39;ve seen. Im pretty suspicious of the Trump vs Nfl (black) players and Nba (black) players. It was just both odd situations. Like that was done to split the country by race. I dunno I&#39;ve been a &quot;Trump guy&quot; for a little while now but lately I find myself second guessing, but not for reasons most people here second guess him. I feel most people here that are against him are just blindly against him, whereas I am seeing things he seems to be doing right, although there are somethings I&#39;m pretty suspicious about. </p>

<p>Anyway, I think this is a good plausible theory. It could be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hadn&#39;t actually considered this. I think a civil war is unlikely because the average American would really not easily take up arms against one another.</p>

<p>However. War is very good for those that sell it. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s controversial to say Trump is sort of a loose cannon about stuff, liberals are already afraid of how he talks to NK after all. What if the plan by the GMIC (and it&#39;s absolutely international, I like the label) is to use him to kick off another big one? There&#39;s a lot of interest by Israel in picking off Iran and stuff gets posted here all the time about them saber rattling towards them. And both countries would be massive undertakings to fight, requiring years and trillions to conclude. They get a war to start, a scapegoat to blame for it all, and unlimited credit to give to a world at war.</p>
