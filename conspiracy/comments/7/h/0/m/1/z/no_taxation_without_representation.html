We are constantly sold out by those who we elect thinking that they will represent the will of us, the people. Instead these people pad their pockets with the money of lobbyists who are doing the bidding of corporations and the 1%ers. In turn, these people who are suppose to represent us, instead often pass legislation that hurts us in favor of what is good for the 1%. I propose that we, the 99%, begin a movement to boycott tax season. They can’t possibly come after all of us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol. First of, it&#39;s not a democracy, it&#39;s a Constitution Republic, and taxes have always been assessed by those governing. The issue is, if it&#39;s a republic of the people, by the people, and for the people then government, which technically is us, has a duty and responsibility to ensure Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. The later having been defined by TPTB to be property. To pay taxes is to give up Liberty through time collecting payment in exchange which the government has defined as income or a profit. To profit in a perfect union, we all would tithe a fair portion to provide for collective services, which in turn builds the country to provide a means of ensuring liberty through education of the masses and providing infrastructure for business. The problem is, we have a supposedly government of the people that been hijacked by a global corporate oligarchy that uses our money against us as propaganda to divide and conquer, dumb is down through control of media, and false flags to scare is into being good patriotic way mongers. Hence, they get to steal 10%-33%, depending on which state you live in, and is it against is while feathering their nest - in which case it is theft. But when taxes are used properly to pay it forward and provide the foundations of society that Maslow&#39;s Higher Needs can be met by the populace then it&#39;s not theft - it&#39;s passing your fair share. We have the former not the later. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotta say, you&#39;re making some pretty good points here.</p>

<p>I want to back you up by saying that there was a fundamental change in the nature of taxation when the 16th Amendment was ratified in 1913 and Congress was given the power to tax <em>income</em>. That&#39;s bullshit in a bag right there. Previous to this, taxes and tariffs had applied to specific activities and/or products. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax_in_the_United_States#Early_federal_income_taxes">And interestingly previous proposals for a general <em>temporary</em> income tax had been in response to war or some kind of national hardship.</a>)</p>

<p>I can understand taxing specific things. Put a tariff on imported goods to encourage domestic consumption and gain revenue from competing foreign states. Tax a product or service if it somehow incurs costs from the community at large. Tax real estate because you now own a portion of the country and should contribute to its maintenance and growth.</p>

<p>But taxing everyone&#39;s income? And then taxing a sale between two individuals when they&#39;ve both already pay taxes on the money being used and the business being run?</p>

<p>Taxation <em>with</em> representation used to exist in America, but government has expanded and stratified immensely since the founding years. What we have now are new kings sitting in their bureaus and departments, passing taxation that most people have little to no say on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Democracy is a tool used to control the people and give them the illusion of control. It works by the same mechanism as how they levied taxes on the poor. By convincing the poor/stupid that things weren&#39;t equal and to &quot;equalize&quot; them. i.e. socialism.</p>

<p>Taxes only were levied during wartime. Or else the peasants would revolt. You really know nothing about history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree with this.
It&#39;s not black and white. Balance is also important.
Taxation is a tool, it can be used for good or evil.
Just like government and regulations.</p>

<p>Remove money from politics and congress
will suddenly stop acting retarded
and vote based on what is logical/what the people want/what actually helps the people.</p>

<p>People welfare over corporate welfare, any day.
You can&#39;t trust Apple, Amazon, etc. to pay
their fair share when they don&#39;t even do that
NOW in a crony capitalist society where
corporations get free shit (subsidies), crony contracts,
crony regulations (although some regulations are necessary like worker rights),
legal tax dodging loopholes, etc.</p>

<p>Like criminals, they must be forced not to damage
society (no more authoritarian than punishing criminals with fines or jail time). 
Accumulating billions and not giving
back to the community is a crime IMO.
If every multi millionaire and billionaire played by the rules,
the super rich probably would stop feeling like they
need to &quot;compete&quot; to accumulate the most money.
The fear of losing the wealth is irrational and becomes
clear when everyone starts playing by the rules.
It becomes a more level playing field.</p>

<p>Extreme wealth = extreme power.
Moderate millionaires who are ethical and pay their fair share of tax,
I&#39;m cool with. But tax dodging super rich is just disgusting
considering the extreme income inequality.</p>

<p>Some people seem to think that
Bernie is saying &quot;we need to ALL BE 100% EQUAL!!!&quot;
when he&#39;s not.
He&#39;s just saying there&#39;s EXTREME inequality
and the gap between super rich and super poor
should surely be narrowed. Not necessarily closed. (We don&#39;t need 100% equality like clones, but something closer, would be nice right)</p>

<p>Middle class to moderate millionaire seems like
a reasonable range for humanity to be within while avoiding 
extreme poverty (super poor) and extreme power (super rich).</p>

<p>I believe in a good balance between collectivism and individualism.
A balance between self<strong>less</strong>ness and self<strong>ish</strong>ness.</p>

<p>Dems/Repubs/Libertarian party are all economic NEOliberal extremists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree that this would be a good tactic since hitting them in the wallet seems to be the only effective means to get government action.</p>

<p>A quick hypothetical if I may: What would you think of a constitutional amendment that allowed taxpayers to dictate directly how their income tax dollars are to be spent? </p>

<p>What I am thinking of is a system where the tax payer would have direct control over a certain percentage of their taxes (it would be nice if it could be 100% control, but I don&#39;t think that is possible). When one files they would fill out a form stating where one would want say 50% of their taxes spent. So if youdon&#39;t like our foreign policy, you could divert 50% to education or health care.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this a solution to all our woes but it could give voting constituents more power over their government. We are quickly moving to a place in this country where our only recourse as citizens will be to throw off our current government and establish a new one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly what we need to do. Seriously, this is our most powerful card to play against them. If we can get even one whole state to do this, we will be able to ask for whatever we want, or never pay federal taxes again. (State taxes are ok to me, as most of it stays in-state)</p>
