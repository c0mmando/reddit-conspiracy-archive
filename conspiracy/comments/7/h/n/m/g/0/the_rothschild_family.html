        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Rothschild family are subtlety titled the &quot;Guardians of the Papal Treasure&quot; in the Jewish Encyclopedia. They are propped up as the wealthiest family which masks the Italian Nobility and their wealth and power. That is how they guard the papacy and its wealth. The real wealth of the Vatican Nobility is being concealed in private Swiss bank accounts while attention is on the Rothschild family. </p>

<p>The Rothschild family were originally Holy Roman and North Italian banking and merchant clans that reestablished themselves under the name Rothschild. The Rothschild family are intermarried with many Zionist banking families and nobility in Europe. </p>

<p>David Rene de Rothschild who is head of N M Rothschild &amp; Sons is currently married to an Italian princess from the Aldobrandini family and they are also intermarried with the Bonaparte family and Borghese banking family of the Vatican. </p>

<p>Evelyn de Rothschild is a billionaire and financier for the British Crown. </p>

<p>Royal families use royal courts and court factors to manage their investments, taxation, and businesses and this keeps the attention off of them. </p>

<p>The Rothschild&#39;s are intermarried with the Goldsmiths of London who are intermarried with the Middleton family and Kate Middleton is married to Prince William. </p>

<p>These families are all conspiring together to dominate over society and enslave humanity. The Goldsmith family are another powerful and wealthy banking family in London and married with Bourbons in Spain and were formerly bankers in Tuscany. </p>

<p>The Goldsmiths of London appear to be closely related to the Borgia family of Spain or are the continuation of the Borgia family and are concealing this. The Rothschild and Goldsmith families are worth tens of billions and they use this wealth to create leverage over the economy and to dominate markets.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Spirituality and religion have been a part of the human experience since our Consciousness rose about in our ancestors some 50,000 years ago. We have 30k year old Venus statuettes, and ritual burial with jewelry going back 50k years. Religion and its practices only became corrupted with the advent of farming and civilization. First, the priests realized they could mobilize the people to do public works in the name of the gods...this is likely how the first widespread irrigation projects in Farming communities in Southern Turkey and Northern Iraq started some 9k+ years ago...it was only later, with the advent of metallurgy and weaponry, that a warrior class emerged. This warrior class subsumed the priests in control, and utilized/manipulated religion to their ends, becoming the first divine &quot;Warrior Kings&quot;.</p>

<p>All that to say that Religion wasn&#39;t &quot;created&quot; to enslave...it was always a part of who we were as humans, it was only relatively recently that it was manipulated, first by likely sincere and well meaning priests, and then by the warrior class.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody&#39;s afraid to say it, it&#39;s just that most people aren&#39;t as stupid as you have to be to believe it. </p>

<p>Throughout history, the Church has been a major source of social services such as schooling. There are a bunch of Jesuit/Mormon/Christian universities.</p>

<p>The 10 commandments have had just as much influence in our modern legal system as English Common Law. The Bible and Christian theology have also strongly influenced Western philosophers and political activists. The teachings of Jesus, such as the Parable of the Good Samaritan, are among the important sources for modern notions of Human rights and the welfare measures commonly provided by governments in the West. Long held Christian teachings on sexuality and marriage have also been influential in family life. In general it affected the status of women by condemning infanticide (female infants were more likely to be killed), divorce, incest, polygamy, birth control, abortion and adultery.</p>

<p>Days like Easter and Christmas are marked universally as public holidays; what are they marked on? <strong>Pope Gregory XIII&#39;s Gregorian Calendar has been adopted internationally. Year numbering in the West is taken from the assumed date of the birth of the Church&#39;s founder.</strong></p>

<p>A moral/ethical foundation is essential to form a civilisation. What will it be replaced with?</p>

<p>Helping people getting through existential crisis in their lives. Not everybody&#39;s mind is &quot;strong&quot; enough to deal with the bleak reality and religion gives them a framework, illusionary or not, to get through it.</p>

<p>Turning a buck on the greatest lie of all <em>hell</em>,  do you believe in that fairy tell? O&#39; by the way, I most certainly believe in the Creator-God, as well as <em>god&#39;s</em>,  not to mention the Bible. But twisting lies as truth for the Black Nobles on the unsuspecting, on the grounds helping humanity gives me the dry heaves, a penny back for every dollar has worked out well financially for them for a few thousand years, the final straw being Pope Leo sticking the Crown on Charlemagne&#39;s head, the first Charles in charge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When someone says &quot;<em>You should look into them</em> it doesn&#39;t mean &quot;you should accept whatever explanation they give the public to cover up their ulterior motives.&quot;</p>

<p>Who owns the Federal Reserve?</p>

<p>Who owns the Bank of England?</p>

<p>How much money do these institutions handle?</p>

<p>Who audits their transactions?</p>

<p>How common is financial fraud?</p>

<p>Have you heard of Bernie Madoff, Enron, or Worldcom?</p>

<p>If there were financial fraud with these institutions, who would enforce the laws against them?</p>

<p>How much of a revolving door is there between banks and regulators?</p>

<p>Hopefully you get the picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Currency Wars (simplified Chinese: 货币战争; traditional Chinese: 貨幣戰爭; pinyin: Huòbì zhànzhēng) by Song Hongbing,[5] also known as The Currency War,[6] is a bestseller in China, reportedly selling over 200,000 copies in addition to an estimated 400,000 unlicensed copies in circulation[7][8] and is reportedly being read by many senior level government and business leaders in China.[9] Originally published in 2007 the book gained a resurgence in 2009 and is seen as a prominent exponent of a recently emerged genre labeled &quot;economic nationalist&quot; literature.[9] Another bestselling book within this genre is Unhappy China; however, unlike this and other books within this genre, Currency Wars has been received more positively by the Chinese leadership as its recommendations are seen as less aggressive towards the US.[9] The premise of this book is that Western countries are ultimately controlled by a group of private banks, which, according to the book, runs their central banks. This book uses the claim[citation needed] that the Federal Reserve is a private body to support its role. More than one million copies of this book have been sold.[10]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the unification with HK helped a lot, it brought in huge investment</p>

<p>also a lot of it has to do with the manufacturing agreements we allowed china to engage in- china has two closed circles on its economy- an exterior circle for lending and producing products that we in the west buy and an internal circle for the chinese economy and the products they allow bought</p>

<p>until president xi, those where totally separate, chinese people could not buy the products they where making and tariffs prevented imports- but they changed those policies leading to huge shifts in the last 5 years</p>

<p>but way back in the 90&#39;s it was mostly that the chinese agreed to basically anything if it got money flowing to the mainland- mainland GDP was less the HK at reunification- they just had no fucks to give</p>

<p>china is not that different then what is happening in india, they both have gone through huge development</p>

The Killuminati Soldiers of Truth like to steal my word and they rewrite it the same exact way this person just did. Its their way of undermining all the information I put out by blurring it with other people that mix truth with lies. There is no reason why this person did not give me credit for this other than theft. Also the Killuminati Soldiers of Truth stole my posts on Facebook and then flagged my account until it got shut down in order to remove me from exposing their theft.

<p>Amadeo Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in California which was later renamed the Bank of America. The Bank of America is still under the original charter of the Bank of Italy today. The BOA is the second largest bank in the United States with assets estimated at 2.2 trillion. Amadeo Giannini was the son of Italian-Genoese immigrants. Genoa was a powerful banking center in Europe for centuries. Wealthy banking families from Genoa include the Doria, Spinola, and Pallavicini families. The Bank of Italy now BOA made loans to the wine industry in California as well as to Walt Disney. Roy E Disney was a Vatican Knight of St Gregory. Amadeo Giannini also made loans to FIAT in Italy after WWII. John Elkann is Chairman for FIAT and married to Donna Lavinia Borromeo. Pierre Casiraghi is married to Beatrice Borromeo and his mother is Princess Caroline of Hanover and she is the daughter of Prince Rainier III of Monaco from the Genoese House of Grimaldi. The central bank of Italy is called the Bank of Italy. The Borromeo family were noble landowners, merchants, and bankers that did business in Venice and Florence. The first Director of the Italian Bank of Italy was Bonaldo Stringher who was from Venice. Luigi Einaudi was the third Director of the Bank of Italy and from Piedmont. The Borromeo family ruled right near Piedmont and still own islands there in Lake Maggiore. The Sella family are bankers and merchants from Piedmonte which currently own Banca Sella Group which operates in Switzerland where banking is private. The Sella family are Court Factors for the House of Borromeo. Amadeo Giannini was really working for the Genoese and Venetian bankers as a proxy to establish one of the largest banking institutions in the United States. Some Genoese-Venetian princes include Prince Moroello Pallavicini, Prince Sigeri Pallavicini, Prince Jonathan Doria-Pamphilj, Prince Vitaliano XI of Borromeo, Baron Girolama de Massa of Giustiniani and Prince Carlo Odescalchi.</p>

<p>Goldman Sachs is being overseen by the Doria-Pamphilj and Sacchetti families of Italy. The Doria name derives from de Auria and Aureo or D&#39;oro which are Italian words for gold. The Doria family started out as a banking family from Genoa. The Sacchetti and Sachs name both mean bags or sacks. Italian Nobility usually have the highest authority in society through Rome&#39;s network of power. There are numerous Jesuit educated top executives working for Goldman Sachs as well as Vatican knights. Peter Oppenheimer is on the board of directors for Goldman Sachs and was Jesuit educated from Santa Clara University. Lakshmi Mittal is another member of Goldman Sachs board of directors and he was Jesuit educated from St. Xavier&#39;s College of Kolkata, India. Edward Gerald Corrigan was a former President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was Jesuit educated from Fordham University, and is currently managing director in the Office of the Chairman at Goldman Sachs and is Chairman for Goldman Sachs USA. The Roman born Mario Draghi who is President of the European Central bank, board member for the Bank for International Settlements, and member of the G30, was Jesuit educated from the Massimiliano Massimo Institute in Rome. Mario Draghi previously worked as vice chairman and managing director of Goldman Sachs International. Peter Sutherland is a Vatican Knight of the Order of St. Gregory, Jesuit educated from Gonzaga College, Bilderberg member, former Director for the Royal Bank of Scotland, and Director of the GAAT and he worked as non-executive Chairman of Goldman Sachs International. Geoffrey Boisi is a Roman Knight of Malta, Jesuit educated from Boston College, member of the Trilateral Commission, Trustee for the Papal Foundation, and worked as a top executive for Goldman Sachs for decades as well as JP Morgan and Freddie Mac. Eileen Rominger was Jesuit educated from Fairfield University, Director of Investment Management at the United States Security and Exchange Commission, and she was the Global Chief Investment Officer of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Debora Spar went to Georgetown&#39;s Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service and has been a member of Goldman Sach&#39;s board of directors. The head of the Sacchetti family today is Prince Urbano Sacchetti of Rome and the head of the Doria family is Prince Jonathan Doria Pamphilj.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When someone says &quot;<em>You should look into them</em> it doesn&#39;t mean &quot;you should accept whatever explanation they give the public to cover up their ulterior motives.&quot;</p>

<p>Who owns the Federal Reserve?</p>

<p>Who owns the Bank of England?</p>

<p>How much money do these institutions handle?</p>

<p>Who audits their transactions?</p>

<p>How common is financial fraud?</p>

<p>Have you heard of Bernie Madoff, Enron, or Worldcom?</p>

<p>If there were financial fraud with these institutions, who would enforce the laws against them?</p>

<p>How much of a revolving door is there between banks and regulators?</p>

<p>Hopefully you get the picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Currency Wars (simplified Chinese: 货币战争; traditional Chinese: 貨幣戰爭; pinyin: Huòbì zhànzhēng) by Song Hongbing,[5] also known as The Currency War,[6] is a bestseller in China, reportedly selling over 200,000 copies in addition to an estimated 400,000 unlicensed copies in circulation[7][8] and is reportedly being read by many senior level government and business leaders in China.[9] Originally published in 2007 the book gained a resurgence in 2009 and is seen as a prominent exponent of a recently emerged genre labeled &quot;economic nationalist&quot; literature.[9] Another bestselling book within this genre is Unhappy China; however, unlike this and other books within this genre, Currency Wars has been received more positively by the Chinese leadership as its recommendations are seen as less aggressive towards the US.[9] The premise of this book is that Western countries are ultimately controlled by a group of private banks, which, according to the book, runs their central banks. This book uses the claim[citation needed] that the Federal Reserve is a private body to support its role. More than one million copies of this book have been sold.[10]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody&#39;s afraid to say it, it&#39;s just that most people aren&#39;t as stupid as you have to be to believe it. </p>

<p>Throughout history, the Church has been a major source of social services such as schooling. There are a bunch of Jesuit/Mormon/Christian universities.</p>

<p>The 10 commandments have had just as much influence in our modern legal system as English Common Law. The Bible and Christian theology have also strongly influenced Western philosophers and political activists. The teachings of Jesus, such as the Parable of the Good Samaritan, are among the important sources for modern notions of Human rights and the welfare measures commonly provided by governments in the West. Long held Christian teachings on sexuality and marriage have also been influential in family life. In general it affected the status of women by condemning infanticide (female infants were more likely to be killed), divorce, incest, polygamy, birth control, abortion and adultery.</p>

<p>Days like Easter and Christmas are marked universally as public holidays; what are they marked on? <strong>Pope Gregory XIII&#39;s Gregorian Calendar has been adopted internationally. Year numbering in the West is taken from the assumed date of the birth of the Church&#39;s founder.</strong></p>
