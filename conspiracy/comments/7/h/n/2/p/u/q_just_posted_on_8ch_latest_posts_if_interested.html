       You'll catch hate for this post, but in a way, the people involved in those threads have been TRAINING for this. There are some expert researchers who know how to find information VERY quickly; they just need a push in the right direction and off they go.

       It's known as a 'LARP'. Live Action Role Play.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very light on the Live Action, but heavy on the Role Play.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Person A' Role Plays as an insider with insider knowledge, and the readers (the Marks) read along while they stroke their own intrigue boners.
      </p>
      <p>
       The LARP usually evolves over time as many people attempt to take up the role of 'Person A', but it's too difficult for most people to keep the follow up characters consistent with the original. Too many authors in the.... kitchen. Furthermore, hell, the very first poster could be an actual 100% real insider - but LARPers take over and obfuscate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost all LARPs immediately break down when they start making verifiable predictions, like dates of future Happenings; the date comes and passes but nothing ever happens. Smart LARPers can keep a successful LARP going for weeks or months, simply by being smart enough to a) not make predictions b) not offer any new information that can be verified c) be as vague as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Q Anon' is the most successful recent LARP. After spamming the shit out of 4chan with CBTS (Calm Before The Storm) threads, they moved the LARP over to 8chan because people wanted the 4chan threads moderated away - tired of spam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people simply get some sense of enjoyment by having something interesting to read and leave it at that. Unfortunately, it seems schizophrenics get too caught up and can't determine fiction from reality.

       So..it's very possible Strzok was involved in the Seattle Trade Summit scandal in the 90s...where Bill Clinton had the FBI, the NSA, the Navy intelligence and a host of others spying on Trade delegates.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've theorized that McMasters was also involved..during his time in Naval intelligence..his bio on Wikipedia has a total blackout of those years.

       The trouble with modern times is that you can fact check most of the larping done these days .... You couldn't do that in 16th century , so he could drug larp his ass off to please the kings and royalty.

      <p>
       Nowadays you are to connect the dots yourself ....
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, I find amuzing that Flat/Hollow Earth Society uses some pilots testimony (forgot his name atm) from before ww2 about how he was flying over Antarctica and suddenly saw beautiful rich in flora scenery , etc.  For christ sakes, people lie now , and they lied even more before. To get attention.

       While I can't endorse the veracity of any specific claims, the early Q anon posts came directly from Trump. This is
       <em>

       iirc it was someone that was with Trump on his plane. There's no way it's Trump, so I'm speculating it was one of his media members that always follows him or an aide

       No, I'm not being funny I'm being smart like you. There's no way that Trump who is super old knows how to use a computer. Old people don't use computers. Also, they don't know what 4chan is. Only young people know what that site is. Therefore it's impossible that it's trump. Also trump doesn't type like that. If you look at his twitter they aren't in the form of cryptic questions. So it has to be a younger aid of his. Why are you hating? We both have the same line of reasoning and top notch reasoning abilities.

       I don't even know why I try sometimes. I come in here, share inside information, with a post history indicating that, at a bare minimum I'm a well-informed lay person, and I get a mailbox full of messages calling me a "LARP" with absolutely no basis for saying so.

       Would we all be happier if I just deleted the truth so it stops offending so many people that get their jollies from disbelieving true things? That's not a sarcastic question, BTW.

       You're above all this hey? Maybe you should

        stay

       above all this more often. People larping like you are is the reason why it's hard to trust more interesting and credible larps like Q could well be. I'd like to believe Q isn't a larp because it means that something good is actually happening. Not just the rapid decline into chaos and conflict that is foretold otherwise.

       You can interpret it however you want. But I know for a fact that Trump was directly, personally involved in making those posts. I'm not guessing or reading tea leaves, this is coming directly from someone who was present in the room.

       Starting to think that Q is a very clever confirm and extent pro-war psyop.  He's steering the "conspiracy community" into a position where war with North Korea and/or Iran are justified, because they have some vague connection to the "deep state" or CIA.  If the Trump admin wanted to piss in the CIA's cheerios, he'd get up in front of the microphone and say, "fuck the CIA."  He won't.  Q is a psyop.  There is no internal war.  They're still blowing resources on defenseless players in the game because the "game" is still a blowout.  Don't be a boob.  Q's "civil war" is as authentic as when George W. said that he was "not of Washington."

       That's really cute, but innuendos != action.  The guy is an expert salesman.  He sells people.  You've been sold to believe that his right wing, pro-elite and anti-98% of people policies are negated by vague innuendos given to the CIA.  That's all that exists in this clip, is a vague innuendo.  I get harassed and experimented on by the intelligence community on a daily basis.  I'm in the Gangstalking program.  It's real.  Do you honestly believe that if a civil war were going on that they would keep blowing resources on relative nobodies?

       I'm noticing a pattern.  Why would two organic conspiracy board posters tell someone to "keep off the conspiracy threads" and to "lay off the conspiracy boards"?  I don't want to accuse anyone of shilling, because it is possible that your opinions have already been crystallized by fake "Gangstalking victims" and propaganda.  Just in case you are organic posters, have you two read the accounts of Weinstein's accusers?  Do I present myself in the same way as the other "targeted individuals" whose accounts you have read?

       You just sound kinda nutty.  We occasionally get people on here that swear they are being mind controlled or stalked ir whatever.  Most of the tiem they prwsemt  with typical schizophrenic symptoms,  but the problem is you cannot convince them of that because their brain is broken.  They can't trust their own senses hut they don't realize it.  You sound like an early version of one of those posters, but who knows?  You coukd legit be a victim of gangstalking.

       The more you understand about the Gestapo, the Stasi, Cointelpro, MK-Ultra, and Jose Delgado, the more apparent it becomes that the next logical step in this sequence of events will be very unsettling - and unbelievable at first - to most people.  My brain is most certainly not broken.  Hindered at times, and probably dulled to a point that it otherwise wouldn't have been, but not broken.

       Yes I am.  It doesn't matter what you believe.  I have been in the GS program for over 10 years.  They experiment on peoples's brains in broad daylight.  They collect the data, and if successful, will refine the system.  I will not keep off the conspiracy threads, because here is where I find hope that news of what's really going on in the world may be disseminated.  Your opinion and your advice are garbage when it comes to me, but probably correct when it comes to Q.  I hope that I'm wrong on that front, but do not believe that I am.

       Never did I see Q hinting at the 'inevitability' of war with NK or iran, on contrary, I feel that the actions are being taken to prevent TPTB from instigating that wars, thus putting Trump in the whole bloody mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, I think that 'major false flags' may happen IN RESPONSE to possibility of major arrests.

       If you study closely what he said, which I know you won't because it requires effort and you obviously prefer to instead talk shit, you will realize that it is impossible to get the kind of information he's given out without being at a very high level, if not Trump himself.

       BUT obviously you're free to go ahead and tell yourself what you need to in order to maintain your black and white perspective on things. As long as it makes the world easier for you to process.

       If you read them, he doesn't make predictions, he presents questions.
Also people seem to confuse how things are phrased and typed, thinking at surface level. So if he says 11.4, they immediately think Nov 4th, but in reality you present dates as 11/4.

       It's a trail of questions that lead to what people already want the truth to be. It's taking reports and speculation that has existed for months or even years and presenting them in question form so people feel super special for "figuring it out". Very little that they predicted has actually come to pass, but lots of it has appeared to be relevant because it gets writeups in the normal right-wing sources.

       It couldn't be more clear this is just a longtime conspiracy theorist, possibly with a long-severed connection to official sources.

       You're definitely one of the smart ones. Peter Strzok's collusion has existed for years and there has been wide reports on his links to comey, mccabe, his wife and the russian dossier. The details and inner workings are on the front page of every news media site right now. Q just took those articles and turned each event into a question.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people figure out each question they feel "super special" just like how I feel super special when I call bullshit on Q posts. The only difference is that it takes more effort and intelligence to figure out the questions, but since im much smarter than everyone else all i have to do is call LARP to get my self-esteem boost. Other people actually have to use their brain.

       A real inside source would be clairvoyant and predict the future. They would also be telepathic and tell us what the enemies are thinking. Q is a LARP. We are a lot alike, I'm smart just like you.

       Wasn't into him until his last couple posts. If you look at his old post, Q has been on track. Lots of people dismiss him here which I get, but too many want to just call him a Larper so they don't feel fooled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just dig into what Q says and you'll come out understanding the current situation (maybe) far better. It's a read between the lines of what's going on kinda thing.

       Code for I said something relevant to the convo without saying I'd go dig it up. You asked I said google it. Now you can google it and prove to me I'm wrong. I don't see why you keep commenting, this will probly go nowhere. I'll keep going though.

       So instead of doing the research and looking into it for yourself, you let some anonymous poster "verify" for you that this is LARP when it literally could be anyone telling you to believe anything. Very smart approach to discernment there.

       He did predict the Saudi purge. That and a few other things like the Rothschild helicopter crash leads me to think he is someone in the know. Might not be who he says he is, but he does have access/clearance to secret information.

       He's only still anonymous because of the disinformation that he throws in. If you reveal exactly what you know it makes it easier for the bad guys to track you down, especially if you are at a clearance level where only a handful of people know what you know.

       The Q source (also Q document, Q Gospel, Q Sayings Gospel, or Q from German: Quelle, meaning "source") is a hypothetical written collection of primarily Jesus' sayings (logia). Q is part of the common material found in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke but not in the Gospel of Mark. According to this hypothesis, this material was drawn from the early Church's Oral Tradition.[1][2][3]

       What is the point of asking questions and not providing answers?

      <p>
       Is it to set conspiracy theorists down a certain path in the hunt for information?

       Would it not be easier &amp; more productive for the leaker to simply provide that information?

       Does asking rhetorical questions not function simply as a tactic to distract conspiracy theorists with fun "wild goose chases" so that they don't pay as much attention to the real news?

       Q explained this several times before. If he just gave away the intel that he has it could be traced back to him and put him/his family in danger. There are only a handful of people with the level of clearance that he possesses, which allows one to have a very big picture view of everything that is going on in the geopolitical scene.

       Cool story, and it could all very well be true. It could also just be geopolitical theater for a new generation that lives online. As long as the water's still fluoridated, the skies are still sprayed, the food's still poisoned, and we keep getting pilfered by banks and corporations, it doesn't change anything about our day-to-day lives. LARP or not, it's a distraction from your own self-improvement. Focus on bettering your life for you and your loved ones.

       That's really cute, but innuendos != action.  The guy is an expert salesman.  He sells people.  You've been sold to believe that his right wing, pro-elite and anti-98% of people policies are negated by vague innuendos given to the CIA.  That's all that exists in this clip, is a vague innuendo.  I get harassed and experimented on by the intelligence community on a daily basis.  I'm in the Gangstalking program.  It's real.  Do you honestly believe that if a civil war were going on that they would keep blowing resources on relative nobodies?

       I'm noticing a pattern.  Why would two organic conspiracy board posters tell someone to "keep off the conspiracy threads" and to "lay off the conspiracy boards"?  I don't want to accuse anyone of shilling, because it is possible that your opinions have already been crystallized by fake "Gangstalking victims" and propaganda.  Just in case you are organic posters, have you two read the accounts of Weinstein's accusers?  Do I present myself in the same way as the other "targeted individuals" whose accounts you have read?

       You're definitely one of the smart ones. Peter Strzok's collusion has existed for years and there has been wide reports on his links to comey, mccabe, his wife and the russian dossier. The details and inner workings are on the front page of every news media site right now. Q just took those articles and turned each event into a question.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people figure out each question they feel "super special" just like how I feel super special when I call bullshit on Q posts. The only difference is that it takes more effort and intelligence to figure out the questions, but since im much smarter than everyone else all i have to do is call LARP to get my self-esteem boost. Other people actually have to use their brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       A real inside source would be clairvoyant and predict the future. They would also be telepathic and tell us what the enemies are thinking. Q is a LARP. We are a lot alike, I'm smart just like you.
