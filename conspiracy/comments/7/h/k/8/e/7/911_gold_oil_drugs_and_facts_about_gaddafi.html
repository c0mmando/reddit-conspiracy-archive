       Over 50 trillion in gold, opium, lithium, water, cash and oil was stolen in the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and the destruction of Libya and assassination of Gaddafi . 
Remember Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction and was not involved in 9/11 But his country’s wealth was looted nevertheless. Then they went to Afghanistan to secure the poppy fields and lithium mines by force after the Taliban destroyed all of the poppy. After that we went and killed Gaddafi in Libya to gain control of his 22 plus tons of gold, the 30 trillion plus river pipeline that would have brought africa back to life and the diamonds, silver and other deposits. All around the world there is war and genocide for gold, oil, drugs and other natural resources and all of it goes back to the Rothschild’s, Vatican, Royals and Bankers yet they claim we owe trillions in debt to the same families that have robbed, raped and pillaged every country in this world. Its time to eliminate the greed and redistribute everything they own to those in need. 
Also note that Osama Bin Laden was a cia agent and scapegoat used to bring us to war so we could pass the Patriot Act, to hide the evidence in tower 7 of the enron scandal and other corporate crimes and to steal billions worth of gold held in the vaults of the towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       10 Facts about Gaddafi that they dont want to tell you:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         In Libya a home is considered a natural human right
In Gaddafi’s Green Book it states: ”The house is a basic need of both the individual and the family, therefore it should not be owned by others”. Gaddafi’s Green Book is the formal leader’s political philosophy, it was first published in 1975 and was intended reading for all Libyans even being included in the national curriculum.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Education and medical treatment were all free
Under Gaddafi, Libya could boast one of the best healthcare services in the Middle East and Africa. Also if a Libyan citizen could not access the desired educational course or correct medical treatment in Libya they were funded to go abroad.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Gaddafi carried out the world’s largest irrigation project
The largest irrigation system in the world also known as the great manmade river was designed to make water readily available to all Libyan’s across the entire country. It was funded by the Gaddafi government and it said that Gaddafi himself called it ”the eighth wonder of the world”.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It was free to start a farming business
If any Libyan wanted to start a farm they were given a house, farm land and live stock and seeds all free of charge.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A bursary was given to mothers with newborn babies
When a Libyan woman gave birth she was given 5000 (US dollars) for herself and the child.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Electricity was free
Electricity was free in Libya meaning absolutely no electric bills!
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Cheap petrol
During Gaddafi’s reign the price of petrol in Libya was as low as 0.14 (US dollars) per litre.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Gaddafi raised the level of education
Before Gaddafi only 25% of Libyans were literate. This figure was brought up to 87% with 25% earning university degrees.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Libya had It’s own state bank
Libya had its own State bank, which provided loans to citizens at zero percent interest by law and they had no external debt.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The gold dinar
Before the fall of Tripoli and his untimely demise, Gaddafi was trying to introduce a single African currency linked to gold. Following in the foot steps of the late great pioneer Marcus Garvey who first coined the term ”United States of Africa”. Gaddafi wanted to introduce and only trade in the African gold Dinar – a move which would have thrown the world economy into chaos.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The Dinar was widely opposed by the ‘elite’ of today’s society and who could blame them. African nations would have finally had the power to bring itself out of debt and poverty and only trade in this precious commodity. They would have been able to finally say ‘no’ to external exploitation and charge whatever they felt suitable for precious resources. It has been said that the gold Dinar was the real reason for the NATO led rebellion, in a bid to oust the outspoken leader.

       Yes it did, because I have heard all this before and have never seen a single source. If this were true, great. I like evidence more than confirmation bias, though.

       Libya was also democratic. Citizens voted on local, regional, and national policies. I forget what publication, Time perhaps, itself noted that Libya was a democratic state.
