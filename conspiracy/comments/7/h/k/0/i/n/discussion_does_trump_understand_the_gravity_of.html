        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know that many of you came to this thread to defend president. But allow me first to make a case.</p>

<p>Last week the president tweeted a video from a far-right party in Britain. This video was poorly sourced and showed Muslims attacking white Christians and was used as evidence of Muslims being violent Etc. And Trump tweeted this out there were Travel warnings sent out to everyone who is traveling abroad and some people had to be pulled out of embassies in the Middle East due to the inflammatory nature of these videos. My question is this. Did Trump know that this was going to happen when you posted the video and if so did he do it anyway just to get a rise of it media? Or did he do it for some other reason? And does he understand the potential repercussions of his actions?</p>

<p>In addition let me say this. Hillary Clinton also put people are embassies in danger. A big difference here though is that Hillary Clinton denied extra security to embassies. The danger was already there. And Trump&#39;s case he went out and made the danger himself. What was his reason for doing this? Why would he create so much danger for Americans all over the world with one tweet? And why did he tweet that video in particular?</p>

You can call the tax cuts horrible against the middle class but you are not looking at the pass through for small businesses.  Business income is shown on personal returns.

<p>It&#39;s not mental gymnastics.  The warning was issued because of trumps tweet.  It&#39;s mental gymnastics to think the blame should be placed elsrwhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true that for all the good that has happened since he was elected, he seems responsible for very little of it.  The stock market is way up, but his fiscal policies didn&#39;t start until last october, for example.  </p>

<p>I only mentioned clinton because I knew someone on here would go &quot;well hilary did blah blah blah&quot;!  And I would have to answer to it.  Which is pretty sad.</p>

<p>But he is putting americans in danger internationally.  And I do t give a shit about what hilary did or would have done, she&#39;s not president and never was, thank god.  But he is out of control, and I suspect he doesn&#39;t realize what he&#39;s doing.</p>

<p>We should all be suspicious of anyone and I mean ANYONE that seeks to paint BILLIONS   of people woth such a broad brush.  Anyone that says people who are part of a group of that many people are angry/violent/untrustworthy/racist/etc is not saying that because it&#39;s a fact, they&#39;re saying it because they are trying to sell you on the idea that it&#39;s true so you will think the way they want you to.</p>

<p>I already plenty of my own thoughts, I don&#39;t want someone doing my thinking for me.not to mention the fact that there are over a billion muslims on earth.  They can&#39;t ALL be violent extremeists.  If they were, they wouldn&#39;t be extremists.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been thinking a lot about one aspect of Trump.  He doesn&#39;t back down.  I have a daughter in middle school.  Last year was horrific.  They are SO MEAN!  This year I have changed my perspective.  They are RUDE and my daughter is not a victim.  Fuck &#39;em.  Everyone isn&#39;t going to like you.</p>

<p>Rosie.  He blasted her.  Yup.  He did it.  But she started it.  He could have been above the fray and let her trash talk him.  But no.  He smacked her right in the mouth.  Mike Tyson said it best, &quot;everyone has a plan, until they are punched in the mouth.&quot;  </p>

<p>Kasich was the kinder gentler moderate republican candidate.  He was not a right wing nut job like Cruz and not a eunuch like JEB!  </p>

<p>Hillary was so corrupt and her greed so glaring that many people were completely turned off by her.  But she had all of the media and power behind her.  She took down Bernie easily.  But Kasich.  He was a &quot;good guy.&quot;  Then she got him.  One slip turned inside out.  He said women came out of their kitchens to vote for him.  It was used by the Clinton campaign, out of context, and made him look like a sexist buffoon.  He apologized!  The dummy apologized!  I even called him, &quot;women-in-kitchens-Kasich.&quot;  After the election I researched the clip.  Hillary had gotten him and he did not fight back.  We see how Kasich did.  <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/what-kasich-really-said-about-women-coming-out-of-their-kitchens">http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/what-kasich-really-said-about-women-coming-out-of-their-kitchens</a></p>

<p>So Trump fights back.  The media and D.C. hate him.  The elites him.  entire college campuses hate him. Trump derangement syndrome is real.  They are going to attack him non-stop no matter what.  So really what does he have to lose?  </p>

<p>&quot;Oh my, I wish he didn&#39;t tweet!&quot;  But if he didn&#39;t he would have absolutely no voice.  The media and elites treat him like a clown. </p>

<p>Next point.  Take back Constantinople.   </p>
