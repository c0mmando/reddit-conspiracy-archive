    <div class="md"><p>So weird. There was a post just like this about the Dixie Chicks six months or so ago. </p>

<p>It was also WRONG and MISINFO.</p>

<p>After the Dix Chix badmouthed Bush, they had a few months of bad press, yes. BUT...they regrouped and put out their best, most popular and most successful album of their career: &quot;Taking the Long Way.&quot;</p>

<p>The Dixie Chicks album &quot;Taking the Long Way,&quot; released in 2006, 
debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200. It sold over 2.5 million copies in the U.S. It was certified 2x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. </p>

<p>It also won 5 Grammy Awards, including the top award, Album of the Year. It also won significant Grammys for Record of the Year, and Song of the Year. </p>

<p>So no. The comments about George Bush did not &quot;end their career.&quot; It was a precursor to the pinnacle of their career.</p>

<p>Glad I could clear that up. AGAIN.</p>

I’m just getting sick of seeing all these people say what ever they want and having no repercussions.

    <div class="md"><p>So to &quot;restore justice&quot; or correct the injustices you perceive - what would be your solutions?  </p>

<p>Think deeply about the ramifications of what you propose because while you consider yourself currently on the &quot;right side&quot;, any ramifications need to be considered from when you&#39;re on the &quot;wrong side&quot;.  Why?  Because history has shown us repeatedly that times change and what people value changes and many who used to be in the majority are now in the minority.</p>

<p>Not only that, someone can be thrust into the minority by someone else&#39;s bad memory - case-in-point, your bad memory about what actually went down with the Dixie Chicks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which sort of invalidates your point. The issue is not that the Dixie Chicks personally suffered. It is that that particular audience dropped them entirely. Supposedly for disrespecting the president. But that audience&#39;s subsequent behavior shows they don&#39;t give a damn about that issue. Their  first audience spent 8 years disrespecting the president: they dropped the Dixie Chicks because that audience liked a war that killed Muslims.</p>
