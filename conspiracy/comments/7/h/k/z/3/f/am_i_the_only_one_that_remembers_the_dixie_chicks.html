       So weird. There was a post just like this about the Dixie Chicks six months or so ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was also WRONG and MISINFO.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the Dix Chix badmouthed Bush, they had a few months of bad press, yes. BUT...they regrouped and put out their best, most popular and most successful album of their career: "Taking the Long Way."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Dixie Chicks album "Taking the Long Way," released in 2006, 
debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200. It sold over 2.5 million copies in the U.S. It was certified 2x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also won 5 Grammy Awards, including the top award, Album of the Year. It also won significant Grammys for Record of the Year, and Song of the Year.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no. The comments about George Bush did not "end their career." It was a precursor to the pinnacle of their career.
      </p>
      <p>
       Glad I could clear that up. AGAIN.

       Okay thanks for the info, honesty not a huge Dixie chicks fan. I just remember my mom talking about it a lot back in the day. I’m just getting sick of seeing all these people say what ever they want and having no repercussions. I get they have the right to say it, that’s not the issue, I’m all for free speech, I just think it’s very unjust for some to get crucified while others are still celebrated for the same types of actions, thoughts, or words.

       I wasn't much of a DixChix fan either until "Taking the Long Way." It's an excellent album, not as "country" as their earlier material.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very good songwriting. If you're on Spotify, I recommend "Taking the Long Way Home" and "Not Ready to Make Nice" as the place to start.

       So to "restore justice" or correct the injustices you perceive - what would be your solutions?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think deeply about the ramifications of what you propose because while you consider yourself currently on the "right side", any ramifications need to be considered from when you're on the "wrong side".  Why?  Because history has shown us repeatedly that times change and what people value changes and many who used to be in the majority are now in the minority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, someone can be thrust into the minority by someone else's bad memory - case-in-point, your bad memory about what actually went down with the Dixie Chicks.

       Over here in Australia we heard that MSM and Radio were boycotting the group and would not be giving them air time, I remember there was an interview with them on TV here and they said that this did happen and was still happening a few years after the incident.

       I live in Texas and listened to  country radio, I never heard them on the radio after that. It was a different time, people still listened to radio. They may have released that album but it didn't get any airtime where I live.

       The album sold a ton, won a bunch of awards. But I do agree it looks like radio largely blacklisted them.

       Which sort of invalidates your point. The issue is not that the Dixie Chicks personally suffered. It is that that particular audience dropped them entirely. Supposedly for disrespecting the president. But that audience's subsequent behavior shows they don't give a damn about that issue. Their  first audience spent 8 years disrespecting the president: they dropped the Dixie Chicks because that audience liked a war that killed Muslims.

       They liked a war that brought revenge against people who that audience was convinced by media that certain Muslim countries attacked the United States on 9/11. The whole things was a psyop shit show.

       Well, if Buddhists had been framed for blowing up the WTC, that crowd would've been down will killing Buddhists. The way you write it suggests this is more about killing Muslims than just general revenge.

       I saw that live on TV and wish I had recorded it.  She basically held up a picture of the current pope and said into the microphone "FIGHT THE REAL ENEMY" and then tore up the picture.

       I remember thinking "DAMN" and being shocked....but this was back before the days of the DVR so I couldn't rewind it and Saturday Night Live has never released to episode....or they've edited out the controversial part.

       that was becuas the country music fans are pedominitly conservative. and Bush was alota ppls 9/11 hero.

       The Dixie Chicks pissed off their fan base. That's what happened. Most country fans are conservative. They got support from the liberal media but once they lost interest, their real fans never came back. Im from Texas and I remeber hearing that last popular got sales but their concerts werent very popular. Liberals wee buting the album and giving them awards to support them, but real country music fans never accepted them again.
