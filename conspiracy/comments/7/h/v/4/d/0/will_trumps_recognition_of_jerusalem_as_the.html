        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With the backing of the US I think the Jewish people will begin building their third temple in Jerusalem.  The Temple Institute has all the preperations to build the temple but they are waiting on something... What could that be???  I think that they are waiting for a super power (aka the United States) to back them militarily against Palestine.  It is OBVIOUS that the Trump administration is going hard in the middle east and Jared (who is Jewish) is very very close with Netenyahu is making huge changes in the middle east right now.  I think that this could be a massive massive massive event and could identify Jared as the antichrist especially if the Temple Institute and Netenyahu announce that Jared was the key person in the building of the temple.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they have announced where but most likely be built on the temple mount.  And if Jared can negotiate peace between the Arabs and Jews allowing the temple to be built there, that would cement his role as the antichrist IMO</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it says that he won&#39;t honor the god of his ancestors or of the desires of women.  That does NOT mean he will be single it means that he won&#39;t honor the god of his Jewish ancestors and will only honor one god and that god is MAN.  We must think what are the &quot;desires of women&quot; that this verse is talking about.  I personally believe that it is talking of love, family, and empathy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I interpret this verse differently than you do. I believe he will be single for several reasons.
Firstly, God considers marriage to be holy and good as he is the one that created the idea to begin with. The Antichrist will be against anything Godly and therefore will abstain from marriage. 
Secondly, it says desire of women not desires of women. He will forsake the desire or need for women. So I agree that he will forsake love and family etc. 
Next, the god that the Antichrist will honor is not man it will be himself and only himself as he will be a man inhabited by Satan. See 2 Thessalonians 2:4
Lastly, he will only have a short time to complete his mission thusly all distractions will be put off. Just as the 144,000 witnesses will all be single to devote all their time and energy into following The Lamb and proclaiming the Gospel so too will the Antichrist devote all his time and energy into deceiving the world. But that’s just my interpretation. I enjoy discussing this topic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just think it’s a little more different than something that could be easily proven false. In today’s day and age people could easily prove whether or not someone is married based off of public record. Making it so that he wasn’t the ultimate deceiver. </p>

<p>You won&#39;t be able to convert when you see Jesus.  It will be too late.  There is a reason it&#39;s called &quot;Grace by faith alone.&quot;  My theory is when Jesus returns the Antichrist will have the trans-humanist world thinking they are the avengers defending Earth from some Alien world ending invader.

    <div class="md"><p>Happy Advent!</p>

<p><strong>A New Heaven and a New Earth</strong></p>

<p>Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,” for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.  <em>I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.</em>  And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.  ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”</p>

<p>He who was seated on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” Then he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”</p>

<p>He said to me: “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life.  Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children.  But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”</p>

<p><strong>The New Jerusalem, the Bride of the Lamb</strong></p>

<p>One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”  And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.  It shone with the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.  It had a great, high wall with twelve gates, and with twelve angels at the gates. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.  There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south and three on the west.  The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p>

<p>The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city, its gates and its walls.  The city was laid out like a square, as long as it was wide. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12,000 stadia in length, and as wide and high as it is long.  The angel measured the wall using human measurement, and it was 144 cubits thick. The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as pure as glass.  The foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, the fifth onyx, the sixth ruby, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth turquoise, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The great street of the city was of gold, as pure as transparent glass.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+21&amp;amp;version=NIV">I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.</a>  The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and the Lamb is its lamp.  The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it.  On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there.  The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it.  Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.</p>

<p>Israel is the most strategic location on the planet militarily. That is it.

Jews, Romans, Muslims, crusaders, Christians, Zionist, British, Americans, monarchies, religions, politicians, and media all understand the importance of this location. </p>

<p>They can&#39;t tell you &quot;we need to invade Jerusalem to gain a strategic advantage&quot; so they craft some bullshit narrative to get enough support for invasion. Zionist are a mere rebranding of taking the strategic location that is Israel. So the created some bullshit story to get enough public support to invade and conquor the earths crossroads.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, its called the red heifer. Has to be completely red and without any faults. To Jews, that means not a single hair can be anything other than red.
There is a special kind of offering perscribed for opening a temple, where ashes mixed with water is required to be sprinkled upon all the tools of the temple in order to dedicate it.</p>

<p>There has been a few cancidate calfs but so far they have all been rejected for being defective. Also some hope has been placed in genetical modification in order to make such a cow a reality.</p>

<p>But even if they have the cow, the temple needs a location, there is only one single location in the world that this temple can be built, and traditionally that is of course at the point where the dome of the rock sits today. Very deliberatly so, they placed it there as a sign of Islams triumph over Judeism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a King James Bible believing Christian I certainly hope so.  The temple has to be rebuilt according to Bible prophecy (Antichrist will sit in it, confirm the covenant, and call himself god) and if it happens now it&#39;s a sign of the times.  We will be at the doorstep of Jacob&#39;s trouble.  For all the Bible deniers get ready for the fake Alien invasion and then their defeat by your future hero the Antichrist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1611 sent from heaven!</p>

<p>Couldn&#39;t all these temple prophecies be interpreted spiritually?
If the temple of the holy spirit is within us and the Antichrist sits in the temple calling himself God, I mean, that sounds like the exact same spiritual problem with Christians today. They consume the goods of the whore of babylon, and the antichrist could be a sort of Christ-View if you will. A poorly constructed christlike figure that has the world by the yannis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I follow the doctrine of dispensationalism (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI4CteEFxOk&amp;amp;list=PLFIc5Y7xpsJIvVrGdYpWTo3fdoOB7NBXo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI4CteEFxOk&amp;amp;list=PLFIc5Y7xpsJIvVrGdYpWTo3fdoOB7NBXo</a>).  It&#39;s the only way to make everything fit with no contradictions and is a Biblical term.   We are also commanded to &quot;rightly divide.&quot;</p>

<p>2Ti 2:15  Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>

<p>So, I believe God is not done with Israel.  If you spiritualize then usually that will also put you in the time of Jacob&#39;s trouble.  Rev 7: 4-8 shows literal tribes of Israel being marked.  Not the Church.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like spirtualizing or allegorizing because it allows one to interpret things the way they want to.  It&#39;s similar to going back to the Greek.  Depending on the lexicon and what word one picks from the multiple options one can come up with completely different doctrine.</p>

<p>I do believe there is an Antichrist spirit though that is at work today (has been for a long time) and is leading many false Christians today.</p>

<p>1Jn 4:3  And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Temple will be built at some point or another in our generation.</p>

<p>However, I doubt this will make much of a difference directly, as it can&#39;t be built until the messiah arrives.  No, no REAL Jew (at least the ones that use their heads) will ever consider Jared the messiah.  </p>

<p>Also, a secular Israeli government would not be interested in starting a huge war, just to build a  Temple which they don&#39;t believe in.  Also, the secular gov wants more Jews to come live there, and more war means less Jews...But maybe I&#39;m wrong.  I highly doubt I&#39;m wrong, as it is fairly simple logic.</p>
