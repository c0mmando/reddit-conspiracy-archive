<p>Who are these people?</p>

<p>Who do they work for?</p>

<p>Who funds this shadowy mysterious group? How do they recruit?</p>

<p>What is their overarching agenda? Anti-science? pro-bible? Distract us from something more important? Is it possible for us to know? obviously some interdimensional illuminati lizards or something must be involved.</p>

<p>A few things I do notice, it often, if not almost always ties back to a religious agenda.
I am not sure if it is uniformly true, but a lot of things that come in flat earth discussions involve dinosaurs being fake, and it&#39;s hard to ignore the Genesis connection to the firmament. It leads me to think that many use it as a vehicle to assert the bible is true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh really? Do you know that the very foundations of modern science was created in ancient mystery schools and the occult? Going all the way back to Pythagoras. Newton was heavy in the occult and alchemy. Those are but two examples, and there are plenty more. The majority of people take science as a belief purely on faith alone. Not science, experimentation, and  personal observing. Merely what a priest class has written in a book.</p>

<p>You sir or madam, are the deluded one.  Your ignorance of history is quite telling. You are a parishioner in the church of Science, and you don&#39;t even know it. To me, that is even worse than being a FE&#39;r. </p>

It is a very wide brush you are painting with there. Don&#39;t assume everyone is in the same boat. I have studied a lot if it myself, so I have to disagree with you.</p>

<p>I spent years as a &quot;zombie&quot; listening to what I was tokd, doig what I was told, accepting what I was told. Until I grew&quot; critical thinking. I started asking questions, investigating evolution, and resolving my beliefs. I know what being a &quot;sheep is like&quot;. And I despise it. So I know what it feels like. You haven&#39;t the slightest clue of my knowledge of history either. So your judgements about me, while all your own, are definitely off base. You can think I&#39;m &quot;a parishoner in the church of science&quot; all you like if that helps your mind accept your beliefs are what you want them to be. But I have no doubts about my own skeptical nature, inquiring intellect and thirst for answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But we glossed over the relevant point. What does the fact that Newton believed in and practiced alchemy have to do with it? Utterly irrelevant. It was effectively, if not openly accepted as science at the time.</p>

<p>But guess what? When it was found to have no actual scientific basis it was discarded. That&#39;s science! That is what science is about.
Flat earthism is about trickery, obfuscation, relying on obscurity in hopes people won&#39;t research said claims, and, often outright  prevarication.</p>

You are taught in school about the scientific method and how you can PROVE things using science. So now your all programmed up to believe when researches discover and scientists conclude and blah blah fucking blah. Truth is soooo much scientific law and research is just the bullshit we think we know right now. The science community is as closed off from releasing real truths as the governments are for giving real freedoms. It is all bought and paid for pseudoscience.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No. Scientific law is law. I suggest reading an overview of what it <em>means</em>. A hypothesis is only a hypothesis. A theory is a theory. Educate yourself on what they mean. When we have a theory, it is based on known observed information. If there is new information that changes or refutes it, it is changed, or discarded as needed. Guess the fuck what? That <em>is</em> what science is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s perfectly reasonable to conclude that the earth is not a sphere.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it isn&#39;t. Please provide any evidence whatsoever.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The flat earth model is logical and reasonable and there explanations for most observed natural events.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No it isn&#39;t. It requires gravity to not exist (which it does) and for other planets and stars to be magically floating in the air and moving in strange patterns all over the place with no explanation whatsoever. It requires the sun to magically only shine on certain parts of the earth in the perfect shape for if it was a sphere.   </p>

<p>How about <a href="https://www.google.com/flights/#search;f=JNB;t=SYD;d=2017-12-26;r=2017-12-30">this?</a> Those are tickets to fly from South Africa to Sydney on a direct flight. On the flat earth model that distance is tens of thousands of miles and would send you <a href="https://www.metabunk.org/attachments/flat-earth-sydney-to-johannesburg-jpg.15089/">right over Asia.</a>. Not only is that well beyond what any commercial aircraft can achieve, it would also be impossible with the time of that flight. Also, that flight never flies anywhere near Asia.  </p>

<p>Could you also explain to me what the deal with satellites is? You know you can see them from earth, right? Not only that, but if you drop a few bucks on a receiver, you can even steal images from them when they are sent back down to earth. You can even track these satellites as they fly about. Could you explain to me how <a href="https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/2010/05/ralf.jpg">this</a> picture exists? That&#39;s a shot of the ISS from the surface of earth. You can see the thing go by during the night too.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but the flat earth &quot;theory&quot; is idiotic and does not deserve any respect. I sincerely feel bad for anyone who has been duped into believing it.</p>

to be fair, it is challenging to build a scientific model based on &quot;gravity&quot; without resorting to mental gymnastics.  he gave it his best though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. You don&#39;t counter the argument about tides at all, you just dismiss it. Typical. Same thing with gravity. Incredible how thousands of genius minds can come up with how gravity works, prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, then you think that you in your infinite genius can just dismiss it with the wave of a hand.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you don&#39;t need to fly over asia  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then how would you do it? Take a massive curving path out towards the &quot;edge&quot;? That would add even more miles. Sorry buddy, it&#39;s completely impossible.  </p>

<p>Actually, that picture proves that there is a giant flying spacecraft 250 miles straight up. I am confused as to how you would make a an aircraft that looks like that, yet is somehow aerodynamically stable and able to fly for literally years on end at incredible speeds without making so much as a sound. You know you can track these things right? You can even listen to radio chatter between the spacecraft and the ground.  </p>

<p>So you ignored a lot of my comment, and only went after the stuff that you thought you could debunk, which you failed utterly to do.  </p>

<p>Sorry man, the earth isn&#39;t flat. If you want to give me any evidence whatsoever that it is, feel free.   </p>

<p>If an ancient Greek mathematician could come up with the fact that the earth was round and give almost an exact figure for its circumference over 2,000 years ago, I think you can come to the same conclusion with the near endless wealth of knowledge that we have today.  </p>

<p>You are not helping anything. You are trying to deceive people, and are trying your very hardest to drag us backwards. We know so much about the world and have the incredible technology we have today because we fallowed the evidence and the facts. You are actively choosing to ignore them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes well maybe you should stick around for a while before shovelling any guff about any so-called &quot;stacks of threads&quot; pushing the Flat Earth idea on this forum. </p>

<p>Of course some Flat-Earthers among us respond or try to respond to these threads aimed against them with counter-points of their own and many others also do simply as a matter of principle.</p>

<p>About once a week someone posts a thread here pitching the idea that that the Flat Earth Movement is some kind of psy-op to discredit and belittle what they call &quot;the conspiracy community&quot; which they have nothing but their own opinion and nothing else to offer to substantiate or back that up but the official line and information mainly from NASA that is both questionable and  the focus of any number of other conspiracies around here, starting with the Moon landings, the Challenger incident, and all kinds of anomalous items from the ISS that don&#39;t pass muster and clearly appear to be faked upon close examination. A Flat Earth is one of many possible explanations for whatever NASA is really up to that makes what the Flat Earthers are up to worth keeping an eye on. They certainly believe that explains those oddities.</p>

<p>Just for the record, the opposite of belief isn&#39;t &quot;disbelief&quot;, but *doubt&quot; and most of us are here not out of any &quot;disbelief&quot; or need to debunk any official story lines but because there isn&#39;t enough reliable information in any those official narratives for us to possibly believe them in the first place no matter what authorative source is trying to convince us that&#39;s good enough, when it clearly isn&#39;t. So we look for more information and remain open to other and alternative explanations based on whatever turns up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason that flat Earth theory exists is because NASA is full of lies and propaganda. </p>

<p>A group of people have rejected everything that NASA says including the shape of the Earth. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very hard to independently see the shape of the Earth because (apparently) the roundness is too subtle to detect by our line of sight, even at very high altitudes. Therefore, the only images of the Earth as a globe come from NASA and other governmental space agencies. </p>

<p>Whether you choose to believe the Earth is round or flat has nothing to do with critical thinking skills. If you could prove the shape easily by experiments on the ground, then there would be no debate. Many tests that supposedly prove the shape of the Earth are not actually adequate and could be explained by other phenomenon. </p>

<p>The vast majority choose to believe NASA and most other scientists throughout history. There is nothing wrong with that, but that does not mean that it is 100% fact. It&#39;s possible that most scientists are wrong, and NASA has been lying about everything. The few people who believe this are not lacking critical thinking skills, they are lacking trust in the judgement and honesty of the scientific institutions.</p>

<p>&quot;Radiation like this could harm the guidance systems, on-board computers or other electronics on Orion,&quot; Smith says. &quot;Shielding will be put to the test as the vehicle cuts through the waves of radiation… We must solve these challenges before we send people through this region of space.&quot;</p>

<p>The systems that have to be radiation hardened are much more complex than in the Apollo era, and any people in an Orion while on mission will be exposed to significantly more radiation than just whats in the VA belts, especially over time (versus immediate exposure) on a mission potentially months or years long; far longer than Apollo mission durations.</p>

<p>The vagaries of radiation hardening of electronics and protecting crew from radiation on a mission many times longer than any before does not, even a little bit back up your claim.</p>

<p>If this is your honest response, then I <em>assume</em> you are a person who prefers to do your own research, correct?  If so, I implore you to click on the hyperlinks which I have included in this post.  Until you actually do so, you are standing on zero legs of honest, factual debate.</p>

<p>Eventually, you&#39;ll wake up, and you&#39;ll realize that you have fallen victim to the single most unfortunate Psyop that has ever been devilishly, and creatively, assembled for identifying individuals who would rather believe a lie than face a truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see alot of people writing off FE as bullshit.</p>

<p>Personally, I truly love to view things from as many perspectives as I can. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t have a solid conclusion for FE or GE. D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We live in a fear based society.
The Bible was not meant to be taken literally. The people that do are slaves of fear. 
The ones who do not are made wise. </p>

<p>The Bible is absolutely FULL of metaphors and allegories. </p>

<p>I think the Earth is flat but for personal reasons. Not biblical. </p>

<p>In order to understand FE you have to view things purely objective. </p>

<p>You NEED to view the world from a different perspective than everyone else because it&#39;s literally about perspective. </p>

<p>200 proofs by Eric Dubay. </p>

<p>Watch a little bit of that. He explains and breaks everything down in detail. </p>

<p>Pretend like you&#39;re in school and you know nothing about the world and Eric is your new teacher. </p>

<p>You have to be open minded. </p>

<p>The world is truly not what it&#39;s portrayed to be. </p>

<p>Watch a few of his videos to really understand how the Flat Earth works. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually watched Eric Dubay&#39;s 200 proofs. All 200 of them are laughably debunkable if you do even the tiniest amount of research. FE &quot;theory&quot; is a joke.  </p>

<p>If you believe in the flat earth &quot;theory&quot;, you are not being open minded. You are only allowing information that confirms the &quot;theory&quot; in, because otherwise you wouldn&#39;t believe it. If you want to make any arguments for the flat earth, I would be happy to debunk them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey I know this isn&#39;t the right place for this but I figured I would start somewhere. Punish me if you must but this is pretty fucking important.</p>

<p>I think both Flat Earthers AND Globe Earthers can agree on one thing. Net Neutrality. The decision to repeal or keep it  December 14th is this Thursday! </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know what it is then I strongly suggest you look into it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s infringement on our rights. </p>

<p>This will effectively kill the first amendment by prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.</p>

<p>The internet is now a necessity for millions and is considered a public domain!</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let this go. It affects each and every one of us common folk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny, as a believer of science I do not believe in tarot cards and I have a better picture thats proof of a round earth. But oddly nobody can offer any good criticism beyond &quot;obviously it&#39;s fake.&quot; But unfortunately, that assertion is not a convincing argument unto itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Checked it out. Your claim doesn&#39;t stand up to scrutiny.</p>

<p>&quot;Radiation like this could harm the guidance systems, on-board computers or other electronics on Orion,&quot; Smith says. &quot;Shielding will be put to the test as the vehicle cuts through the waves of radiation… We must solve these challenges before we send people through this region of space.&quot;</p>

<p>The systems that have to be radiation hardened are much more complex than in the Apollo era, and any people in an Orion while on mission will be exposed to significantly more radiation than just whats in the VA belts, especially over time (versus immediate exposure) on a mission potentially months or years long; far longer than Apollo mission durations.</p>

<p>The vagaries of radiation hardening of electronics and protecting crew from radiation on a mission many times longer than any before does not, even a little bit back up your claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But we glossed over the relevant point. What does the fact that Newton believed in and practiced alchemy have to do with it? Utterly irrelevant. It was effectively, if not openly accepted as science at the time.</p>

<p>But guess what? When it was found to have no actual scientific basis it was discarded. That&#39;s science! That is what science is about.
Flat earthism is about trickery, obfuscation, relying on obscurity in hopes people won&#39;t research said claims, and, often outright  prevarication.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s perfectly reasonable to conclude that the earth is not a sphere. The flat earth model is logical and reasonable and there explanations for most observed natural events.
Don&#39;t be so rigid to think that the globe earth model is infallible. It too is an incomplete model. The tides have never been adequately explained, for example.</p>

<p>What isn&#39;t reasonable is the beligerence that is displayed by people who believe in a globe earth, and who lash out in fits of rage merely because their world views have been challenged.</p>
