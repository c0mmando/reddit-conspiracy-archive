       I think one of the biggest conspiracies going over the last 20 years or so, other than 9/11, JFK and maybe a small small few others, is the Conspiracy to convince people that the earth is flat when there is so much overwhelming and indisputable evidence that the earth is round.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who are these people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who do they work for?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who funds this shadowy mysterious group? How do they recruit?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is their overarching agenda? Anti-science? pro-bible? Distract us from something more important? Is it possible for us to know? obviously some interdimensional illuminati lizards or something must be involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few things I do notice, it often, if not almost always ties back to a religious agenda.
I am not sure if it is uniformly true, but a lot of things that come in flat earth discussions involve dinosaurs being fake, and it's hard to ignore the Genesis connection to the firmament. It leads me to think that many use it as a vehicle to assert the bible is true.

       The point of flat earth is to survey the percentage of humans who will  believe the impossible through cultural influence. This data is later used and applied by mainstream outlets to prey on ignorance and promote propaganda.

       Oh really? Do you know that the very foundations of modern science was created in ancient mystery schools and the occult? Going all the way back to Pythagoras. Newton was heavy in the occult and alchemy. Those are but two examples, and there are plenty more. The majority of people take science as a belief purely on faith alone. Not science, experimentation, and  personal observing. Merely what a priest class has written in a book.
      </p>
      <p>
       You sir or madam, are the deluded one.  Your ignorance of history is quite telling. You are a parishioner in the church of Science, and you don't even know it. To me, that is even worse than being a FE'r.

       You make some pretty "interesting" assumptions there. You are pretty much all good until "The majority of people take...."
It is a very wide brush you are painting with there. Don't assume everyone is in the same boat. I have studied a lot if it myself, so I have to disagree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent years as a "zombie" listening to what I was tokd, doig what I was told, accepting what I was told. Until I grew" critical thinking. I started asking questions, investigating evolution, and resolving my beliefs. I know what being a "sheep is like". And I despise it. So I know what it feels like. You haven't the slightest clue of my knowledge of history either. So your judgements about me, while all your own, are definitely off base. You can think I'm "a parishoner in the church of science" all you like if that helps your mind accept your beliefs are what you want them to be. But I have no doubts about my own skeptical nature, inquiring intellect and thirst for answers.

       Not very sold on giants. Maybe taller than normal, but not much.
Sphinx, I think it is very possible it is a lot older than is commonly believed.
Likewise, how old humanity goes back. I don't have any sort of specific numbers I would rely on, but I am fairly sure humans go back much further than is commonly accepted.

       But we glossed over the relevant point. What does the fact that Newton believed in and practiced alchemy have to do with it? Utterly irrelevant. It was effectively, if not openly accepted as science at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       But guess what? When it was found to have no actual scientific basis it was discarded. That's science! That is what science is about.
Flat earthism is about trickery, obfuscation, relying on obscurity in hopes people won't research said claims, and, often outright  prevarication.

       No no we know that science is good and shit but that’s not what we get. That’s not what we are told about. You are taught in school about the scientific method and how you can PROVE things using science. So now your all programmed up to believe when researches discover and scientists conclude and blah blah fucking blah. Truth is soooo much scientific law and research is just the bullshit we think we know right now. The science community is as closed off from releasing real truths as the governments are for giving real freedoms. It is all bought and paid for pseudoscience. Haberdashery to sway consumers into buying into whatever we are being told will add a few years to our shitty over worked under paid lives. Try this totally revolutionary totally tested and approved new miracle drug, vaccine, zit cream, boner pill, aids medication only $99.95

       No. Scientific law is law. I suggest reading an overview of what it
       <em>
        means
       </em>
       . A hypothesis is only a hypothesis. A theory is a theory. Educate yourself on what they mean. When we have a theory, it is based on known observed information. If there is new information that changes or refutes it, it is changed, or discarded as needed. Guess the fuck what? That
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       what science is.

       Funny, as a believer of science I do not believe in tarot cards and I have a better picture thats proof of a round earth. But oddly nobody can offer any good criticism beyond "obviously it's fake." But unfortunately, that assertion is not a convincing argument unto itself.

       If you think dinosaurs are real then you probably think the world is a ball. This is because you have done near zero research and are meeting the barrier of cognitive dissonance that you find any time you try to expand beyond the limits of your societal programming and group think conditioning.

       I know dinosaurs existed. I also know the earth is round. Because I have spent a significant amount of time researching it. And I have found significant convincing evidence for a round earth. And none for a flat earth. There are literally photographs of the earth and the moon in one image. None of the flat earth. But all that can be offered to explain sorely lacking.

       It's perfectly reasonable to conclude that the earth is not a sphere. The flat earth model is logical and reasonable and there explanations for most observed natural events.
Don't be so rigid to think that the globe earth model is infallible. It too is an incomplete model. The tides have never been adequately explained, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       What isn't reasonable is the beligerence that is displayed by people who believe in a globe earth, and who lash out in fits of rage merely because their world views have been challenged.

       No it isn't. It requires gravity to not exist (which it does) and for other planets and stars to be magically floating in the air and moving in strange patterns all over the place with no explanation whatsoever. It requires the sun to magically only shine on certain parts of the earth in the perfect shape for if it was a sphere.

       Could you also explain to me what the deal with satellites is? You know you can see them from earth, right? Not only that, but if you drop a few bucks on a receiver, you can even steal images from them when they are sent back down to earth. You can even track these satellites as they fly about.

to be fair, it is challenging to build a scientific model based on "gravity" without resorting to mental gymnastics.  he gave it his best though.

       Ok. You don't counter the argument about tides at all, you just dismiss it. Typical. Same thing with gravity. Incredible how thousands of genius minds can come up with how gravity works, prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, then you think that you in your infinite genius can just dismiss it with the wave of a hand.

       Then how would you do it? Take a massive curving path out towards the "edge"? That would add even more miles. Sorry buddy, it's completely impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, that picture proves that there is a giant flying spacecraft 250 miles straight up. I am confused as to how you would make a an aircraft that looks like that, yet is somehow aerodynamically stable and able to fly for literally years on end at incredible speeds without making so much as a sound. You know you can track these things right? You can even listen to radio chatter between the spacecraft and the ground.
      </p>

       So you ignored a lot of my comment, and only went after the stuff that you thought you could debunk, which you failed utterly to do.

       Sorry man, the earth isn't flat. If you want to give me any evidence whatsoever that it is, feel free.

       If an ancient Greek mathematician could come up with the fact that the earth was round and give almost an exact figure for its circumference over 2,000 years ago, I think you can come to the same conclusion with the near endless wealth of knowledge that we have today.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are not helping anything. You are trying to deceive people, and are trying your very hardest to drag us backwards. We know so much about the world and have the incredible technology we have today because we fallowed the evidence and the facts. You are actively choosing to ignore them.

       They have simply been investigating it as scientifically and methodically as they can and bringing to light the reasons why they no longer believe that the world is a globe while steadily accumulating more and more facts that incline them to believe it's flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Facts which they invite anyone to consider and simply make up their own minds about after giving those facts a fair and honest appraisal. Something that none of their opponents are willing to do in an unbiased way nor enter into any real discussions about.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's in no way being forced on anyone, nor is anyone being coerced or manipulated in any sort of a conspiratorial way to believe anything but whatever they choose to about the issue.

       Yes well maybe you should stick around for a while before shovelling any guff about any so-called "stacks of threads" pushing the Flat Earth idea on this forum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course some Flat-Earthers among us respond or try to respond to these threads aimed against them with counter-points of their own and many others also do simply as a matter of principle.
      </p>
      <p>
       About once a week someone posts a thread here pitching the idea that that the Flat Earth Movement is some kind of psy-op to discredit and belittle what they call "the conspiracy community" which they have nothing but their own opinion and nothing else to offer to substantiate or back that up but the official line and information mainly from NASA that is both questionable and  the focus of any number of other conspiracies around here, starting with the Moon landings, the Challenger incident, and all kinds of anomalous items from the ISS that don't pass muster and clearly appear to be faked upon close examination. A Flat Earth is one of many possible explanations for whatever NASA is really up to that makes what the Flat Earthers are up to worth keeping an eye on. They certainly believe that explains those oddities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just for the record, the opposite of belief isn't "disbelief", but *doubt" and most of us are here not out of any "disbelief" or need to debunk any official story lines but because there isn't enough reliable information in any those official narratives for us to possibly believe them in the first place no matter what authorative source is trying to convince us that's good enough, when it clearly isn't. So we look for more information and remain open to other and alternative explanations based on whatever turns up.

       If you do, please research rationally. If you search "flat earth proof" all you are going to get is a bunch of BS from flat earthers that isn't based in reality at all, and is intentionally manipulative and ignorant of fact. Try to research as to why it's NOT true at least as much. Believe me, all of their arguments are laughably easy to debunk.

       The reason that flat Earth theory exists is because NASA is full of lies and propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       A group of people have rejected everything that NASA says including the shape of the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very hard to independently see the shape of the Earth because (apparently) the roundness is too subtle to detect by our line of sight, even at very high altitudes. Therefore, the only images of the Earth as a globe come from NASA and other governmental space agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether you choose to believe the Earth is round or flat has nothing to do with critical thinking skills. If you could prove the shape easily by experiments on the ground, then there would be no debate. Many tests that supposedly prove the shape of the Earth are not actually adequate and could be explained by other phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority choose to believe NASA and most other scientists throughout history. There is nothing wrong with that, but that does not mean that it is 100% fact. It's possible that most scientists are wrong, and NASA has been lying about everything. The few people who believe this are not lacking critical thinking skills, they are lacking trust in the judgement and honesty of the scientific institutions.

       Lately they have really contradicted themselves with the moon missions by stating they are not able to send humans through the Van Allen Radiation Belt and they state that they no longer have the ability to travel past low earth orbit. You can find videos of officials who say we cannot explore past low earth orbit, just go check it out.

       Checked it out. Your claim doesn't stand up to scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Radiation like this could harm the guidance systems, on-board computers or other electronics on Orion," Smith says. "Shielding will be put to the test as the vehicle cuts through the waves of radiation… We must solve these challenges before we send people through this region of space."
      </p>
      <p>
       The systems that have to be radiation hardened are much more complex than in the Apollo era, and any people in an Orion while on mission will be exposed to significantly more radiation than just whats in the VA belts, especially over time (versus immediate exposure) on a mission potentially months or years long; far longer than Apollo mission durations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vagaries of radiation hardening of electronics and protecting crew from radiation on a mission many times longer than any before does not, even a little bit back up your claim.

       Ok, well that was only one part of my "claim" and from one of the NASA representatives. The Astronauts from the Apollo missions have shown no signs of excess radiation from their time through the radiation belts or while on the Moon.

       Yes, the apollo missions had sufficient shielding for the comparstively short time they were in space and the very short time they were in the VA belt. What you quoted was a distortion of what was actually said. Not that I am accusing you of creating said distortion. In no way did they say it can not be done, nor that they have never sent people beyond LEO.

       Propaganda is used by governments to bolster public support, which then allows them to undertake or continue unpopular campaigns, often war. There's a wikipedia page on

       If you do a little research you'll uncover enough NASA lies to question your own sanity. I'll start you off with one undeniable lie about the Apollo mission. You can web search or youtube search "NASA lies" or similar and find many examples of obvious deceit.

       You actually think every single space agency around the globe is conspiring to hide the shape of our planet?  Do you actually believe this?  This would require millions of people from all around the world to "know" the planet is flat, yet insist it's a globe, among other impossibly ridiculous activities.

       If the Earth was flat, everyone would know for a fact.  Anyone in a plane would be able to tell, anyone who skydives for fun could tell, anyone who flies drones could tell, anyone who can launch an amatuer rocket with a gopro could tell, anyone who has climbed Mt. Everest could tell.

       It's flat, motionless, and it's completely obvious.  You simply have never considered the possibility because it's outside of your lifelong indoctrination.  You live in a manufactured reality created by the Occult.  Start with the Moon landing hoax.  If you seriously research that there is no way to conclude that it was real.  It's worse than an episode of Mystery Science Theater.

       <strong>
        astonishingly obvious

       natural phenomena that contradict your baseless, unprovable, silly little theory, I regained my sanity and concluded that the Earth is

       flat, nor is it motionless.  I am, however, interested in the fictitious, manufactured internet hoaxes that have led you to fall for such a silly delusion.

       Is it because someone once told you that ancient constellations haven't changed?  Because they actually

       I lived my entire life believing the spinning ball lie.  Until you actually get out there and test it all for yourself you will continue to blindly defend the lie.  If you believe we landed on the Moon there is no point in even trying.  If you can't see the ISS augmented reality puppet show then you have too far to go to see any truth.  I'm weary of debating with indoctrinated zealots so I'm not going to bother with you.  It's your religion and you don't even know it.  It's very sad.

       Buoyancy/density tests, gyroscope tests (trying to show precession), horizon distance tests with telescope trying to show curvature.  Telescopic observations of the stars and planets (wandering stars). Observations while on airline flights.  Observing evidence to the contrary that I've always belived such as boats going over the horizon, NASA photos, Moon landing, ISS videos.  Looking into tests such as Airys's failure, finding the problems with Eratosthenes assumptions, seeing how everything builds on Newton's formula for gravity which is simply assumptions based on assumptions, looking at flight paths in the southern hemisphere, asking a NAVY SEAL sniper I know IRL if he accounts for the Coriolis effect (he does't).  Understanding human perceptive and how it explains sunsets much more than the globe model, cell phone level apps, discovering Foucault pendulum is a complete fraud, understanding that water is always level and does not curve/bow or flow up a hill.  There is so much evidence it's overwhelming.

       You are the brainwashed shill unfortunately, and you don't even realize it.  You're parroting typical Flat Earth jargon that doesn't actually make sense, and is easily debunked with simple mathematics and physics (as well as the reasoning of a 2 year old.)
      </p>
      <p>
       "Buoyancy/density tests"?  You fail to elaborate, which makes it clear you're pulling shit out of your ass.  "gyroscope tests (trying to show precession)"?  Same thing, this is meaningless when you fail to demonstrate any scientific, experimental merit.  "horizon distance tests with telescope trying to show curvature"? If you actually carried such 'tests' out you would easily conclude the Earth isn't flat.  The list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply put,
       <strong>
        if you did any actual tests, you'd quickly realize the Earth isn't flat, unless your delusions are THAT strong.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the nature of your extremely embedded delusions I will no longer be responding to you, regardless of circumstances.  Nothing you can say or do will entice me into responding to you.  Good-bye forever, you poor, brainwashed, parroting sheep.

       Difficulty: the image was nit created under the pretense of being a genuine photograph. Nobody (cough
       <em>
        in their right mind
       </em>
       cough) has tried to suggest it is. And finally, nobody but a child is going to believe it is. And even then, most kids I know would just laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       A photograph of earth from a satellite or probe that is presented as genuine is thusly a bit different. But still, yet to see any honest, sensible technical criticism beyond"obviously it's fake". But thats no argument. Prove fakery.

       As far as I'm concerned, anything I cannot verify for myself is potentially a lie. I've never seen a globe Earth from space with my own eyes, and therefore, it may not be a globe. I certainly do not trust NASA or the government. We're lied to so much about so many things I find it very difficult to take the word of authorities, scientific or otherwise.

       There is nothing wrong with healthy skepticism! Question everything that doesn't make sense or you don't understand. This goes double for authorities. If its politicians, they have a responsibility to their constituents. Never be afraid to ask questions, In my industry, better safe than sorry as pertains to asking for information you need is critical

       We live in a fear based society.
The Bible was not meant to be taken literally. The people that do are slaves of fear. 
The ones who do not are made wise.

      <p>
       The Bible is absolutely FULL of metaphors and allegories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the Earth is flat but for personal reasons. Not biblical.

      <p>
       In order to understand FE you have to view things purely objective.
      </p>
      <p>
       You NEED to view the world from a different perspective than everyone else because it's literally about perspective.

       I actually watched Eric Dubay's 200 proofs. All 200 of them are laughably debunkable if you do even the tiniest amount of research. FE "theory" is a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe in the flat earth "theory", you are not being open minded. You are only allowing information that confirms the "theory" in, because otherwise you wouldn't believe it. If you want to make any arguments for the flat earth, I would be happy to debunk them.

       Checked it out. Your claim doesn't stand up to scrutiny.

       "Radiation like this could harm the guidance systems, on-board computers or other electronics on Orion," Smith says. "Shielding will be put to the test as the vehicle cuts through the waves of radiation… We must solve these challenges before we send people through this region of space."
      </p>
      <p>
       The systems that have to be radiation hardened are much more complex than in the Apollo era, and any people in an Orion while on mission will be exposed to significantly more radiation than just whats in the VA belts, especially over time (versus immediate exposure) on a mission potentially months or years long; far longer than Apollo mission durations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vagaries of radiation hardening of electronics and protecting crew from radiation on a mission many times longer than any before does not, even a little bit back up your claim.

       But we glossed over the relevant point. What does the fact that Newton believed in and practiced alchemy have to do with it? Utterly irrelevant. It was effectively, if not openly accepted as science at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       But guess what? When it was found to have no actual scientific basis it was discarded. That's science! That is what science is about.
Flat earthism is about trickery, obfuscation, relying on obscurity in hopes people won't research said claims, and, often outright  prevarication.

       It's perfectly reasonable to conclude that the earth is not a sphere. The flat earth model is logical and reasonable and there explanations for most observed natural events.
Don't be so rigid to think that the globe earth model is infallible. It too is an incomplete model. The tides have never been adequately explained, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       What isn't reasonable is the beligerence that is displayed by people who believe in a globe earth, and who lash out in fits of rage merely because their world views have been challenged.
