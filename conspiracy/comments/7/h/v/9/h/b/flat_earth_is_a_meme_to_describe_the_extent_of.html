    <div class="md"><p>No links but from what I piece together from the images of the hole in the tower looking like wile coyote impact compared to similar impacts. explosions most often creat circular shapes.  That along with the images of the nose of the plane penetrated through to the opposite side of the building and what I&#39;ve learned about alternative physics breakaway classified weapons type situation. The molten steel at the site the disintegration of the building  all indicate to me exotic weapons from nukes to something more. And holograms aren&#39;t particularly exotic but they would have been at the time. See how the technology trickles out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Pentagon is the most obvious because they can&#39;t even show you a picture. The scene in Shanksville is basically the same because there&#39;s simply no plane there. </p>

<p>With the twin towers, once you get over the fact that there in fact were not and could not have been &quot;thousands of eyewitnesses&quot; it&#39;s just a matter of realizing that the imagery of a plane going into a tower is physically impossible and therefore could not have happened except for on television. </p>

<p>Look at a picture of one of the steel support columns of the World Trade Center. Imagine it standing by itself in an open field and a passenger jet hitting it at greater than top speed. Your common sense correctly tells you the plane would be sliced lengthwise like a carrot. No question about this. </p>

<p>Okay, but on 9/11 we are told that a plane can go through many such steel columns which are attached to steel trusses and reinforced with concrete. They do this without even slowing down on the footage not to mention there&#39;s no strobe lights or identifiable airline logos on any of them. </p>

<p>But on a basic level the idea that a hollow relatively light object can completely penetrate a relatively massive solid object is absurd. Doesn&#39;t matter how fast it is going at the time, just like it won&#39;t matter how fast you launch a beer can at a tree -- it won&#39;t go inside it. </p>

<p>I would argue that FE is just that. </p>

<p>Its scary to think that the Earth isnt special that we are just on a rock hurtling through space all alone with no one but us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes there is a mountain of supporting evidence for FE, actually everywhere you turn there is evidence, like water conforming the shape of containers you drink out of, or watching sunrises and sunsets, or seeing the moon in the sky, the stars at night, etc. Everything points to earth being flat, it&#39;s just cognitive dissonance that keeps you from evaluating the evidence from a FE perspective.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Im not sure how that supports a FE... Water takes the shape of its container is a property of a liquid. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>watching sunrises and sunsets</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which debunks FE... </p>

<p>The sun goes below the horizon when its rises and sets... There is pretty clear footage of it if youve never seen it. It doesnt get smaller and disappear it get cut in half by the horizon and goes below it. </p>

<p>This can also be seen in sunrises when the undersides of clouds are illuminated and mountains can cast 90 degree shadows... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>or seeing the moon in the sky, </p>

<p>There is no FE model that can predict eclipses solar or lunar. </p>

<p>How does the moon prove a FE?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or seeing the moon in the sky, </p>

<p>Again I would argue that astronomy proves a globe earth... </p>

<p>Just look at the orbit of mars, for example. FE has no way of explaining that orbit. </p>

I thought the world was a ball like most people and I began attempting to debunk it and look for all the proofs on both sides and the arguments that get rehashed, and now I think the world is not a ball and there is no curvature, I am not certain what the ultimate shape and situation is but we have been lied to and deceived. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I started with liquids conforming to the shape of their container which disproves a spinning ball with water sticking to it, unless you can point me towards a practical experiment where water adheres to the exterior of an object, or if you could find a reproducible and practical example of mass being attracted to another from mass alone. The reason the sun doesn&#39;t decrease in size is because of atmospheric distortion from air moisture generally, but in deserts you can observe the sun getting progressively smaller, and you can observe the sun and moon changing size at a rate much too large for the standard model. The reason the sunsets and sunrises are beautiful are because of the local light source and how it diffracts from a central point on the horizon, if the sun was 93 million miles away and the rays were basically parallel then the entire horizon would be evenly illuminated. There are thousands of satellites supposedly orbiting the earth right now and have been for years, cameras are very cheap and have been, yet on these thousands of satellites there are no cameras and you can&#39;t find and footage from them, there should be hundreds of live feeds and pictures from space by independent private entities but you will only find NASA and state sponsored ones. There is a long list of all the examples of earth curvature not existing in canals, railroads, highways, and other large engineering projects and land surveyors and civil engineers have and will tell you they do not account for earth curvature, and you can see things that should be below the curvature of the earth all the time and find examples of this.

<p>Which would be correct if we didnt have gravity. </p>

<p>Dont try to Russels teapot me. </p>

<p>You have to prove gravity doesnt exist. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Gravity. </p>

<p>A practical experiment is the problem. You would at the very least need sensitive equpiment, you could measure the mass of a 1kg object at sea level vs a mountain top, I dont know what practical means to you. </p>

<p>It would be like me saying give me a practical experiment to prove bacteria exist. Its easy if you consider a microscope &quot;Practical&quot;</p>

<p>I would also like to point out that no one is stopping you or anyone else from offering up their own theory or model. Gravity is a theory but its the only theory that comes anywhere near explaining the phenomena we see. Whats your alternative to gravity and why is your theory superior?</p>

<p>Observation. Get a telescope and start writing down what you see. </p>

<p>Thats a lie. The sun will not change size, you have atmospheric haze but the sun is so large and so far away it will not change size by any noticeable measure. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This doesnt even come close to the original question I prompted... </p>

<p>As for the evenness of the horizon... Dude if its a globe then it makes perfect sense. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Thats not even evidence... You made a lot of assumptions with that one. </p>

<p>Im not even going to touch it because it has nothing to do with the topic at hand. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Right a vanishing point. </p>

<p>Now heres the problem. </p>

<p>Why does the vanishing point extend when the subject rises? If sight is reliant on this vanishing point and the Earth is flat then the vanishing point shouldnt increase when elevation increases. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright so here it why I didn&#39;t want to engage in the first place, you are dripping in confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance. I can&#39;t prove gravity DOESN&#39;T exist, that is absurd and you should know that, the burden of proof is on the claim, density and buoyancy are the result of Occam&#39;s razor here, no gravity required. And my critique of the standard cosmological model and general relativity do no require a superior alternative to be valid, that&#39;s illogical. Then comes the strawman and red herrings, measuring masses at different elevations and bacteria don&#39;t have anything to do with liquids adhering to the exterior or shapes, which you will never be able to reproduce as it is fantasy world baloney. Looking at things in the sky that are not tangible are irrelevant to reproducing an object being attracted to another from mass alone, this was an opportunity to reference the Cavendish experiment which displays your lack of knowledge and research on the matter. This video could be fake but it shows a shrinking sun (@2:45<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut-Mp-CEp_w">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut-Mp-CEp_w</a>) and I supposed this video could be fake too (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIEcees5oP8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIEcees5oP8</a>), but I would just go ahead and assume you haven&#39;t watch very many time lapses of the sun in different environments all over the world, further exposing your lack of research and knowledge on the matter as I surmised from your original comment. And then the purposeful ignorance, likely stemming from a strong shock of cognitive dissonance, start asking yourself why you see satellites so much in movies and TV but never have seen any real pictures of them. The vanishing point extends with elevation on a flat plane because the vanishing point is a result of perspective not a certain distance, do your research man you are speaking on things you have not diligently studied. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Right. An as of right now gravity is a theory. </p>

<p>You are free to offer a counter theory but I guarantee you that whatever theories you provide will fall well short of the amount of answers gravity provides. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>density and buoyancy are the result of Occam&#39;s razor here, no gravity required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. </p>

<p>We can build EM shielding, what happens to objects when they are completely isolated from EM? Do they fluctuate in weight? No. That means there is a force outside of EM affecting the object</p>

<p>What about density? Well you cant even have density without an attractice force anyway... </p>

<p>Two ways to test for density. </p>

<p>Lock a brick in a vacuum chamber. Nothing inside the chamber and the brick shouldnt be affected by density, right? Does the brick change in weight? No. So we know there is a force that permeates the vacuum chamber in this case that still in the absence of anything causes the brick to be attracted to the Earth. </p>

<p>Secondly we all know objects in a vacuum fall at the same speed regardless of how much they weigh. So a less dense object should fall slower than a more dense object, right? But we know all objects fall at the same speed depending on wind resistance. This again shows us it isnt density. </p>

<p>We call this phenomena gravity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And my critique of the standard cosmological model and general relativity do no require a superior alternative to be valid, that&#39;s illogical. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How so? If I told you that your illness is caused by an imbalance of humours and not a bacterial infection is my hypothesis as valid as yours? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>measuring masses at different elevations and bacteria don&#39;t have anything to do with liquids adhering to the exterior or shapes, which you will never be able to reproduce as it is fantasy world baloney</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No but much like I cant view a bacteria with the naked eye I also cant measure gravity with the naked eye. </p>

<p>Why does an object have slightly different weights at sea level vs a mountain top? </p>

<p>You as of right now have no explanation. Gravity does, you see the issue, right?</p>

<p>You can say something is fake or not true but unless you have any supporting evidence that its not true or a competing model then what good does it do you? Gravity is a theory, you cant really debunk a theory just offer competing theories and both the theories youve delivered dont provide as much as gravity does. </p>

<p>Looking at things in the sky that are not tangible are irrelevant to reproducing an object being attracted to another from mass alone</p>

<p>The things in the sky are tangible... We can observe them and observe their interactions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>e, this was an opportunity to reference the Cavendish experiment which displays your lack of knowledge and research on the matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Im familiar with the Cavendish Experiment lol. </p>

<p>Lets try to limit the ad hominems? Most people use them as an argument of last resort, lets hope you havent reached that point yet. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This video could be fake but it shows a shrinking sun </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Try it again with a filter on a flat plane, like this. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GseizX2z2kU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GseizX2z2kU</a></p>

<p>You can clearly see the horizon over the ocean cutting into the sun. </p>

<p>This is not possible on a FE. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but I would just go ahead and assume you haven&#39;t watch very many time lapses of the sun in different environments all over the world</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No Ive seen a lot of FEers post these videos. Never on the ocean though which shows a clear horizon. Always with some obstruction... I wonder why? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>start asking yourself why you see satellites so much in movies and TV but never have seen any real pictures of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont see a lot of satellites in movies and TV... I dont watch telesvision and havent had cable in well over a decade. </p>

<p>If you are done with your insults could you respond to one or two of the points I made earlier? Possibly regarding shadows being cast by mountains at 90 degree or sunrises illuminating the bottoms of clouds? I think you forgot to address those. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The vanishing point extends with elevation on a flat plane because the <strong>vanishing point is a result of perspective</strong> not a certain distance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See the problem? Ive bolded it for you just in case there was some confusion. </p>

<p>So take a look at these images, please and explain how perspective is accomplishing this. </p>

<p>Wouldnt these images suggest that its less vanishing point and more that there is an obstruction?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I don&#39;t think I have the stamina to keep this going, you have clearly seen enough and have the ability to think critically, if you want to choose to not understand how a sailboat is obstructed out of view due to perspective then that if your free choice, you would probably say you have already seen p900 cameras zooming things in and out of vanishing on the beach looking out at boats on the horizon after I bring it up lol. You have your mind set and that&#39;s fine by me. Like I said, I used to think the world was a ball like you do now, I totally get it. When you are ready to open your eyes to some of the hidden layers that hide behind the veil of deception that is draped over the masses then you will start to see the holes and cracks and then they will become painfully obvious. Until then, it doesn&#39;t matter much what I bring up because you will willfully ignore it, like satellites. This whole discussion began with you asking me for a couple points which I provided, water doesn&#39;t adhere to the exterior of objects, and the sun shrinks over the horizon in low air moisture when it is not distorted by atmospheric conditions. Both of those you can&#39;t find any flaws with or refute so I will crown myself victorious and notch another win for flat earth. </p>

<p>Well if you cant explain your position then just say so. </p>

<p>You cant just make assumptions then get upset when people challenge it. You havent done anything to show or prove your points regarding perspective. Ive taken drawing classes Ive used cameras and I can tell you emphatically you are mistaken. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you would probably say you have already seen p900 cameras zooming things in and out of vanishing on the beach looking out at boats on the horizon after I bring it up lol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, Ive seen high zoom cameras bring objects into view that are already visible. There is a reason they never follow the object as it sails away, like this. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpAGXpusAiQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpAGXpusAiQ</a></p>

<p>There is footage of a container ship going over the horizon with a high zoom P900. </p>

<p>Seriously, it never bothered you that those zoom videos never showed them moving away to see what this vanishing point looks like? Why would you not ask that question?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have your mind set and that&#39;s fine by me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, Ive done my research and the evidence shows a globe earth. To believe in a FE you literally have to ignore basic facts about your universe. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>water doesn&#39;t adhere to the exterior of objects</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does in the presence of a massive object. You can observe this phenomena, you can observe gravity weaken as you get further from the massive object. </p>

<p>So tell me what phenomena keeps things &quot;down&quot; I debunked both your assumptions (EM and Density) which you never bothered to challenge...?</p>

<p>You actually never challenged that point. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and the sun shrinks over the horizon in low air moisture when it is not distorted by atmospheric conditions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I gave you evidence that was false, you never bothered to challenge it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both of those you can&#39;t find any flaws with or refute so I will crown myself victorious and notch another win for flat earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You just keep repeating the same stuff with no support or proof, refuse to even acknowledge the facts I brought up and then act as though youve won some imaginary contest. </p>

<p>Sad. </p>

<p>Observation. Get a telescope and start writing down what you see.</p>

<p>Just here to pick on one thing.  </p>

<p>You do seem to be filtering your analytical skills from full effectiveness due to being so attached to the Copernican Model.  The entire point of this thread is to THINK.  </p>

<p>When we observe astral phenomenon we&#39;ve actually no real way to say that the orbit is due to mass - mass attraction.  As far as we&#39;re aware, we dictate the mass of objects in the sky based partially on this.  But what if it was electromagnetism that kept universal clock work afloat?</p>

<p>Actually, this is the topic of one of the threads in OP&#39;s post (thunderbolts)</p>

<p>Keep an open mind and you&#39;ll see there are many interpretations and science tends to have boxed themselves deep in a particular explanation for their observations.  (Not all of them, the majority)  </p>

<p>The problem with your logic is we all know gravity is a theory, I get that. You seem to think I have unfaltering belief in gravity.</p>

<p>We could add a large list of alternative/natural/healthy/empowering practices subs, I&#39;d say. If you would get the chance to meet people the  types of subs that you linked to, to your point, you would find what they had to say fascinating, kind, and intelligent, empirically based, and you wouldn&#39;t have even considered or known that they also look into &quot;flat earth&quot;.</p>
