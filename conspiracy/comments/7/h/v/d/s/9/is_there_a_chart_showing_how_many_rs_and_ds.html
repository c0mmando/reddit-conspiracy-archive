       This is just a list of people not going for reelection, it doesn't mean every one of them are quitting for sex abuse reasons; just quickly scanning, Corker and Flake aren't running because they're "never-trumpers" and it's been made clear to them that they'll be primaried so they're looking to save face.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, in the next 2-4 years you're going to see a lot of sitting republicans get the boot, and liberals have been gloating to me that it's because of the "blue wave" that's supposedly coming, but in fact they'll be getting primaried, it'll be republicans doing the booting. It would be quicker to list the ones we like than the ones we don't like, hell, if I lived in Wisconsin and Paul Ryan won the primaries I'd vote democrat just to get him out.

       If the recent elections in Virginia is any indicator, you're wrong. We'll have to wait and see though. Heavy red states will most likely stay heavy red. We might see a shift in purple states. Trump is historically unpopular and shifts typically happen when one party gains this much control.

       That's not a very good argument; Virginia has had a democrat as governor since 2002, I don't know why people act like you stole the state from us. I'll tell you what, it
       <em>
        almost
       </em>
       went red, that's not a win to brag about, it's one that should make you start worrying for the next election.
      </p>
      <p>
       New Jersey flipped blue though; it was basically guaranteed to happen because of how bad Chris Christie had been, the state was sick of him and everyone fully expected the voters to give him an extra fuck you by voting in a dem. That sucks, I wish it hadn't happened, but a few months ago the governor of West Virginia came out and switched over to being a republican so I guess it evens out.

       So IIRC, this upcoming election year there aren't alot of republicans up for reelection while there are a few democrats, some of which in states where them keeping their jobs is not a sure thing at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is "historically unpopular", but that's according to polls; I remember some about a year ago that said he had a 2% chance of winning. I've been pretty skeptical about them ever since 2012 after the Romney/Obama polls; I was a democrat and was hoping to reelect Obama but at best the polls had them neck and neck and a few had him losing, but then I came to find out the next day that he won no problem. Ever since then I've paid a little attention to the polls just to see if they end up being right or wrong, and they're wrong a surprising amount of the time. You could also be getting the idea that he's historically unpopular from the people here on Reddit; the radical left is so over represented here you shouldn't take the consensus on Reddit to mean much.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about shifts happening when one party has a lot of control, but I've noticed that voter turnout isn't as high for midterms and the House does tend to change leadership, probably because the voters from the winning party are complacent, so we'll see.

       The reason people point to Virginia is because it's been a purple state for a long time. Conservatives were treating the election as a test for what's to come. They believed Virginia would shift because people love Trump. Democrats were claiming the opposite and democrats won the day.

       And I'm basing my opinion of Trump on a lot of things. I'm sure you're doing the same. At the end of the day, we can only wait and see.

       I thought the D candidate was the favorite up until the terrorist attack with the Home Depot truck in NYC, and that guy had a commercial showing republicans running people down so people were mad? While it's true there are a lot of people that hate Trump, I believe it's due to some of them being misinformed by the MSM and the rest being uninformed and getting their info from the misinformed. And of course some other group spreading disinfo to confuse everything further.
      </p>

       For all the people who think "ending net neutrality" is going to be the end of the internet, acting like the sky is falling, they're spreading it to others who had never even heard of NN. I've taken the time to set a few people straight on what's actually going to happen but I can't get to everyone, instead it will just have to wait until the change is made and everything stays the same/improves before they hopefully realize they've been lied to.

       The Russia collusion thing that's been going on for the past year where A: it didn't happen B: the hack was proven fake; the emails Russia hacked and leaked to sabotage poor innocent Hillary? A group called VIPS analyzed the {insert tech jargon here} and came to the conclusion that for the amount of data that was taken, in the time it took to take it, someone had to physically be there, it was to fast to be done over the web.

       And that's just two things, it would take me days to type everything out that people believe but aren't true. One favorite of the MSM is to print a damaging story that
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       is based on something real, or just completely made up; everyone sees it and remembers, and then the next day they print a retraction that hardly anyone sees.

        Here's
       </a>
       some examples of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So after a year of investigating him, so far they got Manafort for something he did years ago while working as a lobbyist, and they got Flynn for lying about something that he had done that was public record. They keep talking about collusion and now obstruction of justice, but according to Alan Dershowitz (highly respected constitutional lawyer, lifelong democrat) there's no crime called collusion, and they can't charge him with obstruction for firing Comey because that's his constitutional right as POTUS. So after all this time they
       <em>
        still
       </em>
       haven't caught him for anything, and even if they did it wouldn't matter because it isn't illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm getting at is sooner or later all these hysterical, unhinged, rabid Trump haters are going to have to wake up from this brain washing they're in; yeah, sometimes Trump says cringey stuff, a lot of times the Twitter stuff is embarrassing (a lot of times it's kinda cool, it's really his only way to talk directly to his constituents and let them know what he's working on. I thought Obama was supposed to be the transparent one), and maybe they don't agree with some of his policies like illegal immigration, which is ridiculous btw, dems would have agreed with him 5 years ago, but they're going to start noticing that good jobs are coming back, the economy is way up, contrary to the belief the world is "laughing at us" whenever he goes abroad he draws huge crowds, he gets along great with foreign leaders, shit this last Asia trip he did he secured something like $300b in deals for American companies. He's renegotiating NAFTA so it's more fair for us. The only thing I didn't like was what the EPA has been doing, but, when I looked into it I found out that it got completely screwed up under Obama, way over regulated, and it's in the process of being fixed, but not so much that we're going to start having environmental problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       I encourage everyone to take stock of what you hate about Trump and actually research it; it's hard, you can't use like CNN or the like, but once you get past the bullshit and find out what's actually happening and why you'll realize he's one of the best presidents we've had in a long time.

       Well I didn't type it out all for you, I figured other people might read it too. But the tl;dr is that unless what you don't like about him is something you can see, like his personality (which doesn't have any bearing on how he's been doing), if it's his policies you have a problem with, there's a good chance you've been mislead on what's actually been going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just know there've been a number of times I'll see a report on the news about him and feel my heart drop, just disappointed because I really liked the job he's been doing; and then I find out what actually happened and what the news changed to make him look bad/stupid/etc and I know if I was a normie and that's all i ever saw about him, I wouldn't like him either.

       I'll just say a couple; the following is something I copied from somewhere else, it gives context to the first policy of his I really liked. I bolded important parts for emphasis, but if you read the whole thing it'll make more sense.
      </p>

       John Locke argued, among other things, for the overarching import of elected legislative bodies, for they directly represent the people. Therefore, he insisted,
       <strong>
        legislatures must not delegate the power of lawmaking to any other entity
       </strong>
       . Lock wrote: “The legislative cannot transfer the power of making laws to any other hands:
       <strong>
        for it being but a delegated power from the people, they who have it cannot pass it over to others.
       </strong>
       ” Locke continued, “The power of the legislative, being derived from the people by a positive voluntary granted institutions, can be no other than what the positive grant conveyed, which being only to make laws, and not to make legislator words, the legislative can have no power to transfer their authority of making laws and place it in other hands.”...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        "The unconstitutional transfer of lawmaking power from Congress to the executive branch and the seizure by the executive branch from Congress of additional lawmaking power have led to disastrous effects.
       </strong>
       To demonstrate the problem, consider that each year the executive branch is engaged in frenzied regulatory activity with virtually no oversight by Congress or input from the public. In 2014 alone, the executive branch issued 3,541 regulations, comprising 79,066 pages of the Federal Register, the yearly compilation of federal regulations. And these thousands of pages of regulations are piled on top of tens of thousands of pages of regulations from prior years. Federal Register page numbers for successive years starting in 2007 are as follows: 2007: 72,090; 2008: 79,435; 2009: 68,598; 2010: 81,405; 2011: 81,247; 2012: 78,961; 2013: 79,311; 2014: 79,066. That is a total of
       <strong>
        620,113 pages of federal regulations in the past 8 years
       </strong>
       ....
      </p>
      <p>
       "In addition, the number of actual regulations issued by the executive branch during this period is astounding:… that is 36,877 regulations, many of which carry heavy fines and penalties, including prison terms upon conviction....
      </p>
      <p>
       "By comparison, Congress, which is supposed to be the federal lawmaking body, has passed the following number of bills in the past 10 years: 2005: 161; 2006: 321; 2007: 188; 2008: 285; 2009: 125; 2010: 217; 2011: 81; 2012: 127; 2013: 72; 2014: 129."
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama's Habit of Releasing Massive Numbers of Regulations Just Before a Holiday
      </p>
      <p>
       On November 23, 2015, President Obama proposed 2,224 new regulations --
       <strong>
        144 of which were each
       </strong>
       expected to cost American taxpayers
       <strong>
        $100 million
       </strong>
       or more. Heritage Foundation senior research fellow James Gattuso reviewed the “economically significant” regulations and concluded: “The regulations span the full scope of American life,
       <strong>
        ranging from labeling requirements for pet food, new test procedures for battery chargers, mandated paid sick leave for contractors, and automatic speed limiters for trucks, to a dozen new rules limiting energy use [and increasing the price] of everything from furnaces and dishwashers to dehumidifiers.”
       </strong>
       Moreover, Gattuso noted that while the administration was required to release its proposed regulations twice per year, Obama had a habit of doing it around holidays when most Americans were focused on family matters:
      </p>
      <p>
       As you may or may not know, Obama was regulation happy; particularly when it came to the EPA, and some problems with making so many of them is there were multiples that overlapped regulatory issues. When I heard he appointed a guy who's sued the EPA multiple times to Director I was thinking WTF, when I heard about all the regulations he was cutting I couldn't fucking believe it. So then when I looked into what was getting cut and why, it was important sounding things like The Clean Air and Water Act (or similar) and the way it helped the environment was... negligible. What it did do was shut down power plants that couldn't meet it's ridiculous standards, it also shut down coal mines (that's an awful lot of people losing their jobs for a negligible environmental impact).
Anyways, you can look into it more if you're interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        1. Trump Policy-
       </strong>
       Executive order requiring that for every new regulation put in place, 2 must be removed. saved 378m ytd expected to go to the billions next year
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        2. Trump Policy
       </strong>
       Because I'm tired this one will be a threefer: Has begun renegotiating NAFTA, Pulled out of the TPP, Pulled out of the Paris Accord
      </p>
      <p>
       The Paris Accord might be something you're mad about; if you haven't actually read it you should find out what was in it first. Short and simple, it would cost us trillions of $, cost us thousands of jobs, make us artificially hobble our economy to raise the prices of our exports so "it would be easier for poorer countries to compete with us". Also, it's not a binding agreement so nobody has to actually follow it, but we still had to pay for a large percentage or it and it would have dropped the global temp by .2 degrees, that's two tenths by 2100.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also DACA: What Obama did when he made that program was unconstitutional, only the legislative branch can make laws, the executive branch enforces them. So it's not Trump's fault that now they might have to leave, he even figured out a way to give congress 3 months while they won't get deported to fix it the right way. They haven't.

       Everything you said makes sense and I'd like Trump too, if I were a conservative. I personally like those regulations and care less about propping up outdated industries, like coal mining. Basically every regulation you listed is something I support.
      </p>
      <p>
       DACA is something Trump chose to get rid of. He could have just as easily not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is also taking full advantage of the same executive order rules that Obama did. I'm not sure how any of his supporters can still criticize Obama for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       And finally, I would rather Trump save money in areas like the military and his own personal vacations than in areas that actually improve society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing you named is something I support. Even my 401k is starting to go down. That was really the only area I've seen Trump indirectly improve. Without that, he's done nothing I like.

       There are assholes everywhere but specific institutions have been known to be better at hiding/ignoring serious issues like sexual assault so I believe it would make sense for one party to harbor more if it's leadership is more aligned with protecting the party than the country (ahem, Paul Ryan's accidental recorded conversation  about "keeping it in the family" and the GOP supporting alleged pedophiles in their party and pointing fingers at others for same accusations).
