       I think we know he exposed the CIA spying on everyone. Which led to a bit more of disclosure. If it takes a Russian double agent to expose the untold truth and freedoms violations.. then so be it.

       Did you mean to write NSA spying on everyone?
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden was a weapon used in the war between the NSA and the CIA. He was designed to hinder the NSA's power which was starting to clash with CIA supremacy.

       "Yes, Ellen, when disguised I stray
In life’s more low but happier way,
’Tis under name which veils my power
Nor falsely veils — for Stirling’s tower
Of yore the name of Snowdoun claims,
And Normans call me James Fitz-James."

       I get that. It’s not I don’t believe that. It’s more of I believe they are using similar programs to do the same thing. Like all other countries etc.

       Thanks for the thoughtful response. Him being a weapon seems like a reasonable concept. Does that make it a limited hangout? What's the evidence that's the case?

       Ya limited hangout, panopticon that sort of thing. Obviously there is not hard evidence. One thing that has always bothered me about Snowden is his glasses missing the nose pad on one side reminds me of this.

       &amp; the fanfare he received. 60 minutes, elaborate interviews from all the networks and magazines. He was very much in the limelight for someone on the run. Compare him to Binney or Drake and he comes across as very polished and as though he is taking us all on a very detailed thought out con. You ultimately have to make up your own mind but look at it all again with rose colored glasses as they say.

       Exactly - and even some are not even pro-Clinton but are aligned with the cabal. They're saying he was turned years ago, came back to the u.s. to gather info. Doesn't sound right to me but I would like to know the evidence pro and con.

       I hear ya.

       My train of thought, if its on the news in this country there is an agenda/propaganda behind it. Could be limited hangout; I doubt double agent. If that's the case look at Assange in the same light.
      </p>

       The absurdity I was referring to was the Russian agent part. I am just sick of the neo liberal whitewashing of anti everything Russia. The U.S. powers that be have tried to push buttons since the end of ww2 and all those buttons were directed at Russia. Albert Pike. The war to end all wars. They just didn't think it would take 70 years when they tried to do it in the 60s; practically begged for it.

       To give you my opinion: He got into what he thought was going to be what it wasn't, as many find is the case as life goes on, and he made a choice to let it be known that nothing is private and its only getting worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       His being granted asylum is a stance against terrorism as the word itself is defined and not the boogeymen that inhabit the area they're trying to build major pipelines to circumvent the 2 largest game players on their own continent. He isn't a traitor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bullshit actors in Congress pretending to act in our best interests by continually blurring the line between public and private sector conglomerates. That's who I would label such a word, which used to carry weight in the world.

       Yeah, he thinks Assange has been working for the Russians all along too. Le sigh. The limited hangout really doesn't make sense in light of the evidence, and I'm just not seeing the Russia story either. Like you said, they need an enemy / someone to blame rather than letting Americans see the light.

       Just FYI, he wasn’t supposed to wind up in Russia- he just got stuck there on his way to Ecuador bc the US government cancelled his passport.

       Louise Mensch believes Snowden is a Russian asset-- or she wants to convince people of this, as she exists solely to corral Trump opposition into false or partially false theories and conclusions. Very much in the AJ mold actually, and probably just as tied to actual "deep state" functions (in her case, Rupert Murdoch and the Brexit fold).
      </p>
      <p>
       Snowden has said some things that a Russian double agent probably would not say (unless the point was to convince me he isn't a Russian double agent). He doesn't speak highly of Putin or his control-wrestling schemes at all. I think he's allowed to stay there as a fuck you to the US intel system and to make us have conversations such as this one, really.

       This is my most likely answer too, but my friend was so convinced Snowden's a Russian asset that I was ready to be open to information that he might be one. I have a hard time believing he would give up his freedom to be a double agent and be exiled in Russia.

       Does he believe he's always been working for them, this whole time? Or like switched teams in some way after he was a wanted man. I'd like to see suggestions of evidence for the former.

       He thinks he was turned years ago based on his earlier trips to eastern bloc and other countries (and possibly other things I'm forgetting.) But I was just reading that Snowden said he was CIA and NSA undercover so that would explain those trips. (American whistleblower, Edward Snowden, has described himself as a trained spy specializing in electronic surveillance, dismissing claims he was a mere low-level analyst | In an interview with NBC, he reiterated that he had worked undercover overseas for the CIA and NSA.)

       What snowden said at the time was nothing any deep conspiracy theorist didn't already know. With that being said some lower level conspiracy theorist heard this from snowden so they will say he's legit.

       Again at the time Snowden came out what he said was nothing that wasn't already known.
