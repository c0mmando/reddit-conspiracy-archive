    <div class="md"><p>Did you mean to write NSA spying on everyone?</p>

<p>Snowden was a weapon used in the war between the NSA and the CIA. He was designed to hinder the NSA&#39;s power which was starting to clash with CIA supremacy.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Ellen, when disguised I stray
In life’s more low but happier way,
’Tis under name which veils my power
Nor falsely veils — for Stirling’s tower
Of yore the name of Snowdoun claims,
And Normans call me James Fitz-James.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya limited hangout, panopticon that sort of thing. Obviously there is not hard evidence. One thing that has always bothered me about Snowden is his glasses missing the nose pad on one side reminds me of this.

<p>&amp; the fanfare he received. 60 minutes, elaborate interviews from all the networks and magazines. He was very much in the limelight for someone on the run. Compare him to Binney or Drake and he comes across as very polished and as though he is taking us all on a very detailed thought out con. You ultimately have to make up your own mind but look at it all again with rose colored glasses as they say.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear ya.</p>

<p>My train of thought, if its on the news in this country there is an agenda/propaganda behind it. Could be limited hangout; I doubt double agent. If that&#39;s the case look at Assange in the same light.</p>

<p>The absurdity I was referring to was the Russian agent part. I am just sick of the neo liberal whitewashing of anti everything Russia. The U.S. powers that be have tried to push buttons since the end of ww2 and all those buttons were directed at Russia. Albert Pike. The war to end all wars. They just didn&#39;t think it would take 70 years when they tried to do it in the 60s; practically begged for it.</p>

<p>To give you my opinion: He got into what he thought was going to be what it wasn&#39;t, as many find is the case as life goes on, and he made a choice to let it be known that nothing is private and its only getting worse. </p>

<p>His being granted asylum is a stance against terrorism as the word itself is defined and not the boogeymen that inhabit the area they&#39;re trying to build major pipelines to circumvent the 2 largest game players on their own continent. He isn&#39;t a traitor. </p>

<p>The bullshit actors in Congress pretending to act in our best interests by continually blurring the line between public and private sector conglomerates. That&#39;s who I would label such a word, which used to carry weight in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, he thinks Assange has been working for the Russians all along too. Le sigh. The limited hangout really doesn&#39;t make sense in light of the evidence, and I&#39;m just not seeing the Russia story either. Like you said, they need an enemy / someone to blame rather than letting Americans see the light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Louise Mensch believes Snowden is a Russian asset-- or she wants to convince people of this, as she exists solely to corral Trump opposition into false or partially false theories and conclusions. Very much in the AJ mold actually, and probably just as tied to actual &quot;deep state&quot; functions (in her case, Rupert Murdoch and the Brexit fold). </p>

<p>Snowden has said some things that a Russian double agent probably would not say (unless the point was to convince me he isn&#39;t a Russian double agent). He doesn&#39;t speak highly of Putin or his control-wrestling schemes at all. I think he&#39;s allowed to stay there as a fuck you to the US intel system and to make us have conversations such as this one, really.</p>

But I was just reading that Snowden said he was CIA and NSA undercover so that would explain those trips.
