       I'mma tell why we are so pissed. We knew Trump team offered sanction relief. No, you don't sanction relief for hacking. Especially if you're going rape the Americans for more money by giving the richest Americans tax breaks.

       So the russian collusion was the trump team contacting russia once the election was won and he was president elect?
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought the collusion was supposed to be about russia helping him get elected?
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds like they are starting with a conclusion and then scouring the earth for evidence to fit that conclusion.  I've seen this before actually.  Dick Cheney basically says Iraq has WMD's, as a statement of fact.  We know Iraq has WMD and the cheney/libby appointed heads of all the US intelligence agencies were basically ordered to find evidence that showed this. Meanwhile, media, the american people and the US legislators are all being convinced of the inevitability that the dots will be connected, to the point where our country starts a war, overthrows a government and then later quietly admits, there is no evidence of WMDs and there never was.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny how quickly we've all been taken for fools yet again.  If there is one thing we can rule out, its that trump colluded with russians. Why?  Because thats what our IC claims is the truth. When have they ever, EVER told the american people the truth?

       Pretty much. Collusion would be Trump contacting another country to alter the outcome of the election. Really nothing happened, but the media seems to be fooling people because they have pushed this for so long that they can't let it go at this point. For those that haven't read the DNI report about Russian interference check it out:

       It's really lame and talks about how Russia news didn't support Clinton, therefore it was helping Trump. Does anyone here even watch Russian news, such as RT? And for those that do, you would have seen Russian news also not covering Trump in a very flattering way, so it's not that convincing. The whole narrative is pretty pathetic actually, but they are hyping it while not telling the public the details. Based on the logic of the DNI, you could say Mexico was trying to help Clinton win and destroy Trump by simply looking at how their media was very anti-Trump during the election. In fact most media was anti-Trump, yet simply pointing out the flaws of Clinton gets you labeled a Russian bot. The people spreading this are not thinking very clearly.

       Well, most people in America can't speak Russian, so watching RT wouldn't be very useful.  What RT covers and doesn't cover should be the last thing on the minds of American politicians.  They should be worrying about their own media, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or shouldn't it just be separate, people report what they want to and not what they're paid to?

       Well actually RT America is all in English. It's actually not that bad. I used to watch it actually. They covered what was revealed in wikileaks emails that CNN told the American people was illegal to read lol

       It all reeks of obvious bullshit. It’s disgusting how there wasn’t nearly as much fervor for HRC to be investigated by that spineless fuck Comey
