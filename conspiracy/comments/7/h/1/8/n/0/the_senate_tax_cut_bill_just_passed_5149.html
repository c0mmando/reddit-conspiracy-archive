        Senaters voted 51-49, as Republicans approved the nearly 500-page bill in the early morning hours after lawmakers received a rewritten version, which contained significant changes from the original bill that passed two Senate panels last month along party lines.

       Unfortunately I don't feel like digging through 500 pages of legislation right at this moment, and the NYT failed to describe the "significant changes" in the passed version.

       Media, news everything is just a show for the sheeples, to divert their remaining attention from all the entertainments these days. It doesn't matter which political party they try to blame things on, their goals are the same. They make you think that you have a chance at controlling the future, but it's simply not true.

       You are a peasant that will never make any money because you literally define it as evil. It's a defense mechanism to justify your poorness and inaction. "I'm just poor because i'm an ethically superior person" - cringey as fuck. You'll never change anything

       You are either lying, misinformed, or stupipid. The ACA had over 70+ hours of debate, it went though a dozen bipartisan comittees. It had multiple hearings, and Democrats gave the bill to Republicans and the public months before the vote. Republicans were allowed to make changes to the bill and Dems added them and negotiated most of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both parties are not the fucking same. Both are shit, but Republicans have been obstructing and literally undermining democracy to give donors a huge paycheck and you're ok with that? Unless you are a millionaire, then you are fucked by this. You are fucking brainwashed. Wake up! Maybe the answer isn't Democrats, but if you believe Republicans are the answer then I genuinely feel sorry for you. You are being conned. Trump is literally going to get a $40,000,000 dollar check when he signs this. His immediate family will get over a billion. That's just one family. What will you get? Liberal tears? Stop fucking supporting the people who want to take away from you. Stop backing the most powerful political party in American history. Back the people of your country, not the billionaires that don't contribute jack shit to the economy.

       The only reason I can think of is that the contents of the bill are so horrible that the public would be in uproar about it.

       For example the death of the ACA was included in this bill. And even if Republicans don't like the ACA the majority of Americans do. If this were public it would have caused huge backlash.

       Because they had already deliberated on the details for days, also having to deal and vote on the multiple motions to block the overall vote by those fighting the bill, and wanted get back to their families and lives? I don’t know I personally wasn’t there to see it.

       You can read the Senate’s version now and build whatever backlash you want before the House reconciles it next week. The handwritten notes might have bought them an hour.

       Sure but the contents of the bill have changed. The final version, 500 pages, only came out a few hours before voting. Why not wait for the morning. Or a week from now? There was no reason to force it through at 2 am with no debate except for the fact that it would have created a huge uproar if anyone was actually awake.

       Sure maybe you won't but the ACA is polling at a significantly higher number than our dear president is. Killing healthcare isn't popular.

       They didn’t wait for the morning because they felt they had spent enough time on it already. Fairly simple. Maybe if there weren’t multiple attempts to stall the vote it wouldn’t have happened at 2am. You realize it was going to happen Thursday?

       I guess? But I don't think anyone actually thinks those are coming soon enough that there couldn't have been a debate. It was probably pushed through because Trump had the idea that he wanted this done by Christmas so he could say he did something important his first year.

       The bill was written entirely without input from essentially half of congress and the final version was dropped on the senate floor just hours beforehand. The bill makes enormous changes to the tax code, which, affects everyone and everything. Everything about this stinks, even if the changes are ultimately good for people (hint: unless you are in the 1%, you are getting hosed and it will probably not be good for you in the long run). This is simply not how legislatures are supposed to make law. (I already know you are thinking of a rebuttal that Obamacare was the same, and it was not even close, there were over 9 months of open debate and amendments in committee before a final vote, this wasnt even 9 hours!)
      </p>
      <p>
       This begs the question, why do it this way? Numerous senators openly admitted that if they didn't pass it, the big money donors wouldn't donate again. Seems pretty unequivocal to me. Big money donors mean more than the rest of the American people. Donors &gt; constituents.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think that with the Flynn news today, the writing is on the wall for the trump presidency. The Republicans know it, they need his signature and it may not be available much longer. Things are about to get hot in DC, this reeks of desperation from a party that knows its power is about to be dramatically diminished in the next decade. I'm disappointed they are fucking the rest of us over in the process.

       it eliminates tax deductions for a lot of things.  medical, education, work, ect...its effectively a tax hike for most americans while a tax cut for the wealthy.  it wont drive growth.  the u.s. is a consumer based economy....people in the middle and lower class drive the economy.  they have less money now to spend...so the tax bill will cripple growth.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In reality, the tax bill would provide significant relief for the middle class by doing the following: doubling the income threshold under which families pay no taxes at all to $24,000; doubling the child tax credit to $2,000; and eliminating the 15 percent tax rate in favor of an expanded 12 percent rate, among other provisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to the middle-class provisions mentioned above, consider the bill’s relief for Main Street small businesses. The bill offers a 20 percent small business tax deduction for all small businesses earning less than $500,000 a year.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, survey and economic evidence demonstrates that corporate tax cuts benefit the middle class in the form of higher wages, better workplace benefits, new job opportunities and lower consumer prices.
       </p>

      <p>
       Why
       <em>
        wouldn't
       </em>
       this be the case?!
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The tax cuts enacted under Presidents Coolidge, Kennedy and Reagan, among others, all generated several years of supercharged economic growth. The principle is simple: More money in the wealth-creating hands of the private economy – and less in the wealth-destroying hands of government – creates economic growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some 100 economists wrote an open letter to Congress with the following message: “Economic growth will accelerate if the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passes, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and a better standard of living for the American people.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Far from kicking people off health insurance as Democrats imply, the tax bill would simply eliminate the health-care tax on those who choose not to purchase health insurance. This tax is borne mostly by working- and middle-class Americans: Nearly 80 percent earn $50,000 a year or less. In fact, this provision would reduce the middle-class tax burden even further.

       The problem you're having is that I'm speaking in pretty open terms. Ideally you would understand that I mean - if you're going to cut taxes or provide monetary incentives to anyone, provide them to the people and not corporations. But because your argument is bad from the start, you'll retreat into semantics and pretend not to understand. "gib money lol" is where
       <em>
        you're
       </em>
       at now.
      </p>
      <p>
       This tax bill is terrible, and I hope it doesn't affect you like it will most people. But then again, maybe I hope it does so you can see the error of your ways. Either way I'm done here. Have a good weekend!

      <p>
       cost to raise a kid a year is over 13,000 a year.
the tax bill changed abortion law to life begins at conception.  making it more difficult for lower income people to have abortions, placing more of a financial burden on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       people with small businesses in the lower and middle classes makes up a small fraction of the population.

       ending the aca requirement will drive up health care costs, that due to the same tax bill are now not deductible.  you are on crack if you think this tax bill helps anyone but the very rich.

       No Isaid I wish they had free abortions for the specific reason of reducing my tax burden.  I don't believe that I should have to pay anything for the mistakes of uneducated, undriven and unsuccessful people.  If I
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       have to pay, I would rather pay to abort their children than to support another generation of failure and tax burden.

       It does seem to impact people who do not believe in person responsibility harder than those whom do though.  If you are a glutton for McDonalds, welfare handouts and unprotected unloving and uncommitted sexual relationships I believe you

       suffer in a moral society.

       It's easy to say, but with the dow at 24k, where the fuck are the higher wages and better benefits?

       <p>
        The enactment of a comprehensive overhaul — complete with a lower corporate tax rate — will ignite our economy with levels of growth not seen in generations. A twenty percent statutory rate on a permanent basis would, per the Council of Economic Advisers, help produce a GDP boost "by between 3 and 5 percent." As the debate delves into deficit implications, it is critical to consider that $1 trillion in new revenue for the federal government can be generated by four-tenths of a percentage in GDP growth.

       Do you know what a poll is? 37 of 38 of the
       <strong>
        top economists in the country
       </strong>
       polled by the University of Chicago, said it would be devastating for the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Non-partisan entities like the Congressional Budget Office, the Tax policy Center, and the Joint Committee on Taxation all said the plan was bone-headed.

       Unlike Trump's list of 100 or so "economists", those people are actually experts, and not ghosts and office assistants, which suffuse the Trump list supporting it.

       actually it might not. The House is a bit more...chaotic (read: Insane) then the Senate. There's a pretty good chance a good chunk of Republicans in The House consider the 1.4 trillion dollar deficit to be a non-starter. Either they'll fall in line, or they're going to ad amendments (cuts in the social safety net)  until it's more palatable for their base. Hopefully they add enough that the feet draggers in the the Senate can't stomach the house draft and it dies again

       They will need to vote again on whatever comes out of the committee that pushes the two bills together. The senate and house bills were different. The very last chance will be the second senate vote or by some miracle Trump vetoes it.

       As far as the comments go, the first thread is filled with highly voted, top level comments defending Trump and his cronies.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the second one goes, I'm not surprised to see you lied about that as well. You linked what you called the "top comment" which wasn't the Top, nor most voted comment. Now why would you do that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it because that thread is also filled with multiple, highly upvoted, top level comments defending Trump and his cronies? (It is).

       Go look at that thread. Of the only comments that are still positive right now...
      </p>
      <p>
       4/5 are anti-trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only positively voted comment that isn't an attack on Trump is this-
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Does this mean Trump or his team didn’t violate the Logan Act
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Which is only a neutral question, and doesn't betray a leaning one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the other comments that are pro-trump are either in the negatives or on their way soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is pretty much a perfect microcosm of exactly what I was talking about, thanks.

        Trump did not violate the Logan Act. Anyone who tells you otherwise is listening to fake news. Michael Flynn's meeting with the Russians occurred after the election. The "Muh Russia" theory now requires belief in time travel.

       Assuming that you use the standard deduction, which has doubled (and its estimated that more than 90% of people will), your taxable income will go down from $21,600 to $19,300. So you will save some money. Not a lot, but it every little bit counts!

       And I am happy for you.  I may even get a modest savings, although I have a feeling I wont be able to afford decent Health Insurance, as I am self employed and don't get the luxury of subsidized Health Care, like everyone else.  But here is what I will say.  Obama wanted to pass a bill that would provide free community college, and pre kindergarten for all children.  I believe it cost something like 130 billion over 10 years.  Republicans obstructed, said it was too expensive.  But 2 years later they increase spending by 1.4 trillion over 10 years, without blinking an eye?  For what, modest tax breaks for you and me and a repeal of the estate tax? You do realize that the the decreases in revenue have to be made up eventually, right?  In 5, 10 years we may regret being happy about our modest tax breaks.

       I'm with you on health insurance. The costs have gotten ridiculous, its financially not worth it for a lot of people. I'm glad they got rid of the individual mandate, so at least people aren't punished for making a financially sound decision.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for the revenue, I understand that you might disagree with me but I think this tax plan, among other things, is helping to fuel our economy and attract more businesses who will actually pay taxes.

       And you can make that argument, regarding your second point.  The problem I have is, there is little historical precedent that shows this will be the case.  In fact, many economists believe the Bush Tax Cuts were the catalyst to the 2008 recession.

       The Republicans are being under-handed and sneaking in all the stuff they want because this can pass with the majority they have; basically they know the administration and Trump are soon to be on the way out so they are trying to shoehorn in whatever they can to help themselves.

       We are one of the oldest governments on the planet and they have figured out many ways to circumvent the will of the majority.
      </p>
      <p>
       90 years ago, Edward Bernays figured out how to "engineer the consent" of a democratic society.  It works.  We call propaganda "public relations," and it is the best in the world.  Big picture, we are a fascist society with uniparty rule supported by a complicit media apparatus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Down in the details there are a lot of reasons why things are the way they are.  One fun example a lot of people don't know about is that many of the congressional staffers -- you know, the people who actually write the laws -- are actually on corporate or union payroll.  That's right: the people who actually work in congressional offices can be (and often are) on direct payroll of some external corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another mechanism they use is this whole sexual assault situation.  The gatekeepers of power like Weinstein and Epstein use sexual perversion and abuse to guard and filter who gets into power and who does not.  Play the game or don't play at all.  PizzaGate is a sideshow compared to what's actually going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many ways to rig a democracy without resorting to rigging the actual votes.

       It's interesting tho isn't it? How it's a nothing burger but Flynn still decided to lie to the FBI and how he isn't getting nailed for any of the other illegal stuff he's done. But I guess he has some info on others in the transition team that Mueller is interested in. It's almost like there's something there.

       It's almost as if lying is common with these politicians. Good thing in certain cases the FBI director can decide not to care, and the prosecutor shell out immunity like candy to cover it up. Quite a contrast to the current witch hunt.

       The front page yesterday being littered with net neutrality "This is..." sellout pictures and memes seemed fishy. Plus sexual misconduct allegations flooding newsfeeds and Flynn pleading guilty is the cherry on top of this media smoke screen TBH. The title of those net neturality posts reek of those image titles from The_Donald, where they post a picture of someone and give their version of news to go along with it.

       The big corporations and Wall Street were bailed out after the 2008 financial collapse. Today they are making record profits. The stock market is akin to a giant gambling table for the rich and corporations and isn't indicative of wealth or prosperity of the middle class and the masses. Now, instead of infrastructure spending and remembering the "forgotten men and women" which Trump championed for in his inaugural speech, the rich and corporations get even more money to pile onto their already towering mounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       All while the official unemployment rate is a  touted lie and wages are stagnant when compared to inflation and people are getting by via going into debt which is just a ball and chain attached to a job/slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rich and corporations own the politicians because the politicians rely on them to fund their campaigns and the rich and corporations grease the members of Congress and your state representatives via lobbying aka bribery. And it's legal. No term limits—no, we have actual career politicians.
      </p>
      <p>
       This country is fucked. And Trump can stand there and say "Believe me!" and his supporters will just eat it up like a giant pile of shit and smile while he fucks them over because they are so blinded by their own hatred of Obama and "Dumb liberals" that they can't comprehend that the side that they are pulling for is no better. Politics has become a sports match now and you stick by your team or else.

       Certainly there must be a solution, a way to fix the mess you just described. We're being bled dry via taxation to fund this shit show. Why can't we think of alternate revenue streams to fund the federal government's operations? Surely there is some kind of advanced technology or infrastructure project the federal government could invest in that could deliver enough revenue to serve as its chief income stream and eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, the tax burden on the populace. These are the ideas on which we as a society should be working together. The problem, it seems, if you choose to believe this hypothesis, is that the "powers that be" know there is a way out, a means to end taxation via an alternate revenue stream, and this collective utilizes myriad methods to distract, anger, amuse, and fracture us so we can't work towards these solutions.

       Which one of the 2016 presidential candidates took the most lobbying money?

       I was with your seemingly anti-partisan rant until the last paragraph in which you showed your partisan leanings.

       Obama was trying to get the US through the crisis. He should've let wall street fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why are you trying to bring Clinton in to this? It's a bill written by lobbyists, the first look the democrats got of it was only cause a lobbyist leaked it, from behind closed doors.

       So Obama helped wall street at the expense of the average American because he was "scared"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lol, nice logic. Notice how you don't assume that this bill was passed because Trump or whoever was "scared". You immediately assume quid pro quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just blatant Hyperpartisanship. "When my guy does it, it's cause he's scared by the mean bad guys. When the bad guy does it, it's because he is nefarious"
      </p>
      <p>
       You're completely naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you can't understand why Obama got brought up I suggest you go back and read the thread. 2008 wall street crisis is specifically brought up, but of course it isn't a democrats fault. The blatant irony and hypocrisy you guys employ is comical.

      <p>
       Yes, their donors who gave vastly more cash to Clinton this cycle. The donors who own polkiticians on both sides. The donors who have favors me treatment from both republicans and democrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       My whole point is that the Democrats engage in the same exact behavior as the GOP. I think it's hilarious to watch you and all the people who voted for Clinton, the candidate who took nearly  2 million more from lobbyists than any other candidate, bitch about lobbying and the GOP.

       I'm not defending this bill, I don't support it, I don't support the totally corrupt  GOP, I don't support deep state asset Trump, I don't defend the practice of lobbying.

       In fact, im very critical of these things all the time in this sub.

       However, when I start to point out that the Democrats are guilty of the same shit... everyone loses their minds.

       Right, you just like to be a hyperpartisan attack dog who is critical of the GOP but refuses to talk about the fact the corruption exists on both sides and voting blue or red isn't going to fix it.

      <p>
       Like dude, it's so obvious what the goal is.

       No thanks, I'll keep voting third party and exposing the bullshit anti-third-party rhetoric you people love, while being equally critical of both establishment parties (but only getting downvoted by one side)

       So, just for the record, you are saying that the GOP and the Democrats are both corrupt, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you actually agree with that, then you should be able to see the reasons why I'd reply the way I did. Because criticism of the GOP and their corruption is good, but you
       <em>
        will be downvoted for criticising the democrats
       </em>
       ... Which I, of course, was.

       An exact illustration of the point you apparently wanted to make. Just not in the direction your were expecting, I think.

       Why would someone who votes third party write an angry knee jerk reply pointing out Obama's failures—which I already referenced via the 2008 financial collapse—and then point out which presidential candidate received how much lobbying money which everyone took as a defense of Trump? And I wasn't even referencing lobbying money in regards to presidential candidates. You couldn't have come off as more of a knee jerk Trump supporter.
      </p>
      <p>
       And actually, which may be a surprise to you, I've been critical of democrats and republicans and Obama and Trump and Clinton in this subreddit and have been upvoted and downvoted almost equally.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't know what point you're attempting to convey but okay......

       Right, you and everyone else "took it as a defense of Trump". You can talk about "GOP lobbying", and how bad lobbying is, to the tune of many upvotes you knew you'd get from the left wing partisans on this sub.... but when I bring up the lobbying numbers from a prominent left wing figure... suddenly I'm a knee-jerk Trump supporter. A guy who's a registered independent and has literally never voted Republican, ever. You get to determine what I'm allowed to and not allowed to criticise... if I don't adhere, I'm a Trump supporter.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is exactly my point. This is exactly why I said "I was with you until"... Because you paint yourself as a neutral actor and yet you engage in the exact type of behavior you just decried.

       So what's your problem? I normally ignore someone after you last two replies but I'm in a good mood today. What are you angry at me for? Why are you attacking me again?
      </p>
      <p>
       I referenced psychosis or misplaced anger because your initial post was attacking me for not pointing out things which I clearly had pointed out. Then you go on this diatribe and project what I'm thinking or what you think my response will be. And almost every post in my history where I reference Nazi's and Hitler was when I was arguing with a few posters months ago about whether Hitler was or wasn't a socialist—it had nothing to do with calling fellow posters Nazis or calling candidates I don't like Hitler.
      </p>
      <p>
       So.....?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are projecting your anger a lot and reading things that aren't there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a registered Independent too. And? I criticize both major parties? So what's your deal beyond thinking that this place is either a democratcirclejerk or a republicancirclejerk because given any day of the week it could look like either to a lay person.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway, hope you have a good day and release that anger in a fruitful manner.

       Alright... youre right. You dont deserve the guff im giving you right now. I apologize. What ive read from you I mostly agree with and I admit I probably read things into your initial comment that were not there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was upset mainly by the fact that the torrent of upvotes you got, especially in the context of the entire thread, were from Democrat supporters who are blatant hypocrites and are constantly downvoting me for being critical of the DNC or breaking up the left wing circle jerk.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm mainly coming from a place of just being done with the Donald 2.0 narrative. Left wingers control discussion on this sub. Right wing is the enemy; moderates are erased because you're to the right of the left.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a series of posts this summer that showed extremely convincing evidence that botnets were upvoting content on T_D, and crossposting it to this sub and upvoting it. Whatever it is, Cambridge Analytica or Russian botnets, maybe 4chan... it has become the resident strawman for this sub. The Donald 2.0 narrative is absolute horseshit and the absurdity of people being upvoted into the hundreds for claiming that this sub is by nature hostile to their opinion... is staggering.

       I didn't write it for upvotes. I was surprised as anyone to wakeup today and see the amount of upvotes given. I was just writing my truth. How do you know that it was only or mainly democrats who upvoted me? Maybe I should have been clearer but the post two times inferred that both major political parties are bad. Yesterday I was also attempting to knockdown the whole Flynn thing with the supposed Trump-Russia "collusion" and received a lot of downvotes from that. I just speak my mind, regardless who may or may not like it.

       Well, to be honest it did become Donald 2.0 for awhile, especially when Spez hid their subreddit and the conspiracy mods all welcomed them here. There was a flood of rightwingers that entered

       Ghostdog999 is cynical and not too bright. The tax reform is a good thing for americans. It'll give the middle class more money to invest back into their businesses, save or spend on necessities. Ignore this "everybody is bad, oh no we're dying, woe is me" cynic.

      <p>
       Tax cuts for the middle class are going to be offset, and then some, by the removal of certain write offs that
       <strong>
        actually
       </strong>
       benefit those who grow the economy, and it's going to add

       to the deficit over the next decade.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only people this plan benefits are the ultra rich, and corporations. So unless you're either one of those, you got duped, hard.

       You ignore the fact that most of the write-offs are for the ultra rich. Removing them doesnt hurt the middle class, it hurts the rich more because most middle class dont qualify for those write-offs. So you're conclusion doesnt even make sense. You dont seem that bright to me except reciting a few facts. No rational thinking, just cynical hyperbole.

       Fox News flies in the face of decades of empirical economic data to state trickle down economics really will work this time, all to push the Republican agenda. Color me surprised.

       You referenced a compromised liberal source funded by the biggest liars on the planet. Proof:

       You linking proposals doesn't strengthen your argument, showing direct causation does. I have provided direct proof that your source TPC is COMPROMISED aka lying pieces of shit. You're using a compromised source bought and paid for by immoral lying liberals. What part of that don't you get? You are an immoral liar yourself for using other lies to justify a lie.

       A little lesson is taxes about Schedule A that I have not seen anywhere lately.
      </p>
      <p>
       . Most of the deductions taken by working people are filed on Schedule A, the form where you list "itemized deductions."
      </p>
      <p>
       Schedule A is the most used schedule for workers. It has always been so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the thing nobody seems to know. Itemized deductions on Schedule A PHASE OUT when income goes well into the six-figures area. People who earn over some amount between $155,650 to $311,300 (depending upon their household status) lose ALL of their Schedule A deductions.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR rich people don't get Schedule A deductions, so they cannot be the ones who pay when these deductions are eliminated.

       Yeah show me. I live in Germany and all the time I hear "the economy is good, Germany is doing so well at the moment" but honest I don't experience it. Show me some statistics that prove your point. And please no rugged unemployment statistics or how "we" make more money (we as in Germany in total, but the growth is only with big companys and nobody else, but yeah in total we are doing fine if you don't differentiate between companys and acutal humans

       Yeah I know that, it wan't meant as prove to my point but to show what my point actually is. But this statistics are quite useless because they compare regions and countries to other regions and countries. To see a development you need to compare data from one region to older data from the same region.

       Exactly this smaller businesses are the backbone of our economy. Sure some do well but the number is shrinking. Look how many new businesses are founded each year compared to before. Look how more and more newly founded businesses go out faster and faster each year. It's worrying because these are the businesses the people actually profit from and not some big companies where a few thousend people work only for some few guys to get a fat paycheck.

       That is a general worlwide phenomen and the governments are responsible to solve that problem.
When you speak about avoiding taxes for the big economy/companies, it was our SPD chancellor Schröder who provided the tools for the big companies. That's why i'm not voting for the SPD anymore.

       Don't listen to the EU trolls. Germany and the rest of Western Europe is under lock and key to their masters. Surveillance, censorship, Coudenhove Kalergi Plan, etc. All of it pushing towards a single European state and eventually this will spread to the rest of the world. "They" won't control the people's of Europe for much longer, many are waking up.

       That's not really a fact. It's just the JCT running numbers and speculating.  In reference to the WaPo article, I find it odd that eliminating the healthcare mandate is somehow a "tax hike".  I work for CPA firm, and most of our lower income clients hate the mandate and alot of them have been burned by the subsidy because they didn't understand how it works.  This is just going to allow people who can't afford insurance to avoid a penalty.

       Those sources are controlled by multi-millionaire and billionaire corporate interests to push all left-wing thought. Don't get me wrong, Fox News and Info Wars are all part of the same machine but it baffles me how these people say these are valid sources when all you need to do is a simple background check on the owners and donors of the papers.

       "Most of the hit to poor and working-class Americans would come from the Senate Republicans’ push to insert a major health care change into the tax bill. Republicans are repealing the requirement that all Americans buy health insurance or face a penalty, a move that would lead to 13 million more uninsured Americans, the Congressional Budget Office has said. Many of those people earn modest incomes and currently receive tax credits and subsidies from the government to help them afford insurance. If the Senate GOP bill becomes law, premiums are expected to rise and millions would likely opt not to buy insurance anymore, meaning their tax breaks would go away, explained Thomas Barthold, head of the JCT."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is disingenuous journalism at it's finest. The article CLAIMS taxes will be raised for  EVERYONE making under 75k but then goes on to say the bulk of this is a REPEAL of Obamacare (13 million of the US population to become uninsured, a small percentage)...causing FUTURE insurance premiums to RISE higher than they are currently.

       This has nothing to do with taxes. It's a fluff piece, aaaand you're a shill.

       To say "they don't know what's in it" is simply not true because they have changed and debated alot of different provisions, for example the property tax deduction.  So, anybody saying "nobody knows what's in it" is just regurgitating faux outrage.

       Because the GOP conspired to ram a bill through with no debate, no current scoring, no discussion with the other party. Well over half the nation doesn't want this, but they're doing it because party over country and the rich eat the rest.

       I'm with you. Politicians using political tactics that have been used before to get what they want while being the majority party is not a conspiracy, it's politics. Politicians taking money and making policy around said money is the way the game is played now (as seen by tlihat blatant bot push of net neutrality posts). If you want to discuss modern American politics, head over to a political sub. The Senate using their majority to push a bill is hardly a conspiracy.

       To push an ill-informed narrative that this tax bill is some kind of disaster.  The angles are really interesting to me, but it's mostly just ignorant flailing.

      <p>
       Reducing the nominal corporate tax rate to a more globally competitive level is vital for the USA's future.   Yes, I agree with many of you that in theory corporations should be taxed more, but you have to deal with the reality of a globalized world where they are shielding profits and assets in lower tax rate havens.  Until the entire world decides to tax corps more, the sensible decision is this one:  a more competitive nominal rate.

       This is the problem with fake news.  People who actually understand what this bill does think it's at least an acceptable plan.  Those who foolishly rely on partisan news sources are being misinformed.

       Here come the down votes.  The left wing brigade is here.  It's not unlike people out in the streets yelling "hey hey ho ho" but if you actually corner them and ask what they are upset about, it's just all the cliche bullshit rhetoric they've been spoon fed that doesn't mean anything.

       Do you know what a poll is? 37 of 38 of the
       <strong>
        top economists in the country
       </strong>
       polled by the University of Chicago, said it would be devastating for the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Non-partisan entities like the Congressional Budget Office, the Tax policy Center, and the Joint Committee on Taxation all said the plan was bone-headed.

      <p>
       Unlike Trump's list of 100 or so "economists", those people are actually experts, and not ghosts and office assistants, which suffuse the Trump list supporting it.

       They will need to vote again on whatever comes out of the committee that pushes the two bills together. The senate and house bills were different. The very last chance will be the second senate vote or by some miracle Trump vetoes it.

       I’m going to be saving a lot of money in taxes so I’m happy that the system is working. Que the salty bullshit and lies about how I’m not actually going to benefit. But trust me, I am and I’m thrilled about paying less in taxes.

       The level of projection and delusion among your kind is gross and bad for the country.  You have to swallow a sick pill and your reaction is "well hillary would have passed it too", despite the fact that this was Trump's campaign promise the whole time, and this was never on Hillary's radar?  Despite the fact that every democrat voted against it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, you keep believing what you want, but no reasonable person will believe that nonsense for a second.  The democrats voted to prevent this ransacking of our future.  They'd have fucked us in other ways, but there was zero chance of a hillary tax bill being written up that would repeal the estate tax, reclassified unborn fetuses as people, demand 400k acres of Alaskan wilderness be sold to oil companies, or had a ridiculous expiration on the pathetic tax credits the majority of the country will get (which won't off set the huge spike in medical costs they'll receive) while the corporate tax rate is permanent.
      </p>
      <p>
       They wouldn't have passed it in the dead of night with pencil scratchings in the margins.  These crooks just stole your money, they're pissing on you and you're thanking them for the rain.
