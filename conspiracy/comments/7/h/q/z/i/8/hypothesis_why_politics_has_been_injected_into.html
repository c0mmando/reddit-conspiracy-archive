        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Most users on this board can acknowledge that the current system in place (at least in the US) is designed to keep citizens at bay through a combination of materialism, excessive entertainment, de-emphasis of education, and debt. </p>

<p>Everywhere you look your eyes are assaulted with flashy advertisements on the best new deals. Make sure you keep up with fashion and the newest trends with these products that will be obsolete in months. Keep spending money, feed the system.</p>

<p>Make sure you keep up with your favorite shows so you can discuss them with your coworkers/friends; don&#39;t be left out of the conversation!</p>

<p>No, we don&#39;t have the money to invest in our education system, we have to handout hundreds of billions of dollars to military contractors so we can afford to pay them to rebuild the cities and countries we payed them to destroy. Oh and now you say you do want to get an education? Well here&#39;s a loan that will keep you perpetually in debt. </p>

<p>Make sure you&#39;ve got a good credit score by opening as many credit accounts as possible while maintaining persistent debt, or else you won&#39;t be able to qualify for a loan to take advantage of Trucktober<sup>TM</sup></p>

<p>Now, with this blend of Orwell and Huxley&#39;s nightmare presented to us as the American way of life most people are overwhelmed; too exhausted to scrutinize the people in power. Though there&#39;s always some that slip through the cracks. </p>

<p>But wait, you would dare question your military&#39;s involvement in conflicts all across the globe? You don&#39;t support the Troops<sup>TM</sup> ? You must be on Putin&#39;s payroll.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t have people thinking critically about the system now can we? So how do we nip that urge in the bud? Let&#39;s inject toxic red vs blue tribal politics into every facet of life so that citizens will be too exasperated to even care. Pacify the population so that future generations grow up without any inkling of curiosity as to how the world around them came to be. You better stand for the national anthem at your NFL game, but does your star qb take a knee? Let&#39;s debate that ad nauseum rather than address the fact that the water supply is contaminated with highly toxic concentrations of lead.</p>

<p>Right now there seems to be a trend of politics being injected into everything for the intention, in my opinion, to make people so fatigued that they have no urge to examine the world around them. &quot;Fuck man, I just want to come home and have an ice cold Bud Light<sup>TM</sup> after working my 12 hour shift and watch the game on my new 50 inch flatscreen but now these players just want to whine about the civil rights, fuck it I&#39;ll just watch the new Law &amp; Order SVU&quot;.</p>

<p>TPTB seem to want the most inane identity politics latched onto every aspect of society in order to make any discussion controversial which in turn pushes people away from participating as a vigilant citizen altogether. A form of self-censorship.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think, peace and love to all</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should check out inverted totalitarianism:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism">Inverted totalitarianism reverses things. <strong>It is all politics all of the time but a politics largely untempered by the political</strong>. Party squabbles are occasionally on public display, and there is a frantic and continuous politics among factions of the party, interest groups, competing corporate powers, and rival media concerns. And there is, of course, the culminating moment of national elections when the attention of the nation is required to make a choice of personalities rather than a choice between alternatives. What is absent is the political, the commitment to finding where the common good lies amidst the welter of well-financed, highly organized, single-minded interests rabidly seeking governmental favors and overwhelming the practices of representative government and public administration by a sea of cash.</a></p>
