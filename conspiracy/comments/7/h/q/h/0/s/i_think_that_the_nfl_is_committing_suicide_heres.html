        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The NFL is a not for profit organization. That was fine as long as we had politicians who were for sale. They see the writing on the wall.</p>

<p>American football is a brutal gladiator sport, which shops high schools and colleges for fresh meat. These (often underprivileged and uneducated) young men are then given a free pass through college and transitioned into the NFL. They are highly paid actors, who are used and abused by the &quot;sport&quot; until they are too old or too injured to continue performing. Because of their primary demographic, they become idols to those who will never make it out of poverty. It&#39;s a consolation for the fact that our country intentionally deprives underprivileged children of basic safety and education. The children can aspire to be a rapper or an athlete. Coupled with the insane player salaries, this dynamic usually results in the destruction/self-destruction of the individual.  </p>

<p>The elephant in the room is the overwhelming evidence that this production guarantees that the actors&#39; brains will be turned to mush, if they manage to avoid crippling injuries long enough to collect the requisite number of concussions. The pressure is mounting to solve this problem; as the living guinea pigs are proving the case for CTE. </p>

<p>The only solution is for the NFL to pull the plug on football and make reparations to the victims and their families. Because the two are mutually exclusive, the government would have to step in and pick up the tab. When the populace realizes that they have already been paying the tab for the stadiums and letting the owners and players enrich themselves through a bogus not-for-profit scheme, they will be infuriated by their tax dollars being used to bail out the insolvent organization.</p>

<p>Something tells me that there is a conspiracy to kill off the sport with the National Anthem red herring. Essentially, using the actors, themselves, to fall upon their own swords. This would deflect the attention away from the owners and vilify the potential recipients of future reparations. Football will fade into obscurity and the damning scientific revelations will stop before it&#39;s too late.</p>

<p>Think about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read the stories about how the protests, colin Kapernick, gang culture etc, is killing football and I don&#39;t buy it at all. I used to love football, played high school and college ball and rarely missed an NFL game.  I used to drive to Platteville Wisconsin, then Kankakkee to watch the Bears workouts, I truly followed the game. </p>

<p>Over the past several years, however, the game has gone beyond the game I loved.  It is a freak show.  When I played in the early 1980&#39;s there were no players over 300 pounds.  William Perry was an outlier at 300 plus pounds.  A month or so ago I was reading an article about a Chargers offensive lineman that Denver cut loose because he couldn&#39;t stay above 300 pounds. </p>

<p>Generally speaking with a few exceptions players over 225 pounds were slow when I played.  There are 300 plus pound players that could keep pace with the defensive backs that played in the early 80&#39;s.  </p>

<p>For a long time the enhanced size and speed were amazing, it truly seemed like the sport was evolving.  Over time, however, it got to the point where watching people literally killing themselves started to make me tune out.  I watched about a quarter of the super bowl last year.  I watched the final three minutes of a game in October because I was in Vegas and laid a bet on it.  Aside from that I haven&#39;t so much as seen a highlight. </p>

<p>You may be right.  If the game isn&#39;t killing itself on purpose it is definitely succeeding by default.  As an aside, however, the owners would rather burn their money than make reparations.  They give absolutely 0 fucks about the players.  Cattle are treated better.  </p>

<p>In 20 years I suspect there will be rogue games played in places like Mexico you can pay per view on a streaming channel.  A lot of parents are refusing to allow their kids to bash their brains in.  When I was younger concussions happened but not to the extent they do today.  Players are bigger and faster and on the verge of killing each other.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s also poor coaching and lack of pro proper form when they do tackle. I live in the US and played football for one year in middle school and just didn&#39;t like it. I definitely was not a large or fast middle schooler so I didn&#39;t see much playing time. When I got into high school I picked up rugby and have been playing ever since. I played for 13 years then I finally broke my arm from an illegal tackle when I had the ball. During those 13 years of playing I saw less injuries than I did watching football in high school and college. When you don&#39;t teach kids to tackle properly and have them just run full speed into someone head first and not wrap up,  that&#39;s when serious injuries happen. Look at highlight reels of football &quot;tackles&quot; to rugby tackles and you&#39;ll see a big difference. Most NFL players are just oversized morons anyways so I&#39;m not surprised they can&#39;t understand the concept of a proper tackling</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plus not only is it safer, it&#39;s also more effective; rather than run full speed at a guy and blow him up, except the semi frequent times they see you coming and side step, making you miss completely, if you lock him up with your arms, even if you now don&#39;t have the leverage to make the tackle you&#39;ve slowed him enough that bam bam Kam has time to get there and hit him so hard his soul leaves his body.

    <div class="md"><p>they mention you&#39;ll get sales tax on stuff bought. but that is tiny compared to the millions taxpayers lose when the pay to build these things. and it&#39;s a sunk cost kind of thing. say there was no nfl team in a certain city. all the people in that city will still spend their money on something. if there is an nfl team suddenly in the city, it&#39;s not like the people living there suddenly have more money to spend. they spend money on nfl tickets but that means they spend less on other businesses around town. so the non tax paying nfl owner benefits and other businesses around town get hurt.</p>

<p>It won&#39;t be a billion dollar business when people pull their heads out and realize that it&#39;s organized cruelty to animals. The animals, which happen to be humans. Shit, even though the corruption continues; at least racehorses and greyhounds have protection. If a factory harbored a workplace environment where top employees suffered such injuries, OSHA would step in. I think that the tables will turn as more and more players fall victim to dementia.</p>

<p>When the science supports class-action suits, to represent the brain-addled former-players, fans with a conscience will begin to back away. Up to this point, they&#39;ve been operating on denial.</p>

<p>Once the fanbase drops below a certain level, the industry will fail. I believe that the owners will be facing legal action, soon; and they see the writing on the wall.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my hope, anyway. This sport is encouraging children (not yet old enough to drink, or even vote) to receive irreversible brain damage or other bodily injuries. It&#39;s sick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your objection and believe you are right for feeling the way you do though I believe the only way for the NFL to be disbanded is for it to be replaced with something of equal fandom.  The government has interest in cultural fandom. That aspect aside for a moment culturally it is known how terrible cigarettes are for you yet it is still a billion dollar business that directly affects the health of anyone who decides to try them on their next trip to the gas station. Even writing &#39;this will give you cancer&#39; direction on every package is not enough to eliminate it from the market.  The culture likes the idealogy of these things but not the application.  Good intentions have a low exchange rate on the USD$.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The responses to this post are quite intriguing; and I hesitated to post here, because I&#39;ve found that this sub has taken on a much more hostile atmosphere, as of late. Thank you for your reasonable comments. You make great points. </p>

<p>I did consider the cigarette angle; as well as asbestos (which went the other way). The difference is that cigarette smoking is an individual choice to harm one&#39;s self. Our society has made great changes, in just a couple of decades, to marginalize smokers and protect non-smokers from the dangers of cigarette smoke. Although, I do feel that people who subject children to cigarette smoke should be punished for child abuse. (What the hell, this thread is on the way to negative karma, anyway! :D</p>

<p>In order to give up cigarettes, smokers must fight a crippling chemical addiction. If you follow the smoking analogy, then the players are the cigarettes, and the fans are the smokers. And, just like smoking is falling out of popularity, so could football.</p>

<p>I agree with your point about the government&#39;s utilization of cultural fandom. This is why I thought that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> would be an appropriate place to share my thoughts. Cultural fandom is a large cog in the mind-control machine. And, the players are showing their hand by demonstrating their influence over the minds of their followers. However, we are experiencing a massive cultural shift, right now, and I sense that we may not be able to rely upon recent history to predict future trends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not impossible for football to die it just has enough money to live with a severed head.  The time it would take for football to be rejected by the amount of the society required to remove it from schools, let alone television would be staggering. The amount of money football can generate at even  the high school level is unbelievable, and a drastic removal of that money would require a hell of a replacement.  As for the NFL it is still raging  pretty hard on  its fantasy football steroids shot. And if there is a massive cultural shift, and if this one is different than any other before, it is not going to benefit the most financially enslaved population ever no matter how healthy it sounds.  Enjoyed the discussion though, if you weed through the people demanding validation and the shills this sub ain&#39;t so bad!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t put words in my mouth and I won&#39;t do the same to yours.  To whom exactly were you referring, which demographic, when you referenced children poorly performing (or that schooling had failed them)?  Was it inner city / urban / rural / both / something else?</p>

<p>I had assumed you were referring to urban/inner city, but if that&#39;s not the case then my comment may not wholly apply.  If you were, then it&#39;s fairly safe to say you were referring to minorities, likely blacks, to which my comment directly applies.</p>

<p>Intelligence, as measured by IQ, is at least one standard deviation below 100 for them.  IQ is mostly genetic, innate, and does not change during a person&#39;s lifetime; education does not change IQ.  There is also a direct correlation, which is almost certainly mostly a causation, between IQ and wealth regardless of education (though education does play a minimal role).  It also predicts the probability of having a stable home.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is not the schools which are failing these kids; it is their own intellectual (and to a certain extent cultural) shortcomings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking about children raised below the poverty line, who aspire to celebrity as their way out of their situation. The majority of these idols are black, and the appeal to black, underprivileged youth, is great.</p>

<p>I wholly reject your premise (as I understand it) that people are just born stupid, and that&#39;s why they are football fans. Do you have links to any sources to back up your statement?</p>

<p>There is evidence to support that educational opportunities absolutely have life changing effects on students. Even those who are raised in a negative environment. I&#39;m not going to waste my time digging up sources, because I can see that this is going nowhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s going nowhere because you are scared to accept new ideas that directly oppose what you currently believe.</p>

<p>The average IQ of blacks in the US is 85.  It is a fact.  85 was the threshold for mental retardation until 1973/4 when the APA succumbed to political pressures brought forth by those who could not accept the fact that literally half of all US blacks are certifiably mentally retarded.  This is also a fact.</p>

<p>What kind of sources for this would you find acceptable?  Off the top of my head, and one that I believe you&#39;d find the most credible, I know that there is a sourced Wikipedia article which proves it.  &quot;IQ and race&quot;, IIRC.  Of course there are other sources which you&#39;d probably figure out some way to immediately dismiss.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just think they are going to politicize it to the point where peoples political affiliation supersede their team affiliation.  When taken to the extreme sports can definitely become a distraction.  But the thing I love about sports is you can come together with someone who you completely disagree on in everything else in life and have a good time with them because you are cheering for the same team.  It&#39;s getting to the point where people care more about the protests than the actual games. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s your take on why the players are even allowed to wage these political protests? They are employees, who are paid to do a job. How does it benefit the owners to allow this to take place?</p>

<p>Not being able to find a rational answer for this is what pushed me into speculation of a conspiracy taking place. There are no accidents with that much money involved, and the owners could take control of this; couldn&#39;t they?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>politicians are still for sale, don&#39;t think that will effect nfl. but it does have a problem with the concussions. and no one likes the guys kneeling. and the game is getting less interesting to watch as they add in new rules that make it less violent, to have less rough hits that cause concussions. this is football! people watch to see the big hits. Just like people watch NASCAR to see the car crashes. If it wanted to totally prevent concussions they&#39;d make it two hand touch but then no one would watch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t put words in my mouth and I won&#39;t do the same to yours.  To whom exactly were you referring, which demographic, when you referenced children poorly performing (or that schooling had failed them)?  Was it inner city / urban / rural / both / something else?</p>

<p>I had assumed you were referring to urban/inner city, but if that&#39;s not the case then my comment may not wholly apply.  If you were, then it&#39;s fairly safe to say you were referring to minorities, likely blacks, to which my comment directly applies.</p>

<p>Intelligence, as measured by IQ, is at least one standard deviation below 100 for them.  IQ is mostly genetic, innate, and does not change during a person&#39;s lifetime; education does not change IQ.  There is also a direct correlation, which is almost certainly mostly a causation, between IQ and wealth regardless of education (though education does play a minimal role).  It also predicts the probability of having a stable home.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is not the schools which are failing these kids; it is their own intellectual (and to a certain extent cultural) shortcomings.</p>
