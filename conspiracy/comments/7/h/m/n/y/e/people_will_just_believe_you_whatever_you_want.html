<p>I feel as though “genius” would be the ability to manipulate other geniuses whose genius lies in other fields. Right? Maybe not. Maybe a cult leader is a genius manipulator. I dunno.</p>

<p>Trump manipulates rubes and uses blatantly obvious lies to do so. Only people whose careers depend on being sycophants stay close to him. Everybody else never stops getting fed ridiculous lies, and thus never know the real him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright...</p>

<p>Before presidency, decades of financial crimes. He’s been in court countless times for non-payment of contract work. Many of those are still pending, as far as I’m aware. He is likely to have mob ties; you can’t do development on his scale in New York <em>or</em> open a casino without that being the case. This isn’t conjecture, he has met with known mob associates many, many times during his career. He also has reportedly threatened to have his sexual assault victims murdered if they speak out.</p>

<p>Multiple counts of obstruction of justice, for various actions like firing Comey after asking for a loyalty pledge and doing things like asking Flynn’s case to be dropped. This alone is impeachable, in a just world.</p>

<p>He almost certainly directly ordered his campaign officials to collude with Russia, but we have no public proof of this yet.</p>

<p>If you want specifics... it’s a gigantic ball of yarn with so many threads that people have been making websites and video series to keep track of it all. I couldn’t possibly explain it all in one post.</p>

<p>But he’s so guilty. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, I hate him because he is a virulent racist, sexual predator, and had political objectives that would make my life much harder.</p>

<p>I don’t need to personally investigate him, lots of people are doing it for me these days. Like I said: video series, websites, subreddits, timelines... half the internet is collating this information and constructing a plausible narrative.</p>

<p>You don’t have a good understanding of the legal system if you don’t see how much trouble Flynn and Manafort are bringing down on Trump. Flynn especially has a whole list of charges in front of him, but he walked away with just one. That’s called a plea deal, and it is a sweetheart deal. You don’t get that unless you give up something big, or you’ve already given up something big.</p>
