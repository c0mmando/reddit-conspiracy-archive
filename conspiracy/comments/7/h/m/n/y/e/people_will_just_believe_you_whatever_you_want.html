       shit poster? I saw it as taking advantage of human nature. That we trust the "facts" that stars and politicians tell us. Trump's genius is not his business acumen, it's his gut instinct on human psychology. He's a genius salesman / conman.

       I feel as though “genius” would be the ability to manipulate other geniuses whose genius lies in other fields. Right? Maybe not. Maybe a cult leader is a genius manipulator. I dunno.

      <p>
       Trump manipulates rubes and uses blatantly obvious lies to do so. Only people whose careers depend on being sycophants stay close to him. Everybody else never stops getting fed ridiculous lies, and thus never know the real him.

       It's simply old-fashioned "bullshit", a purely American invention, btw, and differs from straight-out lying because the bull-shitter doesn't care whether what he says is true or not only that it has the desired effect on others that he wants or needs for his own purposes.

       Alright...
      </p>
      <p>
       Before presidency, decades of financial crimes. He’s been in court countless times for non-payment of contract work. Many of those are still pending, as far as I’m aware. He is likely to have mob ties; you can’t do development on his scale in New York
       <em>
        or
       </em>
       open a casino without that being the case. This isn’t conjecture, he has met with known mob associates many, many times during his career. He also has reportedly threatened to have his sexual assault victims murdered if they speak out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiple counts of obstruction of justice, for various actions like firing Comey after asking for a loyalty pledge and doing things like asking Flynn’s case to be dropped. This alone is impeachable, in a just world.
      </p>
      <p>
       He almost certainly directly ordered his campaign officials to collude with Russia, but we have no public proof of this yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want specifics... it’s a gigantic ball of yarn with so many threads that people have been making websites and video series to keep track of it all. I couldn’t possibly explain it all in one post.
      </p>
      <p>
       But he’s so guilty.

       Nope, I hate him because he is a virulent racist, sexual predator, and had political objectives that would make my life much harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t need to personally investigate him, lots of people are doing it for me these days. Like I said: video series, websites, subreddits, timelines... half the internet is collating this information and constructing a plausible narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don’t have a good understanding of the legal system if you don’t see how much trouble Flynn and Manafort are bringing down on Trump. Flynn especially has a whole list of charges in front of him, but he walked away with just one. That’s called a plea deal, and it is a sweetheart deal. You don’t get that unless you give up something big, or you’ve already given up something big.

       lol dude, you can't see yourself. broad generalizations and pointing out "half the internet" is collating is hilarious! per your argument then, Trump is a mastermind criminal, that is sloop well connected and solo powerful, he has been able to elude you AND all the agencies, power players, the legal system etc. I mean c
       <code>
        mon....its the same as always, ignore anything you hear that makes sense and make up shit as you go. oh, those other things that we were wrong about, oh you'll just ignore and jump right on the next thing to rail about. boy, how did a racist, guy that has so much
       </code>
       honest reporting
       <code>
        about all his nefarious white supremacist dealings, treason, and demons ever make it without anything legally attributed to him, get so many votes from minorities like me (or even get vetted) oh I see, were all stupid, and he hid all that so well, and is so powerful that we need to ignore that there hasn't been ANYONE to take your internet timelines, articles that are ALL true *eyeroll*, and because you say so by quoting the internet, lol, that you're right?ok dude, I'm going to stop wasting me time
       </code>
       cause you can't acknowledge he has had(my main point) the MSM, and all these people have been slandering him, and no one has had anything stick except name calling, labeling and story after story that is retracted or corrected.
