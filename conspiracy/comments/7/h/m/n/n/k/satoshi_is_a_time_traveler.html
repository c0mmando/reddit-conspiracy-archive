    <div class="md"><p>It was the first to go mainstream. It has the branding and name recognition. It’s been featured in entertainment and has seen its share of coverage from business media.</p>

<p>It may not be the best blockchain tech, but it’s gained so much momentum that it’s clear that the market is not organic. There’s always been manipulation (whales and bots). Only difference now is that there’s people willing to buy into it because there’s a lot of fear of missing out and ease of jumping into the market.</p>

<p>I would not be surprised if it retracts back, people lose their shirts, and then the cries for regulation become louder than ever.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know that Ethereum used KECCAK-256.  I thought it was sha256.  That&#39;s probably better, but I don&#39;t know anything about KECCAK.  The q computer is still a problem.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I don&#39;t mean direct offense to religious people, but as a former one myself I wish they could let go of their fear of hellfire and damnation and examine what was really behind Christianity in the first place.</p>

<p>Jesus may or may not have been real. His teachings are pretty solid though. But what was definitely real were the state efforts to create new religions to control the minds of the masses.</p>

<p>How do you get millions of people to behave when you don&#39;t have cars, guns, or phones? Teach each of them that if they don&#39;t behave, they&#39;ll be tortured forever by God. </p>

<p>2000 years later, that tactic is still working on a lot of us.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I&#39;d say op thinks that AI will arise from a distributed network of computers over the internet. If processing power = intelligence, the more cycles spent on bitcoin, the less available for the AI.</p>

<p>If this Satoshi character really is from the future, they ought to know the definitive test for recognizing self-awareness in a computer program.</p>

<p>Why would this prove he&#39;s from the future? Because nobody today really knows the answer. Why is that? Because as soon as someone mentions an idea for defining self awareness, a programmer can code their program to exhibit that feature. As soon as they do that, the feature is no longer the result of self-awareness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like that only strengthens my argument. ASICs exist because of cryptocurrencies and profitability, so they are being built and used when they wouldn&#39;t have been otherwise. The numbers you cite are now, what about 2 years from now? 20? Right now, we are pretty early in the overall cryptocurrency game as widespread adoption hasn&#39;t even occurred.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another way of looking at it: With the limited availability of fossil fuel, what if someone was able to go back in time to 50 years ago and create a system to pay everyone to burn 1000x more fuel? To the perspective of everyone in that fictional timeline 50 years ago, it wouldn&#39;t be posing any serious risk either. However, to us fifty years later it certainly would.</p>
