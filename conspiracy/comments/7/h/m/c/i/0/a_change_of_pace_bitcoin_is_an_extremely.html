        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>All of the below assumes time-travelling backwards in the same universe or hopping across to alternate universes that exist in the same state as our past is possible.</p>

<p><strong>Anyone who ever invents time-travelling needs an anchor from which to gauge changes made to the timeline, among other things I&#39;ll outline below.</strong></p>

<p>Bitcoin serves as a <em>perfect</em> tool for time-travellers.  In case you&#39;re not familiar, every 10 minutes, Bitcoin creates a new block with part of the output of a previous block, plus a very special, very hard to compute number.  In effect, this creates a chain (where the word blockchain comes from) of very improbable events (finding a very special number).</p>

<p>If you were to time-travel effectively, one of the first things you&#39;d need is the ability to measure and track your changes.  You don&#39;t want to go back, kill Hitler, and then come back to a dystopia worse than you had before.</p>

<p>What bitcoin does is make a series of permanent, distributed, unalterable points of low entropy.  You can, in essence, track your timeline against a proposed timeline you&#39;re travelling to by where the blockchain diverges.  If they match, the universe <strong>must</strong> be a match.  If they don&#39;t, walk backwards through the blockchain to find the point of divergence, and there&#39;s where the change has affected the universe.</p>

<p>Everything in the universe affects everything else, so any change <em>will</em> show up in the blockchain, but not necessarily immediately.  Imagine stopping someone on the street to ask them the time.  That person then goes on to do what they were going to do anyway, but they cause a chain reaction of change starting from the minute and very quickly ballooning into massive changes.  Eventually, this will affect bitcoin mining by affecting the PRNGs inside of one or more Bitcoin miners (a miner is plugged in sooner, rather than later; a user logs in at a different time, timing from electrical circuits is affected, any number of things can change), causing them to either &quot;miss&quot; the winning hash, or find a hash where they previously wouldn&#39;t have.</p>

<p>Comically, this is not so far off from the plot of Steins;Gate, which leaned heavily on the story of John Titor, a time traveller who posted for some months on an internet forum warning us that CERN would develop time-travel technology and create a dystopia.  In the anime, Rintaro Okabe (the main character) receives a &quot;divergence meter&quot; from another time-traveller that allows him to track his changes to the timeline (either further or closer to the original point of divergence and the original timeline)</p>

<p><strong>Bitcoin is also extremely useful as a permanent, eternal record of truth.</strong></p>

<p>If you start recording reality into a permanent distributed ledger, when you arrive to a new reality (and you still trust mirror-you not to lie to yourself), you can just read the blockchain to see an unalterable record of events, cryptographically proven and secure.  Any information recorded into the blockchain cannot be edited or erased without an ever-rising cost.  You can disrupt information from being written (and indeed, this has happened before), but once blocks start getting stacked on top, it&#39;s essentially permanent (a lot more permanent and easier than microfiche&#39;s, that&#39;s for sure)</p>

<p><strong>Which brings me to my conclusion:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>EITHER Time-travel to the past or universe hopping is impossible or is never achieved by any descendants of humans (unknown possibility) OR</li>
<li>Bitcoin is irreparably flawed in ways we&#39;re not aware of that makes it unsuitable for a &quot;divergence meter&quot; and record of truth (very possible) OR</li>
<li>Bitcoin will be used by time-travellers to provide a point of reference for any effects they have on the planet and by their progenitors or trusted scribes to create a record of reality.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many companies combing the blockchain for interesting data, and perhaps one day they&#39;ll uncover some &quot;news feed&quot; in the blockchain left by an aspiring time-traveller, but in any case already there exists a technology that allows for careful, precise measurement of time-travel related activity.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: If the universe is a spanning tree of possibilities, the blockchain is a trail of breadcrumbs left to track one particular subset of possibilities.</strong></p>

<p>I welcome any further ideas about the possible conspiratorial uses of a permanent digital record.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A footnote: Some will immediately realize that by posting this, I&#39;m giving lots of people lots of ideas, many of which could mean <strong>very bad things</strong> to us and to our future children.</p>

<p>My thought process is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>EITHER I&#39;m wrong for any number of reasons (and this is just a fun thing to think about) OR</li>
<li>I&#39;m right, which means</li>
<li>EITHER I&#39;m the first to realize this OR</li>
<li>(more scary) I&#39;m not.</li>
</ul>

<p>Either way, I don&#39;t plan to do any time travelling (and will very likely never have the means to) and I figure public disclosure and discussion is more advised than simply withholding this information.  As a matter of fact, I have a strict policy against time-travelling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, the transactions aren&#39;t necessary for this to work; the only thing that matters is the chain of block hashes.  Also, while I&#39;m not a bitcoin expert, I think this is incorrect.  From the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_hashing_algorithm">wiki</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In bitcoin the service string is encoded in the block header data structure, and includes a version field, the hash of the previous block, the root hash of the merkle tree of all transactions in the block, the current time, and the difficulty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If a different transaction was included in the previous block, the merkle tree would change and I <strong>think</strong> it would also change the resulting block hash.</p>

<p>This is related to the reason for SegWit: to remove the &quot;witness&quot; portion of the transaction from the data that is part of the chain of hashes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Bitcoin expert though, so I could be wrong.  In any case, I&#39;m positive about the chain of block hashes being a result of previous block hashes, so that&#39;s the only thing you&#39;d need to keep track of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you absolutely can mine an empty block.</p>

<p>The hash will always differ from the previous block even if the previous block was also empty due to other data present in the block. Even the new sequential  block ID alone with no other additional data at all would still produce a completely different hash; that&#39;s the beauty of hashing data - only an exact bit-for-bit match will ever result in the exact same hash value. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;only an exact bit-for-bit match will ever result in the exact same hash value&quot; </p>

<p>That&#39;s not exactly correct but you&#39;re  almost all the way there. By the very nature of how a hash function works there are many more possible inputs than there are possible hashes. It&#39;s called a collision when two different inputs result in the same hash function output. The security utility of hash functions depend on just how difficult it would be to compute such a collision... In the case of Bitcoin and classical computing, a computer the size of the known universe computing for longer than the universe has existed would still be incredibly unlikely to discover a collision.</p>

<p>To intuitively understand this, imagine a hash function that takes any input and outputs a 4 digit number. This would not be very useful, because you could find a collision just by making a few hundred guesses. In fact you could compute a workable input for any given output just by making a few tens of thousands of guesses. The hash function used in Bitcoin (sha 256) creates a 256 bit psuedorandom output, vastly larger than a mere 4 digit number.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is kind of what I had in mind; sort of a map of desirable and undesirable timelines by using the common blockchain to navigate, if your intent is to interfere the least.</p>

<p>If your intent is to track other time-travellers, knowing the blockchain in advance allows you to know when something has changed, although your mere presence might affect things.</p>

<p>Actually, if you can&#39;t travel to the past yourself but you can predict the future, Bitcoin serves as a warning bell of travellers from the future changing things since the predicted winning hash won&#39;t match the found winning hash once enough change has reverberated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reddit comment histories require trust in Reddit.  Any digital store of data (database) requires trust of the operator to be neutral <strong>and not to omit or change things</strong>.  Bitcoin decentralizes this trust; indeed in order to change a single byte of the blockchain, you need to overpower the mining network for <strong>every hashing operation done since the change</strong>.  Overriding one block is hard enough, imagine if the data is days or weeks old...</p>

<p>The scenario I imagine is one where systems are run thousands of years into the future.  Data-loss, neutrality, integrity are all <strong>crucial</strong>.  I argue Bitcoin is possibly the first plausible digital store of truth a time-traveller can use.</p>

<p>If a time-traveller used Reddit, what happens when in one of the timelines Reddit goes down and loses data?  What happens when a random bit-flip happens and his encoded string decodes to another valid string?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this checks out dude! I like your &quot;ultimatums&quot; at the bottom, that&#39;s how I&#39;ve always thought of this to rationalize time travel in general.</p>

<p>EITHER you believe time travel is theoretically impossible OR you believe it is possible but we haven&#39;t perfected the means to do so.</p>

<p>IF you believe it is possible, then at some point in the future of the human race it will become a reality at which point people can travel back as far as they want.</p>

<p>THUS, IF you believe time travel is theoretically possible then you have to admit that time travellers could be interfering in our current reality and that it&#39;s equally plausible they have been doing so as far back as Adam &amp; Eve.</p>

<p>NOTE: I am not a genius, I&#39;m just a guy who watched Interstellar. But as far as I know, time travel has already been proven possible via wormholes. It&#39;s more a matter of how to use that knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some caveats.</p>

<p>It might be possible, but it might have rules.</p>

<p>(a) Simple rules: You can&#39;t travel backwards in time. Or, possibly, you won&#39;t be allowed to make changes to the past. Or, the past is self-healing to prevent you from making changes to it (say, by your time machine spontaneously self-destructing). Or, it might be extraordinarily expensive in some way to time travel, either by money or by resource usage.  Possibly you can only visit one time once and once only and then are forever locked out from visiting that time again.</p>

<p>(b) Complex rules: Say, a Primer-like rule that you cannot travel backwards in time longer than the machine has been in existence.</p>

<p>(c) Multiverse rules: You cannot jump from branch to branch. Once something has been changed in the past, you are on a path that leads to a certain future that cannot be altered.</p>

<p>There could be any number of unknown and unknowable rules that affect time travelers, how they travel, and how they interact with us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent points; I&#39;d like to point out specifically point (b):</p>

<p>If time travel is possible, depending on the circumstances it might only be possible to a point where time travel is invented, otherwise there would be a possibility of a time travelling machine spontaneously existing rather than being invented.  I think there are certain criteria required for time travel and the LHC might meet a criteria for a piece of time travelling equipment, and that&#39;s the generation of micro-black holes, or possibly other extreme effects the LHC has.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, while probably not necessary for time travel, would definitely make it a whole lot easier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to hear your arguments on how time travel is not possible; we know for a fact that as temporal beings we &quot;time travel&quot; naturally; we also know that spacetime gets warped due to speed and mass, so where does the hard wall of &quot;not possible&quot; come from?</p>

<p>Personally, I also default to believing time travel to be impossible (or we don&#39;t understand time well enough to realize why we don&#39;t see time travellers; sort of like asking what&#39;s more north than the north pole--our entire understanding is flawed by the initial set of assumptions we&#39;re approaching the problem with).  But saying &quot;time travel is not possible&quot; is a statement, not a hypothesis, and it requires an understanding of <strong>why</strong>.</p>

<p>So, why?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the response, but the fact that GPS works invalidates your premise that spacetime doesn&#39;t work.  The clocks on GPS satellites must be synchronized <em>and</em> adjusted to account for spacetime warping.  There are many experimental proofs of General relativity as well; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Probe_B">Gravity Probe B</a> is just one of many if you were to look.</p>

<p>However, you are exactly right about your second point.  Either time travel to the past is impossible <strong>forever</strong> for <strong>everyone</strong>, <em>or</em> we should see tourists.  The fact we don&#39;t means either they are evading detection, or time travel to the past is truly impossible.</p>

None of what you just said is true.

When I get to my desktop and can look up things properly I will easily prove to you that your GPS argument is flawed and has a far more logical answer that doesn&#39;t require bending of your fantasy space substance </p>

If a neighborhood wants a pothole fixed that is as much a &#39;trade&#39; as you giving someone an end table for a vacuum.
