        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Before anyone brushes this off, please read the entire post. I understand skepticism, I am skeptical too but people need to realize there ARE other options that are being proved to be extremely successful in other countries as well as small clinics in the USA. </p>

<p>My mother was diagnosed with terminal cervical/uterine cancer at 21 after having her first child (my older brother), after multiple treatments the doctors told her she would never have any more kids and wouldn&#39;t live to see her son raised. </p>

<p>That&#39;s when she turned to the natural world and began taking incredibly good care of herself, getting colon-hydrotherapy treatments, and taking supplements. After not having a period for over a year and being told she was going to die, 6 months after beginning natural treatment she had a period, went to the doctor, and was told that she was cancer free. </p>

<p>She is now 58, has had 4 more children and is probably in the best health of her life. She has been a colon-hydrotherapist for over 30 years now and is one of the most knowledgeable people I know about natural health. </p>

<p>I honestly always brushed this story off because I grew up with my mom spouting this stuff constantly and didn&#39;t really take her seriously. I am a biology major and get the typical story about cancer and cancer treatment. I am very pro-science and this all seemed a little hokey to me because I never saw any evidence. </p>

<p>Then I watched this documentary and discovered that people in Germany (and in the US but on a smaller scale) are actually using these treatments and getting 90-93% success rates in ridding people of their cancer in as little as 30 days. </p>

<p>Treatments consist of personalized vitamin infusions to boost the immune system, diet changes, hyperthermia treatments, colon-hydrotherapy, and countless other things that focus on strengthening to body to give it the tools to defend itself. </p>

<p>Do I believe there is a place for modern, western medicine? Of course. But the fact that doctors receive $$ for referring patients to chemotherapy, and the fact that congress refuses to legalize a lot of these treatments even though they have been proven to be effective, points to the big pharmaceutical companies having their hands in the mess. </p>

<p>I would highly recommend people watch this documentary and do their own research into these treatments. It is truly incredible and I have had a firsthand account from my mother. </p>

<p>Also, it is important to note that I am extremely pro-science and think that stem cell therapy, immunotherapy, and other developing treatments have INCREDIBLE potential to be the next-generation of cancer treatment. Science is amazing and the technology is cutting edge. But I can&#39;t help but think that what the pharmaceutical companies are pushing in this country can&#39;t be the entire story when our entire system is based on profit for the elite and control of the masses. Science tells a different story with these other treatments, and it seems like they are being silenced in the US.  </p>

She is pretty well-known in her field but has always been self-employed and obviously struggles to get people to come and see her lol. </p>

Nothing really super new to the game, just really focusing on eating proper foods to strengthen the body. Avoiding processed foods and especially processed sugars.

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty much just lots of processed foods. She never paid much attention to her health because she has always been a small woman and didn&#39;t know anything about it. She would commonly eat a bag of chips or a candy bar for lunch for quick energy. She also grew up with a really rough home life. She was in foster care and faced all kinds of trauma, so I can&#39;t help but think that played a part in her getting sick so young. Thank you! She&#39;s a wonderful, strong woman, not to mention one of the kindest and funniest people I&#39;ve ever known lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep! Acidity seems to play a role in many diseases. My mom sees crazy amounts of acid come out of people, she thinks it plays a large role in a lot of skin conditions like eczema, and digestive issues like gluten intolerance. Acidity in the system gives diseases a hospital environment just like you said. If you fix the environment, stuff can&#39;t survive in it.   </p>

<p>When I was a little girl I wanted to travel the world - like a pirate but a good guy. I&#39;ve always been a good guy. Being a good guy has been a big deal for me.</p>

<p>My sisters called me &quot;goody two-shoes&quot; (in my parent&#39;s presence anyway).</p>

<p>When I got older, that meant taking care of myself - body is a temple, kinda thing. Then I thought I wanted to study medicine but I don&#39;t really like most people in person. They&#39;re lovelier as a concept.</p>

<p>So after trying finance for a while, doing a fair bit of traveling, I decided I wanted to be a research scientist. That&#39;s the ticket. I can save the world by using my brain. Arrrr, Matey.</p>

<p>This whole time though, right from the beginning, I was always sick There was always something going wrong. From brain surgery to Crohn&#39;s disease, it&#39;s been a real struggle.</p>

<p>And then cancer.</p>

<p>So no. You haven&#39;t met a pharma rep. You bumped into a real person on the internet who has had real struggles- just like you. Except I&#39;ve tried everything in life from prayer and homeopathy to vegetarianism back to keto diet, extreme physical fitness and meditation...and science.</p>

<p>Only one thing can be relied on in life - fact based evidence.</p>

<p>To be honest as someone who watched a loved one with an entirely healthy mostly whole foods diet developed a large breast tumor and watched it continue to grow even after diagnosis before any chemotherapy during a time she was even MORE mindful of her diet and health- then watched the chemo beat the fucking shit out of the tumor with manageable side effects to the woman I feel kind of unsure how to take all this bashing of the oncologist community.  Most of these standard cancer drugs outside the hormone suppressors and newer immunotherapy are 30-150 year old technology and are NOT BIG money for pharmaceutical companies the way anti-depressants and blood pressure medications are.... let alone vitamins or steroids</p>

<p>If these natural remedies worked, then why do all the people who run big pharma still get cancer and still use their own chemotherapy/radiation and surgery?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia -is the potentially premalignant transformation and abnormal growth (dysplasia) of squamous cells on the surface of the cervix.</p>

<p>When you are diagnosed, it is CIN1, CIN2, or CIN3 according to the level of irregular growth.</p>

<p>Both CIN2 and CIN3 are serious enough to require LEEP.</p>

<p>CIN3 often contains cancerous cells, carcinoma in situ. In fact, carcinoma in situ is also known as Stage 0 cancer.</p>

<p>A LEEP removes the epithelial tissue from the cervix. It is and has been the prescribed remedy for CIN3 for decades. It is usually sufficient. </p>

<p>Had she had <strong>invasive cervical cancer</strong>, they would have recommended at least a partial hysterectomy, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Invasive cancer begins the actual staging you&#39;re familiar with in talking about cancer.</p>

<p>1 in 25 women in the United States are diagnosed with CIN2 or higher which requires removal of epithelial tissue to prevent invasive cancer. As it is, only around 12,000 women in the US are diagnosed with invasive cancer BECAUSE LEEPs work. Not all those women take care of themselves. Some, I&#39;m sure, perform seances or have people rolling on the floor, speaking in tongues on their behalf. Some of them are professional athletes. The one thing they all have in common is the LEEP.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t mind if you think your Mom was cured by some home remedy but I do mind if you start pushing it as a cure for cancer.</p>

<p><strong>You want to talk about rude?</strong></p>

<p>Consider all the women who believe what you tell them and it doesn&#39;t work and then they feel like a failure. It must be something they did wrong. They just didn&#39;t TRY hard enough.</p>

<p>When the fact is, Olympic athletes have died of cervical cancer. </p>

<p>Making people think they just aren&#39;t living right and that&#39;s why they&#39;re sick...that&#39;s fucking rude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When did I ever say this was the only thing they should try or that it was a &quot;cure-all&quot;. All I&#39;m saying is some people are seeing success with these treatments, I explicitly stated traditional treatment works and it has its place. I do think people should be aware of options, but obviously traditional cancer treatment is around for a reason. Just because I believe something is worth researching further does not mean I&#39;m pushing it on people all the time. I know a LOT of people with cancer and I haven&#39;t mentioned it to a single one of them, nor would I. It&#39;s not my place and I believe in western medicine. I already said that. </p>

<p>Then there is a whole slew of alleged patients who encourage you to dismiss science and embrace natural remedies.</p>

There was absolutely no way that some sinister force would be at work to profit off cancer patients rather than taking away their unspeakable pain and loss. So when these doctors at natural clinics explained that cancer was just a symptom of something being out of balance in the body, and that it was possible to bring the body back in balance and starve the cancer, I couldn’t believe it.</a></p>

<p>Hey everyone! As my title states, I just got my new paulina deck, <strong>before this I had the wild unknown</strong> and was having a lot of trouble drawing from the imagery. I&#39;m not going to give up on it, but <strong>I&#39;ve wanted the Paulina deck for forever</strong> so I figured I&#39;d give in.
Anyway, <strong>I opened the deck and cleansed it with sage</strong>, and after looking through the cards I did a brief interview with the deck. However, when I asked the deck how it felt about me, I drew a reversed five of swords. This concerned me immediately because it&#39;s not the most positive card and I really want to get along well with the deck.</p>

<p>So...I don&#39;t really care. I think I have a tarot deck lying around that my sister gave to one of my kids and we&#39;ve done some readings...I&#39;m just saying that this does not appear to be as you said - curiosity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a friend who had the paulina deck in high school and I always thought it was pretty. This was the same friend who told me I should buy a tarot deck. I&#39;ve literally used both my decks combined a total of 5 times and haven&#39;t even touched them since I wrote that post. But that&#39;s fine if you want to tear apart everything you think you know about me. Also having to Google what the cards mean (where I got the information you think I&#39;m so &quot;well versed&quot; in), is not the same as knowing what they mean and having to ask reddit for more info if I could actually do it myself. Don&#39;t you think I&#39;d have more posts about it if I was as into it as you make it seem like I am? Lol I&#39;m a stranger on the internet yet you know so much about me from a single post.  I&#39;m a science major who doesn&#39;t typically believe in any of this stuff (ask any of my friends, really) and found empirical evidence that some of these treatments are working for people, but again, I never said it was a cure-all. I never said it was for everyone, I stated multiple times traditional cancer treatment works. I know how cancer works and that not everyone can benefit from the same treatment as well. As I stated earlier, I haven&#39;t even told any of my friends with cancer about this because I don&#39;t want to give them false hope or make them feel bad about their current treatment. I would never do that, so get off my back with all your weird assumptions, because literally none of them are true. </p>

After about a week it started scabbing up. We kept up the treatments for another week. After it was completely scabbed we started leaving it uncovered and used a coconut oil baking soda paste for another week. After the scab fell off it was completely gone. It was crazy because the Apple cider vinegar didn&#39;t affect the healthy skin around it at all, just the carcinoma turned into a scab. She uses the baking soda coconut oil paste on the area every night before bed just to be safe, and it hasn&#39;t come back. It&#39;s been a year. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, for the science. Has there been any study posted?</p>

<p>If this treatment works, there needs to be hard numbers behind it. Gather data on outcomes, compare to historical survival rates. Record exact diagnoses. What other treatments are they on? Follow up with each patient after 2 years. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be tempted to make the numbers seem better by ignoring patients with bad outcomes, or assuming ones with bad outcomes didn&#39;t do it right. This may be where the extremely high 90% rates come from. I know of one alt clinic that judged patients cured if they seemed healthy when they left the 10 day treatment, and so advertised a near 100% rate. You have to be really careful to be rigorous. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t base anything on first hand accounts. At this point, if it really helps patients, someone needs to gather numbers to make the case and write a study. Be prepared if the numbers don&#39;t match your expectations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for posting this! Medical Conspiracy is real. The US is being hosted when it comes to pharmaceuticals, and the very large majority of drugs developed in the last 15 years have been to mask symptoms, never addressing the root cause of the disease or illness they are supposed to help with. I was ill with an “incurable” disease, given drugs that barely masked the symptoms, and actually caused my body more damage. I eventually found my way to natural medicine and was healed and cured of my disease/illnesses in a matter of months. Mainstream US medicine likes to treat the body like an inanimate object unable to regenerate. They tell people suffering with chronic illness that their life will be just taking drugs (that barely work) and living will illness until they die. And it does not have to work like that. </p>

<p>There are doctors who reverse the damage and stop chronic illness with natural medicine (pharmaceutical medicine is not a viable option for cures because is not designed to heal, it’s designed to keep lifelong customers). And if some doctors have figured out what is going on in the body that causes chronic illness and what it takes to heal the damage and get the body functioning properly on its own again, there is no fucking way that some people in the pharmaceutical industry have not figured this shit out. </p>

<p>This why mainstream medicine is so compartmentalized. You cannot see what is going on with the body if we treat each organ system like an island, unconnected to other organ systems. They all work in conjunction with one another and this is basic logic that somehow medical practitioners cannot see. A person has chronic headaches, they are sent to a neurologist. They have any type of joint pain, they go to a rheumatologist. They have stomach issues or fatigue or skin issues, this just continues. But then no one is taking into account the whole or how and in what way the symptoms are connected. This keeps people from getting proper diagnoses, and keeps them in “syndrome” categories which to mainstream medicine are considered idiopathic and therefor are incurable. </p>

<p>It happened to me. I had to figure it out myself just to find the right type doctor to properly diagnose me. And then I was put in symptom masking pills. That was clearly not the right way to live so I eventually ended up with natural medicine, and thank fucking god for that. </p>

<p>Our nation is sick and it’s being kept that way intentionally. There is just NO way that someone in big pharma has not put this together. It’s the compartmentalization of both treatment and research which keeps this all hidden from us and those who work in the industry. And I find it very hard to believe that is not intentional. </p>

<p>(Sorry if the flow of what I wrote is odd, I wrote it on my phone and so it was just mental flow of ideas I think and talk about often.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a friend who had the paulina deck in high school and I always thought it was pretty. This was the same friend who told me I should buy a tarot deck. I&#39;ve literally used both my decks combined a total of 5 times and haven&#39;t even touched them since I wrote that post. But that&#39;s fine if you want to tear apart everything you think you know about me. Also having to Google what the cards mean (where I got the information you think I&#39;m so &quot;well versed&quot; in), is not the same as knowing what they mean and having to ask reddit for more info if I could actually do it myself. Don&#39;t you think I&#39;d have more posts about it if I was as into it as you make it seem like I am? Lol I&#39;m a stranger on the internet yet you know so much about me from a single post.  I&#39;m a science major who doesn&#39;t typically believe in any of this stuff (ask any of my friends, really) and found empirical evidence that some of these treatments are working for people, but again, I never said it was a cure-all. I never said it was for everyone, I stated multiple times traditional cancer treatment works. I know how cancer works and that not everyone can benefit from the same treatment as well. As I stated earlier, I haven&#39;t even told any of my friends with cancer about this because I don&#39;t want to give them false hope or make them feel bad about their current treatment. I would never do that, so get off my back with all your weird assumptions, because literally none of them are true. </p>
