       And a former Secretary of State and twice ex-Presidential candidate. She's been in high positions of power for years. Don't act like she's some sweet old lady just because she doesn't hold the absolute highest seat of power in this country. By that logic, Flynn, Manafort and the rest should be left alone because they aren't the President.

       I didn't say she's a sweet old lady. I said they absolutely don't deserve the same amount of scrutiny at this current time. Trump is the president, and the people who worked for him and went down on federal charges absolutely deserve scrutiny. A lot more than someone who's not in office and not facing any federal charges.

       Why not the same level of scrutiny? Many people agree that there is far more evidence in regards to Uranium 1, including an FBI informant that had a gag order put on them by Obama.

       She is literally sitting at home knitting. I didn't walk anything back. Many people agree? That's a horrible argument. Many people agree that ghosts exist. Oh you think muh Russia is going to take down Hillary? 4 cronies from the Trump administration go down on federal charges and obviously the next one will be Hillary. The hopeful thinking here is quite hilarious.

       You are at home touching yourself over Flynn getting arrested while simultaneously saying Clinton shouldn't be held to same scrutiny. The irony.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people agree because of the information that's been presented in regards to her role on CFIUS and the connections she has to the Podesta Group. The FBI informant has stated that there is evidence kickbacks were paid to the Clintons via their foundation. Why shouldn't she be subjected to the same scrutiny? Why do you think that just because she isn't President, these things shouldn't be looked into further? If someone rapes and murders your mother, and a suspect is identified who isn't Donald Trump, should they not be investigated either?

       Woah you've really gone off the rails here. You should also learn what irony means. Not sure you understand what scrutiny means in this context either. Does the person who killed my mom deserve the same amount of national scrutiny as the president of the United States right now? Should the news spend equal time talking about Trump and the guy who killed my mom?

       Ironic because you say Clinton is not President so shouldn't be subjected to scrutiny. While at same time you are fapping over Flynn getting brought in. Even though he's not the President. That's irony.
      </p>

       Crimes deserve justice. Period. I don't know what scrutiny means? You seem to think scrutiny is defined as media coverage. Are you fucking serious?

      <p>
       Trump might have more power than Hillary at this very second. He didn't 12 months ago. So according to you, she should be able to go on her merry way now. Incredible. People like you are the reason politicians take advantage of us in the United States. If holding office means I'm able to commit crimes and can't be held accountable for them if they aren't discovered until I leave office, who wouldn't go into politics and become a scumbag criminal? You're a fucking moron. And your mentality is extremely dangerous.

       Wrong again bud. I never said Hillary was immune to sctruniy. I simply said back at the top of this thread that the president of the United States and Hillary don't deserve the same amount of scrutiny from the media. Then you started going off. Take a deep breath big guy.

       Yeah you just wrote her off as sitting at home knitting.

      <p>
       You are wrong here; all serious crime deserves scrutiny. The crimes committed by people so high up in the power structure merit more of it at times because of the scope and scale of their crimes and how many people they can impact and how dangerous it can be for an entire country or the entire planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between Trump and Clinton is fractional, and only in recent times. Historically, the Clintons had far more power than Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that you have shown yourself to favor preferential treatment to Hillary over Trump, you want to turn this discussion into me overreacting and needing to calm down. You're a disgrace.

       I already pointed out to you how confused you are in regards to those terms. It's pathetic to watch your argument devolve into this. But it's expected because of how easy it was to point out your willingness to turn a blind eye towards Hillary just because she is not POTUS.

       I don't have favoritism when it comes to how crimes they commit should be handled. You have clearly stated that because Hillary lost to Trump, her crimes can be brushed aside. Even though she held the third highest office in the nation. That's why you are a moron.

        I didn't say she's a sweet old lady. I said
        <strong>
         they absolutely don't deserve the same amount of scrutiny at this current time
        </strong>
        . Trump is the president, and the people who worked for him and went down on federal charges absolutely deserve scrutiny. A lot more than someone who's not in office and not facing any federal charges.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       According to you, Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State from the previous administration, the third highest seat in the nation, does not deserve the same scrutiny as Trump...
       <em>
        at this time
       </em>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       So when then? In a few months when the Trump/Russia investigation is wrapped up? What is an appropriate timeline, in your opinion? On a scale of 1-100, Trump being 100, would you say Hillary deserves a scrutiny level of a 98? Just trying to get an idea of how far off we are here.

       Ahh so I never said all these things you claimed. Cool, thanks. I said the media shouldn't be spending as much time talking about Hillary as they should about Trump right now. That's a straight forward fact. One is the leader of the free world. One is sitting at home knitting. Thanks for reminding me that I made a completely reasonable point.

       Yeah and let's hope they get her for whatever crimes she's committed, but what relevance does any of this have to the current controversies in Trump's administration?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I'm wondering why every post critical of Trump seems to need a comment about Hillary. What's the point?

       Ironic because you say Clinton is not President so shouldn't be subjected to scrutiny. While at same time you are fapping over Flynn getting brought in. Even though he's not the President. That's irony.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crimes deserve justice. Period. I don't know what scrutiny means? You seem to think scrutiny is defined as media coverage. Are you fucking serious?

       Trump might have more power than Hillary at this very second. He didn't 12 months ago. So according to you, she should be able to go on her merry way now. Incredible. People like you are the reason politicians take advantage of us in the United States. If holding office means I'm able to commit crimes and can't be held accountable for them if they aren't discovered until I leave office, who wouldn't go into politics and become a scumbag criminal? You're a fucking moron. And your mentality is extremely dangerous.
