What if some high religious leaders of each group came out and admitted together on live television that God/Jesus/Allah/Yahweh/etc. were all just made up stories, based on some things that actually happened and were embellished to the max?</p>

<p>How do you think the world would react to such a news event?</p>

<p>EDIT: I should clarify. The STORIES of God, as interpreted in these texts. Meaning the Bible/Koran/Etc. debunked by big wigs in each religion. I guess no one can really prove that he does or doesn&#39;t exist, until we die. But the texts themselves can be questioned.</p>

<p>Like, if it was the Pope, I don&#39;t know how you fire a Pope, they can ask him to step down, but if he says no, then what? And the Pope,  yeah he might be taken pretty seriously, but I think most people would just continue to go on believing. </p>

So many here have no faith in God or an afterlife as it is - if it was &quot;absolutely proven&quot; that their was no source and it&#39;s absolute nothingness when we die and that was believed....I think if people knew that they only had this one life and that was absolutely it, we would defiantly still have a large amount of people smoking, drinking, skydiving, all the trill seeking stuff we have now because why not?

<p>That is not necessarily true to some people because it is not provable. The rationale science demands of its disciples works within theists as well, the demand for proof, just working in reverse.</p>

<p>This allows people to subconsciously accept bad choices, because it&#39;s not REALLY forever, <em>right</em>?</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t agree with this so hopefully we can agree to disagree :)</p>

<p>World is going to end in 3 months for every single person indefinitely? And never come back in this form or any other? I&#39;m going to party and have a good time (after the initial shock). Why not? </p>

<p>Of course I believe a lot of people would fall into despair but not every single person would die crying in the fetal position at the end of those 3 months.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you provide some evidence of this, like which communities and which behaviours are you talking about? Can you provide data? I agree,  you completely misunderstand atheism. In fact, you are displaying clear bigotry against non-believers. I think you should open your mind more and visit some countries that are post-Christian and see that they are much like everywhere else, with some great aspects of their culture and some not so great. By and large, they are the most attractive places on the planet to live. In the most sincere way, you should attempt to see things from an atheist&#39;s shoes without projecting from within your own worldview. As an atheist who grew up around both religious and non-religious people, you seem to not only misunderstand non-belief, but also basic human nature.</p>

<p>What kind of effect would this have upon food production, transportation of people and goods, availability of services and such?</p>

<p>From there, we could expect rises in prices and wages (which would result in even higher prices)! Potentially underskilled workers replacing missing employees, slowly collapsing luxury markets...</p>

<p>If a large segment of the population suddenly had their beliefs removed, the people that came out of that event would vary: from total nihilists, criminals, dead beats, suicides - to, vastly improved &quot;enjoyment of the moment&quot; and perhaps some better people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you provide any data to show what the effects of non-belief are? It seems like you are making huge assumptions. Most atheists view atheism as a net positive as it frees people from superstition and magical thinking, and therefore encourages scientific research and rational thinking. And, because of this, one could argue that they are happier. There is a reddit discussion on it [here] with sources (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2zszb1/the_happiest_countries_are_also_the_least/">https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2zszb1/the_happiest_countries_are_also_the_least/</a>). There is also a correlation between rule of law and atheism (see <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/epiphenom/2009/06/atheist-nations-are-more-peaceful.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>So I ask again, what is the relationship you are arguing for and where is your data? Which countries are you looking to for the moral breakdown you envisage in this godless world?</p>

<p>Happy to discuss your findings,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This WHOLE thread is built on a theoretical event that literally cannot happen... as with all theists, I end up not caring 100% about &quot;data&quot; and more about life experiences and as with all atheists, you are never satisfied with letting anyone else have their own opinion unless it already fits YOUR view (ie: 100% data).</p>

<p>I will give you a hint (straight from the source, if you will). In attempting to convert theists to rationalism, there is an order to argument that seems prevalent to me.</p>

<p>Wisdom is stronger than belief, belief out ranks straight intelligence however (or else everyone would be atheist, right?)</p>

<p>As such, atheism, which holds as its belief: (human) intelligence, can only progress so far without the application of real world, tangible solutions.</p>

<p>Sterile lab results and studies of far away countries simply do not classify as wisdom, something that belief originates from and thus, is the only force it can be changed by.</p>

<p>When atheism becomes wise (as in: the proper (moral) application of intelligence (the ends do not justify the means, regardless of a godless universe)), it will not need to attack belief, it can simply enlighten it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have already told you theists do not require data for everything in life (read: I don&#39;t care about studies from other countries where people (if you want data) think differently from us, from the level of how their brain functions based on the language they speak and up).</p>

<p>&quot;Advanced societies&quot; ooooh, <em>advanced</em>. So what, Mesopotamia, Canaan, Egypt, Greece, Rome, Renaissance Italy, Europe, Feudal Japan, Imperial China - all these are backward because their leaders were not atheist? I hate how atheism presumes superiority, without any of its precious evidence to back it up. Besides, you literally said there are advanced societies where everyone is an atheist, prove THAT please. I&#39;ll wait and if you&#39;re telling the truth, I&#39;ll be the first person to go there. That place sounds fucking fantastic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing is making logical sense at this point. You are going around in circles.</p>

<p>You said we cannot have this discussion as we cannot disprove god. However, you also claimed that certain behavioural traits were linked to atheism. When I asked for proof of that you said that theists did not need to provide data for their claims (lol).</p>

<p>You completely confused the next point I made which was not that we do not need to disprove god. I said that as there are countries that are already atheistic, these people do not need convincing BECAUSE THEY ARE ALREADY atheist. Therefore, we can look to their behaviour NOW to see any correlation between behaviour and atheism.</p>

<p>I never said these countries were paradise. I never said anything like that. What I did say was that, by and large, the happiest countries in the world are non-religious and have the highest proportion of atheists.</p>

<p>And asking for data does not show that atheism is a religion. That is the opposite. I am asking for evidence. Nothing I have said is being based in blind faith. Unlike you. You are displaying religious thinking.</p>

<p>I think r/Vigte is projecting what he thinks a godless world would feel like without just visiting Norway and seeing for himself. Don&#39;t forget, to most people in northern Europe, to all intents and purposes, it has already been proven that god does not exist. And they are the happiest societies on the planet according to many polls. They drink tons of beer, probably enjoy extreme sports as much as anyone on the planet, and generally live for the moment (as much as anywhere else). Are they living like animals? What an frankly odd thing to claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Christians, Muslims and all the other absolutists need to realize that their God is not the real God. </p>

<p>I think there is no question that Humankind is the product of intelligent design. It&#39;s becoming clearer and clearer that there are beings from ours or other star systems that have a hand in our creation. </p>

<p>Furthermore the rythmic nature of this planet clearly shows that there is an inter-connectedness with the universe around it. And that that void in human understanding has an innate intelligence behind it. </p>

<p>So the question really is how to red-pill the jihadists and templars into realizing the <em>real</em> truth of our World and our Universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First let&#39;s define God:</p>

<p>To speak of “God” properly, then—to use the word in a sense consonant with the teachings of orthodox Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, Hinduism, Bahá’í, a great deal of antique paganism, and so forth—is to speak of the one infinite source of all that is: eternal, omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, uncreated, uncaused, perfectly transcendent of all things and for that very reason absolutely immanent to all things. God so understood is not something posed over against the universe, in addition to it, nor is he the universe itself. He is not a “being,” at least not in the way that a tree, a shoemaker, or a god is a being; he is not one more object in the inventory of things that are, or any sort of discrete object at all. Rather, all things that exist receive their being continuously from him, who is the infinite wellspring of all that is, in whom (to use the language of the Christian scriptures) all things live and move and have their being. In one sense he is “beyond being,” if by “being” one means the totality of discrete, finite things. In another sense he is “being itself,” in that he is the inexhaustible source of all reality, the absolute upon which the contingent is always utterly dependent, the unity and simplicity that underlies and sustains the diversity of finite and composite things. Infinite being, infinite consciousness, infinite bliss, from whom we are, by whom we know and are known, and in whom we find our only true consummation. All the great theistic traditions agree that God, understood in this proper sense, is essentially beyond finite comprehension; hence, much of the language used of him is negative in form and has been reached only by a logical process of abstraction from those qualities of finite reality that make it insufficient to account for its own existence. All agree as well, however, that he can genuinely be known: that is, reasoned toward, intimately encountered, directly experienced with a fullness surpassing mere conceptual comprehension.</p>

<p>David Bentley Hart</p>

<p>With that out of the way, probably half the population of believers will go on with their lives just accepting the fact. The other half would continue to believe what they&#39;ve always believed as that&#39;s how &quot;faith&quot; works sometimes. The rest of the world would find it amusing for a few days and then life would go on.</p>

If people, or a group of scientists, religious experts, or whoever, proves to the masses that God (not just necessarily biblical God, but negating a source entirely) doesn&#39;t exist - why would I believe them? &quot;Evidence&quot; can be faked or heavily misunderstood and manipulated.</p>

<p>Only in death will I <em>begin</em> to truly see truth and even then it is just the beginning. What I experience here only shows me glimpses of what is actually out there once we are no longer physical beings. Instead it&#39;s filled with deception. This whole world is deceiving in all corners and aspects. It&#39;s a test/tool that we (hopefully) learn from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it does. It is a spiritual battle ultimately.</p>

<p>With that being said, if God doesn&#39;t exist, we will die. That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>If God does exists  (and I believe he does), then this implies that our lives do have meaning.</p>

<p>Nihilism is the modern tool of the devil.</p>

<p>Anyway, Pascal&#39;s wager is how I live.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You cannot prove a negative, hence, you cannot prove that God doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Betrand Russel used the example of the teapot orbiting the sun. You cannot prove there&#39;s not a teapot in orbit around the sun, but why would you think so? You wouldn&#39;t. Now imagine that you have a whole culture built around the story of the teapon, tons of scriptures explaining it&#39;s qualities and so on and so forth. Still pretty unlikely, but it cannot be disproved.</p>

<p>I think we need to look elsewhere than the question of whether there&#39;s a god or not, if we want answers to the question of the nature of reality and consciousness.</p>

<p>I can highly recommend studying the work of Robert Lanza, Donald Hoffman and B. Alan Wallace on the topic of reality.</p>

<p>Basically, when we&#39;re asking about god, I think we&#39;re - somewhat clumsily - asking what Einstein called the most important question: Is this a kind universe?</p>

<p>In my perception, all that we experience, every instance of sentience, is the product of primordial creativity which is the very fabric of reality. That is what it is: An expanse of infinite possibility and basic knowing, and we are part of that, which is why we have experiences.</p>

<p>What we perceive is the result of the content of our consciousness, our past actions of body speech and mind, and our intention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To prove that God doesn&#39;t exist you&#39;ll first have to define what you tested for exactly. I think you&#39;ll find no two identical descriptions of what God is to believers anywhere, so at best you can disprove your own notions of God.</p>

<p>If I claim that God is Love (which incidentally is precisely what I personally hold true), you&#39;d have to prove that love does not exist. If you want to prove that love doesn&#39;t exist, you&#39;ll have to define what love is, and again, good luck with that. It&#39;s not something that CAN be defined beyond vague descriptions and associations. If I claim that Love is a resonance of harmonising frequencies in the morphogenetic field which manifests a biochemical response within the bodies which hold those frequencies,... well, I guess then you&#39;ll have your hands full disproving my notion of God.</p>

<p>Is there a man in the clouds who judges people for masturbating? Probably not. Is that really the kind of entity that people think of when they pray? Maybe for some, but probably fewer than you&#39;d think. The bearded man is little more than the patriarchal metaphor for the gentle love of a caring parent.</p>

<p>At least that&#39;s my impression.</p>

<p>Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. 
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? 
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?</p>
