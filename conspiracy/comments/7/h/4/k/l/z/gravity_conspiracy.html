<p>So how is it that gravity just stops when they travel to space? How does gravity stop and a vacuum begin? It makes no sense to me. </p>

<p>Take for example what we think as meteor showers, these are being attracted to the earth, correct? Then how does a space shuttle enter space and then they start floating around in No gravity.</p>

<p>Think of how gold in water, compared to oxygen in water. Because of the surrounding volume we can observe difference in density. </p>

<p>Rain is more dense that nitrogen gas so there for we have rain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kiwi prove me wrong. Just keep trying. I will applaud the day you have &quot;gravity&quot; more figured out than the rest of the class. People have not accepted that gravity was a stupid farce. I imagine you think there is a tangible form time and space. Which has never been proven, and will never be proven. It is a measurement of reality not a tangible force. Gravity was another trial for that concept, and it has since failed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are not more dense than the force created from a rotating planet. That is the kicker. On top of the fact that the &quot;vacuum&quot; of space implies a constant motion. This again is more powerful than a space shuttle or astronaut. So unless you using the force of another celestial body you will just keep moving in the direction of moving pressure. For example solar sails could work off solar flares.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well first it is good to remember that heat/energy is motion, and pressure is direction. So even on micro level we can see structures move in beats. Constriction, and expansion. </p>

<p>Secondly density will cause the object in question to fall if the volume occupied is less dense. Other wise like oxygen in water that bad boy rises fairly fast. UFO space craft use this same principle. Turning something into a photon from a solid, gas, plasma, or liquid state is a large burst of energy. A beach ball under water. </p>

<p>Imagine if that beach ball was full of water, but by using 
 reverse polarization (or quickly safely heating the ball up) you separated the oxygen in it? Well boom that sucker moves. Which main stream science doesn&#39;t even consider when building vehicles. The reality is jet propulsion is straight up primitive. Nothing in nature uses that pattern. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Secondly density will cause the object in question to fall if the volume occupied is less dense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. Density has nothing to do with the direction of motion. There has to be some other force giving a direction to the motion. Dense objects <em>fall</em> toward the center of mass because of gravity. No gravity, no <em>falling</em>.</p>

<p>Consider this: In a lab we set up a sphere of water containing within it a small balloon of much less dense gas. What happens if the balloon is above the center of the sphere when it is released? It &quot;floats&quot; away from the center... right? </p>

<p>So that <em>could</em> be because the balloon is less dense than the water and the water is pushing it to the surface, trying to move it out of the water.</p>

<p>Now we do the same thing but release the balloon <em>below</em> the center of the sphere. This time it &quot;floats&quot; toward the center of the sphere of water, initially becoming deeper within the sphere.</p>

<p>How does this work? If the more dense water is pushing the balloon to the surface, it should push it away from the center... right? So why does the opposite happen?</p>

<p>It happens because in reality all the water in the sphere is trying to fall towards the center of mass, which on earth is the center of the earth. The water is &quot;falling&quot; towards the center because gravity is pulling on it with a strength relative to its density. The less dense balloon is <em>also</em> being pulled to the center of the earth, but less strongly. This causes the balloon to float to the top of the sphere, no matter where it is released.</p>

<p>The direction the balloon moves is solely governed by the direction of gravity, and has nothing to do with density.</p>

<p>If the gas in the balloon is less dense than water, but more dense than air, the balloon will rise until it reaches the less dense air, then will simply sit there, because gravity stops it from moving any higher. If the gas in the balloon is less dense than air then it will keep rising until it is high enough above the earth than the density of air is less than the density of the gas within it, and then it will just sit there.</p>

<p>At no point does gravity stop working on it, and the only reason it floated up to that altitude is because gravity was working more strongly on the air around it.</p>

<p>Put simply - no gravity, no buoyancy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your lab experiment doesn&#39;t work because the volume occupied has not changed. IF we were in the dead middle of space your point would be proven. However none of that really matters. </p>

<p>Humanity hasn&#39;t put this together, but a center point of density is why our planet is a sphere. More over pressure from heavy density adds the direction you are looking for in my science. Much like the formation of a planet the key factors are HEAT, and PRESSURE. </p>

<p>To add a little more on this cake, you should be aware that black matter has been disproved. Which means is &quot;Space&quot; is truly a translucent void. Most likely being pushed along side the galaxy, or large cosmic object moving. Ideally our very reality hinged on something becoming so dense that it broke threw a bottom layer funneling all of matter into this cosmic sink hole. Which creates the spiral effect all of this reality resembles. </p>

<p>Meteor showers aren&#39;t objects being being pulled across space to earth. It&#39;s the Earth&#39;s orbit taking it through debris fields. The gravity from Earth (and other planets - Jupiter, for instance) can affect the trajectory and orbit of the debris fields, but I think you&#39;re just largely misunderstanding basic astrophysics.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t. The speed at which they are orbiting the Earth keeps them in a perpetual state of free fall. They are going around the Earth at 17k mph. Their orbital velocity essentially makes it so they are falling <em>around</em> the Earth rather than <em>to</em> it. </p>

<p>You really ought to take your own advice. As I mentioned in another post, the answers to your questions are literally a few seconds of searching away.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s be honest here: you&#39;re not asking these questions in good faith. You&#39;re not actually curious about the answers. You&#39;ve made up your mind and think you&#39;re smart enough to play a game of &quot;gotcha.&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you&#39;ve chosen some pretty basic stuff to base your game on. Trying something a little more complex, something that even layman couldn&#39;t answer themselves with a four-second Google, and maybe you&#39;ll do better with your bait.</p>

<p>I&#39;m okay with that. If this was someone asking sincere questions and truthfully looking for answers to them, no problem respecting that and trying to have a decent discussion with them.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not, though, and that is evident. Whether simply trolling or they&#39;re truly this out of it, it doesn&#39;t matter. After a certain point, neither scenario is worth a great deal of time or respect. They&#39;ve gotten many, many good and factual answers throughout the thread.

<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-microgravity-58.html">&quot;Microgravity is the condition in which people or objects appear to be weightless. The effects of microgravity can be seen when astronauts and objects float in space. Microgravity can be experienced in other ways, as well. &quot;Micro-&quot; means &quot;very small,&quot; so microgravity refers to the condition where gravity seems to be very small. In microgravity, astronauts can float in their spacecraft - or outside, on a spacewalk. Heavy objects move around easily. For example, astronauts can move equipment weighing hundreds of pounds with their fingertips. Microgravity is sometimes called &quot;zero gravity,&quot; but this is misleading.&quot;</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup!  As long as gravity is the only force acting on them (they&#39;re in free fall) they will appear to be weightless.  They&#39;re not weightless (gravity is still pulling them down, being pulled down by gravity is how we define weight) but they appear to be weightless next to all the other stuff that&#39;s falling right along with them.</p>

<p>But, in order orbit in the first place, you need the force of gravity acting on you.  So it&#39;s important that they still feel gravity pulling on them, otherwise they&#39;d just fly into space.  What&#39;s more, it doesn&#39;t really matter how strong the gravity is.  It could be 100 times greater than earth&#39;s gravity, and as long as they&#39;re in free fall, they&#39;ll still feel weightless.</p>

Think of it like firing a bullet.. the bullet overcomes the force of gravity. But the spacecraft is traveling at a speed much faster than a bullet even.

<p>There is gravity in space.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>how does a space shuttle enter space and then they start floating around in No gravity. Good luck explaining this.</p>

<p>The shuttle is in a perpetual state of free fall. The astronauts inside are not actually weightless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hehehe, that&#39;s what I mean, an orbit has an attraction still but the astronauts are beyond that force. It&#39;s not a balance, it shows it can&#39;t happen. Gravity cannot be selective even in free fall you are falling Towards something, there would always be that tendency towards a direction.</p>

<p>They would have to constantly be forcing themselves away from the attraction , and obviously they aren&#39;t propelling themselves outward constantly to maintain this perfect balance of attraction /repulsion, and walk that line to keep from getting pulled to earth. You have to maintain balance and they can&#39;t do that in a vacuum where they are subject to the gravity of larger objects in space.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>This is where you&#39;re incorrect.  Let&#39;s look at you, right now.  You maintain your altitude by standing on the ground.  The ground is providing the force necessary to keep you up.  But, obviously, you&#39;re not weightless.  But, there&#39;s another way to maintain your altitude.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take you a little bit higher (so it&#39;s easier to visualize) and release you from a few hundred thousand kilometers away.  Obviously, there&#39;s still gravity out here, so you&#39;d plummet toward the earth.  </p>

<p>However, rather than just dropping you, launch you side ways, really fast!</p>

<p>Well, you&#39;d still plummet toward the earth (gavity&#39;s gravity after all).  But, the gravity would be trying to over come your initial speed.  As you feel toward the earth, you&#39;d continue to move sideways.  If I threw you fast enough, gravity wouldn&#39;t be able to pull you in, and you&#39;d miss the earth entirely.</p>

<p>If I threw you just hard enough, though, you&#39;d miss the earth, but gravity would have also deflected your path quite a bit (a whole 90 degrees!).  Gravity canceled out that initial push I started you with, but all that falling you&#39;ve done has given you a new speed, in a new direction.  But gravity is now pulling sideways to that new speed (because you moved around to the side of the planet).  So the whole thing repeats again... and again... and again!  You&#39;re actually using the planet&#39;s own gravity to stay up there!  We call this effect an orbit!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is pretty fast, but it doesn&#39;t instantly accelerate to that speed. While it&#39;s accelerating the astronauts definitely feel the force of the rocket pulling against the force of gravity, pushing them into the back of their chairs as gravity pulls them down but the rocket pushes them up.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t that much of a jolt if you accelerate slowly enough though, which is why it doesn&#39;t kill them. And once they are in orbit and at a constant speed, there&#39;s no more inertia.</p>

<p>The whole earth is traveling through space at 67,000 miles per hour, but we don&#39;t feel that since we are all moving at the same speed and so our velocity relative to the earth is 0.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>TL;DR: The ISS is under the effect of gravity, about 90% of surface gravity.  However, as they fall, they keep missing the earth.</p>

<p>Astronauts are under the effect of gravity, and it&#39;s about 90% the strength we feel here at the surface (gravity gets weaker the farther away you are from an object).  That means if you suddenly teleported to the altitude of the ISS, you&#39;d start falling at about 9 meters per second per second.  In fact, this is about how fast the ISS is falling toward the Earth as we speak.  So, why hasn&#39;t it crashed, and why do the astronauts seem to float?</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever been in free fall (like on a roller coaster, or one of those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced-gravity_aircraft">reduced gravity planes</a>) you&#39;ll know you can get the feeling of being without gravity quite easily.  Let&#39;s take a look at those planes.  The basically fly up really high, then allow themselves to free fall back to earth for a little while, before flying back up to do it again.</p>

<p>If we look more closely at their flight path, however, we&#39;ll see something odd.  The part were you stop feeling gravity actually starts while the plane is still going upward!</p>

<p>Think about it this way: we know you&#39;re in free fall if you only have the force of gravity acting on you.  No engines from a ship, no ground holding you up, etc.  If the plane is heading upward, then shuts off their engines, they still have their upward momentum that has to be canceled out first, before they start falling downward.  But, the moment they cut off their engines, they are in free fall; the plane is only under the effect of gravity.</p>

<p>So how does this apply to the astronauts?  Well, the ISS doesn&#39;t have any engines holding up there, so they are free falling too.  Why haven&#39;t they crashed yet?  The ISS is also moving sideways very fast as well.  As it falls, it is moving sideways.  It&#39;s moving sideways so fast (7 kilometers per second), the earth actually curves away before it would hit the ground.</p>

<p>So, the astronauts are under the effect of gravity, but everything around them is too.  It looks like they aren&#39;t because all the stuff around them is plummeting toward the earth as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Still reading but I had to stop and mention that the sun&#39;s gravity attracts comets billions of miles away. So at least the astronauts should be being pulled towards it. You can&#39;t escape gravity. According to relativity the sun is suspended  in the fabric of space  and the planets are within this space time field and within its gravitational pull. </p>

<p>That means so are the astronots. Everyone on earth should be attracted to the sun by its own fallacy. The earth would be absorbed by the sun&#39;s gravity especially since it attracts larger planets farther out, like Jupiter.  </p>

<p>But comets should tell you that the gravity field spans billions of miles  out, as soon as the space ship left the gravity of earth it would be pulled to the sun. If any of this made sense.</p>

<p>When you orbit the earth, you&#39;re also orbiting the sun.  You, right now, sitting in your chair on the computer, are currently orbiting the sun.  If the earth vanished out from under you, and you were floating in space, you&#39;d still be orbiting the sun.  What&#39;re more, if the sun then disappeared, you&#39;d still have your orbit around the galactic core!</p>

<p>As we speak, you are being pulled directly toward the center of the sun!  You&#39;re in free fall toward the sun!  However, just like the ISS here on earth, we&#39;re also moving sideways very quickly.  As we fall toward the sun, we&#39;re also moving sideways at the same time.  By the time we would have reached the sun (about 3 months), we&#39;ve moved sideways to far that we&#39;re actually basically the same distance away as when we started!

<p>They are being pulled towards the sun - the astronauts, their spacecraft, the earth and the moon are all in  orbit around the sun. That&#39;s because all of them are being attracted to the sun.</p>

<p>The difference is, they are <em>much</em> closer to the earth so it is the dominant force they feel.</p>

<p>So how is it that gravity just stops when they travel to space?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t. Satellites, the ISS and the Moon stay in orbit around the earth <em>because</em> gravity doesn&#39;t stop when you travel into space.</p>

<p>Your ignorance is pretty astounding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Good luck explaining this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s called orbit. Put simply objects in orbit are moving perpendicular to the direction of gravity at a speed that essentially means the by the time they have &quot;fallen&quot; far enough to have hit the planet, they have moved sideways enough to actually miss it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The same way the moon rotates around the earth because , in lieu of a better term: IT is &quot;falling&quot; and earth&#39;s gravity is pulling her, thus, creating an orbit.</p>

<p>The same thing happends with the space shuttle. They don&#39;t float around in &quot;no gravity&quot; they just fall. continuously.</p>

<p>The question is how does it stop working on astronauts, but be affecting everything else in space?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is pretty fast, but it doesn&#39;t instantly accelerate to that speed. While it&#39;s accelerating the astronauts definitely feel the force of the rocket pulling against the force of gravity, pushing them into the back of their chairs as gravity pulls them down but the rocket pushes them up.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t that much of a jolt if you accelerate slowly enough though, which is why it doesn&#39;t kill them. And once they are in orbit and at a constant speed, there&#39;s no more inertia.</p>

<p>The whole earth is traveling through space at 67,000 miles per hour, but we don&#39;t feel that since we are all moving at the same speed and so our velocity relative to the earth is 0.</p>
