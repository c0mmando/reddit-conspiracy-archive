        Washington (CNN)
       </a>
       In his much-anticipated congressional testimony on Thursday, fired FBI Director James Comey will dispute President Donald Trump's blanket claim that he was told he was not under investigation multiple times, according to sources familiar with Comey's thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/06/politics/comey-testimony-refute-trump-russian-investigation/index.html">
        CORRECTION AND UPDATE:
       </a>
       This article was published before Comey released his prepared opening statement. The article and headline have been corrected to reflect that Comey does not directly dispute that Trump was told multiple times he was not under investigation in his prepared testimony released after this story was published.

       the retraction of a story published on CNN.com, CNN has accepted the resignations of the employees involved in the story's publication," a spokesman said Monday evening. The story, which reported that Congress was investigating a "Russian investment fund with ties to Trump officials," cited a single anonymous source.

        This article was amended
       </a>
       on 29 December 2016 to remove a sentence in which it was asserted that Assange “has long had a close relationship with the Putin regime”. A sentence was also amended which paraphrased the interview, suggesting Assange said “there was no need for Wikileaks to undertake a whistleblowing role in Russia because of the open and competitive debate he claimed exists there”. It has been amended to more directly describe the question Assange was responding to when he spoke of Russia’s “many vibrant publications”."

        James Comey: a controversial New York Times story in February about alleged contacts between Trump intimates and Russian officials was bogus. “In the main, it was not true,” he said. “The challenge, and I’m not picking on reporters, about writing stories about classified information is the people talking about it often don’t really know what’s going on and those of us who actually know what’s going on are not talking about it,” said Comey during questioning from Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho). “And we don’t call the press and say, ‘Hey, you got that thing wrong.’ ”

       You can usually find the "corrections" section for news outlets, but sometimes it's pretty difficult. For NPR, they've made it so difficult that it appears deliberate (see 23).
      </p>
      <p>
       Corrections are usually minor, but sometimes they really fuck up big time, as some of my examples show.

       I added some stuff about NPR. That's all I have time for at the moment. If someone wants to do a "alternative media corrections" post, go right ahead. I think everyone already knows that alternative media can get things wrong sometimes. I don't think a lot of people know the scale of the errors in the mainstream media though, which is why I made this post.

       It's very detrimental to everyone who reads it also. Most people don't ever go back to any of this. They read the first article and never know about the retractions and corrections  afterwards.

       I mean even if there wasn't a Fox News section would that invalidate anything that has been put forth or are reports only factual when they happen to cover the particular news outlet you don't like alongside them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Disclaimer - Not a Fox fan by any means, just don't see how in any objective manner this is relevant. They even went after The Hill also, I'm not sure why this matters at all if the goal is to object and discuss what has been put forth in OP. This certainly isn't an excuse to downvote the otherwise valid work that OP has presented.

       The difference is they attack MSM and leave out the literal biggest MSM station and offender. They attack CNN on statements from sources inside the whitehouse that got a story 95% right but attack Fox on bringing on a non expert, seems biased.
