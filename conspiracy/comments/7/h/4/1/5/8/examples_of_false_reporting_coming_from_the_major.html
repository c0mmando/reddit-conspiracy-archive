        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>1) From CNN</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170606234238/http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/06/politics/comey-testimony-refute-trump-russian-investigation/index.html">Washington (CNN)</a> In his much-anticipated congressional testimony on Thursday, fired FBI Director James Comey will dispute President Donald Trump&#39;s blanket claim that he was told he was not under investigation multiple times, according to sources familiar with Comey&#39;s thinking.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/06/politics/comey-testimony-refute-trump-russian-investigation/index.html">CORRECTION AND UPDATE:</a> This article was published before Comey released his prepared opening statement. The article and headline have been corrected to reflect that Comey does not directly dispute that Trump was told multiple times he was not under investigation in his prepared testimony released after this story was published.</p>

<p>2) From CNN</p>

<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/26/media/cnn-announcement-retracted-article/index.html">&quot;In the aftermath of </a>  the retraction of a story published on CNN.com, CNN has accepted the resignations of the employees involved in the story&#39;s publication,&quot; a spokesman said Monday evening. The story, which reported that Congress was investigating a &quot;Russian investment fund with ties to Trump officials,&quot; cited a single anonymous source. </p>

<p>3) From Wash Post</p>

<p>Original title that they have changed, which you can verify by checking the url: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-hackers-penetrated-us-electricity-grid-through-a-utility-in-vermont/2016/12/30/8fc90cc4-ceec-11e6-b8a2-8c2a61b0436f_story.html?utm_term=.9ea5a949fb20">&quot;Russian hackers penetrated U.S. electricity grid through a utility in Vermont, officials say.”</a></p>

<p>Correction article: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-government-hackers-do-not-appear-to-have-targeted-vermont-utility-say-people-close-to-investigation/2017/01/02/70c25956-d12c-11e6-945a-76f69a399dd5_story.html?utm_term=.073d320a356b">Russian government hackers do not appear to have targeted Vermont utility, say people close to investigation</a></p>

<p>4) Slate, which didn&#39;t even retract the story yet: <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html">Was a Trump Server Communicating With Russia?</a></p>

<p>Debunked by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/01/that-secret-trump-russia-email-server-link-is-likely-neither-secret-nor-a-trump-russia-link/?utm_term=.0d6dc14257ad">Wash Post</a></p>

<p>5) Fortune Magazine: <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/01/12/cspan-rt-interruption/">Correction: This story originally ran under the headline “C-SPAN Confirms It Was Briefly Hacked by Russian News Site.” C-SPAN confirmed that an interruption took place but has not yet identified the cause of the interruption.</a></p>

<p>6) The Guardian: &quot;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/24/julian-assange-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-interview">This article was amended</a> on 29 December 2016 to remove a sentence in which it was asserted that Assange “has long had a close relationship with the Putin regime”. A sentence was also amended which paraphrased the interview, suggesting Assange said “there was no need for Wikileaks to undertake a whistleblowing role in Russia because of the open and competitive debate he claimed exists there”. It has been amended to more directly describe the question Assange was responding to when he spoke of Russia’s “many vibrant publications”.&quot;</p>

<p>7) New York Times:  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/06/08/in-the-main-it-was-not-true-comey-denounces-new-york-times-story/">James Comey: a controversial New York Times story in February about alleged contacts between Trump intimates and Russian officials was bogus. “In the main, it was not true,” he said. “The challenge, and I’m not picking on reporters, about writing stories about classified information is the people talking about it often don’t really know what’s going on and those of us who actually know what’s going on are not talking about it,” said Comey during questioning from Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho). “And we don’t call the press and say, ‘Hey, you got that thing wrong.’ ”</a> </p>

<p>8) New York Times:  Notorious &quot;17 intelligence agencies agree&quot; claim <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/pageoneplus/corrections-june-29-2017.html?_r=0">retracted</a> by the New York Times. (It was actually 3 agencies according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NevA1FFfj7s">Former director of National Intelligence Clapper</a>)</p>

<p>9) NBC News:</p>

<p>“EXCLUSIVE: Putin does not deny having compromising information on President Trump in interview with @megynkelly.” <a href="https://twitter.com/keridouglas/status/871514544480415744/photo/1">https://twitter.com/keridouglas/status/871514544480415744/photo/1</a></p>

<p>&quot;CORRECTION: Putin denies having compromising information about President Trump, calls it nonsense <a href="https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/871519148085583873">https://twitter.com/NBCNews/status/871519148085583873</a> </p>

<p>10) from ABC News:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>JUST IN: @BrianRoss on @ABC News Special Report: Michael Flynn promised &quot;full cooperation to the Mueller team&quot; and is prepared to testify that as a candidate, Donald Trump &quot;directed him to make contact with the Russians.&quot; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171201162158/https:/twitter.com/ABC/status/936628560374071296">https://web.archive.org/web/20171201162158/https:/twitter.com/ABC/status/936628560374071296</a></p>

<p>CLARIFICATION of ABC News Special Report: Flynn prepared to testify that <em>President-elect</em> Donald Trump (not candidate Trump as initially reported) directed him to make contact with the Russians <em>during the transition</em> -- initially as a way to work together to fight ISIS in Syria, confidant now says. <a href="https://twitter.com/ABC/status/936760299146956800">https://twitter.com/ABC/status/936760299146956800</a></p>

<p>The reason this &quot;news&quot; was so big was because it was basically evidence of collusion. After they corrected it, it&#39;s no longer evidence of collusion. It&#39;s just normal presidential business. </p>

<p>11) RT: <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-today-tomorrow-the-world-2083869.html">Several journalists who work for Russia Today have told The Independent that while some coverage of problems in Russia and sensitive issues is allowed, any direct criticism or questioning of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin or President Dmitry Medvedev is strictly prohibited.</a></p>

<p>12) NBC posted an article claiming Menendez, charged with bribery and fraud, was a Republican. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/menendez-says-not-once-have-i-dishonored-senate-office-bribery-n799136">CORRECTION (Sept. 6, 2017, 5:35 p.m.): An earlier version of this article misstated the party affiliation of Menendez. He is a Democrat, not a Republican.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>13) A New York Times <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/09/07/new-york-times-standards-editor-menendez-democrat-omission-was-a-dumb-mistake/?utm_term=.c45e2968db94">story</a> on the bribery trial of Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.) initially failed to mention his party (Democratic). </p>

<p>14) Fox News ran footage of Mark Sanford admitting to an extramarital affair on Wednesday with a Chyron identifying the South Carolina Republican — near tears — as a D, for Democrat. </p>

<p>15) When former congressman Mark Foley admitted to having problems with alcoholism — after reports that he had behaved inappropriately with congressional pages — Fox News also identified him as a Democrat.  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/24/fox-news-identifies-sanfo_n_220377.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/24/fox-news-identifies-sanfo_n_220377.html</a></p>

<p>Here are Fox&#39;s four fake experts: </p>

<p>19) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/26/world/europe/sweden-fraud-fox-news-commentator-trump.html">A man described as a Swedish defense and national security adviser appeared on Fox News last week to defend President Trump’s claim that criminal immigrants are wreaking havoc in Sweden. But according to court records and Swedish officials, the man, identified as Nils Bildt, has a criminal record in the United States and no ties to Sweden’s security establishment.</a></p>

<p>22) The Hill writes article and Tweets claim that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171003215924/http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/353685-trump-admin-denied-puerto-rico-request-to-let-hurricane-victims-use">&quot;Report: Trump admin denied Puerto Rico request to let victims use food stamps for fast food.&quot;</a></p>

<p>This is the article after it has been corrected: <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/353685-trump-admin-denied-puerto-rico-request-to-let-hurricane-victims-use">Trump officials allow Puerto Ricans to use food stamps for hot food</a></p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>23) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100314031252/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100311/ap_en_tv/us_toyota_recall_abc">2-second video causes headache for ABC News</a>. ABC News faked part of a video of a Toyota with acceleration problems. They show a reporter in the moving vehicle, then cut to a shot of the tachometer revving to 6,000 RPMs while in park. They later apologized for faking the video. You can still view the original video here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRN1CnKrc84">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRN1CnKrc84</a> The fake shot is at 2:15. </p>

<p>24) ABC: <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2012/07/ross-takes-heat-for-another-blunder-078793">Brian Ross of ABC News reported that James Holmes, the suspect of the theater shooting in Aurora, Colo., may have connections to the tea party — basing that on a single web page that listed an Aurora-based “Jim Holmes” as a member of the Colorado Tea Party Patriots. The claim was later retracted and Ross appologized.</a></p>

<p>25) NPR: <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/ombudsman/2017/09/18/551350349/airing-the-dirty-laundry-too-few-of-npr-s-corrections-are-heard-on-the-radio">Airing The Dirty Laundry: Too Few Of NPR&#39;s Corrections Are Heard On The Radio</a></p>

<p>26) NPR claims Wikileaks posted Macron leaks and also claims some of the documents were fake so they could tarnish Wikileaks&#39; reputation, had to issue a correction stating that they don&#39;t know who leaked them. See the tweet and comments here: <a href="https://twitter.com/NPR/status/860936844942430210">https://twitter.com/NPR/status/860936844942430210</a></p>

<p>27) &quot;Correction: In this report, it&#39;s said that North Korea has continued to develop and test nuclear weapons despite warnings from the Trump administration. While North Korea is believed to still be developing nuclear weapons, it has not tested any since President Trump took office.&quot; <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/06/19/533494139/how-to-deal-with-north-korea-some-options-are-worse-than-others">http://www.npr.org/2017/06/19/533494139/how-to-deal-with-north-korea-some-options-are-worse-than-others</a></p>

<p>You can usually find the &quot;corrections&quot; section for news outlets, but sometimes it&#39;s pretty difficult. For NPR, they&#39;ve made it so difficult that it appears deliberate (see 23). </p>

<p>Corrections are usually minor, but sometimes they really fuck up big time, as some of my examples show. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, look at the blanket downvotes in this comments section. Looks like you struck a nerve with your well-sourced, objective and nonpartisan presentation of facts. Anyone want to chime in on what&#39;s bothering them about this post or just gonna try to hide what you don&#39;t like with agendavotes?</p>

<p>14) Fox News ran footage of Mark Sanford admitting to an extramarital affair on Wednesday with a Chyron identifying the South Carolina Republican — near tears — as a D, for Democrat.</p>

<p>15) When former congressman Mark Foley admitted to having problems with alcoholism — after reports that he had behaved inappropriately with congressional pages — Fox News also identified him as a Democrat. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/24/fox-news-identifies-sanfo_n_220377.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/24/fox-news-identifies-sanfo_n_220377.html</a>
Here are Fox&#39;s four fake experts:
16) Fox News Apologizes for Featuring Veteran Who Lied About Being a Navy SEAL.</p>

<p>17) A Fake Antifa Member Trolled A Fox News Host</p>

<p>18) Fox News commentator who feds say faked a CIA career sentenced to 33 months in prison</p>

<p>19) A man described as a Swedish defense and national security adviser appeared on Fox News last week to defend President Trump’s claim that criminal immigrants are wreaking havoc in Sweden. But according to court records and Swedish officials, the man, identified as Nils Bildt, has a criminal record in the United States and no ties to Sweden’s security establishment.</p>

<p>I mean even if there wasn&#39;t a Fox News section would that invalidate anything that has been put forth or are reports only factual when they happen to cover the particular news outlet you don&#39;t like alongside them?</p>

<p>Disclaimer - Not a Fox fan by any means, just don&#39;t see how in any objective manner this is relevant. They even went after The Hill also, I&#39;m not sure why this matters at all if the goal is to object and discuss what has been put forth in OP. This certainly isn&#39;t an excuse to downvote the otherwise valid work that OP has presented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, they have ran some pretty big stories that turned out entirely wrong like the Pizzagate one, which was retweeted by friends of the President. </p>

<p>The difference is they attack MSM and leave out the literal biggest MSM station and offender. They attack CNN on statements from sources inside the whitehouse that got a story 95% right but attack Fox on bringing on a non expert, seems biased.</p>
