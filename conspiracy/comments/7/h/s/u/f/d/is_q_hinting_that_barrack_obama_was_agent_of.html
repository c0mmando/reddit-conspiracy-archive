        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Now, I&#39;m the first in line to say that Q is a big ol&#39; larp.  Probably the biggest and greatest LARP in history, but never-the-less, still a larp.</p>

<p>Having said that, it&#39;s pretty interesting how he always links the name Hussein with SA.  He never outright says Obama, but we all know what his middle name is and how he&#39;s been traveling around the world recently.</p>

<p>The connection between Obama and Khalid Al-Mansour has been know for over a decade now.  Here&#39;s a good video about this.  <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheSaudiAgentBehindBarackObama-KhalidAlMansour">https://archive.org/details/TheSaudiAgentBehindBarackObama-KhalidAlMansour</a></p>

<p>Now, what&#39;s interesting is that it is known that Al-Waleed bin Talal was the sponsor behind Mansour.  You know Alwaleed.  The billionaire guy who owns 4 Seasons above Mandalay Bay?  You know, the guy who was just arrested by Muhammad Bin Salman and allegedly tortured by American mercenaries for information.   Here&#39;s a quote from an article back in 9/2008 about Mansour.   <a href="https://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/khalid-al-mansour-Obama/2008/09/04/id/325191/">https://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/khalid-al-mansour-Obama/2008/09/04/id/325191/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>He met and befriended Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the world’s 19-thealthiest person, when the prince was studying at Menlo College in California in the late 1970s. Al-Mansour’s law partner was representing the prince in a court case in California.</p>

<p>After getting a degree in business administration from Menlo in 1979, Prince Alwaleed went back to Saudi Arabia determined to become extremely successful, al-Mansur recalled.</p>

<p>The two began to work together, and the prince asked him to help him invest in Africa. “He said, let’s make our focus turning Africa around. He has never told me until today where this idea came from, but it became an obsession.”</p>

<p>Al-Mansour says he and the prince flew from country to country as he introduced the prince to heads of state. “It was easy for me, because I knew all the presidents.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, we know that Mansour paid for Obama&#39;s education.   We also know, through Wikileaks, that Obama&#39;s cabinet was mostly composed of people from Citigroup, which conveniently, is part-owned by Alwaleed.   Interestingly, the connection is now denied when it was already known back in 2008.  <a href="https://sentinelksmo.org/saudi-billionaire-busted-for-corruption-helped-obama-get-into-harvard/">https://sentinelksmo.org/saudi-billionaire-busted-for-corruption-helped-obama-get-into-harvard/</a></p>

<p>I think at this point, it&#39;d be pretty silly to deny that a definite connection exists here.  Perhaps the reason Obama has been scrambling all over the world is to destroy evidence of his connections to SA?   Regardless, I&#39;m sure no concrete evidence of SA manipulation of Obama exists.  But nevertheless, it is interesting to contemplate.</p>

<p>I was lost in the message you were trying to drive in your post.  I was responding to a question with a question. :) I think the focus with Q is on a Dark Cabal network right? If so I doubt a network of people comprised of world leaders would give a fuck about Obama being connected to SA.  I think Obama is trying to undermine or strategize with world leaders to hijack Trumps agenda. </p>

<p>Hmm... I can&#39;t seem to find the links... ugh. A web map is like... a spider&#39;s web, the &quot;nodes&quot; are people, events, companies etc - and then you string links between them to form a web.</p>

<p>The Q posts basically form a large web, implicating much of the US government in a large scale conspiracy to lie to the people (at the very least).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i thought this was related to saddam, but i kind of gave up on Q a while ago. so i missed a load of supposed info, and i lost toddwhiskey&#39;s thread. so now i see little things, and im so lost in the info its just a case of me waiting until someone screams &quot;haha, i told you, it was all legit&quot; or, the larp just dies out, nothing comes of it, and everyone remembers the great larp of 2017, whilst anticipates an even better one for 2018. either way, knowledge that has been searched due to this larp has been quite a nice recent history lesson for some, and im sure we can all say regardless of authenticity of Q, we all learnt something</p>

The same prince that sent Podesta a list of Obama&#39;s cabinet as seen in Wikileaks. Obama was funded by HUMA (Harvard University Muslim Alumni). Because of the SA purge the strings keeping Obama afloat have been severed. Q has said Obama is running around the world looking for a new &quot;handler&quot;.
