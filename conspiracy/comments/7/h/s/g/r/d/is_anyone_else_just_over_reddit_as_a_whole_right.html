        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m really having trouble dealing with this site anymore. Here&#39;s the main issues that I have:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There is no freedom of speech or rules on this site. If you support Trump, you better delete every post you make or you will be frequently harassed and brigaded. The mods do not care and they actively promote this behavior. The mods even told me outright at one point that I had a small group of people following all of my posts and downvoting them en masse. I had one user who harassed me for months on end. I reported his posts, said nothing in return and even messaged mods about it. He is still active in that sub, while I&#39;m the one banned. When I went to the official reddit mods for help, they told me just to block him and refused to comment when I asked how this would stop him from continuing the behavior. </p></li>
<li><p>This site(and social media as a whole) is a cancer for any discussion. You agree with me, upvote. You don&#39;t, downvote. Most votes gets to the top, least votes gets hidden. I love to discuss and argue, but it&#39;s a complete fucking waste of time and just negatively affects my real world life.</p></li>
<li><p>Anyone can make as many accounts as they want for free. I don&#39;t even know how many I have. I could control most of the front page of reddit alone if I so chose to.  As long as people can continue to make accounts for free, no one will ever have consequences for their various actions. You ban me, I go on another one of my 40 or so accounts. No big deal. 1 week bans actually help me because then I end up karma farming, giving me more power.</p></li>
<li><p>Mods have way too much power and a lot of them probably aren&#39;t even legit people. There is no oversight on mod actions. You challenge a mod and win, you get silenced for 72 hours. You disagree with a mod and they can ban you on the spot. Multiple people have gotten banned from subs just for merely posting in another sub. And take a look, some of the most powerful mods on this site are also mods on other subs. That&#39;s not by accident.</p></li>
<li><p>You get a low enough score on a sub and you will be waiting 9 minutes to post. Reddit knows this. Reddit has known this for years. Reddit has no desire to fix this, because minority opinions are usually opinions they disagree with.</p></li>
<li><p>The Reddit RES system is absolutely awful for free speech. You can literally tag all of your enemies and downvote them forever until they get fed up enough and stop bothering to post.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The only reason that I even bother with this place is because 4chan posts way too much NSFW content, even though it&#39;s a much better system. This site is bad news and will have blood on their hands sooner or later when they push someone too far and they do something stupid.</p>

The partisan media (both MSM and alt) have made it so people can&#39;t accept multi faceted views everything must be black and white. In the UK it&#39;s been the same with Brexit. If you support Brexit you are instantly a xenophobic racist. If you voted remain then you a are statist left winger. No inbetween. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Reddit as a whole has been slowly going downhill for the last 5 years. I barely spend any time here these days. I just check out the few conspiracy related subreddits, and r/modestmouse because I have an unhealthy obsession with that band. </p>

<p>You used to be able to have very interesting conversations on this subreddit, debating different ideologies and sharing different ideas and theories. These days is all astro turfed bullshit. </p>

<p>I used to love this website. It used to be the best way to have intelligent discussions with like minded people. I used to spend all my time on this site, discovering different kinds of music, sharing different ideas, creating something and sharing it with others and receiving constructive criticisms. It felt like a community back in the day, now it feels much more rigid. We more rules, more censorship, and much less freedom. </p>

<p>I miss the old reddit.  </p>

<p>The thing that&#39;s interesting is sometimes an user will get heated and I&#39;ll say something like, &quot;Hey, please be collegial!&quot; They apologize and move on.</p>

<p>But shills. You know how they respond? &quot;FUCK YOU cunt polkadotgirl!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s so easy! Then I know!  A real user will recognize the issue. A shill will not ; ) And even if not a shill, wouldn&#39;t want somebody like that here anyway!</p>

<p>We have to abide by Reddit site wide rules. That&#39;s what I was getting at.</p>

<p>Reddit is not a bastion of free speech and either is this sub.</p>

<p>Instead I&#39;m transparent so people know what gets removed and why.</p>

<p>With that being said we want to remove as little as possible.</p>

<p>i would agree if we are talking about mainstream social media. there are some niche small communities that still have good discussion. there are even some small subs on reddit that do, as long as they dont get too much attention from the admins or their SJW minion army.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So this is an interesting point.  Yes, Cambridge Analytica, but why?</p>

<p>I first heard about Cambridge Analytica very early in the election cycle.  The thing you have to understand about Cambridge Analytica is that they aren&#39;t doing anything new.  They took Edward Bernays&#39; propaganda techniques from almost a century ago and applied them to social media.</p>

<p>The problem here is that Edward Bernays figured out how to engineer the consent of a democratic society.  Our country has been strictly administered via his propaganda techniques for the last 90 years.  They work.  They work so well that nobody has bothered to develop the theory further and try to work out a defense against them.  For 90 years, there has been only a single voice in this country.</p>

<p>Cambridge Analytica added a new voice.  And Trump won, because the people who run this country never expected to be challenged.  They had a machine to reliably run the nation.  Someone broke the machine, and with it all our hearts and our precious world views, which is why we are going insane.  Anyone would, when different voices pull on your deepest heartstrings, your fears and desires, your deepest sense of self.</p>

<p>American propaganda has always been the best in the world.  We just call it something different because &quot;propaganda&quot; sounds like fascism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is the elite. Other than his twitter outbursts he’s quite possibly the most easily manipulated president we’ve ever had. Just put it on Fox and Friends and he’ll lap it up with no critical thought. He’s enacted nothing but boiler plate republican policies since he got in office, other than TPP, I commend him on that. Sure the RNC would’ve preferred a different candidate at the start, but once they realized he was a slippery distraction they’ve used his cover to legislate just as they would with Jeb in charge, and Trump lacks the intellectual curiosity to figure out what’s going on unless Steve Deucey tells him in the morning.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. It&#39;s like people won&#39;t even entertain the idea that most people don&#39;t like Trump. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s as many shills as people think there are because it&#39;s usually brought up in discussions about anti trump threads and discussions. Trump is really damaging the global view of America and is just surprisingly incompetent and unable to do the things he promised his base. He really is just that unlikable and probably the most controversial figure in the world right now. People in other countries are laughing at us and so are their leaders because Trump is who represents the US. It&#39;s insane that this is overlooked and that the general consensus of reddits userbase is overwhelmingly anti Trump. </p>

<p>Yeah, astroturfing happens. It&#39;s one of the biggest sites on the Internet. This is nothing new. But to deny that it&#39;s not happening on the right too, about Trump specifically, is ridiculous. TD has posts that are so obviously being vote manipulated with 10s of thousands of upvotes and less than 1k comments, it&#39;s just so blatant. And I&#39;ve seen comments on here critical of Trump just getting nothing but shill accusation replies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no problems with you complaining about the things you mentioned and we probably share similar views on some of them (more than others).</p>

<p>I have been around since the BBS days and alt.whatever times. And this is nothing new.</p>

<p>I still like reddit better than most places. A lot of content on just about everything.</p>

<p>And you can make your own subreddits if you like.</p>

<p>My problems intersect yours though in that the admins don&#39;t adhere to their own rules and mods can be rather dickish at times (of course, if you start you own sub you would be a mod and might fall into that generality, but no need to).</p>

<p>This all goes to one main thing (well, two): Accountability for actions.</p>

<p>Which goes to the second thing: &quot;Justice&quot;</p>

<p>People want a fair and just system. If you go into a sub in good faith and then are banned simply because some mod doesn&#39;t like you...well, that isn&#39;t very just. it is even worse when they claim you broke a rule which they ignore with others.</p>

<p>Best bet here? Make your own sub and work to promote it (if you are so inclined. One of my alts I still use has several subs dedicated to archiving content and news from around the web, don&#39;t care if anyone else uses it).</p>

<p>I will be happy to join said sub and contribute content if you like and even help with the CSS (though I hear css is going away here, but we shall see).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not if their social media is an echo chamber. For example, if you have a liberal echo chamber, suddenly you dont really have to critically think that much.

    <div class="md"><p>I just have to point out that it wasn’t like this before Trump. Sure, there was intolerance on both the far right and left, but his election has taken it to a completely unprecedented level and it runs much closer to the center. Yes, the media plays things up to make money. But they did during the Bush era too. Trump has a uniquely vitriolic manner. He makes it clear that he has no intention of working equally for all people in the country, that he supports fringe racist groups, that he feeds on Fox News and publicly ignores his advisors. You really have to question the motives of anyone who supports a man like this. It’s not the media. It’s not some vast left wing conspiracy. It’s Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been on Reddit for about 9 or 10 years now, but it&#39;s only in the past year or two that I realized the stupid envelope notification on mobile/changing color on desktop literally gave me anxiety. So weird.</p>

<p>It was fine before that. I loved replies. I love conversation and debate. But, well basically since the primaries, it&#39;s become more about arguing and fighting than actual conversation or debate.</p>

<p>I hated knowing that a lot of replies I&#39;d get would be insults, someone assuming who I voted for or planned on voting for based on literally nothing, or someone trying very hard to drag me into some online slapfight.</p>

<p>I <em>already</em> have anxiety issues so I turned the damn notification off. It&#39;s nice. And I can&#39;t remember the last time I actually used the desktop site for anything other than registering a funny username/using ceddit.</p>

<p>I still check replies, for the most part, but it&#39;s on my own time and I do it by clicking on my comments and seeing them that way to see the entire conversation.</p>

<p>I&#39;m mostly here for the aliens, history, archaeological conspiracies, etc nowadays though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel ya. First <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> and <a href="/r/technology">/r/technology</a> was great.  Then we defeated a few bills like cispa, cisa this cybersecurity that.  Then censorship like never before!  I was so bad that we educated people that they removed politics and technology as default subs!</p>

<p>Fine I like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> better.  That didn&#39;t work out as well as hoped as evidenced by your post. I was told to goto <a href="/r/conspiracyundone">/r/conspiracyundone</a> and r/cst but r/cst mods attack first and second time posters.  No thanks.  Now I fear <a href="/r/conspiracyundone">/r/conspiracyundone</a> for the same reasons.</p>

<p>I&#39;m with OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s kind of important to remember that ALL websites are relative flashes in the pan. Twitter is losing users and dropping off massively in (non-bot) activity. Facebook is stale. Wikipedia has slowed to a fraction of its former growth rate, and even becoming regressive. Does anybody even remember MySpace? There&#39;s no reason Reddit would defy this general trend, and perhaps even more reason for it to follow it than websites allowing a more creative range of communication of ideas.</p>

Come here for some interesting theories and discussion but it feels like almost every thread devolves into the liberals and conservatives talking shit using schoolyard tactics.

<p>This site is bad news and will have blood on their hands sooner or later when they push someone too far and they do something stupid.</p>

<p>Regardless of how crappy or unjust Reddit is, individuals are responsible for their actions. Someone “doing something stupid” is wholly and solely responsible for his stupidity. There is no delegating one’s conscience to a third-party, ever.</p>
