       What's the big deal with Trump acknowledging Jerusalem as the capitol of Israel? I'm looking for some historic context please. Figured it might be useful information for other Redditors as well. Thanks :)
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Jerusalem is considered a sacred city to multiple religious groups. Designating it as a "Jewish capitol" would push the Zionist agenda and burn bridges with Muslim &amp; Christian factions. Thank you for clarifying this, fellow Redditors!

       Basically Jerusalem is a historical sacred place to both Jews and Muslims. There are both muslims and Jews living there. So if Trump were to acknowledge Jerusalem as the jewish capital, it would be a giant dick slap in the face to the Muslim world.

       Heyo.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the big deal is that Jerusalem is considered to be a holy city by various other groups in the region, including Muslims and Christians. Generally, Jerusalem has been treated as an 'open' city where any of the three major religious groups can interact in the open without the major presence of the Israeli Government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tel Aviv, as a newer city with little historical context, has served as the capital of Israel and its where all the major Israeli government buildings and institutions are.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been viewed as an insult to their right to own Israel and Jerusalem by hard-line Zionists for decades; and factions within Israel and without have pushed for the recognition as Jerusalem as the actual capital.
      </p>
      <p>
       By swapping American recognition to Jerusalem, Trump would signal that the US is interested in advancing that Zionist point of view farther and it would be viewed negatively by other factors in the area/around the world including moderate Israelis (who don't want their secular government to be used as a religious weapon).
      </p>
      <p>
       For all intents and purposes, the US doing something like this is emotional grandstanding that changes nothing about the ownership of Jerusalem and nothing about the functioning of the Israeli government.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is compounded by the fact that it would be a strictly pro-forma recognition; Trump is not going to move the actual US Embassy to Jerusalem.

       It says delayed by six months.  I disagree.  If anything, Trump has proven to bow down to his masters just as fast as he can.  It will still happen unless unrest is extreme.

       Honestly, I don't think so. The mechanics of actually creating an embassy is expensive and time consuming; particularly in a region of such historically challenging as that one. Trump
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       order it; but it would be against the recommendations of pretty much everyone in the State Department
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       the Israeli Government.

       Since when has money or expense ever been a deciding factor in a government project like this?  The Israelis have wanted this for decades.  Trump

       You have far too much faith in Trump.  He showed he doesn't give a shit about the american people when he chose his cabinet.  Trump is the first sitting president to wear a yarmulke at the wall.  Where have you been?

       Actually moving it is irrelevant if this is the ultimate goal. Saying they will is good enough.

       Where have I been? Probably over here in the "He talks big but actually fails horribly in the follow-through" camp. I get why he's doing this, and I understand the forces that are influencing him to rattle some cages; but I sincerely do not think he's going to be able to get the actual mechanics done in a timely fashion.

       You didn't question anything I said. You're just making ad hominem attacks against me.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 was adopted on 23 December 2016. It concerns the Israeli settlements in "Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem". The resolution passed in a 14–0 vote by members of the U.N. Security Council (UNSC).
       </p>
       <p>
        The resolution states that Israel's settlement activity constitutes a "flagrant violation" of international law and has "no legal validity". It demands that Israel stop such activity and fulfill its obligations as an occupying power under the Fourth Geneva Convention.[2][3]
