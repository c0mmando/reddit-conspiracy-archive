<p>I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the grand conspiracy is that everyone&#39;s either in Hell already, or just getting processed into soul batteries, and there&#39;s nothing we can do about it.

    <div class="md"><p>We will play with the idea of artificial intelligence but won&#39;t completely merge our consciousness with it. The robotic nature is more akin to the replacement of biology with technology. That in itself would make a human not human, of course, as the feelings and emotions are done energetically, within the mind and aura of the person, and this is an Electromagnetic biology.  To create an actual human type aura into  a machine will be very difficult, or any similar, even a dog will have to be programmed by a human, never quite making it a dog as it is naturally.  But, this is not to say that within the realm of possibility this type of lifeform doesn&#39;t exist; a machine based consciousness. If we can imagine it, it exists, and we can create that existence and if we wanted to, we could reincarnate there and experience that life. So it&#39;s ultimately unnecessary for humans to become something that already exists.</p>

<p>But we play with idea, it&#39;s natural when we create , we toy with our possibilities.</p>

<p>As for us becoming anti-social robots in society... This is interesting because right now we are in a time when we are very separated, and isolated , but this tech is not the reason. This tech is an Example of what we are going through collectively.  We are focused on our self more now than we have for a long time, one of the reasons why is the availability of info about other People. We are flooded with the behavioral range of many different people and how they act and we observe ourselves more, and our choices because of this.  Our isolation is coming to grips with our identities in a collective. We are used to talking about collective events, ideas, weather, etc, but when it comes to having a conversation about our existence, and it&#39;s creation, and how we create our own reality, there is a disconnect. We don&#39;t have this program, so to say, to think outside of the status quo and get to the roots of our creation. Therefor the things we normally found sociable seem perhaps wrong, and as each of us starts to rediscover this i,t&#39;s like living in a world where you don&#39;t know if someone is experiencing the same as you, so there is even more separation as we come to grips with ourselves and our connection and whether or not it is accepted.  </p>

<p>All these devices are examples of a widening of awareness and immersion into self through the collective. Which is quite New, if you think of the internet as the collective, and the time before the internet as being very limited in how you could access the collective, then this robotic perspective I think makes more sense.</p>

<p>Ok, so, want to know how this seperation gets lessened?  Through catastrophe, or challenge, or struggle, etc. These types of events that cause everyone to work together is what brings us out of seperation.  And , as I have said before in posts about earth changes, as we change, so does the earth, and when we decide it&#39;s time to connect, it will be a type of catastrophe that sets it in motion. We are getting closer to this than we are to immersing an actual consciousness into a computer.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just the looming threat of AI. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the fact that the TPTB have conditioned us to BE robots. So when AI finally makes the scene it will not be some alien machination it will be an extension and hyper-stasis of nature: &quot;GOD at last will be real!.&quot; </p>

<p>But that won&#39;t happen. Humans will win. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that becoming robots or synthetic humans will be the key to us travelling the galaxy. The idea of warp engines or ships that people live on like a colony whilst travelling across space are too far fetched. Biological creatures aren’t designed for space. We will have to design ourselves for it. And it will be these robots designed off of homo sapien blueprints that can live for a time that isn’t measured in years but century’s or millennium. They will look back at us as their ancestors as we do to earlier hominids and apes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post really struck me in some areas. One thought that comes to mind is how myself and my boyfriend were without a smartphone and internet for several months due to lack of employment after I had my son and I am honestly thankful for this because it gave both of us more time to bond with out new baby and learn more about eachother but at the same time the more we were around eachother without thw usual distraction of the internet the more were became easily irritable with eachother and we had so many more petty arguments. I connected it with the lack of internet saying to a friend how when we had the internet it was good for our relationship because it gave us the opportunity to spend time together without being down eachother throats and now that i think about it, it is quite sad that we need the distraction of technology in our lives (I am only talking about my personal experienc) to keep a stable communication flow without being petty with eachother because we have too much time to think or we are interacting to much. I also really took heart to when you said about paying too much attention to the baby pictures and not enough attention to the baby itself. I often question my parenting because during special events with my kids or even in general i somehow forget to take pictures like any &quot;normal&quot; parent would do. I just get too caught up in what we are doing to even think about pulling out my phone and taking pictures and if soemone happens to mention taking pictures I stop after just a few ans then I feel bad kater because I don&#39;t have a ton of pictures for social media after the fact. Now that you have pointed this out i feel so much better and I am almost proud of myself for wanting to actaully enjoy the time I spend with my kids instead of spending it holding a phone to show everyone that I spend time with my kids. I was just thinking about how I only have post picture of my almost 6 month old on social media 2 or 3 times since he has been bored and how I am not a normal or good parent because I will have less picture of him the the average mom i see on Facebook but your post reminded me that this is not the case at all. Anyways if you ever want to talk I feel like you would be someone I can have good discussion with so PM me anytime. Sorry about the spelling and grammar I am on a phone. Thanks for the post 😊.</p>
