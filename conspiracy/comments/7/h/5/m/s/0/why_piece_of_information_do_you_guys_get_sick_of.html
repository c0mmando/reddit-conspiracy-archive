<p>A: Muh NOT REAL SOURCE, ITS NOT CNN/NBC!</p>

<p>B: You&#39;re fucking retarded, without bothering to even argue the information</p>

<p>C: The Corporate Media would never lie to us &amp; is isn&#39;t capable of hiding such a large thing</p>

<p>It fucking pathetic how frustrated they get when they hear this that they have to resort to such despicable behavior, i honestly wonder why that&#39;s always the case, we are always labelled such harsh words &amp; instantly dismissed, for simply trying to show people the truth, why is that, why does the truth make them so angry &amp; hostile?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Throw all the conspiracy theories out the window for a moment. This information doesn&#39;t require you to believe in any of the really nefarious shit the US has committed throughout the last century.</p>

<p>Look at the current foreign policy of the United States. With certainty, you can say that it&#39;s been a policy of dominance through economics, culture and military expansionism since the last world war. The Achilles heel of this policy revolves around controlling natural resources in the most unstable region on the planet (oil).</p>

<p>Even though the oil crisis in the 70&#39;s was put to rest the US has invested more time and money into the middle east than anywhere in the world. While you were receiving lower prices for gas the government was spending billions of your tax dollars on peacekeeping and permanent bases.</p>

<p>Twenty years later the US has a military presence in how many countries in the region? While places like Libya, Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria are turning into absolute quagmires.</p>

<p>What is this policy going to lead to 20 years from now? Will there be permanent bases in all 3rd world countries we wish to have economic business with? There&#39;s already a significant US military presence in Africa. Will there be permanent bases built there as well?</p>

<p>Who is going to pay for being the &quot;World Police&quot;? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>/internal screaming for a moment here/ </p>

<p>I&#39;m a fundraiser for an orginization and Jesus fuck are the majority of people I reach out to so beyond uneducated on just everyday politics. I don&#39;t know how many times a day I have to explain how majorities work, or the corruption on both sides due to money driving politicians. Political party doesn&#39;t matter. What these politicians say doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s actually doing your own research and looking into the candidates past policies, voting history and their personal character that actually gets shit done. You can&#39;t just sit there and do nothing but vote for a party and then complain about what they&#39;re doing wrong. YOU&#39;RE part of the problem because the job of the people is to elect the representatives that will vote in their best interest. That is literally our government and constitution. The people hold the power. Until. Fucking. Everyone. Gets. Their. Fucking. Shit. Together. That. Will. Not. Happen. I don&#39;t know how many times a day I try and remain unbiased to actually educated these voters so that they&#39;re able to form their own opinions, do their own research, spread information and get out and make a difference. I&#39;m a moderate republican calling on behalf of new, grassroot candidates and orginizations because right now they&#39;re the only fucking hope to fix this country if we can get a majority. States across the country are actually voting in brand new republican and democratic candidates that are moderate leaning and not fucking stupid or extreme BECAUSE a few people and orginizations are actually fucking putting in effort to educate their asses. Ling rant is a rant. Sorry. </p>

<p>Tldr; I get sick of explaining the actual point of a social contract, how the parties actually operate and how to fix the problem to people who just want to complain about the problems they&#39;ve caused without wanting to make an actual difference bc that requires effort. </p>

<p>You can see airplains releasing contrails. They disappear shortly after the tail end of the plane. You can compare that to the lines in the sky that DON&#39;T disappear.  Those are chemtrails. Just fucking Google geoenginering ffs.</p>

<p>Thankfully the people in my area seem to be noticing it more, but worry that by the time people catch on, it will be too late. We&#39;re gonna have massive influx of dementia in the next 15 years from all the metal in the air, and then the govt will legalize assisted suicide for the people they gave dementia to. This is how they kill us off, and the timeline will be too long to be able to reliably point any fingers or serve any real justice; the people who are doing this will be long gone, the long con allows them to cover tracks and say they had nothing to do with it. Fucking hell i get so pisssed off about this.</p>
