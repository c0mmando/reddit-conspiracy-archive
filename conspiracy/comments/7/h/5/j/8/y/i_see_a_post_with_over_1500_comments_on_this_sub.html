<p>Health insurance costs were rising faster before are ACA, but you don&#39;t care about that.</p>

<p>The ACA forced insurance companies to accept people with preexisting conditions, but you don&#39;t care about that. </p>

<p>Health insurance rates and deductibles aren&#39;t forced on anyone by the ACA, its dependent on insurance companies and how many people States can enroll in the programs, and red states purposefully failed to enroll enough healthy people. But you don&#39;t care about that. </p>

<p>You only care about yourself, and would be more than happy to let a single mother bankrupt herself or lose their child because the kid had a preexisting comdition and can&#39;t find insurance because if it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me explain something you may have missed.  This illegal had in his possession a loaded  Sig Sauer P239 40 caliber pistol in a state with strict gun laws especially for felons (which he was). This pistol requires a 10 pound pull to fire (that&#39;s a lot), it has 4 seperate safety implements and has no history of accidental discharge (this is documented on every gun accident).  There has been 0 safety recalls on this weapon. </p>

<p>Why would a convicted felon who has been deported only to return again illegally but was protected by a sanctuary city, be in possession of a gun illegally? Not to mention it was loaded and was in his hand.  I&#39;m sorry but if he was deported like he should have been, a beautiful young girl would be joining her family for the holidays.  To answer your question, yes because he is here illegally.</p>

<p>He probably worked or lived in a rough area and wanted to defend himself as he didn&#39;t have a record of violence in the past, just drug use.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a reason for him to have killed her, it was an accident and he&#39;s still getting deported as he should. </p>

<p>As for the reason he had this gun, the US has a gun problem and it is getting worse as more guns are allowed to be sold in the US. It is insanely easy to get a gun anywhere, hence why an illegal was able to get one in cali.</p>

I shared stats about that gun and it&#39;s perfectly safe.  The gun didn&#39;t cross the border.  The gun isn&#39;t a felon.  The gun didn&#39;t protect this criminal with a sanctuary city.

<p>Yeah, if we had strict gun laws he couldn&#39;t have passed a background check to get a gun or bought it from a private seller legally.</p>

<p>And he got away with it too! He got away with it because guns aren&#39;t safe and can accidently go off due to the fact you don&#39;t need to know how to use one to buy one.</p>

<p>Now just imagine every other grieving family in the US that lost a loved one to a gun. Do you think it really matters who was holding it? Clearly not, trained or not, drugged or not, legal or not, they go off and kill all the time. Get rid of them or train people how to use them.</p>

He was I&#39;m America illegally, he wasn&#39;t deported by officials, he had a gun because he is a man of criminal history, he had the Gun in his hand and pulled a 10 pound resistant trigger in a loaded gun purchased illegally.

We have more crime than them but also way more guns, wtf? We live in very peaceful times regardless and shouldn&#39;t worry about someone coming to murder our family as it rarely happens and like you said, they will just find a different way. Also yeah fire all the racist cops and start over. Our cops are fat fucks with no standards who are taught to just pull their gun when in trouble.</p>

Nothing is peaceful.  2,000 kids are reported missing daily.  You don&#39;t hear about it but over 1500 people have been arrested for pedo network/trafficking just this year.  MSM doesn&#39;t tell you.  Ever been to a border town? I grew up there, having a gun saved my life 3 times.  You can&#39;t open your borders to convicted felons and people with radical religious views and expect peace.  Especially with shitty cops.  Yet we have this happening and you want to take guns away? Better change some items before people will buy into your views.  </p>

<p>Nah, you heard it wrong or something, it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>Cars actually do something though and you need a license to drive one. Cars have brakes, cars have airbags and cars are designed to save lives. Guns don&#39;t do anything but shoot, they don&#39;t help our economy much. And even with many more people owning a car than a gun the death rate is the same.</p>

<p>They likely read the CBO analysis which had some dire forecasts. I know this will likely be accused as &quot;arguing from authority&quot; or shilling but the CBO has always been an ethical organization for it&#39;s history. It&#39;s run by a Republican now. The Bill is a disaster economically and designed on a fundamental level to shoe horn in Republican &quot;values&quot; into a tax bill. (I mean does fetal personhood, public land drilling, and healthcare belong in a tax bill?) Every provision that I&#39;ve read that belongs to the bill is clearly aimed at enriching the pockets of the wealthy while making leaving the taxes of the middle and lower class unchanged and ballooning our nations debt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>CBO run by an establishment Republican means what? Credibility? Hardly</p>

<p>The CBO counts it this way.  The new bill gives people the option to not buy health insurance.  That doesn&#39;t take money from the poor. It means they have the option to avoid buying insurance, so they won&#39;t take advantage of TAX SUBSIDIES.  But the CBO counts this as a tax increase since the Treasury would increase through a drop in payouts.  See how sneaky that is? No.  Okay I will explain - The people dropping out of insurance are supposedly on Medicaid - which means they won&#39;t drop out at all, since Medicaid is basically free.  So your well ethical organization that works for the elite - is manipulating to support the Establishment agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your criticism of the CBO seems shaky at best. There would still be a large number of people who are left uninsured as medicaid is cut to pay for the tax cuts.  and besides, What do the the elite gain by standing to trash a tax bill that is largely slated to benefit the wealthy? I mean if the CBO works for them then why would they trash a bill that give the wealthy so many breaks? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not shaky it&#39;s honest.  Medicaid is paid by both state and federal. Nice try.  More taxes means more cronyism and way more is made through cronyism than tax breaks. Ever wonder how government makes really bad business decisions? Why pay Verizon for healthcare solution or Seimens for railroad car development?  Cronyism but live in that bubble of CBO knows whats best for America.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You stated jack all. You called the CBO an organization with an interest when it&#39;s attacked both shitty Republican and Democrat plans all the time. Medicaid is literally the only example that you gave and it&#39;s paid for but state and federal funds. The states won&#39;t be able to make up all the windfall of the lesser funding but just keep buying into what podcast you hear. I&#39;m sure all that debt the government will take for these tax breaks is just fine. My generation will just pay it off later. </p>

<p>Not to mention your nonsense answer about Cronyism. You didn&#39;t even reply to the fact that this Bill is 100% slated to help the ELITE. not the average man. But overwhelmingly the wealthy and powerful of the country. Read like a complete distraction. </p>

<p>Also I didn&#39;t even go into the plan to tax grad students on waivers, the cut on taxes literally only for the top 20% of earners in America. Not to mention the allowing public land to be exploited. You are clearly someone with an agenda to push. So go ahead in push it. I won&#39;t reply to you anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You missed my major points purposely. You schmucks use the same tactics.  It&#39;s really ridiculous.  Also it&#39;s tax cuts for small business who file business on their personal tax returns.  A baker with 500k isn&#39;t a top earner when their salary is 150k.  Read the bill and come back with better points </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on number of bills introduced and handed to the senate that would average around 30k pages of essays per senator.  100 senators = 3 million pages written a year that would then need to be graded by someone.  Talk about a bottle neck.  What they should do is provide a framework that explains and illustrates in layman&#39;s the bill.  From there it would be drafted using legal language and would be reviewed by A.I. to confirm it matches the layman version.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me explain something you may have missed.  This illegal had in his possession a loaded  Sig Sauer P239 40 caliber pistol in a state with strict gun laws especially for felons (which he was). This pistol requires a 10 pound pull to fire (that&#39;s a lot), it has 4 seperate safety implements and has no history of accidental discharge (this is documented on every gun accident).  There has been 0 safety recalls on this weapon. </p>

<p>Why would a convicted felon who has been deported only to return again illegally but was protected by a sanctuary city, be in possession of a gun illegally? Not to mention it was loaded and was in his hand.  I&#39;m sorry but if he was deported like he should have been, a beautiful young girl would be joining her family for the holidays.  To answer your question, yes because he is here illegally.</p>
