       Everyone likes to make "Illuminati confirmed" jokes about anything triangle shaped and if you mention the many occult symbols in corporation logos, geographic layouts, entertainment, etc. people will just say you're reading too much into things (which could be true).
      </p>
      <p>
       If we're not just seeing things, why is the occult so obsessed with displaying symbols? Is it communication? Mocking people? some sort of ritual display that gives power? Enlighten me please

       Our minds operate on symbols. They're a huge part of our collective psychological heritage, and they speak to us even if we don't (consciously) know what they mean

       Think about about how meaning conveys feelings vs the same amount of words to convert the same meaning. Imagine the place spacewise and energy wise that I would take to convey the cuteness of a baby cat vs a pic of a cute baby cat.

       Hard to do a tldr on occult control systems. But Passio is a very knowledgeable and sober person for the job.

       Symbols can contain multiple data sets, stories and doctrines within themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       in example: The Cross can mean The axis of the world, Matter itself, the spirit of life fixed onto earth or in matter,  The Sun, Jesus Christ and maybe more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that it can mean one thing to a certain set of people and another thing to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       One can also make up a symbol and give it meaning. This is a fundamental secret of magic: Your word becomes reality. Think of money, which is absolutely magical. We give money it's power because of our agreement on it's meaning. ...and look at all those symbols on the dollar bill....
      </p>
      <p>
       A sign, on the other hand, can only mean one thing: Stop, go , no parking, merge, ect,ect

       it isnt magic, its psychological manipulation pure and simple and the term magick is just a cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       believe me, ive delved deeply into all available works prescribing to speak of these mystical secrets and its just doublespeak for living hedonistically and manipulating people to do what you want and get away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can tattoo pyramids all over yourself and it wont change reality without the consent and concerted efforts of powerful people also willing this for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       the nature of our reality in some way is ephemeral and fleeting, but its a collective of wills and not a unified consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
       if there was a way to manipulate reality I wouldve discovered it by now and attempted to become the antichrist.

       The core of the holographic reality is a structure. What generates the reality around us is an array of hexagon, triangles, circles, geometric patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cut open a piece of fruit, it has a geometry at its core. Same with man, for example the ancient Egyptians dissected a brain and found the pineal to look like an eye. This became symbolic of a third eye, or our perception of more than we see with our eyes. A wider awareness, so to speak, the pineal is linked to awareness, but then again so is every cell in the body, the pineal though does has a function to connect , or be like an antenna to receive subjective Information and inner sense data, like Intuition or imagination, empathy, as it is directly linked to the energy systems of the mind in that way. So it's a symbolic to represent that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The occult symbols the masons use, the ones controlling this world, these symbols are ancient and have a meaning and language that at one time was a perfect representation of the nature of reality. They were pure and conceptually accurate of this template reality. Their meaning was known.  So what has happened is the group's that want to obscure that purity , and  that mean , and take control of its power as being pure. Pure is Power. Similar words right?
      </p>
      <p>
       The distortion of these symbols has be purposely engineered. Take a base template structure like a triangle or pyramid, put an eye in it, and put it on money, and money is Power, or Pure.  See what I'm getting at?
      </p>
      <p>
       In some cases , or most cases the symbol has been Inverted as a mockery. As representative of negating, or destroying creation. And make no mistake there are now powerful groups of people who want destruction, their intent is deception to remain in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporations have taken these template reality symbols. And have done the same. All most all of it has been corrupted by the system so it is important to in a sense take back these symbols or yourself and discard the meaning these secret societies have given them.

       It’s part of the hierarchical nature of Luciferianism and associated demon order. Also, in the past, tidbits of science knowledge were handed out for ascending/descending the order. Like, the orbital path of Venus resembling a pentagram.

       It’s not just “occult” elements leveraging trinkets of natural science knowledge over history. The priests with their astronomical knowledge, for instance. Eclipses and solstice dates in superstitious societies was political power. The daily ocean tide schedule was likely too obvious but the annual monsoon season in those parts of the world would have been high order “magic” or “wisdom” in the ancient world only centuries ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mentioned the lotus style orbital track of Venus. This is the type of “enlightenment” handed handed down as members graduated within the guild. For those cults employing trance &amp; hallucinogenics, a demonic portal providing advice from the “Unknown” was compelling.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Secret Societies old and contemporary, I think the symbols and rituals are rooted in ancient traditions but mostly are simply hijacked for show and the seduction of junior membership. Probly 50% or more of Illuminati or KKK or Mason or Thule or Wiccan ritual is synonymous. Anyone agree ?  There has to be some “guts” to precede individuals signing away their souls or individualism. Whether it’s spooky “charm” or “seduction” many people require the apparatus for membership. The rest just want the raw benefits of power / sex / money and probly see the candles &amp; robes &amp; chants as unnecessary fluff.

       The illuminati started off as one huge larp. Then many took it seriously and they ran with it, making them a secretive cult figures that portrays power in the shadows. My opinion.

       Symbols are living beings that perpetuate their existence by manipulating our minds into working them into reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are the aliens communicating with each other outside of this reality where time and history have no effect on the symbology passed down.  We prescribe meaning to them but disregard their presence since the beginning as a possible Pandora's box of alien language that we play with.
