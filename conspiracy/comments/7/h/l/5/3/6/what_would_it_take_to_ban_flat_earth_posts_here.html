Weekly you can read in some MSM article about this crazy group of people thats apparently growing everyday (yet is almost universally hated in the community), why is that. Why do FE get so much media time, and little to nothing is reserved for anything else.. </p>

<p>Edit: I should add Im as pro freedom of speech as they get. I just feel this is different. If something is purely here for the reason to tarnish our reputation, im fine with it gone. Please correct me, and tell me Why Im wrong if you dont see it the same way</p>

<p>Edit2: clearly people dont see it the same way, thats entirely fine. i got other subs without FE, and i dont mind downvoting content i dont like. </p>

<p>Hitler sacked Schact (the Rothschild pawn) at the Reichsbank and took it over in 1938, replacing him with the anti-usury Funck who was a disciple of the anti-usury Feder.</p>

<p>Hitler&#39;s taking over of the Rothschild controlled Reichsbank was the real reason for Britain and France&#39;s declaration of war in 1939. Poland was just a political opportunist lame excuse.</p>

<p>Hitler made use of western investment to rebuild Germany and then told them to fuck off.﻿</p>

    <div class="md"><p>interesting detail,but not the entire picture. whats neglected is churchill was bankrupt, and needed money, so the blenheim palace estate was in need of money, britains involvement was partially this, aswell as pushing hitler to declare war on britain, due to their nearly  7 year refusal of accepting peace from hitler. britain was stopping supplies arriving to germany and destroying pharma factories, causing big issues in germany (economic war, seek whichever source suits your reading best, 1939-1945). this was a follow on of a previous blockade of supplies during, and after ww1 (1914-19129 ) this is a small scope on a larger geo-political  scale, but a very neglected fact in history. im impressed though. i think you are the first person to highlight the issues you mentioned regarding ww2. haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely agree. Before that, Poland invaded Czechoslovakia, and meanwhile, Russia was invading Poland from the east (even to this day, Russia has not returned much of the territory it stole from Poland), and yet, somehow Germany was the bad guy and deserved to have war declared on them.</p>

<p>All this despite the persecution of ethnic Germans in the Danzig Corridor and elsewhere. All modern historians will acknowledge today was Bloody Sunday, but that was just a small example of what was going on in Poland at the time.</p>

<p>I disagree here. It&#39;s Important we take note of our image. The reason we&#39;re in the minority is because of the wacky image TPTB have crafted for us. </p>

<p>You&#39;re essentially saying not to fight back against them wacky image. That&#39;s bs, we should most definitely be trying to forge a new and more mainstream image for our culture, and shutting the fuck up about flat earth is a good way to do that.</p>

<p>Because its so easily debunked. </p>

<p>Ill have that discussion and frequently there are discussions about FE. </p>

<p>You think posts about theories that 2+2=5 should hit the front page every time? </p>

<p>Its been settled for hundreds of years that we live on a globe. How long do we have to entertain the conspiracy that 2+2=5?</p>

<p>Im not a huge fan of this &quot;oppressed&quot; FE angle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Debunked where? why are more and more people coming to believe flat earth now more than ever, and dont say its disinfo or psy-op. People have dedicated there time to research it and share there findings here. Like many other conspiracies this isnt something thats suppose to be known so of course it might seem far fetched.

<p>Debunked where?</p>

<p>Everywhere, there are almost no FE theories that work. The best FEers can do is explain one event or phenomena but never the whole thing. Their proofs actually counter each other when the model is in place. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point of conspiracy is to unmask what is really going on in the world.</p>

<p>And the FE isnt it. Thats why people reject it so readily. </p>

<p>High altitude balloons have recorded curvature. There are images from the 40s during our V2 rocket program that show curvature. </p>

<p>Fish eye is just wide angle. They are used everywhere so you can see more, thats all. </p>

<p>For example</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The earth is flat, that&#39;s an easily verifiable fact, all you have to do is open your eyes. It&#39;s the grand conspiracy to unite all conspiracies and shows how deep the rabbit hole goes. The whole point of this sub and alternative perspectives is to do your own research and come to your own conclusions so I don&#39;t want to ruin it for you. But here&#39;s a fun fact, the Chinese thought the earth was flat until the 1700s when round earth theory was popularized due to a Jesuit priest gaining favor with the emperor as his astrologist. And while I&#39;m at it, August Piccard the first man to enter the stratosphere is documented as observing the earth shape as a flat disk with upturned edges. It&#39;s amazing how the world changes when you look into things for yourself. </p>
