    <div class="md"><p>it was a single photo, of the cover (i speculate), it was very dark, in colour, black, on maybe dark brown? which i would assume was black ink pressed on a material, that has changed colour due to discolouring, maybe it was original white or pale, but went dark brown. it was written in wha tthe OP descibed as old german (not current language, but a older form of german), and latin. &quot;some crazy drunk guy gave me this book&quot; was the start of the title to the post. myself, and a couple others here, requested photos of the contents, becaause it was really intriguing. the OP cam eback, tried posting again some photos, but there were server issues on upload (which happened to me a few nights ago, nothing suspicious on that front). but he did seem a little freaked out in his last comment. mentioning he thinks it may be some shady freemason book and he would try again later.  whilst the mod did what was correct, i think the pre emptive larp warning may of maybe scared the op. because it was a new account, 1 month old, and tbh, fitted the spec you would expect of a larper. but the book was old. in the original picture, that seemed evident. especially from the darkness of the material. if it was a new book, there is no way the pages would have turned that dark, so quickly, in modern materials. a feloow user, made a comparison of the books image, to an artist which could be seen on severel websites, but, to me personally, i didnt believe it was the same (im also no art expert, so what i think, really isnt credible lol). , but it seemed in teh same kind of field, but different enough for me to think their was a difference in artist. i really hope the other people who commented, saw it, come through this post and drop some info.  i think it was after 10pm gmt last night, because i had a sleep in the evening, and i think i woke up around that time or shortly earlier. well, i probably blinded you with aload of irrelevent info, so il stop now lol. regardless, it was interesting. really want to see/know more</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oddly enough, there&#39;s a whole section with pictures of the pyramids and other ancient Egyptian monuments and lines of hieroglyphs. Super weird to be in a bible if you ask me.</p>

<p>Was thinking about getting it appraised, but it is pretty beat up, so I always figured it wouldn&#39;t be worth anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it written in German? If so, do you read German?</p>

<p>Actually, I don&#39;t think all the pictures of pyramids are weird. I believe the Bible has hidden meanings and pertains to astrology/astronomy. The pyramids are also related to astrology/astronomy too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not speak German. Had to use Google to translate any identifying information on it.</p>

<p>And while I agree that it&#39;s not that weird for a bible to discuss the Pyramids and ancient Egypt, if you saw these pictures you&#39;d understand why it looks so out of place. I think I have pictures of some of the pages still, I&#39;ll try to find some so you can see what I mean.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He never added &quot;the rest&quot; because there was no rest. He just posted a cropped picture of a faded Albrecht Durer woodcut, claiming it was the cover of a 500 year old book. Given to him by an old drunk guy? Come on!</p>

<p>He then claimed he couldn&#39;t post any of the other pages because of a problem with imgur, which was obviously bullshit.</p>
