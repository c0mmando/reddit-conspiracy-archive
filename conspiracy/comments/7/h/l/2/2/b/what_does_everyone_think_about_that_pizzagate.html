       Just wondering, now that the heat of this scandal has passed, because all of the ignorant masses seem to be saying that this was "Debunked long time ago" And any comments not completely negative about it get downvoted instantly, and since they know jack shit, i decided to ask you guys for an honest opinion, is their any truth to this Theory, and if so what is the concrete evidence that indicts those involved?
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: Is this real or fake, what evidence leads to either of these conclusions?

       it died down because it had no weight. All the evidence was easily debunked so people gave up trying to push it.

       r/Pizzagate was banned and memory-holed. That should tell everyone a lot. Pizzagate hit too close to the DC Beast and Clinton-connected cabal. The term fake news was created out of the Podesta leaks, even though Wikileaks has a 100% record for accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       CPP's website had an encrypted section which allegedly stored child pornography (photos and movies).

      </p>
      <p>
       Speculation is that CPP was used as a child retail venue.

       The hope was that Pizzagate evidence would be investigated by law enforcement, but it never was.

       Ask yourself why not. This isn't the first time US politicians (and their cronies) have been investigated for child rape, molestation, and trafficking.

       Just put all the pieces together and read between the lines a bit....no single source is useful really is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, the variety of sources debunking it for a start....there's loads of them - from Snopes to Fox News of all things.  The original website also claims Queen Elizabeth is an alien....There's no need to go on really is there?

       Images taken from Instagram etc and passed off as the victims' as well as other images completely falsified - the Obama one is actually in the White House and the small matter of no evidence having been found and no rape victims coming forward at all.

       Of course these things happen, but it still doesn't change the lack of evidence with Pizzagate, and the glaring holes in the theory as well as the manipulation and falsifying of images and all the rest of it.

       Was there ever an explanation of the image of a toddler with her hands taped to a table with stacks of bills on it? I doubted it as much as you until seeing the instagram photos which have since been scrubbed.

       If you're normal adult, and you see a bunch of kids playing and one of them has her hands taped to the table you don't think "wow, she's in such a good position to be raped right now". The people who are having these thoughts when seeing children are really disturbed in the brain.

       The idea that there are pedophile rings operating around the globe catering to rich and powerful people? Fact
      </p>
      <p>
       The assertion that there are high ranking US government officials at the federal level involved in it? Pretty likely there’s at least 1. There have been several congressmen convicted of it in the past so it’s easily possible there are some who are today.
      </p>
      <p>
       The assertion that Hillary, Podesta, etc. specifically are pedos? Possible. I’m somewhere between it’s real and it’s debunked on this one. I want more evidence. Some of those leaked emails for example are innocuous to me, but some of them are really weird/suspicious, like that hot dog one she sent to BO.

       I was just like you until I took into the consideration there close ties to known and convicted pedos. Hastert, epstein, wiener, Clinton, bean, and the list goes on. I would say that is enough for probable cause to investigate a ring of powerful sexual abusers.

       Unfortunately I’m not sure if there’s enough PC to actually get a warrant signed to investigate Clinton or Podesta on sex trafficking/pedophilia stuff or not. I’d say there’s reasonable suspicion based on some of the stuff that’s come out about the Haiti relief and a few of those leaked emails, but based on the publicly available stuff I’ve seen I’m not sure there’s PC yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real opportunity was when the private email server scandal went down.  I’m not sure she’s guilty of pedogate but I for damn sure believe she’s guilty of mishandling of classified material and breaking several related laws at best and I wouldn’t consider treason to be too out there. It’s a real miscarriage of justice that the FBI completely sabotaged that investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only hope left IMHO is that something can be found with the Uranium 1 scandal. Maybe they can find something related to pedogate with the U1 investigation. I used to have hope that there was something on the Wheiner laptop but nothing’s come of that. So many conspiracy channels are adamant about there being a recovered sex tape on it with Clinton but that story has been floating around for about a year now and nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldn’t surprise me in the least if the rumors are true, but all I’ve seen so far is pretty weak. It’s a lot of speculation and hearsay so far. At least from where I’m sitting.

       I just clicked on the link to the video in the article and it's been removed from his website. The guy is such a dishonest piece of shit. He probably realized how much profit was at stake so he decided to keep pushing it.

       I think that there are pedophiles in very high places. Not just in the USA, but every country. Now, I'm not saying all of the people in high places are pedophiles, but some are.

       I think there is some truth to it. In reading those emails it is all too weird to refer to foods they way they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the comments about the children being in the pool for entertainment, or the girls being rescued by Bill Clinton/Podesta from NK are not at all a normal statements to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has obviously been covered up over the years - the Open Secret documentary never being officially aired is proof of that. This is the primary reason no 'hard' evidence exists.

       I've been going through a a pretty brutal awakening/reality check ever since Las Vegas happened and it was so clearly bullshit. It leads you to questioning everything, and there's one thing I know from a personal experience that got to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to think my parents just hated the Clintons because it was the thing for Boomers to do until one day my mom told me a story:
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a younger Chinese woman at the front desk of a building she was at. Apparently, the girl explained to her that Hillary Clinton had brought some men in along with women that were obviously meant to entertain them sexually. This woman was apparently extremely distressed when telling this to my mother, and there was a language barrier there. She said specifically, "We would not do that in my country, I don't understand."
      </p>
      <p>
       My mom thinks that Clinton hired escorts and the woman was upset that a politician would do that. But, based on the description of this woman's level of distress and what she said, it creates this feeling of upset and mild nausea in my stomach when I think about it. And I know her and I will never know.

       It seems a bit outlandish, but something I thought about was the fact that this woman in particular couldn't speak English very well, but was working the front desk of a hotel. I guess if you wanted to be seen but not be seen somewhere like that, an immigrant who has trouble articulating themselves and would also not have as much credibility due to prejudices about language aptitude (weird MSM and both parties constantly talk about race but some of the most severe, open and acceptes mistreatment I've ever seen towards people have been towards ESL people) working at a front desk would work.

       The story actually does not seem outlandish at all. It has a ring of truth to it so to speak. I am already convinced that HRC has close ties with sexual deviants. That much is easy to see for anyone. Add to the fact that business in corporate America is conducted outside the office, in a party atmosphere. I personally have witnessed executives doing the same exact thing to ensure a deal. In the circles that HRC runs around in hiring prostitutes is a norm, for others it would be going to a stop bar, someone else it is getting drunk and gambling. There is an old saying: tell me who your friends are and I will tell you who you are.  This is not a far fetched story at all.

       so the first lady PERSONALLY took people to see prostitutes? Sure Hillary may be as corrupt as fuck. Hell, maybe she is guilty of even the craziest stuff.

       But. The first lady.... PERSONALLY taking people to see whores... not having a flunky do it, she did it herself. Srsly how the fuck can you even remotely believe she could be that fucking stupid.

       It was a Hilton in DC. Who knows? Maybe it was sokeone who bore an uncanny resemblance to Hillary Clinton, or maybe Hillary likes prostitutes too lol. I'd imagine they'd be a bit difficult to see in the White House and unfortunately Bill got to the interns first. Lolol.

       I have a short tolerance for people trying to bullshit and manipulate me. The creator of the video above points out how the "white handkerchief is symbolic for young girl/boy" is completely fabricated and the snapshot of wikipedia detailing the meaning of these colors is photoshopped. That among other lies means I'm dismissing all the other claims made in the pizzagate theory because it's lost 100% credibility in my eyes. If you let people get away with lying to you once they'll keep doing it again and again.
      </p>

       I also know gay dudes who sexualize EVERYTHING so it didn't seem unusual to me that a gay guy who owned a pizza shop was very sexually provocative with his decor.

       I have followed it from the very beginning. It has only grown exponentially as a movement. The one factor we can all agree upon is we would love to see this debunked. The thought that children are abused like this on a massive scale is enough to bring  the toughest to their knees and cry to their creator. Anyways I would love nothing more than to see this debunked but unfortunately all there is evidence of is a massive cover up and intense disinformation to label this fake, labels without facts are worthless. The movement continues to press on stronger than ever.

       Yep. And Rolling Stone recently covered it in relation to how fake news starts. They ignored and left out so many key points that it made it seem obvious that they are now trying to get ahead of the story.

       The disinformation from msm solidifies to me that it is likely true.
