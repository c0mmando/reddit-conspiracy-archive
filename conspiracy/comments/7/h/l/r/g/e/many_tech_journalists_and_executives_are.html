       Blake Chastain / @brchastain:   My daughter is 5. I don't want her to have this, and I don't want her friends to badger her into getting it. This is expanding the Network Effect of Facebook (&amp; all its concomitant pitfalls) into childhood. It's gross.

       Andr Staltz / @andrestaltz:   Look at every FB announcement from the perspective of a global multi-billion advertisement mega-corp. This is how you can acquire users (eyeballs) very early in their lives, teaching them to stay on your ad platform. Similar to breeding animals in a farm.

       Josh Constine / @joshconstine:   Research shows most kids 6-13 are already on social media or messaging apps like Snapchat &amp; Musically that don't protect against stranger danger. Might seem strange putting a Fb app in tiny hands, but at least it was built for privacy

       Drew Olanoff / @yoda:   i would like any product like this, especially something aimed at kids with scale, to have a full and diverse 3rd party advisory board. i don't see anything like that here.
