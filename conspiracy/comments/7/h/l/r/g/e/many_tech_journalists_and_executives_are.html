        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>These are from the list aggregated by Techmeme - <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/171204/h1855">https://www.techmeme.com/171204/h1855</a></p>

<p>Daniel Howells / @howells:   Facebook creating a messaging app specifically for 6+ year old kids feels really grotesque. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/">http://www.theverge.com/</a>...</p>

<p>Joshua Topolsky / @joshuatopolsky:   no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">http://www.nytimes.com/</a>...</p>

<p>Blake Chastain / @brchastain:   My daughter is 5. I don&#39;t want her to have this, and I don&#39;t want her friends to badger her into getting it. This is expanding the Network Effect of Facebook (&amp; all its concomitant pitfalls) into childhood. It&#39;s gross. <a href="https://twitter.com/">https://twitter.com/</a>...</p>

<p>Casey Newton / @caseynewton:   @joshelman @TechmemeChatter Just because people start smoking at a young age doesn&#39;t mean you need to be the company that starts making candy cigarettes</p>

<p>Sarah Lacy / @sarahcuda:   i see no parents in my feed excited about this... and everyone I know with high-anxiety teens is trying to get them <em>off</em> social... is anyone pumped about this other than FB shareholders? <a href="http://twitter.com/">http://twitter.com/</a>...</p>

<p>Drew Olanoff / @yoda:   i&#39;m going to need a few years of proof that facebook can protect its current users before i&#39;ll be cool with letting kids anywhere near the platform. <a href="http://twitter.com/">http://twitter.com/</a>...</p>

<p>Andr Staltz / @andrestaltz:   Look at every FB announcement from the perspective of a global multi-billion advertisement mega-corp. This is how you can acquire users (eyeballs) very early in their lives, teaching them to stay on your ad platform. Similar to breeding animals in a farm. <a href="http://twitter.com/">http://twitter.com/</a>...</p>

<p>Casey Newton / @caseynewton:   Facebook is building a pipeline of new users starting when they are 6 years old. How can the engineers and designers who built this product feel good about it? <a href="http://twitter.com/">http://twitter.com/</a>...</p>

<p>Josh Constine / @joshconstine:   Research shows most kids 6-13 are already on social media or messaging apps like Snapchat &amp; Musically that don&#39;t protect against stranger danger. Might seem strange putting a Fb app in tiny hands, but at least it was built for privacy <a href="http://techcrunch.com/">http://techcrunch.com/</a>...</p>

<p>Cecilia Kang / @ceciliakang:   This is how they talk about kids: “passive” users. Does the world need children to be aggressive users of Facebook? Ugh <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">http://www.nytimes.com/</a>...</p>

<p>Hunter Walk / @hunterwalk:   We&#39;re in the “don&#39;t give tech companies the benefit of the doubt” phase right now, which given some of their historical choices, is fair</p>

<p>Drew Olanoff / @yoda:   i would like any product like this, especially something aimed at kids with scale, to have a full and diverse 3rd party advisory board. i don&#39;t see anything like that here. <a href="http://twitter.com/">http://twitter.com/</a>...</p>

<p>William Turton / @williamturton:   If there&#39;s one thing we can all agree on, it&#39;s that Facebook has a solid track record of predicting how its products will be misused. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/">https://www.nytimes.com/</a>... pic.twitter.com/KdON1d0brH</p>

<p>Owen Wiliams / @ow:   couldn&#39;t get the teens so let&#39;s try a new tact <a href="http://twitter.com/">http://twitter.com/</a>...</p>

<p>That last one is apparently a reference to this fact -</p>

<p>USA Today, Nov. 25, 2017:  Teens still prefer Snapchat to Facebook – The generation gap between social networks remains wider than ever. </p>
