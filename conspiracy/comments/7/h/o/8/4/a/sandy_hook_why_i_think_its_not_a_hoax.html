       This is just my personal opinion. 
I'm not at all implying that the government never ever lies or no conspiracy theories are true, I'm aware that many do in fact turn out to be true, and basically all world governments lie to their people every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was quite skeptical when I first learned about the Sandy Hook Massacre. It did seem strange with the inconsistencies with the early news reports. 
What was this about some guy in camo arrested in the woods?
Whats up with some parents seen smiling in interviews?
Where is the evidence that any shooting had ever occurred at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       At the last question, for a good while, there was absolutely no evidence. From what I understand, Newtown, specifically Sandy Hook, is a very close knit community, and became even closer after the shooting took place. It would make sense that a majority of the town would push not to let pictures of their or their friends dead children be released to the internet, and they  would want the global attention to be over soon as they don't want their town just to be known as  a place where horrible things happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a short list of the best links I found displaying evidence for a shooting taking place. WARNING: No photos show actual dead bodies, but if you can't deal with blood, I would advise you not to click the photo links.
      </p>
      <p>
       "There were no gunshots heard on the 911 tapes"
       <a href="https://youtu.be/KiiABMjbbW8?t=253">
        https://youtu.be/KiiABMjbbW8?t=253
       </a>
       - You can hear the AR-15 echoing down the hallway and out of the school. "No pictures of blood or evidence people have died."
       <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/27/article-2530129-1A4FC37200000578-980_634x956.jpg">

       </a>
       - Blood puddle on the carpet, most likely from injured staff member who hid. 
"No evidence of Adam Lanza in the school"
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/MorbidReality/comments/716s3l/the_blood_splatter_from_adam_lanzas_suicide_after/">

       - shows bullet holes Lanza made on entry. There may be some debate on what kind of  bullet holes those are, so far we only know he took a shotgun, Sig Sauer, and shotgun with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, Gene Rosen, a man who let some children who had escaped the school take shelter in his house is not and had never worked for a company called "Crisis Actors".
      </p>
      <p>
       He is in fact a retired psychologist and quite elderly, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       One video shows parents in a muted interview with music playing over the top, in which they appear to be smiling. I later watched the interview with audio, and suddenly it made a lot more sense. Here's the transcript:
COOPER: What do you want people to know about Grace?
      </p>
      <p>
       LYNN MCDONNELL: Well, Grace had such a great spirit. She was a kind and gentle soul. And she was just the light and love of our family. She was just truly a special, special little girl that we loved, and she loved her brother so much. And she loved her school, Sandy Hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, this week, I was telling somebody she had a stomach ache one day, and I said to her, “Why don’t you stay home with Mom?”
      </p>
      <p>
       And she said, “No way, I have too much fun there, and I don’t want to miss anything.” She would skip to get on the bus. It wasn’t even — you know, every morning, it was the backpack was packed the night before and ready to get on the bus in the morning and head off to school. We would blow kisses every morning to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I remember that morning putting her on the bus. She had a habit of blowing kisses, but then she’d give me a big little liver lips like this. But then she — I knew she was so happy to go off and get there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it — I’d like to say that she was at a place that she loved, and so we take comfort in that, that we know she was in a place that she really loved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone who loses someone close to him or her only allow themselves to excibit pure sadness and anguish afterwards. I have met a woman who lost her son to a drunk driving accident once, at the time it was fairly recent. Before she told me, she did definately seem to act strangely, but she still smiled as she talked to me and laughed when me or someone else made a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nervous laughter is definitely a real and observed phenomenon too. Whether brought on by the overwhelming stress of being told you have lost someone close and suddenly having hundreds of lights, cameras, and microphones jammed in your face.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Wikipedia page for the phenomenon  states:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Nervous laughter is a physical reaction to stress, tension, confusion, or anxiety. Neuroscientist Vilayanur S. Ramachandran states 'We have nervous laughter because we want to make ourselves think what horrible thing we encountered isn't really as horrible as it appears, something we want to believe.'"
I have noted that I and some of my friends have seen people chuckle at funerals, which may seem strange to anyone who hasn't experienced this kind of emotional overload.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now what about the mysterious man in camo?
That man was a parent, his name was  Chris Manfredonia.  He was, according to his own words, on the way to help his daughter's class make gingerbread houses when he heard gunfire. While attempting to get into the school, police found and arrested him, being suspicious, justifiably so too.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I said at the start of this, I don't believe everything our governments tell us, and I'm not a gun control nut, in fact I believe the shooting was caused by his mothers neglect of his mental illness and failure to keep him away from weapons than the fact she owned guns herself.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you disagree with this, I don't mind. I can definitely see where the truthers are coming from, and this is just what I think. I wanted to make a somewhat structured post hoping to maybe get some people to revisit a case they hadn't looked into in some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for reading and feedback on my post would be nice.

       I don't always agree with things conservatives want or pass, but I agreed with them here.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012, which was contained within the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (section 1078 (a)) amended the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987, allowing for materials produced by the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG)
        <strong>
         to be available
        </strong>
        within the United States
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The key here is that we could produce broadcasts and such overseas but people here weren't allowed access to them before. And that was just silly.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "This means that VOA is forbidden to broadcast within the United States." In reality, of course, any American with a shortwave receiver or an Internet connection can listen to VOA. This is incidental, however. VOA cannot direct or intend its programs to be "for" Americans. This distinction is often lost on experts who see the letter of the law, but with no real understanding of the media.
        <strong>
         George W. Bush-era State Department official James K. Glassman has called for directing VOA at American audiences.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But the above was just plain silly
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A 1998 U.S. Court of Appeals ruling indicated that this act exempts Voice of America from releasing transcripts in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.
       </p>
       <p>
        The act does not prohibit the entirety of the Executive Branch from distributing information at home, just the State Department and Broadcasting Board of Governors. The result of the amendments to the Act means that most United States taxpayers do not know how the VOA (and its successor agencies) operate or what their programming content was, as was noted in 1967 by the Stanton Commission report noted above. The act both insulates the American public from being targeted by the government-sponsored information and broadcasting which is directed at audiences beyond America's borders. Some experts claim that
        <strong>
         the United States is "the only industrialized democracy to do this, and creates mistrust of the same activities in these audiences who increasingly question why Americans cannot read or hear the same material." However, anyone with an Internet connection can access VOA programs and articles for the Web
        </strong>
        , radio and television (VOA increasingly emphasizes television programming now) in English and other languages.
       </p>

       Has anyone figured out the "everyone must check in" sign or why there were porto potties on scene so quickly?
      </p>
      <p>
       How about why the media released an image of Ben Wheeler jumping in a puddle that was clearly photoshopped? Or Allysa Parker releasing atleast 5 images where she photoshopped Emily into the images. I know she admitted to photoshopping one of the images in her blog but why so many?

       You cannot spend just a couple hours looking into SH and expect to even have an incling of what happened. It takes weeks of reading documents or following researchers who have read through them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am starting to believe Fetzer and Tracy are part of the coverup. What kind of dipshit names there research pdf "no one died" that is asking for normies to shut down completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meh don't even care anymore. Way more children are being killed every minute around the globe with my tax dollars and the damage from SH seems contained to Corrupticut.

       I haven’t seen the specific sign you mention, but I had two kids in elementary school even before this event. As we moved while one or the other was at those grades we went through two separate schools in two separate counties. Both had an “all visitors must check in at the office” signs on the glass doors, which were locked at non-start/end times, had intercoms, a camera pointed at the entrance and direct line of sight from the office.

       The school wasn't even in operation at the time of the "shooting". It had mold growing inside the school, and was not even handicap accessable. Which a school has to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       The victims families had their houses paid off all on Christmas week. In honor of the Sandy Hook victims , at the Superbowl halftime show, the children who were supposed to be murdered were singing live on television.
      </p>
      <p>
       according to recently released FBI crime statistics, there were no murders in Newtown in 2012, despite the reports of a mass shooting claiming the lives of several schoolchildren and faculty staff. This has raised suspicions, as no murders were recorded unlike in the statistics that same year for the state of Colorado, which showed that 29 murders occurred in Aurora – accounting for the mass shooting at the Century Theatre cinema during a midnight screening of The Dark Night Rises.
      </p>
      <p>
       Veterans Today also points out other inconsistencies that have questioned what really happened at Sandy Hook. One is that emergency protocols that one would expect to be carried out after such an event, were not actually followed. Emergency vehicles did not line or blockade the street, trauma helicopters were not called in, and the scene was eerily calm and bloodless - not as frantic and chaotic as it should’ve been if such a tragedy were to occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another strange circumstance is the behaviour of the parties involved, such as officials and even the parents of the victims. A YouTube video showing medical examiner Wayne Carver seemingly grinning, laughing, and acting in a strange and unprofessional manner during a press conference aired by MSNBC is just one of the many instances highlighted as suspicious. Most shockingly though, are the reactions of the victims’ families.
      </p>

       Bereaved father Robbie Parker is all smiles only a day after daughter was gunned down...

      <p>
       The most famous being the alleged father of six-year-old victim Emilie Parker, Robbie Parker, whom when speaking to CNN the day after it was believed his daughter had been fatally shot, can be seen chuckling as he walks towards the camera but the switches into a hyperventilating and distressed character in order discuss a fundraising scheme in his daughter’s memory.

       Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), publicly funded schools are required to appropriately accommodate children with every manner of disability so that the children can participate in the educational environment. Under IDEA, an individualized education program (IEP) is formed for a disabled child and the necessary accommodations are decided upon and created by the school. In general, modifications for disabled students can be divided into five categories: accessibility, transportation, classroom, physical education and discipline.

       It's even more basic sense that it wasn't a hoax, based upon the login in which the conspiracy theory's propagators insist it
       <em>
        was.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       They insist it was a hoax to take American guns away from their owners (as per every mass shooting conspiracy...) yet no such thing has happened after
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       mass shooting.  No firearm confiscations, no gun registry lookups, et cetera.  Why would the government kill a bunch of little kids (or make it look like they did) for the purpose of confiscating firearms, if they then fail to do the latter?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very obvious.  This shooting truly happened.  Children died, families were torn apart, and the perpetrators of these internet conspiracies lack empathy and self-awareness.

       The biggest red flag for me was that though there was a push for gun control, they didnt put the parents out front of that demanding it. This is what media typically do in these circumstances. The parents push for gun control was always low key. In the background, ussually they lead the charge.
