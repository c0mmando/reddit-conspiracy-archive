       The Earth is likely
       <strong>
        <em>
         not
        </em>
        flat
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       While there are various points that can be argued could be proven one way, or the other, such as the Euclidean vs Non-Euclidean problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there is an issue which seems to disprove the Flat Earth model.
      </p>
      <h1>
       the equinox
      </h1>
      <p>
       First,
       <strong>
        the flat earth
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/e2M5dVm.jpg">

      </p>
      <p>
       with the spotlight sun illuminating the earth below. yep, no worries.
      </p>
      <p>
       and the
       <strong>
        spiraling sun
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/WoCnXj4.jpg">
        https://i.imgur.com/WoCnXj4.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       with the inwards and outwards movements causing the seasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        seasons on the round earth
       </strong>

        equinox on the round earth

        https://i.imgur.com/Tj9yoFp.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       therefore,
       <strong>
        the flat earth model
        <em>
         must
        </em>
        show that the equinox operates in this fashion.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/7dfbzvs.jpg">
        https://i.imgur.com/7dfbzvs.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And therein lies the problem
      </p>
      <p>
       better illustrated by this picture
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3jZfxn5.jpg">
        https://i.imgur.com/3jZfxn5.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       one more time
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/qcojnQj.png">
        http://i.imgur.com/qcojnQj.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yes, there goes the whole theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       But
       <strong>
        I can admit I was wrong
       </strong>
       , and I have found what I was looking for, evidence that
       <strong>
        undeniably disproves
       </strong>
       the flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel this does.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that
       <strong>
        sux
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But, considering this is a search for
       <em>
        truth
       </em>
       , we must accept the result the evidence provides.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, of course, does not discount the possibility we are living in a simulation, run by aliens from beyond the moon, or on the inside of the hollow earth controlled by space nazis, but it does seem to discount the Flat Earth theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been a fun journey, learning and discovering new things, while interacting with the Reddit community, but ultimately, we
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       uncover the truth. Unfortunately, the evidence in this case leads to the inescapable conclusion that the earth is not flat.
      </p>
      <p>

       The proof of a round earth is conclusive. Flat earth theories cannot explain most phenomena (there is no mathematical model using flat earth that can predict solar eclpses, etc).
      </p>

       I find flat earth theories fascinating and try to understand why people no longer trust experts.

       Trusting experts is an appeal to authority fallacy. There should be internal logic used and if unwilling or not intelligent enough to manifest such a state of disbelief will pragmatically and empirically win over taking every expert opinion as belief.
      </p>
      <p>
       Non-Euclidean geometry allows the Earth to be flat and round. In fact, using
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FringeTheory/comments/72iqfq/bizarre_explanation_of_gravity_in_einsteins_gr/">
        Einsteins models indicates that when you throw a ball in the air and it returns to Earth, it's not actually travelling up and down
       </a>
       . It's going in a single direction and space-time is distorting to give the appearance of the return trajectory.
      </p>
      <p>
       This by all measure of objective observation should sound absolutely absurd to most people. Test it out on someone, claim the "Flat Earthers" came up with it, and watch them coil in disgust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, PhDs are busy modelling reality in this way and its accepted. The "Experts". It's not to say its wrong, its a different perspective. But, the problem with relativity or relative position is that the math works for almost everything, even the Earth being a motionless body where everything revolves around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To add, in quantum physics its accepted that observation collapses the wave function. That matter is both energy (physical) and physical (molecule), yet if that same logic is extrapolated to the Earth, where it may be both flat and round: Geodesy uses geodesic frames to map and model - quite accurately - a flat plane, then using gravity distortion or gravity anomalies (also known as gravity potential) it maps the larger Geoid. In fact, in Ensteins description the Earth is not round, it's an area that has its shape from gravity potential, which is defined as the bending of space time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "Experts" failed to tell the common peon that they too believe the world is flat. Though many suffer cognitive dissonance in public debate.

       Exactly point originally, we use simplified versions of the very complex theories to explain the earth, then people get mad because they think that somehow what has been said break those rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking closer, one can see that those rules are more like generalised guidelines.

       Indeed it is. To avoid confusion, this is from a Euclidean point of view. The proof is conclusive for many reasons, most importantly because it predicts ALL observations.

       Absolutely. If we were on a flat earth and if those maps were correct i think we all would fall towards the northern sea somewhere to the north of scandinavia or something where the center of that circle should be. Gravity would not pull us downwards  anymore but towards the center of that circle so everything would start falling towards the center of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earth is not a conspiracy theory but an ignorance theory in my  opinion. Not knowing how things work is not a conspiracy, its just ignorance.

       Well said. The famous flat earth map actually states that it is a projection, not an actual representation.

       The center of gravity on this map would be around that black dot in the middle. Everything that's loose would start falling towards that dot.
      </p>
      <p>
       It s just a ridiculous idea which doesn't make any sense and to tell the truth i have the feeling that some of these kinds of ridiculous so called "conspiracy" theories are deliberately supported and spread to ridicule the "actual" conspiracies in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its the best way to fight against any conspiracy isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Create and spread all kinds of nonsense conspiracies and ridicule the whole conspiracy movement and after a while nobody would believe in
       <strong>
        any
       </strong>
       conspiracy even if you would come up with the best evidence for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So , if you want to fight conspiracy theories, the best way to do it is to produce all kinds of non-sense conspiracies like the flat earth theory etc. and after a while no  conspiracy theorist would be taken seriously anymore. So there's that aspect of this whole thing as well.

       please, honestly, that is very unusual and I used to believe nasa, one of those astronaut kids I was, heartbreaking...  luckily the flat earth theory brings up so many new things that are good, otherwise I would be depressed nasa lied since the beginning

       WE know the horizon isnt always eye level using a device called a theodolite.

       We know curvature obscures visibility and increasing elevation brings it back.

      <p>
       We know the sun sets below the horizon.

       I may not be high enough, but boats are supposed to go over the curvature, the horizon should drop a little bit as I go up, if not curve at least drop a little below eye level.
I understand you meant evidence that doesn't come from nasa, but can they be really separated from the argument being so important on space matters?.. all I want to know if you think nasa fakes stuff, Im not sure if you do, what do you think of that video?

       The horizon
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       drop when you go up. A theodolite is a device that can measure this drop.

       Absolutely! There are dozens of space programs from all countries not to mention private companies that put things in space.

       all the other space programs are fake as hell too, the main reason to believe flat earth is the fakery on top of us, because our senses are hard to use to gauge the curvature, even round earthers admit this, cant use the senses, this is why trust in space agencies is fundamental, and they lie too much, hence the earth is flat

       I get your position Im saying it logically doesnt make sense when you look at all the evidence that doesnt come from NASA. There is so much out there to prove this but for some reason you are claiming that until you actually see it with your own eyes you will refuse to believe it.

       Great question!
      </p>
      <p>
       the answer is Very Low Frequency transmission.

      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_(navigation_system)">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_(navigation_system)
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        OMEGA was the first
        <strong>
         global-range
        </strong>
        radio navigation system, operated by the United States in cooperation with six partner nations. It enabled ships and aircraft to determine their position by receiving very low frequency (VLF) radio signals in the range 10 to 14 kHz, transmitted by a network of fixed terrestrial radio beacons, using a receiver unit. It became operational around 1971 and was shut down in 1997 in favour of the Global Positioning Satellite system.
       </p>

      <p>
       what if they just made a better Omega system? Rather than switching to GPS?

       Dial up speeds operate at 4khz and it's linear so 10 khz would be just above 10 KB/s not nearly enough for streaming satellite TV by a long shot

       I know, right!
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what about this for an idea :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Project Loon is a research and development project being developed by X (formerly
        <em>
         Google X
        </em>
        ) with the mission of
        <strong>
         providing Internet access to rural and remote areas
        </strong>
        . The project uses
        <strong>
         high-altitude balloons
        </strong>
        placed in the stratosphere at an altitude of about 18 km (11 mi) to create an
        <strong>
         aerial wireless network with up to 4G-LTE speeds
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It was named Project Loon, since
        <strong>
         even
         <em>
          Google itself
         </em>
         found the idea
        </strong>
        of providing Internet access to the remaining 5 billion population
        <strong>
         unprecedented and "loony"
        </strong>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>

      </p>
      <p>
       which uses the same tech as a geostationary balloon satellite, which
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        are atmosphere analogues to satellites that float in the stratosphere (60,000 to 70,000 feet (18 to 21 km) above sea level) at a fixed point over the Earth's surface.
       </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Not, you could set these up to be repeater stations around the world, hovering up there, beaming things down.
      </p>
      <p>
       And we all know how military and secret tech is years ahead of our what they admit to, so..... maybe?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe that is the possibility?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is another way, it could be satellites, and
       <strong>
        the earth is round, *but at the centre of the universe
       </strong>
       * or the geocentric model, which I discuss here :

       Yes, the point is, we can't trust the images of the earth because they come from the very group (The Man) that is claimed, not only to have the evidence of the round earth, but also be hiding the flat earth.

       Due to this conflict of interest, the photographs cannot be trusted to be accurate representations of the truth.
      </p>

       That is why photographs are not considered the be all and end all of round earth proof.

       When anyone says the earth is round it always implies a relation to Euclidean geometry. Using other geometries is simply shifting the issue.

       Trusting experts is not a fallacy. We trust experts all the time. When I go to a doctor I trust her expertise, when I drive a car I trust the expertise of the engineers that designed it etc.

       If the Flat Earthers really wanted to get everyone going, they would give up on Flat Earth and start making posts about how nuclear bombs are fake. It would upset nearly everyone.

       This was always one of the better proofs so good job. Another insightful example to ponder is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Earth is flat, then how do you explain skywatchers in Southern Australia facing south and skywatchers in Southern South America facing south (two completely opposite directions on the Flat Earth map) being able to view the same comet simultaneously as it travels across the same Southern Sky?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Flat Earth Society truly cared about their cause, they would give up their effortless "activism" and promotion of convoluted experiments involving rocketry and expensive plane flights, and instead test the validity of relatively simple and inexpensive phenomena such as this.

       I may not be high enough, but boats are supposed to go over the curvature, the horizon should drop a little bit as I go up, if not curve at least drop a little below eye level.
I understand you meant evidence that doesn't come from nasa, but can they be really separated from the argument being so important on space matters?.. all I want to know if you think nasa fakes stuff, Im not sure if you do, what do you think of that video?

       Ok but the lower the frequency the lower the bit rate
      </p>
      <p>
       Dial up speeds operate at 4khz and it's linear so 10 khz would be just above 10 KB/s not nearly enough for streaming satellite TV by a long shot
