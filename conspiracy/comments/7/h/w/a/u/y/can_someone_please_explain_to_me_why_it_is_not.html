       While I believe that it is indeed worthy if investigation...it will never be seriously scrutinized because this is the very thing which binds the Elite together. Mutual blackmail and destruction. Ritual Magick and abuse. It makes the goddamn world go round...

       Magic with a (k) was a term coined by Crowley to delineate stage magic from actual Occult Magick. The child abuse of the Elites is intimately tied with ritual Magick, and has been for a very,
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       long time.

       Magick is the manifestation of ones' Will into Reality. It doesn't need a spiritual basis, but the fact of the matter is that the Elites
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       this, which is what is important. Doesn't matter if it's "real" or not.

       "Spirit Cooking" "Moloch", these are just some of the terms and guises used to hide it, and not nearly all of them. This abuse isn't random, it has a basis in ritualistic Occult belief. Look into Crowley and Sex Magick, as well as the idea of Trauma and the Pineal Gland.

       I gave you an idea of where to start, I will not put names down, because you will dismiss any and all of them, as I can already tell by your attitude. You don't have to believe it, but I ask you this...do you
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       think this abuse is random? Do you think it has nothing to do with their own spirituality? Do you think it just
       <em>
        happens
       </em>
       ? If so, you are deeply mistaken my friend. Keep digging.

       That's not what you're doing though...what you're doing is simply denying that people believe in certain rituals and in magick itself, that's akin to saying people don't believe in religion...you're not debunking anything, you're just saying no.

       Some people believe in Xenu, too. Believing in magic is like believing in Scientology.

       Again though, that doesn't change the fact that powerful people do indeed believe it. Understanding this and understanding what Magick is is important to piecing together the abuse and the motivations behind it. And again, using Crowleys own definition, Magick doesn't need to be "real", it is simply Will Manifested into Reality...music is a form of Magick, based on that definition, because it creates thoughts and emotions in others minds that may otherwise never have arisen. Birth is Magick, because it changes the base nature of the universe by adding a new consciousness being to it...it has a very wide definition that doesn't require a spiritual aspect.

       It's not a group that I am going to define individually. You need to look at symbolism- the dollar bill, who designed it? Who commissioned it? Look at Freemasonry. Look into numerology...then ask yourself why these events happen on these days. Look into secret societies like Skull and Bones, which has several presidents as members. Look into the symbolism in the Vatican, the Popes Audience Hall, the Keys of St Peter. Look at the people participating in that "performance art" as you  call it, that is Spirit Cooking. Look at the record industry and the messages behind the music, the studios and artists who produce it. Look at Bohemian Grove and the owl of Minerva and the rituals surrounding it.

       Deleted my comment before I saw this, because I saw it was redundant. What has been debunked exactly? The concept of the paranormal?
The current science isn't wrong on every account, but it doesn't cover the entire aspect of all that is.

       There's nothing to debate. The rumor that "spirit cooking" is some kind of Satanic ritual (what is this, 1988?) was disproven, and you cannot prove that magic, outside of Vegas and the trading card game, exists.

       Doesn't mean they believe, it means that someone is making them do it. If I were to blackmail someone with pedophilia and shit like that I'd add some crazy ritual magick thing so if they ever come out they will will be seen as crazy, or maybe they will even think it's real - therefore fearing "me" even more.

       But that’s the thing, there’s 0 evidence and I get what the OP wants. Riding in the Lolita express 20+ times, he was most likely doing some shady shit. But there is no evidence or testimonies to back any of that up.

       Yeah, that's what happens with all those /pol/ pedophiles. 4Chan is just crawling with them, so of course they see it everywhere they look. Classic projection. Same with the Voat users, how many pedophile subs are on Voat? Another classic projection case.

       Oh please a scorned woman during an ugly dividce is not a credible victim like humanity Broderick. Trump and his ex wife are great friends and she even voted for him. How old are you? You seem very naive, Ivan's trump never filed a criminal charge she simply made an accusation to increase a pay out during an ugly divorce. Victim credibility is important. Willingness to prosecute is important especially in a situation where you can only take the victims word for it.

       Please do so. We all saw her and 2 other victims confront her rapist at the 2016 presidential debate. We all her saw her interviewed on fox. We have all seen multiple victims make claims and provide evidence. There are questions that have surrounded the clintons for decades that have never been put to rest, Clinton kill list for example. Reputation comes from who they associate with and the rumors that surround them.

       Reputable to you is cnn. I myself look at the facts and the coincidences that surround the clintons. Based on the pattern of mysterious and convenient deaths of key witnesses and enemies of the Clinton it is very SUSPICIOUS. As for you I suggest you research if you are interested.

       I think that's because it seems you are here to enter into a debate or conflict. I have no interest in convincing you of anything. But your point on this thread seems to be to sow discord. And raise doubts about many accepted conspiracies. I find anyone who displays partisan loyalty in today's political climate suspect. I am sure you can understand how people on a conspiracy forum would be suspicious?

       Because I don't use reputation of a source to judge facts. Nor will I step into a silly debate with u. Facts stand on their own regardless of who says them. People come to this sub all the time just like you. You use the same tactics, reputable sources? What do you consider a reputable source?  Lead by example, show me a reputable source that team Clinton are honest and trustworthy career politicians. Except guess what? I don't believe sources. Lesson here use facts and learn to rely on your own judgement.

       It seems Donald Trump may have sexually abused Ivanka when she was a child. There is something no right about that father / daughter relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was unsure of this conspiracy until
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0_axTST2aY">
        I saw this video.
       </a>
       Where Trump states that the strongest bond him and Ivanka share is sex. Not to mention the multitude of weird/creepy groping photos of Donald and Ivanka when she was a young teen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Baron also exhibits similar signs of trauma that are common among children who have been sexually assaulted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The above, coupled with Trumps unabashed support for a pedophile, Roy Moore, definitely makes this conspiracy worth investigating.

       Lol. I am sure Trump has done a lot of creepy things but that video does not have him say they share a sex bond. Did you think people wouldn't watch it? Roy Moore could very well be a pedophile but it seems odd this is coming up now after what..30 or 40 years? Both sides are dirty but you seem to want to push your agenda.

You probably think conspiracy is just here to push a political agenda and I get that. That is how is seems to a lot of left leaning people. I think both political sides are retarded.

       Dude, you understand how threads work right?  Different topics, different threads?  You want to talk about Trump's accusers, go find a different thread and stop detracting from this one.  You are off topic.

       You have to investigate everything and everyone involved or it would just be a partisan shit show. It's the people still in the government being blackmailed that are the biggest threat to global security not an ex president. Although if evidence is found lock him up with the rest of them.

       Should probably investigate the current president who rode on the Lolita Express first. And who appointed the prosecutor who let Epstein get away with it all to his cabinet. Then we'll start looking at other presidents who were involved.

       There's dozens of court cases detailing Trump's involvement, go look into them since you're so interested in finding out more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's a disgusting pedophile who raped little girls. Do some research on what went down at the Wexner Mansion, that was one of Trump's favorite hangouts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump said Epstein and him were great pals and he had great taste for beautiful women, especially the young ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has put millions of dollars into trying to make all the evidence go away and even hire people to say it didn't happen.

       How naive of you to think that "millions$"would stop the huge machine of elite and media who are desperate to get trump arrested on anything. Trump is one billionaire, how does that work against the Rothschild, &amp; the saudis, &amp; Mossad &amp; Busch family, of course there are many more enemies of trump and combined they are richer than the majority of the middle class. The term follow the evidence applies the trail leads to Clinton and from there you keep going. Is trump complicit? Without exposing and prosecuting Clinton it will simply be another ridiculous witch hunt just like the mueller investigation. You can't cherry pick evidence and choose suspects on political bias. Sorry criminal investigations are supposed to be unbiased.

       Na.  Regular users here know the problems of the world escalate much higher than the US presidency.  Blaming Trump is a scapegoat and a narrow vision.  In the last month or so is when all these anti-Trump comments started popping up.  Trust me, it's not organic.  Reddit has ways of making its agendas known, as we've seen.

       Are you serious? My account alone is full of plenty of Trump bashing, in this sub, dating back to long before the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know how often you're here, but this sub has been used to push partisan, political attacks since
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       the 2016 election.

       In their defense, I don't think that it's a concerted effort. I find that people tend to "wake up" when the other side is in power, because it forces them to dig deeper and learn the hidden history. Just in the case of Trump, they've latched on to so many partisan conspiracy theories that they've lost sight of the fact that the left/right paradigm is an illusion, and instead they focus on all of the horrible things "liberals" have done while ignoring the identical actions of the GOP.

       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       based on the number of partisan anti-Trump posts.  I miss the days where we talked about real conspiracies instead of the ones the media wants to push.  Just my two cents.

       The magic of having a box to put someone in, like "shill" or "astroturf", is that it means you don't ever have to listen to their points! You can interact with sane people and just calmly tune them out as you continue with your day.

Clinton supporters are too partisan to be objective and would prefer allowing a criminal who has a known history of abusing victims and a long kill list and distract with anything or anyone else.

       Going to an island owned by a notorious billionaire pedophile and allegedly having sexual relations with underage persons thanks to the availability of such persons on island.  AKA Statutory rape.

       Although if the relations occurred outside of an American jurisdiction then who's to say what's illegal, and what's not.

       I think your patented response should just be some version of a 'grab em by the pussy' joke. It's a double-speared attack. Maybe even triple-speared. You get the reader thinking about the joke, the thought of trump
       <em>
        actually

       grabbing pussy, then you get people thinking about white men in power. All in a few key strokes. Idk man I think you can do better.

       Actually, its public record that his name never appeared on the flight logs. I'm not defending Trump, I'm attacking the false equivalency you put forth. Trump and Epstein were friends, and I'm sure you can recite the Trump quote regarding Epstein as well as I can.
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts we are left with are that Bill Clinton
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       was on that island. And that through Epsteins hearing, there was confirmation that Trumps name does not appear in anything incriminating regarding Epstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything you are saying is hear-say anyway so I don't know why I would think you'd be receptive to me setting the record straight.

       Depends on who you ask. Some people it is a way to make money and gain fame, for others it is a way to objectify women. Owning a beauty pageant does not equal rape to me. Sorry if that is not what you are getting at. If solid evidence is exposed on any abuser hang em. But a political smear campaign because you are unhappy that your candidate lost is not part of the democratic processs. Evidence of rape is not owning a beauty pageant.

       I don't. But the evidence has pointed to podesta and alefantis. And many more. We don't have wiki leaks emails on trump so rather than spin our wheels and get distracted lets focus on facts. Simply being associated is not enough but it does shed light on where to look. Podesta matches eyewitness descriptions of maddie mcanns kidnappers. Add known associates, and pizza code words in his emails and canibalistic spirit cooking and a collection of child torture and rape art works.... well there is probable cause to conduct a deeper investigation. What is there on trump? Known associates. Still need more unfortunately for probable cause. If anyone finds more i would love to see it. I remain open minded predators, all predators including republican and democrats need to face justice. Yes? That goes for the podesta crew too.

       That's correct, Trump used to fly down to Antigua on his private jet and then "sneak" to pedo Island via a secret network of rape boats (apparently Trump prefers to call them "golden yachts" but I don't know what that's about really, possibly to do with the golden bull).

       The flights were debunked, but not the rape boats.  Trump knew about the flight logs, so he took steps to bypass them.  Boats don't have passenger logs.

       Actually, the burden of proof is on the person who makes a claim, unless that claim in well-established.  Shifting the burden of proof is a logical fallacy.  I wouldn't call people shills either.

       You're the one making the outrageous claim that trump doesn't use rapeboats to travel to pedo-island.  This is well established by both

        STAR TREK, THE NEXT GENERATION
The original series of Star Trek had lost money, but in September, 1987 a new series called Star Trek, The Next Generation was started with $1 million dollars budgeted for each of its 24 episodes.
The episodes pushed the Illuminati's agenda in every show. People were being aroused to bombard Paramount with requests for a new Star Trek. Bob Justman who worked with Roddenberry said, "When I left Star Trek in 1968 it was a disaster. It was a failure as far as the network was concerned." That is because it didn't make money.
Hollywood tells us it makes these movies because they are what the public want and that they have to go where the money is—the closer truth is that Hollywood makes movies that push an agenda—Hollywood makes movies that Hollywood wants to make. And since Star Trek was part of the NWO's mind-control, the show and it successors had to go on. How important is Star Trek?
A witness has talked about Boeing workers sneaking off their jobs and hiding in the tunnels underneath the hugh Seattle Boeing plant so they could watch Star Trek shows. This enormous Boeing plant is used for rituals and mind-control. This Boeing building is enormous, for it is where they have assembly lines to build the hugh jets, like the 747s, 707s, etc. An extensive maze of tunnels lays underneath the main building, large enough to accommodate all the tens of thousands of workers on any shift.
It is interesting who was associated with the production of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Script writers for the Next Generation had a Star Trek Bible to write from. These script writers included such persons as Alan Adler, Dennis Putnam Bailey, three Grays, Debra Mclntrye, Ronald Moore, Grant Rosenberg, Randee Russell, Bryan Stewart. These are common names within the llluminati. Coca-cola, an Uluminati-run corporation, was one of the major advertisers for Star Trek, and the god-man Dalai Lama of Tibet, who is a Star Trek fan, visited the cast of Star Trek in 1988 in Hollywood and got his picture taken with members of the cast. Probert who worked with Star Trek productions also worked with Walt Disney's Imagineering subsidiary.

       I neither believe in a christ or an anti-christ, don't blame god for what you people do.  There are no saints here, only sinners.  I'm not brain washed, but you drink another's words and only accept what reinforces a predetermined view and I see most everything.  Open up your eyes and let the light in, or build an umbrella of conspiracy to keep in the shadows.  Don Quixote will slay his dragon, but are sure you're not hallucinating?

Nothing in there about molesting kids, but Trump brags about seeing teenager titties at his little casino and rides on a lolita express and you're shining his shoes, use lots of spit and tongue, get in the cracks and lick it out pawn.

       Nope, never been.  I don't need indoctrination.  I don't join cults.  My brain doesn't need a scrubbing.  Go do shrooms and meet the universe and see what it says about your ideas.

       Guess you won't read this either then.  If he's a pedo, then so are all you folks lusting after nickelodeon and disney kids.  Back then people got married at 14, so all you folks can gossip, but your great grandpa probably popped out kids at 15.

       Yes, I've read his book. Have you ever seen his Charles's photography book containing nude photographs of young Alice and friends?

       There are many more stories to the world, than baby jesus and the mother mary and evil satanists eating babies.  Christianity and all these religions causing strife today were babies when older religions ruled the world, a layer painted upon layer upon layer.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't need giants and fairies, when there were many of walks of man walking on the same globe, but the stories entertain and sometimes twist fools into taking them literally.  You're a bunch of savages, what can I expect, but you'll evolve or die, that's life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I gotta go, cause there's more to life than arguing madness.  Go down the rabbit hole Alice, but you're probably only going to find rabbit turds and bats with rabies.

       My post is about this blatant portion of US history that seems to be accepted or ignored by the populace. Do you not want to know what the Clinton relationship with Epstein was about- while he was President? And John Podesta was Chief of Staff?

       I already answered that. Epstein was investigated and so were is actions and who he was with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said you can't prove Clinton fucked underage females. Like I can't prove what Trump means when he says Epstein is a lot of fun. They both him and Clinton certainly thought so but where's the evidence? This isn't a fascist nation no matter how badly you want it to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're going off a Podesta accusation which also has no proof. There's not an official list of food code words, only symbols.

       My OP has nothing to do with whether Epstein was investigated. I'm wondering why Bill Clinton hasn't been investigated for his 26 trips on Epsteins private plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absolutely, we can discuss Donald Trump's one time on the plane if you want, but make your own post about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm specifically asking about Bill Clinton's 26 times on the pedo plane.

       And I just said... you don't have evidence of a crime and Epstein didn't give him up. So his connection to Epstein is in the same place as the current president.

       Do you have the DNA evidence off his dick? Or are we going to investigate and jail for guilt by association?

      <p>
       Clinton has much more credible things to go after like the rapes he was accused of doing to adult females. Apparently Clinton wasn't a big enough of a star yet to land something consensual like Monica.

       I'm not talking about politics, I'm talking conspiracy. Is this nonsense something you are ok with, a President spending that much time with a industrial child trafficker? You don't think it should be looked in to? Especially because his Chief of Staff was also working for Obama and then for Hillary Clinton?

       As I'll say ONCE AGAIN. He was probably investigated with every single one of Epstein's associates when he was busted, but there's no evidence of anything other than him riding on a plane. For all you know he went to the island and drank mojito's all day with the nearest child 200 miles away.

       Well if you ask me Both Clinton and The Donald are chidl rapists. Still don't have any proof of either, just Epstein. Funny how two presidents are connected to Epstein, yet you all only want to talk about one being guilty.

       I can’t. I work and have worked with too many children and adults who have been abused. I see it as a multigenerational issue as it affects victims’ core sense of self, intimate relationships, and ability to parent effectively.

       I initially saw her as just an impassioned but politically biased person, rightfully disgusted by child abuse, but after that exchange I was really put off. There are some users that I wish
       <em>
        were

       getting paid because to believe they truly have it
       <em>

       distorted is depressing and kind of scary.

       We can talk about Trump in a different thread, can't we? This thread was intended to speak exactly about the topic in the title but it seems it is impossible. The "whataboutism" is hilarious.

       The OP is specifically about a former President that flew on the Lolita 26 times. What does that have to do with a person that wasn't President flying on the plane once? We know the facts about the flight. What we don't know is the facts about the 26 times Bill Clinton flew on Epsteins plane.

       Yeah, and I agree that Clinton and Epstein relationship should be investigated. But, Trump is also the current president and there is evidence he used his services, but I never heard of him only using it just once.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why do you only want us talking about Clinton using the pedophile service and not Trump? Using the service at least once is just as bad as 26 times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only reason why I think you don't want us to talk about Trump using pedophile services is because you don't actually care about the children, and are just using this as a partisan attack against only one side.

       But Trump didn't "use services" on Epsteins plane. According to testimony, he hitched a ride to NY once. There were no other passengers except J and M Epstein. So, ok, we've talked about it. What else is there to say?

       They are both clearly pedophiles but you only wan the focus only one politician and not the other, and as soon as Trump is mentioned you defend him or deflect.

       What proof do you have of Trump being close to Epstein at all? Theres plenty of concrete evidence that Bill and him were very, very close. Epstein co-founded the Clinton Foundation. Bill made 26 trips to his private island, shedding his secret service guards for a majority of them, they worked together on dozens of fundraisers and many parties. I could go on, but you cant without steeping so low as to defend the right to ask questions when concrete evidence shows a possible abuse of power. The evidence is there for Podesta too, what did he mean when he asked "what should i perform dominos on later, cheese or pasta?"
Why would they want children to entertain them, specifically by them being in a hot tub?
Who is Laura Silsby? Why did she work with the Clinton Foundation in Haiti and claim 33 children she was caught trying to smuggle out of the country were orphans when most of them weren't?
Whose 'Heavy Breathing'? What artwork would they use for their posters? What symbols are in their videos? Where would they perform? How did his single bullet go through several walls and exactly into the PC's hard drive exactly where any incriminating evidence would be?

       Trump was outing right him right there in public. He did the same thing to Larry Silverstein after he bought the World Trade Center towers days before it was hit. 
He said "Larry is one of my good friends, I feel so bad for him because he just bought the lease to the trade center a few days ago"

       Show me Trumps artwork, emails, instagram's of his employees posting about pedo/Satanism &amp; then maybe you can compare him to podesta.

       I think you are to focused on Epstein rather than the operation that was started by Robert Maxwell  (Czech/Ukrainian mossad) and then carried on by his daughter Ghislaine with her boyfriend Epstein. These animals recruited oligarchs and left leaning billionaires from the former Soviet Union using girls trafficked from the Czech Republic/ Ukraine. Donald Trump and his czech mossad wife Ivana assisted by setting up model agencies and pageants to help traffic young girls out of eastern Europe. (Later marrying one trafficked from Slovenia). Donald was in the game pre Epstein. Clinton came along later. Ties to Czechs and Israel is the key go after the traffickers first and the johns will follow.

       Nothing can be proven without an investigation. An investigation uncovers connections, bank transactions, witnesses, and victim. The issue is there is NO investigation. Why would you endorse not investigating?

       is this actually true though?  i'm not familiar with the epstein case, but did victims come forward?  if none of the victims identified him as being involved, then what else is there to investigate?

       Yes, the FBI had many Epstein victims on record and willing to testify, and the FBI violated basic procedures even closing the case without first notifying the victims which apparently is a huge violation.  The parents of the victims were also politically connected and wealthy and forced the Investigation which was conducted relunctantly and the judge also helped conceal the evidence.   They settled the case and gave him immunity regarding the videos epstein had of powerful elites. It's a HUGE scandal. I am all for investigating and criminally prosecuting dems or republicans. Including  Epstein and then his "close" associates and then spreads out. The FBI is in a lot of trouble right now and they seem to be the arm that cherry picks who they investigate for political withchunts. This also applies to how blacks get singled out for prosecution. It's important that justice is blind to status, color, gender. We all have a stake in non biased investigations.

       Then Wikipedia is lying? Actually it was a female investigator who emailed epsteins defense and recommended they file in a different jurisdiction to reduce public attention and scrutiny. I won't disagree about Acosta at all. But there is more to the story and supposedly Acosta was forced by the Florida governor Jen bush to shut down the investigation.

       All these trumpers talk about draining the swamp though. One of the reasons I believe the whole pedogate thing won't be blown wide open is because Trump is just as guilty as the rest of the elite.

       Makes them terrifiangly easy to troll. Maybe the anti vaxxers are right about autism considering how easy it seems to manipulate people now a days. I could create an elaborate LARP about how I'm an agent related to Hillary and I've got inside dirt and if you follow me I'll give you BIG REVEALS and oh my God im scaring myself with the possibilities.

       To me, it seems fairly obvious that he was never invited to the inner circles of the wealthy elites. He has always had to buy his way in. He was not welcomed by New York real estate, the Florida country clubbers, and now he is not welcomed by the Washington pedos. The elites, for decades, just invited him to events for donations and talked shit behind his back. Look what happened when he ran for President. All the people that used to want him at their dinner parties and next to them in pictures are all of a sudden his #1 enemies, attacking his character, insisting they were never friends. He has heard the gossip and knows what people are up to. Looks like he is getting the last laugh now.

       <em>
        he refused to eat at the table

       I'm taking it you aren't aware of everything that's happened with Trump regarding the Epstein case. Because if you were, you would know the attorney who was going after Epstein called Trump and after discussing matters of the case with him determined it wasn't necessary to call him again. In my mind that indicates Trump's innocence regarding this whole matter.

       What I pointed out is that OP is jumping on the Epstein bandwagon, but only to attack one side of the political spectrum. In other words, OP doesn't care about the children Epstein abused or allowed to be abused, he only wants to trash WJC.

       This isn't my opinion, but I'm answering your question: it's because he's irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over and above the fact that we should all care more about the actions of those in power, because they currently have influence, the Bill Clinton saga was hashed out for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's akin to the DNC robbing the primaries for Hillary. There were so many partisan attacks against her that any legitimate criticism was lumped in to one big attack in the minds of her supporters. Once the MSM claims a few times that the DNC story is bullshit, most people assume that it's been debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, Clinton's sexual escapades were the subject of years of reporting. To those that remember Ken Starr's investigation, they probably feel as though the accusations against Clinton have been examined and deemed false.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, the main reason is because Trump is in power, and Clinton is not. Same reason why people talked about Obama's war crimes during his time (droning US citizens without due process), but had stopped talking about Cheney and Bush's war crimes, which were objectively worse by orders of magnitude.

       See, I don't think it makes sense to just say, "eh, whatever, he's irrelevant." Do we only care about investigating those that are currently in office? What about uncovering past corruption and the system that allowed it to happen? Do you not worry that we are doomed to repeat the past? Do you think people should get away with crimes if they got away with it and happen to not be President any longer?

       Again, I'm pointing out what I believe the popular opinion is, but not my own.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing to consider is that you need to take a step back. Take the news, for example. The cable news networks draw a couple of million people at best. Even if the total viewer is 10 million who regularly pay attention, that's still a very small portion of the voting population.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mention this because there are very few people who actually pay attention to what's going on on a daily basis. Within that group you already have people that are emotionally charged, either because they want to support their politician, or to attack the other side. This alone is enough to explain why most people don't care about things that are in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       To further compound the issue, the current administration is generating significant news stories on a daily basis. If it weren't hard enough for the average citizen to keep up before, it's gotten a lot harder still.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all of the obstacles stopping the citizenry from caring about the issues of the day, it's no wonder people have no energy and/or desire to tackle issues that are decades old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, insert divisive, partisan politics. While both sides of TBTB are busy collecting donations from the exact same companies, the electorate is made to believe that it's "left vs. right", despite the fact that ~80% of people agree on most social and political issues. It's hard to care about real crimes when you've been led to believe that they are, in fact, partisan lies.

       Totally, and anyone relying on cable networks as their primary source of information is probably LESS informed than people who are ignorant of an issue; at least they have an open mind.

       Yes but it begs the question as whether or not you're completely forgetting that Trump has also been directly accused of pedophilia in the rape of a 14 year old girl. All I'm saying is this sub has become pro Trump.

       He is the current president, is friends with Epstein, ran a modeling agency and pageants, has multiple accusations of rape (one from his ex-wife). So yeah you are going to hear some "what about Trump" because he currently holds a position of power.

       Yes he was subpoenaed for his involvement in Epstein's case, who was the one being investigated and found guilty (Trump and his lawyers deny the subpoena). Worth noting Epstein's outrageously light punishment:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Trump’s nominee for labor secretary, former Miami U.S. attorney Alexander Acosta, whose Senate confirmation hearing began Wednesday morning, cut a non-prosecution deal with Epstein a decade ago rather than pursuing a federal indictment that Acosta’s staff had advocated.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Other facts: 
* Epstein admitted to knowing Trump under oath, and curiously pled the fifth to Trump attending sex parties with underage girls. 
* At least one of Epstein’s underage sex victims was recruited from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago — which he frequented often. 
* Mark Epstein, Jeffrey's brother, testified in 2009 that Trump flew on Jeffrey's private jet
       <em>
        at least
       </em>
       once
* Trump quote: "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy, He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."
* Trump was named in Epstein’s “little black book.”
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many connections between Trump and Epstein, that you have to be incredibly ignorant to ignore them. Same for Clinton.

       Sure, absolutely worth expressing concern over. But Trump is the current POTUS, which carries a lot more weight. Bottom line, my point is that there shouldn't be anything partisan about this. Both Trump and Clinton are very likely guilty of nefarious activity involving Epstein.

       that there was a subpoena, they only maintain that Trump willingly volunteered to questioning before he was served. I've yet to see a denial that there was a subpoena. Do you have anything to back your claim up?

       Trump's president, he won, he has control of the DOJ and can prosecute the Clintons. He's not prosecuting anyone in D.C. though.

       These things are instant, you're aware of that? For example, we recently found out the DOJ has been investigating the FBI. So there is stuff being done, unfortunately, it takes time. Specially when trying to take down some of the most powerful people in America.

       Trump openly called for prosecuting her before the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he backtracked:

       it after being as transparent as he can be and saying she'll be in jail when he's President on national televised debates?

       Yea they're talking about it somewhat now. Trump revived some talk of Clinton only after the heat fired up on his administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's still not going after her. Why discuss mishandling of the case by the FBI only, and not Clinton herself? The emails and FBI handling of it isn't the only criminal charge that can be brought against Clinton. This is obvious from everyone watching Fox.
      </p>
      <p>
       She murdered people, rigged the primaries, etc. All arguments against her by Trump and the right-wing media.
      </p>
      <p>
       ESPECIALLY RIGGING THE PRIMARIES.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we'll investigate the FBI?? What happened to draining the swamp??
      </p>
      <p>
       Your source even says Trump tweeted:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Bernie Sanders supporters have every right to be apoplectic of the complete theft of the Dem primary by Crooked Hillary!"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But I guess investigations are only worth it when it deflects from what his administration is doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual justice and arresting Clinton hasn't been a priority, or they'd be investigating her and not the FBI.

      <p>
       Secondly, things still have to be handled by following the correct legal process. They know there's evidence that she's guilty with the email probe, without a doubt. So they know for sure they can get her on that. They can't charge her on a closed investigation, so they have to get the investigation reopened. That happens by showing it was handled incorrectly the first time.
      </p>

       You only get one attempt to prosecute a high power individual like HRC, that attempt has to count.

       Do you have any inkling of proof he is investigating Clinton after explicitly saying he's not going to go after her?

       You keep asserting a connection to Clinton even though Trump said he's explicitly not going after her.

       The reason the media doesn't bring it up is because it would also bring up the names of many other powerful people in politics and entertainment who they want to protect. Plus it wouldn't go anywhere. There's no direct evidence of anything. Everyone already knows Trump is a womanizer.

       Think of all of the things that Trump brought up about the Clintons during the election, and the things he continues to bring up about them as president. Now consider that one of the most damning things Trump could have brought up is Clinton's association with Epstein. Now ask yourself why Trump wouldn't have brought that up, and continues not to bring it up.

       You mean the Acosta who gave Epstein a sweetheart deal whereby he was sentenced to a year in prison where he was let out on work release to his mansion every single day of the sentence? The Acosta who agreed with Epstein's defense to not tell the victims about the deal until after it was made public? The Acosta who chose not to charge Epstein with obstruction of justice after he "convinced" one of the victims not to testify? It's amazing to me that Trump picks the guy who let Epstein off easy and your response is to twist it so somehow this is Trump using 3D chess to coral the Clintons. Even if we allow your premise, it fails because a) Acosta is there now and Trump is still silent, and b) Acosta is the Labor Secretary . . . not a criminal prosecutor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's some things people said about Acosta's deal with Epstein:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Acosta is pretending the failure to prosecute was routine, But that’s bullshit. What happened here was completely and totally out of the main. Prosecutors wanted badly to prosecute this guy because he was an unrepentant perpetrator and child molester who was not going to stop absent significant incarceration. That Acosta overruled his prosecutors and didn’t notify the victims cannot be justified." - Kenneth Starr, hardly a Clinton fan
      </p>
      <p>
       "I think it is absolutely appalling that he gave Jeffrey Epstein such a sweet deal in light of the number of accusers that were out there, I think it should disqualify him for any other government job. If you don’t take the sexual exploitation of minors seriously, you don’t have the fundamental decency to be working for us.” - Attorney for one of Epstein's victims
      </p>
      <p>
       “That wasn’t an appropriate resolution of this matter . . . the charges leveled against Epstein were very minor, compared with what the facts called for. . . . justice had not been served." - Michael Reiter, Palm Beach County Police Chief who investigated the case and later testified in a civil case against Acosta.

       You mean the Acosta who gave Epstein a sweetheart deal whereby he was sentenced to a year in prison where he was let out on work release to his mansion every single day of the sentence? The Acosta who agreed with Epstein's defense to not tell the victims about the deal until after it was made public? The Acosta who chose not to charge Epstein with obstruction of justice after he "convinced" one of the victims not to testify? It's amazing to me that Trump picks the guy who let Epstein off easy and your response is to twist it so somehow this is Trump using 3D chess to coral the Clintons. Even if we allow your premise, it fails because a) Acosta is there now and Trump is still silent, and b) Acosta is the Labor Secretary . . . not a criminal prosecutor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's some things people said about Acosta's deal with Epstein:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Acosta is pretending the failure to prosecute was routine, But that’s bullshit. What happened here was completely and totally out of the main. Prosecutors wanted badly to prosecute this guy because he was an unrepentant perpetrator and child molester who was not going to stop absent significant incarceration. That Acosta overruled his prosecutors and didn’t notify the victims cannot be justified." - Kenneth Starr, hardly a Clinton fan
      </p>
      <p>
       "I think it is absolutely appalling that he gave Jeffrey Epstein such a sweet deal in light of the number of accusers that were out there, I think it should disqualify him for any other government job. If you don’t take the sexual exploitation of minors seriously, you don’t have the fundamental decency to be working for us.” - Attorney for one of Epstein's victims
      </p>
      <p>
       “That wasn’t an appropriate resolution of this matter . . . the charges leveled against Epstein were very minor, compared with what the facts called for. . . . justice had not been served." - Michael Reiter, Palm Beach County Police Chief who investigated the case and later testified in a civil case against Acosta.

       Do you know what probable cause is ? There has to be some evidence for probable cause. Not running for reelection is not evidence of a crime nor is it probable cause. Do you realize that by acting illogical and hysterical you discredit yourself? Please try to be logical.  I still wonder why you endorse not investigating.

       I wasn't medicated from birth like most of you little pokemon junkies.  Gotta collect em all!  Obviously you've never read it like you claimed.  Nothing in there about molesting kids, but Trump brags about seeing teenager titties at his little casino and rides on a lolita express and you're shining his shoes, use lots of spit and tongue, get in the cracks and lick it out pawn.
