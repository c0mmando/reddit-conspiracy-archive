       The school wasn't even in operation at the time of the "shooting". It had mold growing inside the school, and was not even handicap accessable. Which a public school has to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), publicly funded schools are required to appropriately accommodate children with every manner of disability so that the children can participate in the educational environment. Under IDEA, an individualized education program (IEP) is formed for a disabled child and the necessary accommodations are decided upon and created by the school. In general, modifications for disabled students can be divided into five categories: accessibility, transportation, classroom, physical education and discipline.
Accessibility Rules Under the ADA Under the ADA rules, all classrooms must be wheelchair accessible. This includes installation of an elevator in two-story school buildings. Additionally, ramps and handicapped parking are required for facilitating easy access to school buildings.Bathrooms must have wheelchair accessible toilets and a lowered sink. In lunchrooms, there must be wheelchair accessible tables. On playgrounds, many schools offer specialized equipment so that wheelchair bound children can use the playground and enjoy their recess freely.

       The victims families had their houses paid off all on Christmas week. In honor of the Sandy Hook victims , at the Superbowl halftime show, the children who were supposed to be murdered were singing live on television.

       according to recently released FBI crime statistics, there were no murders in Newtown in 2012, despite the reports of a mass shooting claiming the lives of several schoolchildren and faculty staff. This has raised suspicions, as no murders were recorded unlike in the statistics that same year for the state of Colorado, which showed that 29 murders occurred in Aurora – accounting for the mass shooting at the Century Theatre cinema during a midnight screening of The Dark Night Rises.
      </p>
      <p>
       Veterans Today also points out other inconsistencies that have questioned what really happened at Sandy Hook. One is that emergency protocols that one would expect to be carried out after such an event, were not actually followed. Emergency vehicles did not line or blockade the street, trauma helicopters were not called in, and the scene was eerily calm and bloodless - not as frantic and chaotic as it should’ve been if such a tragedy were to occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another strange circumstance is the behaviour of the parties involved, such as officials and even the parents of the victims. A YouTube video showing medical examiner Wayne Carver seemingly grinning, laughing, and acting in a strange and unprofessional manner during a press conference aired by MSNBC is just one of the many instances highlighted as suspicious. Most shockingly though, are the reactions of the victims’ families.

       Bereaved father Robbie Parker is all smiles only a day after daughter was gunned down...
      </p>
      <p>
       The most famous being the alleged father of six-year-old victim Emilie Parker, Robbie Parker, whom when speaking to CNN the day after it was believed his daughter had been fatally shot, can be seen chuckling as he walks towards the camera but the switches into a hyperventilating and distressed character in order discuss a fundraising scheme in his daughter’s memory.

       Most of these people have convinced themselves what they are doing is for the betterment of the country, and us all.  If the perpetraitors are the department of defense, and the FBI is covering it up,. then really these people know they will never get in trouble so why not get rich. Also, really who would have the balls to go against the DOD, and FBI by admitting themselves complacent in a crime. Sued for every penny, or better yet just killed off.

       Could it be these people were all in witness protection and given fake lives and a role to play here? Why not. Think of the thousands in the program who could be controlled and silenced using that over their heads. Once sandy hook happened they’re scattered and given all new identities except for those who didn’t have children die in the event.

       would ANY parents manage to get past the police at the bottom of the road, walk all the way up the drive, and stand around in a parking lot while SWAT was conducting room to room searches. Additionally, not a single vehicle would have been allowed to leave the parking lot for at least a full day.
When arriving at the scene there could be multiple active shooters. One ready to jump out and fire upon the parents, and gathering crowd, but you let them linger around the parking lot. Also, the evidence, even accidentally, could be tampered, or destroyed. You remark to someone comment and compare it to the post, or the sub, etc. You bring nothing to this argument, or your claim.

       Remember this. I thought the same thing too. Like how could they pay off hundreds of people? Well supposedly the Manhattan Project that we all know was the project that created the Atomic Bomb.  There were over 100 k people who knew about its existence but it mever leaked.  If 100k people cohld keep quite about this Soros or other billionaires could absolutely pay off news crews amd stations, a couple dozen actors and am entire police force of the small town. No question.
       <br/>
       My real concern is that I have not seen any coverage of a funeral or anything. Thats whats wierd to me.

       I did all this about 6 months ago when it was pionted out to me. I would assume they either switched platforms or the webmaster put it on. It's standard practice to have a robots.txt. It really is a nothing burger. Way more interesting shit with SH. I recommend Aryan Empires youtube channel.

       the media conspired to brainwash the public into thinking a lone gunman drill known as the ‘Sandy Hook Massacre’ was real, when in fact it was a staged FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] National Level Exercise Event.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Shanley pointed to two of the main documents he includes in his lawsuit.
      </p>
      <p>
       “One is the photo that was on the front page of all the newspapers, magazines and on every TV channel,” explained Shanley. “Everyone has seen this picture of a dozen or so children supposedly being evacuated from Sandy Hook School. The children are shown walking single file in a parking lot with their hands on each other’s shoulder while a policewoman is guiding them. Have you seen that picture? Everyone has seen that picture. But guess what? That picture was completely staged by Shannon Hick of The Newtown Bee. It wasn’t even taken on that day. You can tell that the children are not even wearing winter clothes and there is no frost on the ground as there was on December 14. Not a single child is wearing any winter clothes, not even one coat or jacket. That’s because the photo was taken either on November 12 or on October 17 during a drill conducted at Sandy Hook. Other panned out pictures of this photo-op event show that only these 10 to 15 kids are on the scene along with other bystanders. Where are the other 585 children?”
      </p>
      <p>
       Shanley said the other evidence he has is the video footage from the dash cams in the police cars that showed up at Sandy Hook School that morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The cameras have a running time stamp starting from 9:37 a.m. and running till 12:49 p.m. and show the entire school and parking lot, yet they show absolutely no evacuation activity taking place that morning, nor do they record purported evacuation activity at specific times as recorded in the official Sandy Hook report,” he said. “In at least 36 documented instances, the evacuation activity events reported on the official Sandy Hook report are not reflected in any of the three dash cams pointed at the specific direction of the school building cited in the report.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The iconic picture of the children being evacuated was allegedly taken at 10:16 a.m. on December 14, 2012. Once again, there is no such activity recorded by any of the three dash cams, which scoped the entire school and parking lot. Aerial video footage taken of the school grounds by news helicopters also do not show any evacuation activity.

      <p>
       Perhaps because they didn't have time to get bundled up before evacuating. Or maybe they were separated from the area where their coats were. Is it also strange to you that they didn't pack up their backpacks full of homework before evacuating during an active shooting? It was 40 degrees outside at the time of the evacuation, it's not like these kids would have been dying of cold. Also, not likely there would have been a frost considering it was late in the morning on a relatively warm day. Is it really easier for you to believe this was staged than to believe that a truly terrible thing happened that day? Maybe you should look inside yourself and ask why that is.

       It was 34 degrees. That's almost freezing. Yes they would have grabbed coats. The people of sandy hook just walked around in circles. At 32 degrees I would be freezing my ass off.

       Maybe you guys are just so tough you think children with no winter wear on at near 32 degrees is normal? Me personally I would freeze my ass off at 32 no coat, etc. It is odd. You have time for a photo op, but not put on a coat?

       Don't try to infringe on my free speech with such a lame attempt to silence me. Why are you mad at me? I never attacked any parents. The way they "acted" after this event made them get the attention themselves. I know if my child was gunned down the day before I wouldn't have a shit eating grin on my face. Laughing it up.

       Which part of "nobody is preventing you from expressing your opinion" is hard for you understand? Perhaps it's the part where you seem to think you can say whatever you want without being criticized for it.

       You don't know how you would react. Nobody does until they actually experience something like having a loved one dying suddenly. Especially if that loved one was murdered. Those people you think are laughing it up are in shock and are trying to cope as best they can.

       What the hell are you talking about? The American people aren't stupid. We know what's going on, and you can say everything is just a damn coincidence about everything in the world. These parents did the worst acting job ever. Not one real tear for their children shot dead the day before. How do you explain Robbie Parker laughing it up with the cops , and then switches. to act job when he realizes the cameras rolling. It is a joke. Show me a real dead body. You can't cause it's fake as hell.

       If the city already knew in 2008 that the school was contaminated with asbestos and, in 2013, used the contamination to justify tearing it down, why would the same asbestos-contaminated school be safe for children and teachers to inhabit from 2008 through 2012? If SHES had remained open, wouldn’t the school district be sued for endangering public health?

       The school wasn't closed. It was still open and funded before the shooting. It was also staffed.

       And no, a school does not have to be closed if asbestos is in the building.

       On October 5, 2013, nearly 10 months after the massacre, a city referendum passed by over 90% in support of the demolition and rebuilding of SHES with a generous $49.25 million grant from the State of Connecticut. The reason given for the demolition was “asbestos abatement”. On Dec. 2, 2013, Newtown’s Public Building and Site Commission Chairman Robert Mitchell issued a report to justify the already-approved demolition. He said that “had the town decided to reoccupy the school on Dickinson Drive, it would have faced a daunting and possibly insurmountable challenge regarding the presence of hazardous materials” because the school was contaminated by not just asbestos, but also PCBs under the flooring and in the foundations and footings.

       the media conspired to brainwash the public into thinking a lone gunman drill known as the ‘Sandy Hook Massacre’ was real, when in fact it was a staged FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] National Level Exercise Event.”
Shanley pointed to two of the main documents he includes in his lawsuit.
“One is the photo that was on the front page of all the newspapers, magazines and on every TV channel,” explained Shanley. “Everyone has seen this picture of a dozen or so children supposedly being evacuated from Sandy Hook School. The children are shown walking single file in a parking lot with their hands on each other’s shoulder while a policewoman is guiding them. Have you seen that picture? Everyone has seen that picture. But guess what? That picture was completely staged by Shannon Hick of The Newtown Bee. It wasn’t even taken on that day. You can tell that the children are not even wearing winter clothes and there is no frost on the ground as there was on December 14. Not a single child is wearing any winter clothes, not even one coat or jacket. That’s because the photo was taken either on November 12 or on October 17 during a drill conducted at Sandy Hook. Other panned out pictures of this photo-op event show that only these 10 to 15 kids are on the scene along with other bystanders. Where are the other 585 children?”
Shanley said the other evidence he has is the video footage from the dash cams in the police cars that showed up at Sandy Hook School that morning.
“The cameras have a running time stamp starting from 9:37 a.m. and running till 12:49 p.m. and show the entire school and parking lot, yet they show absolutely no evacuation activity taking place that morning, nor do they record purported evacuation activity at specific times as recorded in the official Sandy Hook report,” he said. “In at least 36 documented instances, the evacuation activity events reported on the official Sandy Hook report are not reflected in any of the three dash cams pointed at the specific direction of the school building cited in the report.”
The iconic picture of the children being evacuated was allegedly taken at 10:16 a.m. on December 14, 2012. Once again, there is no such activity recorded by any of the three dash cams, which scoped the entire school and parking lot. Aerial video footage taken of the school grounds by news helicopters also do not show any evacuation activity.

       The Moon landing was real, they faked some of the photos either because they were of a shitty quality and wouldn't create a big sense of nationalism out of a pixelated photograph (which would look, ironically, even
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       fake) or because there were structures there. But they did land on the moon, that's unquestionable (because of how easy it is to prove it).

       Yes I agree with your claim of 9-11, but that was a real false flag. It brought us to war in the middle East. The rest Sandy Hook, moon landings, etc. are merely HOAXES. 9-11 was an elaborate ceremony ushering in the NWO.

       Although I agree that the moon landings, Las Vegas , and Sandy Hook are HOAXES. My research shows. that 9/11 wasn't a hoax in the same sense. Although it had hoax qualities, buildings really did fall, and people died also from inhaling the chemicals in the air.

       My research shows(since the day it happened) that the planes , and most jumpers were CGI that people saw on TV. The explosives were pre-planted in the WTC by a group of Israeli explosives experts disguised as Israeli college students doing an art project. They closed entire floors for them, and they had a helicopter filming people in the WTC windows.  Gelatin-B was their name , and the "art project" was titled b-thing. Directed energy weapons actually took the buildings down, along with thermite demolition. The DEW was necessary to eliminate  75% of the missing rubble. For on the ground witness confirmation a hologram projection of a plane was used, U.S. Airforce airborne holographic projections, along with some of the jumpers even being holograms themselves. This was necessary for on the scene witness confirmation. The entire event was planned by the Pentagon , and the C.I.A. ,with Israeli intelligence  help.

       Thanks for your info.  There are always so many red herrings placed in these things it's hard to know what exactly went down.  All I know for sure is it's a massive deception and most of the world just buys the media narrative.  This means we are already in an Orwellian mind controlled society.  If you try to inform people they get viscerally angry.  Very sad.

       Are people actually arguing with visual evidence? 
 How do you refute jovial mourning parents? What about the signage advising everyone on site to check in? What about the towns previous ties to the military?
       <br/>
       If you don't feel comfortable with implausible conclusions, you can at least see something was odd about the entire incident.. to my understanding FOI requests for the death certificates are still denied.  Is that not odd?
It's the 5 year anniversary next week, should we expect another incident to go under-investigated?

       Thanks for the comment. It screams a drill.
Would ANY parents manage to get past the police at the bottom of the road, walk all the way up the drive, and stand around in a parking lot while SWAT was conducting room to room searches. Additionally, not a single vehicle would have been allowed to leave the parking lot for at least a full day.

       Is there a documentary, video or article with solid evidence you would recommend that should be watched by everyone with the anniversary on the way?
       <br/>
       I thought this was a legit false flag.. the response from the sub is telling me otherwise. If it happened as per all reports, why are people not rebutting with credible substance?

       Jim fetzer has a book about it. You can find him on YouTube . Everything he says about sandy hook, and ,911 are accurate, but not his JFK research.

       I don't believe his JFK theories at all. Why? Doesn't add up. I agree with most of his 9-11 claims though. People like him are gonna give you a lot of truth, and just enough lies to get you off track.

       You're not wrong, there are so many questions when it comes to Sandy Hook. That school was not in use, there was no internet activity and all the cars had expired tags. I can only speculate but I have my theories as to where those children actually went.

       Keep spreading the truth Brother! We need more people like us! Sandy Hook was a hoax, Orlando shooting was a hoax, Las Vegas shooting was a hoax, Boston Bombing was a hoax, moon landings, globe earth, Etc... the government loves hoaxes.

       I did all this about 6 months ago when it was pionted out to me. I would assume they either switched platforms or the webmaster put it on. It's standard practice to have a robots.txt. It really is a nothing burger. Way more interesting shit with SH. I recommend Aryan Empires youtube channel.

       It's pretty easy to tell it was all masonic propaganda like all these other hoaxes.  Combine that with the fact "outer space" isn't even real and case closed.

       My research shows(since the day it happened) that the planes , and most jumpers were CGI that people saw on TV. The explosives were pre-planted in the WTC by a group of Israeli explosives experts disguised as Israeli college students doing an art project. They closed entire floors for them, and they had a helicopter filming people in the WTC windows.  Gelatin-B was their name , and the "art project" was titled b-thing. Directed energy weapons actually took the buildings down, along with thermite demolition. The DEW was necessary to eliminate  75% of the missing rubble. For on the ground witness confirmation a hologram projection of a plane was used, U.S. Airforce airborne holographic projections, along with some of the jumpers even being holograms themselves. This was necessary for on the scene witness confirmation. The entire event was planned by the Pentagon , and the C.I.A. ,with Israeli intelligence  help.
