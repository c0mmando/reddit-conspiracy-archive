       TL;DR: Was a disease people talked about for the last 6-8 years, everyone (including myself, who loves reading peer reviewed papers) could not find any actual physical indication of an ailment. Further research has proven that there is actually a physical issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, people thought they had threads/bugs/tinglies under their skin, were told they were crazy because biopsies turned up nothing, turns out there is something actually happening. Basically.

       It means there is a metabolic issue occurring from the infectious process of the Borrelia spirochetal infection, the spirochetes (spirochetes are spiral prokaryotes that contain longer and more flexible cells which cause Lyme disease and syphilis.) are proof of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tinglies/bugs/threads/whatever are actually dermal filaments of keratine, and collagen, and are caused by activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in the epidermis. The spirochetes activated keratinocytes and fibroblasts to express keratin and collagen.

       Ok, thanks for the information - a new one to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am in IT mainly, so I don't really feel qualified to comment on a disease :) (though I do get periodicals from the CDC, but that is another issue).
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you seeing a coverup of certain things regarding this?
      </p>
      <p>
       that all said, and looking at your reply, I will say this (off the cuff):
      </p>
      <p>
       There are problems in our medical discussions (whether via media or otherwise) that highlight the problems with acceptance of those in the profession with certain things (like ignoring data, personal anecdotes, etc and so on).
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it your contention that this particular issue has been ignored, or glossed over, etc?

       Your hitting the head on all of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Morgellons started out as the "psycho disorder", only people who we considered crazy had it (Doesn't it sound odd that syphilis apparently makes you lose your mind and it is also a spirochetal infection?), and most western nation doctors considered it a joke, with it being ignored 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other countries, like Asian Countries and Europe, they didn't fuck around, they provided these people with psychological support because they knew something was going on, like 90% of morgellon sufferers are hospitalized in a psych ward, this number is too high and in itself proves that there is something else occurring.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is now taboo to discuss in western nations as its considered the "boogyman" of diseases, when it should be seen as a chance to advance our understanding of what our enviroment/diets/lives are doing to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, was the "cry wolf" disease, seems to be real, people are afraid to get involved because it was the "fake" disease.

       Ok, now that is good stuff :)
      </p>
      <p>
       This all harkens back to Thomas Szasz and his theories on Psychiatry (
       <a href="http://www.szasz.com/">
        http://www.szasz.com/
       </a>
       ) and no, I don't agree with everything he says :)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the idea is that those in power get decide who is crazy, based on their own ideals of what is normal and not. I think that plays into what you are getting to with this.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that, in a roundabout way, gets into conspiracies :) Especially here in the US (as you noted, this was treated differently elsewhere - different power structure, different results).
      </p>
      <p>
       This, IMHO, boils down into prejudice and social structure (defined by those in power and what they see as worthy vs not worthy and so on).
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have enough information on this topic to really get into it all but will check it out more in the coming months (got a lot going on starting in a few days so will be busy).

       You got it though, you understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its basically that it was not a normal condition that medical professionals learn about, or many patients with these conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidentally, most people who have this psychiatric breakdown caused by morgellons is understandable from the point of view of an illness sufferer being ignored, and also gives a tip-of-the-hat to Syphilis, which coincidentally does the same thing, which is coincidentally also a spirochetal infection, and the Borrelia spirochetes suggest lyme disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want my theory: Lyme disease is one of the infections caused by Borrelia spirochetes, but there is likely another metabolic route that the presence of spirochetes activated keratinocytes and fibroblasts to express keratin and collagen take that causes Morgellons. But who knows.

       And that is my problem with some professions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Led by a few that ignore the many over biases. I don't know how many times I have been to a doctor myself where they have ignored things I told them and insisted that I was 'off my rocker'. Only to find out later, through blood tests/etc that I knew what I was talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       To look at this more in depth, think about it like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       You get accused of a crime. If you have a good attorney (you are wealthy) you can get a better defense and people to listen to you and hear your side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now imagine you are poor and go to a doctor and tell them what you know. They just chalk it up to xyz when you know your body and researched things and feel it is abc. If you have a lot of money and see a doctor they will get you more tests, more specialists and listen to you more.
      </p>
      <p>
       The medical field, law, politics, are all the same in this regards - the few will tell the many one thing while listening in a different way to the wealthy. And that goes back to your topic and how it is handled (as it did with agent orange, aids, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       Always question, always keep fighting - because if history shows us anything it is that those with power and money ignore a great deal of things. To the detriment of us all.

       This is the best way to explain it. I wasn’t buying it reading the medical terms for it.  After reading this it makes total sense and I agree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people are apprehensive because it is easy to trick people by using a lot of long buzz words and sounding smart. But in this case you actually know what you are talking about, and understand it so well that you assume that we all understand what the terminology all means (I find myself doing this often)

       I need to say something I have previously already stated, I did not believe Morgellons was real either. I submitted a response to a thread in regards to various bacterial/viral infections and he was asking about it, I remember reading up about it in the past but there was NOTHING conclusive and I did not have access to the peer reviewed papers I have now.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I started reading I found things that connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you go to when I first started these threads, everything is in roughly 3-10 peer reviewed articles, and using these articles, I was able to construct what exactly the virus is, and what it
       <strong>
        SEEMS
       </strong>
       to be doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not fully understand at all, and in regards to the type of infection it is, it should have further stages, but this raises another question, is it already in a further stage once collagen and keratin begin being produced in the epidermis? Who knows, we don't know.

       TL;DR: Morgellons Disease seems to be caused by a spirochetal infection, and the filaments detected in the cases were found to have a collagen component, and contain melanin pigment, suggesting that the presence of spirochetes activated keratinocytes and fibroblasts to express keratin and collagen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Morgellons Disease is a true somatic illness associated with Borrelia spirochetes that cause Lyme disease.

       God damn it, dont do it man, its scary haha. Last time I read about it i came across a video that said if you get a ‘sensation’ through your body if you listen to this, you got the decease, apparently morgelions didnt like that particular vibration. Didnt listen to that shit, got shivers just thinking about it. Imma just change my diet, live healthy and if i die i die, not knowing about those pesky morgelions

       Its a spirochetal infection of sometype, that creates Spirochetes just like Lyme disease, causes the mental breakdown of someone with Syphilis, (coincidental that they are all spirochetal infections). It has nothing to do with additives, diets, carcinogens, etc, it has to do with a viral spirochetal infection that doesn't work the way normal spirochetal infections that we know of work.

       I have never met anyone who has it. I have seen a couple of documentaries but all have been very biased and seem to outright accuse the patients of being mentally ill. There is so little in the way of good research available I cant form an opinion. One thing I can say, howver, is the people who suffer from whatever it is live an existence as close to hell as I have seen.

       I do think there is a tendency for any disease that the pharmaceutical industry doesnt have a cure or panacea for to be derided as fake. That by itself is enough for me to believe there should be legitimate research into the disease.

       So basically, everyone thought the disease was made up, but it turns out that a certain type of bacteria (spyrochete) stimulates skin cells to produce more keratin and collagen, making the host itchy and uncomfortable?

       I had never really heard of this disease until now. I saw you mentioned something about Lyme disease and it being man-made, and that maybe Morgellon's disease is as well?

      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Clarity
       </strong>
       : spirochetal infections are like Lyme disease, syphilis, yaws, etc, lyme disease creates Spirochetes (Borrelia burgdorferi is what is important here, and its the only causative agent for Lyme disease in the United States.), the presence of these Borrelia spirochetes indicate a spirochetal infection, the mental breakdown caused by Morgellons seems to be consistent with Syphilis, and the physical feeling of fatigue seems to also be consistent with Lyme disease, but Borellia spirochetes being present in the skin/epidermic seems to cause the activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Dermal filaments are real, they may not be threads like some people have stated, but it is technically filaments of keratin and collagen. I still can't find any information how the spirochetes being present cause activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, but it likely has to do with chemicals the virus is spewing out or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, its a true condition, we now know this, but there are still lots of questions, and before we can figure that out, it can no longer be taboo to speak about Morgellons. This is also something good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowing its a spirochetal infection, with spirochetes being present, we know things about to, so if someone was to claim to have it, one day we should be able to simply prove that there is either spirochetes present/or a spirochetal infection, or if there are the normally characterized filaments, or if there is proof of excess activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts (the filaments would be enough proof of this though).

       I wonder why the Borrelia don't get to the nervous system and cause Lyme disease in cases of Morgellons. Maybe it needs to enter the bloodstream? But if its in the skin, you'd think it would eventually get into the bloodstream one way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I've never heard the theory that this bacteria was man-made. Do you believe that to be the case?

       Yes, was likely created alongside lyme, or is lyme disease expressing itself differently, or the body quarantines it and tricks it into thinking its infecting cells when its really just causing collagen and keratin production in the epidermis.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really doesn't matter if it was created at this point though, its here, thats all that matters, we need to find out the vector, where is the largest cluster of infections occurring? We need to be able to diagnose, are filaments present proving spirochetes are causing activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts? Are Spirochetes pressent? What is the reason these Spirochetes are activating keratinocytes and fibroblasts instead of traveling to the heart, bones and the nervous system?

       Worrying about how something was made means nothing, it gives us no control over the situation.

       And I just read about how THC and CBD can stimulate apoptosis in some cancer cells via the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. Interestingly, it does that specifically in transformed cells, and seems to actually protect non-transformed cells.

       Delusional parasitosis.  My wife was suffering from delusional parasitosis, she was spending more and more time picking off things fro her hands and skin and putting it on tape... looking for something like a crazy person. Finally we figured out that the dog had gone in the insulation on the attic, and had tiny filaments of fiberglass on her fur and getting in the bed.

       TL;DR: Morgellons Disease seems to be caused by a spirochetal infection, and the filaments detected in the cases were found to have a collagen component, and contain melanin pigment, suggesting that the presence of spirochetes activated keratinocytes and fibroblasts to express keratin and collagen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Morgellons Disease is a true somatic illness associated with Borrelia spirochetes that cause Lyme disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       "imaging from representative Morgellons disease samples revealing that dermal filaments in these cases are keratin and collagen in composition and result from proliferation and activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in the epidermis. Spirochetes were detected in the dermatological specimens from our study patients, providing evidence that Morgellons disease is associated with an infectious process."
      </p>
      <p>
       I present all this information based upon peer reviewed articles, and the identification of keratin and collagen literally has pictures provided within the peer reviewed article.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its a spirochetal infection of sometype, that creates Spirochetes just like Lyme disease, causes the mental breakdown of someone with Syphilis, (coincidental that they are all spirochetal infections). It has nothing to do with additives, diets, carcinogens, etc, it has to do with a viral spirochetal infection that doesn't work the way normal spirochetal infections that we know of work.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really care, go get your wife checked for Borrelia spirochetes, and then get a biopsy that searched for keratin and collagen specifically. If both are found to be present with the epidermis, then there is a likely chance she has Morgellons, a spirochetal infection.

       I met a guy back in 2004 that told me about this illness he had. He showed me all these fibers that he'd collected. Some came from sores and some that he said would wriggle right out of his skin. He described how he could feel them crawling under his skin and the only way to stop the sensation was to "wreck em"...which involved taking the point of his knife and literally jabbing it into his skin directly in front of where he felt the fibers. He did this in front of me and proceeded to pull a fiber approximately one half inch long out of the cut he made. I left thinking he was one of the most batshit crazy people I've ever met.
I read about morgellons a year or so later.

       The thing that catches me about what you have said is:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He did this in front of me and proceeded to pull a fiber approximately one half inch long out of the cut he made.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Most of them are between 1-15 microns, to find one that is a half inch means it is progressing as spirochetal infections do, like Lyme, Yaws, Syphilis, these all have 2 or more stages. Morgellons disease isn't fully understood or even properly discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want my opinion, with everything I present, it seems we have found the mid point, when the Borrelia spirochetes actually starts causing the keratinocytes and fibroblasts to overproduce keratin and collagen filaments in the epidermis. We don't know why the Borrelia spirochetes are there, its commonly associated with Lyme disease and is the only known causative agent of it in the United States. Why is the present of Borrelia even causing the keratinocytes and fibroblasts to produce keratin and collagen in the epidermis? If someone is able to pull out a half inch strand, that means it has likely progressed seriously enough for them to identify the filament location and physically remove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not a professional (I wish I was, I could be if I had the opportunity), but this is a crucial time in our understanding of morgellons, if we write this disease off as "phony" when there is clear evidence of its existence in multiple peer reviewed papers, then we are literally preventing furthering our understanding of biology.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't lie, there is probably a scientist who specializes in spirochetal infections that will get totally excited by this.

       My mom claims to have it and it has driven our entire family insane. She now believes that it is living outside of her body and growing in “nests” in all of her things. She sends me photos of what looks like mushed up food, garbage, cat hairballs, etc. claiming it’s morgellons. It’s really upsetting.

       If there are no signs of Borrelia spirochetal infection, then its a psychiatric disorder, I personally would not know how someone would go through with this, but it is 100% a real condition, its common in cattle and goes by Bovine Digital Dermatitis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The common trait is basically systematic spirochetal infection by Borrelia Burgdorferi.
