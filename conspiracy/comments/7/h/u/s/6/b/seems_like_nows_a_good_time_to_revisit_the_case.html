    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Charles Upham, the father of Misty Upham, the Hollywood actress known for her roles in August: Osage County and Django Unchained, spoke out recently about the alleged rape of his daughter and the horrifying problem that is Hollywood sexual abuse.</p>

<p>Charles noted that although Hollywood found a “poster boy” in Weinstein to “ease the conscience of high society for a while,” that the problem is persistent and “not an isolated incident.”</p>

<p>“This is an institutional problem that exists in in many Organizations and Corporate America including Religious Orders, Law Enforcement, Politics, Education, Federal, State and local Governments,” wrote Upham in a bombshell Facebook post. “The victims are not just women; they include men, elderly, mentally ill, children (male and female) of all races and even some animals.”</p>

<p>Upham went on to explain how his own daughter fell victim to this abuse and it happened as Hollywood’s elite cheered it on as if it “were a beer drinking contest.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;My daughter, Misty Upham, was a victim of rape by a Weinstein Executive in 2013 at the Golden Globe Awards. The rapist forced her into the men’s room and had his way while other men in formal wear cheered him on as if he were chugging a beer in a contest. As Misty made the walk of shame back to the event, the Exec was given high fives, bragging rights and another notch in his Weinstein Co. belt. What should have been an auspicious occasion for Misty turned into a nightmare of pain, humiliation, fear and anxiety.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p> Her mom and I pleaded with her to press charges since she still has the torn green dress she wore with the DNA all over it. Misty was afraid to pursue charges because she knew Harvey Weinstein could protect his constituency and ruin her existence.</p>

<p>Misty was not only worried about her career but she was worried about actual physical harm that may come to her for speaking out against Weinstein.</p>

<p>Misty’s experience with Harvey Weinstein left her with the impression that he was a powerful man with many influential connections and could make people disappear. Once while riding in a limo with Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Weinstein and his assistant, somewhere between Salt Lake City and Park City, Utah, the assistant interrupted Weinstein and Tarantino’s conversation in a matter of urgent business; at which point Harvey Weinstein ordered the driver to stop and subsequently kicked his assistant out of the car in the middle of no where during a snow storm amidst subzero temperatures. Misty commented, “What if he freezes to death?” Weinstein retorted “ Somebody will come along and pick him up!”</p>

<p>Indeed, a year after the alleged rape at the Golden Globe Awards, Misty Upham “disappeared.” On October 5, the Django Unchained actress went missing from her Auburn home. On October 16, friends and family searching for Misty found her body in a ravine near the White River, about 30 miles south of Seattle.</p>

<p>The medical examiner ruled her cause of death due to blunt force injuries to her head and torso.</p>

<p>After being brutally raped at the Golden Globe Awards, Hollywood actress Misty Upham went missing and found over a week later, having died from falling off a cliff.</p>

<p>Charles Upham, the father of Misty Upham, the Hollywood actress known for her roles in August: Osage County and Django Unchained, spoke out recently about the alleged rape of his daughter and the horrifying problem that is Hollywood sexual abuse.</p>

<p>Charles noted that although Hollywood found a “poster boy” in Weinstein to “ease the conscience of high society for a while,” that the problem is persistent and “not an isolated incident.”</p>

<p>“This is an institutional problem that exists in in many Organizations and Corporate America including Religious Orders, Law Enforcement, Politics, Education, Federal, State and local Governments,” wrote Upham in a bombshell Facebook post. “The victims are not just women; they include men, elderly, mentally ill, children (male and female) of all races and even some animals.”</p>

<p>Upham went on to explain how his own daughter fell victim to this abuse and it happened as Hollywood’s elite cheered it on as if it “were a beer drinking contest.”</p>

<p>&quot;My daughter, Misty Upham, was a victim of rape by a Weinstein Executive in 2013 at the Golden Globe Awards. The rapist forced her into the men’s room and had his way while other men in formal wear cheered him on as if he were chugging a beer in a contest. As Misty made the walk of shame back to the event, the Exec was given high fives, bragging rights and another notch in his Weinstein Co. belt. What should have been an auspicious occasion for Misty turned into a nightmare of pain, humiliation, fear and anxiety.&quot;</p>

<p>After her rape, Upham explained how he and Misty’s mom pleaded with her to press charges. However, Misty was petrified of doing so.</p>

<p>In a shocking revelation, Charles noted that they have DNA evidence of the crime.</p>

<p>&quot;Her mom and I pleaded with her to press charges since she still has the torn green dress she wore with the DNA all over it. Misty was afraid to pursue charges because she knew Harvey Weinstein could protect his constituency and ruin her existence.</p>

<p>Misty was not only worried about her career but she was worried about actual physical harm that may come to her for speaking out against Weinstein.</p>

<p>Misty’s experience with Harvey Weinstein left her with the impression that he was a powerful man with many influential connections and could make people disappear. Once while riding in a limo with Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Weinstein and his assistant, somewhere between Salt Lake City and Park City, Utah, the assistant interrupted Weinstein and Tarantino’s conversation in a matter of urgent business; at which point Harvey Weinstein ordered the driver to stop and subsequently kicked his assistant out of the car in the middle of no where during a snow storm amidst subzero temperatures. Misty commented, “What if he freezes to death?” Weinstein retorted “ Somebody will come along and pick him up!”</p>

<p>Indeed, a year after the alleged rape at the Golden Globe Awards, Misty Upham “disappeared.” On October 5, the Django Unchained actress went missing from her Auburn home. On October 16, friends and family searching for Misty found her body in a ravine near the White River, about 30 miles south of Seattle.</p>

<p>The medical examiner ruled her cause of death due to blunt force injuries to her head and torso.</p>

<p>After she died in 2014, police said her death was caused by a fall and they do not know what happened. Her father immediately noted that it was not suicide, however.</p>

<p>“She has said suicidal things in the past but never followed through,” he said at the time. “She doesn’t believe in killing herself. She believes that is a sin and she would never do that.”</p>

<p>Mysteriously enough, as the Daily Mail reported, in the days after the discovery of Misty’s body, her family came out with claims that the 32-year-old woman fell to her death by accident while running away from police. Upham’s parents alleged that the Native American actress had been mistreated and that the Auburn Police Department did not take her disappearance seriously.</p>

<p>Charles noted specific examples of how Misty was abused at the hands of the police.</p>

<p>“Misty was afraid of the Auburn PD officers with good reason. In an incident prior to her disappearance, the Auburn PD came to pick up Misty on an involuntary transport to the ER.</p>

<p>“She was cuffed and placed in a police car. Some of the officers began to taunt and tease her while she was in the car.</p>

<p>“Because it was dark they couldn’t see that we, her family, were outside our apartment just across the street witnessing this behavior.</p>

<p>“They were tapping on the window making faces at her. Misty was crying and she told them ‘you can’t treat me like this I’m a movie actress and I will use my connections to expose </p>

<p>“Then another officer walked up to her asked ‘are you a movie star? Then why don’t complain to George Clooney!&#39;”</p>

<p>As TFTP reported earlier this month, Harvey Weinstein reportedly employed ex-Mossad agents to track, intimidate, and otherwise silence his victims and journalists who were going to expose his alleged abusive behavior. Could he have used these same connections and had a hand in Misty ‘falling’ off this cliff?</p>

<p>To this date, the official report from the medical examiner is that  “the manner of her death – whether by foul play, suicide or accident – could not be determined.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. That there are two starkly contrasting/conflucting versions of events is almost the definition of a cover-up. The fact that her death was <em>intially</em> reported as &quot;accidental death&quot; in no way negates the allegation that she was raped and then killed to be silenced. The case needs reopening and looking at again, is all I&#39;m saying  </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t heard of this before tonight. It&#39;s just ridiculous that countless people have stories where they TELL that the elite have systematic ways to exploit the masses. It&#39;s not a coincidence that she was involved in Hollywood, it&#39;s not a coincidence that the Dad (and others) NEVER give the whole story, and never name names. </p>

<p>The masses need these stories to realize the manipulation that is happening politically, economically, socially, intellectually, and culturally. The sheeple won&#39;t wake up without help. Speak up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was the first way her death was covered, and should show you the extent to which deaths like this <em>are</em> covered up. There are 2, co-existing timelines - one where Misty was a &#39;depressive&#39; and &#39;in trouble with the local cops a lot&#39;, went out walking at 2am and fell off a cliff &#39;she didn&#39;t see&#39;. There&#39;s another timeline where she is raped, tried to report it, the report is shelved and she is harassed for reporting it, then murdered because she won&#39;t shut up. The fact that this interview with her father pre-dates his subsequent one where he alleges rape and murder, is entirely consistent with a sophisticated cover-up operation... Just needs looking at again, is all I&#39;m saying  </p>

<p>Regardless of whodunnit on the Weinstein team, that doesn&#39;t change the fact her death is very suspicious and the police department was negligent, refusing to consider her a missing person, which could mean a coverup happened. It should be investigated at the least.</p>

<p>She had &#39;been in trouble&#39; with the local (reservation?) police 5 times - possibly die to reporting it in the first place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes she was. The facebook post in which her father alleges Misty was raped and imploes she may have been murdered in it&#39;s entirety :</p>

<p>&quot;The recent backlash with regard to Harvey Weinstein’s sexual allegations is blowing up like a NAPA Valley firestorm leaving a trail of victims in its wake. The smoke of this scandal can be seen through out the entertainment industry as many Hollywood insiders release a collective gasp. (Like you didn’t know this was going on!) The only thing bigger than the Weinstein media apocalypse is the hypocrisy that existed since the 1890’s when the casting couch, I mean movie camera was invented. Sure you now have found a sexual harassment poster boy in Weinstein that we can martyr to will ease the conscience of high society for a while. But this is not an isolated incident! This is an institutional problem that exists in in many Organizations and Corporate America including Religious Orders, Law Enforcement, Politics, Education, Federal, State and local Governments. The victims are not just women; they include men, elderly, mentally ill, children (male and female) of all races and even some animals. </p>

<p>My daughter, Misty Upham, was a victim of rape by a Weinstein Executive in 2013 at the Golden Globe Awards.  The rapist forced her into the men’s room and had his way while other men in formal wear cheered him on as if he were chugging a beer in a contest. As Misty made the walk of shame back to the event, the Exec was given high fives, bragging rights and another notch in his Weinstein Co. belt. What should have been an auspicious occasion for Misty turned into a nightmare of pain, humiliation, fear and anxiety? Her mom and I pleaded with her to press charges since she still has the torn green dress she wore (Photo Above) with the DNA all over it. Misty was afraid to pursue charges because she knew Harvey Weinstein could protect his constituency and ruin her existence. Misty’s experience with Harvey Weinstein left her with the impression that he was a powerful man with many influential connections and could make people disappear. Once while riding in a limo with Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Weinstein and his assistant, somewhere between Salt Lake City and Park City, Utah, the assistant interrupted Weinstein and Tarantino’s conversation in a matter of urgent business; at which point Harvey Weinstein ordered the driver to stop and subsequently kicked his assistant out of the car in the middle of no where during a snow storm amidst subzero temperatures. Misty commented, “What if he freezes to death?” Weinstein retorted “ Somebody will come along and pick him up!” How could anyone expect a sincere investigation when the Weinstein’s company commander and chief is also a perpetrator? Misty said to me “Dad, every time a rape victim comes forward to get justice they become the cause of the matter!” This was not the first time Misty was raped and harassed by an Executive/Producer/Director/Actor etc. And you know who you are!</p>

<p>How many times have you heard the defense say things like: “She slept around with everyone.” or “She was smiling and flirting while being accosted!” or “She was dressed like a slut!” and “She knew what she was getting into but left with him anyway!” All of a sudden the rape victim become the blame in everyone’s eyes. This has been the trend now amongst Police Officers, Judges, Defenders even Prosecutors and witnesses alike. The rapist is not just a man thing either; this exercise of empowerment exists among every gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation and social class. The characteristic traits of these criminals are usually recognizable from childhood: A Bully, Socially Enabled, Possesses a Sense of Entitlement and Justified by partisan social circles.  Sounds a lot like MANIFEST DESTINY (Google It).  In many cases the crime becomes a matter of opinion and the rapist becomes the victim. It is no surprise that many rape victims stay silent. Most victims don’t report such crimes because they believe nothing will be done.</p>

<p>In the course of time the majority of the genders has developed a natural affection for the opposite sex or the same sex. In the ritual of courtship you may find yourself attending to your esthetic qualities in order to attract you mate. If this includes dressing provocatively, wearing makeup, flirting or even participating in a conversation that could lead to consummation. So what! That&#39;s what people do! But nowhere in that ritual has the implied meaning been embedded that rape is ok. No means no! People are looking for a lasting relationship that is founded in love, trust and affection. Do you think a woman or her parents would want to have a relationship and have children with a person who raped her? Or would any parent brag on the fact that their child was best rapist in the family? </p>

<p>If Harvey Weinstein has become the poster boy of Sexual Harassment among the rich and powerful then Native American Women should exemplify the most disregarded rape victims in the Americas. According to the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA) Indigenous Women have the highest rates of uninvestigated violent sex and abuse crimes among women per capita. Federal government studies have consistently shown that American Indian women experience much higher levels of sexual violence than other women in the U.S. Data gathered by the U.S. Department of Justice indicates that Native American and Alaskan Native women are more than 2.5 times more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted than women in the USA in general. First Nations women in Canada and Native American women in Border States like Minnesota and North Dakota have become the targets of commercial sex trade with little or no intervention from law enforcement. An intrinsic effort on the part of victims and advocacy groups was necessary to raise awareness so that Judicial, Legislative bodies and Politicians would be shamed into action on the behalf of the Native communities.</p>

<p>I know there are many people that will turn a blind eye, wallow in apathy or even entertain the thought of joining the ranks of sex abusers. Before you do I hope you recognize the emotional harm, life long pain and humiliation that these type of crimes bring to their victims; before you have to learn your lesson by experiencing the same type of abuse in some prison cell yourself.&quot;</p>
