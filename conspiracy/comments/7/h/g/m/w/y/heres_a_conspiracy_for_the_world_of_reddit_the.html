    <div class="md"><p>The thing with the wmd is it was a plausible reason. We know Iraq had wmd&#39;s. They used chemical weapons on the Kurds in the 80s. </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t suddenly get rid of them no matter what news source you see saying that. We actually found one of their bunkers that was loaded with chemical munitions. The issue that no one would have really been able to know is that the weapons were degraded beyond their ability to he used effectively. We thought so little of what we found we left it unsecured for months before putting some bodies on it.</p>

<p>Iran also gave insurgents chemical weapons. My unit found caches that contained at least 3 chemical tipped artillery rounds 5 or 6 times in 06. </p>

<p>But we should have never used the word of one dude as justification for going to war. Especially a dude known to intelligence agencies to give misleading or outright false information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the flip side that requires all politicians to have been ok with fighting a war overseas in the first place. Should the congress really be filled with people who thought signing up to go fight people in Iraq was a good or moral idea?</p>

<p>There are many veterans who come out of service anti-war, having changed their perspective. But there are also many (I would bet even more) who don&#39;t. I know tons of families where all the men join the military, generation after generation.</p>

<p>I know most people join the military with good intentions and I don&#39;t disrespect anyone who does join, despite our different outlooks, but I think it is a really bad idea to stop people who already had an anti-war, anti-imperialism outlook who didn&#39;t join the military because they thought it was wrong from entering congress</p>

<p>You can&#39;t spread quotes around with no proof they said it and defend it as &quot;well he never denied it.&quot; It&#39;s nobody&#39;s duty to hunt around the internet for fake quotes and then refute them publicly. Maybe find a case of someone asking him if he said it, and him refusing to confirm or deny, then I&#39;d listen.</p>

<p>Kissinger is more eloquent than that. I can imagine him saying cynical and cruel things about military men, but &quot;Military men are just dumb, stupid animals to be used as pawns in foreign policy.&quot; just sounds like a parody of Kissinger&#39;s public persona put into words by someone who is extremely inarticulate compared to him.</p>

<p>Coldly has nothing to do with eloquence, nor does plainness. Eloquence isn&#39;t about using fancy words or sweeping metaphors, it&#39;s about cadence and brevity. </p>

<p>I never once said he had compassion. I spoke of his manner of speaking. I never once questioned Kissinger might <em>think</em> this way, but his style of speaking is another matter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I come from such a military family, they were in the air force or marines since WWI on my dad&#39;s side. They all think the iraq war wasn&#39;t faught hard enough, we should have just nuked them like we did in Japan to stop the terrorists from attacking America again (funny how the US didn&#39;t suffer a single attack since Pearl Harbor, funny how 9/11 was called the next Pearl Harbor and we didn&#39;t suffer a single attack since then, and the countries we invade want to establish their own banks). I&#39;m
not being hyperbolic either, my dad probably secretly jacks off to thoughts of George Bush beheading Osama so I admit I&#39;m biased.</p>

<p>Then again you can&#39;t seriously tell me they don&#39;t know what the military is about just because they are brainwashed at a young age. It&#39;s a death cult obsessed with murder and destruction and the vets join for benefits, benefits that = $$$$. Blood can be worth it&#39;s weight in gold.

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that I have a bias but the people who join the military understand that they can be commanded to kill a target that they do not know. I&#39;m not going to argue under the supposition that they were just good boys who didn&#39;t know what they were singing up for. </p>

<p>You want to hear the gayest shit in the world? When I was 11 and played Medal of Honor Allied Assualt on the PS2, and half way through the game during a mission in the bombed out city I started crying because I couldn&#39;t understand how this could be based in reality. I still played and beat the game because it was fun and videogames doesn&#39;t real but every image and story in media and in the stories told by veterans is essentially a violent conflict where one guy kills the other. They never know each other&#39;s name.</p>

<p>My point is that to say the military engages in violence and I question the mental facilities of individuals who wish to engage in said violence upon, once again, people that they do not know.  Maybe it would be a different story if we weren&#39;t historically the invaders in damn near literally every conflict since this nations existence (and don&#39;t worry I&#39;m not a buyer of the natives dindu stories of the noble Savage.) </p>

<p>That&#39;s my position and I don&#39;t like the idea of my taxes going towards individuals whom have no hesitation in wasting literally trillions of dollars on wartime engagements that don&#39;t even benefit the nation as a whole and just the shareholders and business owner&#39;s of the drug and weapons manufacturer and trafficking companies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. I saw his many civilian causalities there were. I realized due to being my teams interpreter and  interacting with the Iraqis that they were mostly just like us. Most were good people who just wanted to take care of their families abd be in peace. The average Iraqi wiped their ass with their hands and didn&#39;t have internet but knew more about US foreign policy than the average American. That was eye opening. They all knew any hard towards America was due to our support of Israel. Between that and seeing many good young men die or get injured in both sides then just get discarded lime they meant nothing. I also saw how the CIA had its fingers in literally everything.  I saw ways we could help the Iraqis and bring an end to conflict but or hands were tied by political affiliations and or higher ups ignoring or ideas.

    <div class="md"><p>Youre holding it against him that he wants to live in a nice suburb, close to work with great schools for his kids. Are you serious. This tax plan hurts people that live in blue states that actually work well for their residents without getting fucked by the federal government because rich people want tax breaks on their massive income. Pass through incoming being dropped to 20% is a fuckin joke. That&#39;s the biggest give away I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. That&#39;s the biggest give away my FATHER has seen in his life and he gets his entire income from pass through. Even my dad who is standing to gain nearly 200k a year extra from this is flat out shocked. I called him and he&#39;s at a loss for words. Depending on how this hits the middle class people who normally spend their tax refunds on non essential large purchases it&#39;s going to fuck up the economy big time. How many people do you know suddenly get car repairs, new tv&#39;s new everything around tax refund time. The answer is fuckin everyone. Think that&#39;s gonna happen if everyone is getting a few grand less? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people join the service out of a sense of duty to their country without realizing what they are really doing. I spent 15 years in the military and if I had to do it all over again knowing what I know now there is no way in hell I could, but at the time I didn&#39;t understand and I thought I was doing the right thing as did most of the people that were there with me. I can always appreciate peoples willingness to sacrifice at that level regardless whether I agree with the outcome of that service or not. That is why I thank people for their service. Maybe I am wrong and most people do it because they want to kill people in other countries for no reason and serve their government but that hasn&#39;t been my experience with 95% of the military I have come across. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, yeah it’s a brazen money grab before they potentially lose power. Corporate tax cuts have never resulted in higher wages. The GOP knows our current economic situation is unsustainable so they’re shifting the baseline further and further in anticipation of the inevitable correction which <em>will</em> be preceded by a deep recession/depression that they will also use to further consolidate wealth) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-21/republican-presidents-and-recessions-a-pattern-trump-would-like-to-break">Republican economic policy results in recessions</a>. </p>

<p>Recessions make it hard to raise taxes. Recessions keep interest rates and inflation low. Recessions make it easy to gut and privatize entitlements public services. Recessions that hemorrhage jobs and the security of all of us, while the wealthiest scoop up everything that slipped through our fingers. And of course, the corporations have a responsibility to their shareholders to keep wages as low as the market will bear. So as people become desperate for work (again), they’ll again be more willing to accept shit pay, shit hours, no security, no benefits. Makes me wonder if they do it on purpose, eh?</p>

<p>We’ll shovel money into the military still, of course, which is a giant unaccountable money funnel (to the tune of $6 trillion missing) for defense contractors. </p>

<p>Undoing this mess will take a long ass time, and there may never really be political will to fully do so if the current establishment democrats are any indication. </p>

<p>another consideration, in a lot of these &#39;free&#39; healthcare places, you are not able to sue for malpractice. malpractice insurance is expensive, for some Drs its over $100k/yr. </p>

<p>Congress should:</p>

<ul>
<li>get a stipend not a paycheck</li>
<li>have the same healthcare as everyone else</li>
<li>have to plan for retirement like everyone else (401K, etc)</li>
<li>no publicly paid for lifetime health insurance</li>
<li>no contact with lobbyists</li>
<li>no 3rd party money changes hands (no quid pro quo)</li>

<p>Serving in Congress is a privilege and if someone wants to do it,  they should consider it a public service. Not a get rich scheme. </p>

<p>And kick their sorry asses out after a couple of terms. The longer people serve, the more opportunities for shenanigans.</p>

<p>no contact with lobbyists</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Honest question.</p>

<p>How would you expect an 88 year old life-long politician Conyers vote on legislation relating to Technology? Healthcare? Banking? </p>

<p>He has ZERO experience in those industries. He probably doesn&#39;t know how to work a smartphone or computer.</p>

<p>Politicans aren&#39;t magical know-it-alls. Lobbying is actually a necessary part of government. It&#39;s the only window for the politicians to become informed about the interworkings of an industry; what effects them, what legislation is preventing their growth, what legislation they may need for protection from bad actors, etc.</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of a life-changing experience if you get to go through this first hand. There was an industry that I knew nothing about other than negative stuff I heard through the media. Then I worked in the industry and gained an insider perspective. Then I realized - You. Do. Not. Know. An. Industry. Until. You. Work. There.</p>

<p>Do you expect Conyers to just sit on Wikipedia all day, and then vote tomorrow and pretend that he is informed?</p>

<p>Lobbying and kickbacks are abusable and need to be controlled the right way. But it&#39;s necessary for industry insiders to attempt to inform the government about their position.</p>

<p>I expect doctors, surgeons, health insurance workers, and pharmacists to know the Healthcare Industry.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect Conyers to know his head from his ass when it comes to how the industry works.</p>

<p>I know not everyone is as jaded and confrontational as you seem to be.

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, what? I’ve never heard any of my friends and family who are combat vets ever complain about getting “shite on.” They complain about some VA bureaucracy, but they have all given me the impression (based on their words and their bank accounts) that they are well taken care of and their mental health care is addressed if they seek it.</p>

<p>From the words of one of my closest relatives: ‘Many guys are just too stubborn to take the time to fill out their paper work. I’ve tried to help some of them who complain the most, but they wouldn’t even take my offer to fill out the papers for them.’</p>

<p>Now, idk if this is true for the majority, but combat vets and rich people are pretty much the most taken care of individuals in our society. I can’t walk an inch into any major city without seeing billboards and advertisements about university research into robotic limbs, ads to donate to WWP, or some other thing about giving to vets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Combat veterans are treated fairly well in the VA. I have volunteered there and my Dad has worked at three different VA&#39;s. Yes, there are tons of scandals, which is bad, but part of that is due to a looking glass being directed towards the VA and not other government agencies, such as the USDA. I have interacted with veterans coming from the shittiest backgrounds living in the shittiest neighborhoods.</p>

<p>At the VA my Dad worked at until recently, we wouldn&#39;t be able to get out of the hospital without five people stopping my Dad to shake his hand. Because of this, my Mom didn&#39;t want to go into the VA ever because she would have to talk to a bunch of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think most people have a choice whether to get into the army in non-war times, no? Seeing how brutally america carries out drone bombings and oil wars in the middle east and Africa, I for one would never sign up for that shit. I can see how many veterans are permanently scarred in their heads for &quot;having to&quot; carry out some real ill shit that they probably didn&#39;t sign up for but likely couldve seen coming. I do sympathize though. I really do. With the innocent victims on american imperialism. </p>
