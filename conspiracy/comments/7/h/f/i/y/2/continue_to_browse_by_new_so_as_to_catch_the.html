       I know reddit amin made changes this summer allowing some sort of facebook like account profiles on reddit, stuff like this -
      </p>
      <p>
       /user/HmediaG
      </p>
      <p>
       /user/timemagazine/

       And these accounts post shit in here frequently. I don't understand how it works, they're not exactly bots, they don't comment, they just post junk on reddit.

       I think that's because you're a high priority individual on a certain other subreddit. I'm not so sure anyone has bots after you, but hey what do I know. How do these bots work? Honest question, is this like a proven thing? Is it something reddit is ok with?

       I guess there is some application that will color code people by a SJW type of 'ranking'...I think SJW just go down the comments and downvote anyone with a specific 'color scheme'...I don't think it is personal.

       If you're here often enough new is only thing to look at eventually. You would have gone through top. See what's controversial. See what's rising then if you're still here you have to come to new to get more content.

       Yeah but
       <em>
        controversial
       </em>
       doesn't work if they can hold you at zero upvotes...I used to be so pleased with a different account if I could make the top 25 controversial on conspiracy but they have done something to fix that and now my OP's (again different account) just hover at 0...no upvotes/no downvotes and believe me, they are definitely still controversial because in smaller subreddits they generate lots of controversy.  So, something is very wrong here...just my two cents.  I would think 'new' would be the only way to browse r/conspiracy...
       <strong>
        when I do, I always click on an OP with a big fat 0 on it because I know that is what they do to me in order to marginalize my chance of being heard.

       It was always the volume that bothered me on r/conspiracy...I like to be able to focus and think about the content...can't do that here, so I just use it as a backup place to dump an OP when I have one I want to share with more than a few smaller subreddits...I figure r/conspiracy introduces people to new ideas but I don't think I would hang out here.
