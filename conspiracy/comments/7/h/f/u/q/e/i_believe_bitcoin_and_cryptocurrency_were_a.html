<p>Coinbase alone has nearly 100K merchants accepting BTC with their help.  World-wide the number of merchants acepting BTC is massive, and growing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While thats true it still doesn&#39;t justify the rapid increase in bitcoin. The only logical reason for the insane ROI is because its being pumped up, hardcore. Anything at any moment could crash it down thousands. At the price bitcoins are today its an insanely risky long term profit risk. Now for buying and selling like a common day trader bitcoin is logical because right now we are at the peak of interest in bitcoin. The issue with it is you won&#39;t continually pull this much interest down the line, once the wow factor starts to fade you could see a major player move his coins, thus causing a crash itself. Thats my opinion though maybe Bitcoin will replace fiat one day who knows really. 11,000$ for a coin though sketches me out to much to ever buy back in again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While this may be true, Bitcoin was still better then currency (USD , GBP, etc). The reason is due to the inflation and the power that the government gets to create as much as USD &amp; GBP. They create it only with a printer and paper. Bitcoin and cryptos have proof-of-work. Bitcoin has also been taken over by AXA insurance and Bilderberg group alongside Blockstream &amp; Bitcoin Core.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Cash was created and it is decentralized.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a blanket statement and a missunderstanding of the utility a privacy coin provides.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing wrong with wanting to keep your bank account (so to speak) private while obeying the law, too.  That&#39;s what Monero is good for.  Of couse some players might take advantage of its privacy for darknet purposes.  The same could be said for encryption  Are you also suggesting darknet purposes are what make encryption useful at the moment?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very simple.</p>

<p>One of the dev team of Bitcoin (Bitcoin Core) that is funded by Blockstream (that is again funded by/supported by AXA insurance group/Bilderberg group) is ruining Bitcoin. They were paid to ruin bitcoin and cripple it to make it slow and unusable. There&#39;s also a censored sub in reddit r/bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash was then created and now it has multiple dev teams and has cheap fees. Try to say in r/bitcoin &quot;Bitcoin Cash is better&quot; and you would get censored. Or say &quot;Bitcoin is shit&quot;. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also a sub that regularly collect posts that have been censored.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A quick analysis of your account, shows that all you do is bash Bitcoin..and promote that altcoin that tries to use bitcoin&#39;s name, for branding power..odd for a &quot;real&quot; person on the internet.</p>

<p>There&#39;s is a reason why we censor you so much. Since the beggining of the fork, all you know is to come and trow shit all around.  Anytime of the day, if you go on your sub r/btc , all people do is bash Bitcoin. That&#39;s all. </p>

<p>And btw, it&#39;s called r/Bitcoin for a reason, we TALK ABOUT BITCOIN, not about your lame altcoin. </p>

<p>Look at <a href="https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@anarcho/roger-ver-loses-his-shit-over-bcash-and-shows-his-true-colors">this guy</a> he called himself Bcash CEO, and he got rich, guess what? from BITCOIN. Then when money wasn&#39;t enough, he wanted power..therefore his own coin.. That&#39;s the guy you follow. And he lost his shit, following some basic questions in an interview. Pretty sad.</p>

<p>multiple dev teams?? really? there are only a handful of guys, and they took most of the code from the core team.</p>

<p>cheap fees ? Yes, cause nobody is using it. Name me 3 vendors that accept it.</p>

<p>And btw , I don&#39;t even know why I fall for this lame comments anymore, since you obviously follow an agenda, but, you try to braiwash other people and that&#39;s not call.</p>

<p>Bitcoin&#39;s code, is changed and improved by the community, every NODE votes for upgrades. That are PUBLIC. and everyone can submit upgrade ideas.</p>

<p>And what you say with &quot;slow and unusable&quot;..lol , I won&#39;t even bother with this.. Should we talk about Jihan Wu, who made his minning pool mine EMPTY blocks, just to slow down the network?</p>

<p>Should we talk about the milions of fake transactions, to clog the network? Then These guys came with the idea &quot;hey, let&#39;s fork Bitcoin&quot;, and as soon as they got what they want, all those transactions volumes, just magically disssapeared ?</p>

<p>Point is , don&#39;t belive this guy, and don&#39;t belive me..Just search the net for yourself, and see what is what.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Segwitcoin (also known as BTC or Bitcoin) was crippled and turned into an alt-coin by Core devs who got paid $76 million by the banks.</p>

<p>Option A) super fast, almost zero fees.
Option B) payment could arrive 20 hours from now, fees up to $20, usually in the $2-$5 range.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious that option A is going to win globally.</p>

<p>So you can say whatever you want, but Bitcoin Cash actually works, whereas BTC is a crippled dead giant stumbling towards his grave. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not brainwashing anyone here.</p>

<p>r/bitcoin is fully censored and is just like r/The_Donald.</p>

<p>Satoshi&#39;s idea was to increase the blocksize once blocks started getting fuller.</p>

<p>The fees have been going up since 2015 but no solution till now is there. So Bitcoin Cash was forked off.</p>

<p>Read the Bitcoin Whitepaper.</p>

<p>Jihan Wu and Craig Wright do not own Bitcoin Cash that&#39;s just what you were told to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I apreciate you want to have an open disccution. Sorry for my tone.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t said they own Bcash, I said that they had the idea for the fork, and Jihan helped by slowing down the Bitcoin Network, and Roger Ver, used his ton of money to organise the recent pumps and dumps.</p>

<p>Nothing to say about CWright..guy wants to convince the world he&#39;s Satoshi, while he can&#39;t do simple math.</p>

<p>About satoshi&#39;s idea, yes we can increase the block size, but that is presented as a last solution, as long as we can develop layer 2, why not do it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bcash is not Bitcoin Cash. Bcash is another coin. </p>

<p>You can also look at my post history for evidence regarding Blockstream&#39;s takeover. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eszwk/links_related_to_blockstreams_takeover_of_bitcoin/">https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7eszwk/links_related_to_blockstreams_takeover_of_bitcoin/</a>)</p>

<p>Yes they had the idea for the fork but it was also miners and users that were a part of it.  Jihan did not slow down the network. The usage of Bitcoin went too much and every second only 3tx can be processed (or about 300,000/day). Fees skyrocketed and companies had to stop adopting Bitcoin. You say Roger is doing a pump and dump but what proof do you have? Roger is also not the owner of Bitcoin Cash if you think so.</p>

<p>Well let Craig Wright say what he wants. That&#39;s irrelevant. He just said it a few times he&#39;s not pushing it neither he has proved it so we should not believe he is Satoshi.</p>

<p>Fees have been skyrocketing since 2015. And the solution had to be solved with a blocksize increase and in the future some layer 2 solution. It&#39;s been 2 years + another about 18 months for Lightning network to come. On top of that we don&#39;t know if we can trust it or it works.</p>

<p>AXA insurance group and Bilderberg paid off the Bitcoin Core devs to ruin Bitcoin and keep it this way.</p>
