        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the past 6 years Elon Musk has positioned himself in every major category of mixed technological and economical importance. If he takes over the semitruck industry, he will be able to track data for shipments within the country. He is leading the innovative front for space travel and desperately trying to accumulate a power monopoly on Mars. Tesla is expanding incredibly and he will be able to track which vehicles are charging where. Each Tesla owner is in a database somewhere that connects them to their cars. </p>

<p>He has run a fierce PR campaign despite most science/technology demagogues typically being welcomed and appreciated by public opinion. From a world-leader point of view Elon Musk having you by the balls technologically seems like a win-win for you until he flips and takes advantage of the power you gave him in your nation. He recently redid the power grid for Puerto Rico. </p>

<p>Thinking projectionally, these types of situations will happen more and more as Musk develops an even stronger reputation until eventually he will be in a position where he has so many resources and so much information that he is able to redevelop any industry and spread his tentacle arms into every aspect of life around the years 2030-2040. He will have more power than any single political office holder of any nation and his power will be on a worldwide scale. Think Mark Zuckerberg but without public suspicion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>eh, I disagree from his history of tech innovation.  He doesnt seem like one to take over existing spaces.  He makes his was in new industries that he creates.  paypal (online finance), spaceX (privitized space), tesla(electric automated cars), gigafactory(battery tech).
Doesnt seem like he wants to take over this world.  Why do that when you can build a new world on mars?</p>

<p>He wants to be the king of Mars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, having seen interviews with him, he actually DOES do a lot of groundwork and design first hand and delegates people to fine tune prototypes or time consuming digitalization of design concepts/ manufacturing. He is actually very personally involved in the ground work and overseeing every one of his projects personally. He&#39;s not just an investor, and he often has risked his entire fortune to pursue his inventions. Also, making your patents public domain isn&#39;t something an investor does if they are in it for the money. </p>
