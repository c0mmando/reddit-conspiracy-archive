       In the past 6 years Elon Musk has positioned himself in every major category of mixed technological and economical importance. If he takes over the semitruck industry, he will be able to track data for shipments within the country. He is leading the innovative front for space travel and desperately trying to accumulate a power monopoly on Mars. Tesla is expanding incredibly and he will be able to track which vehicles are charging where. Each Tesla owner is in a database somewhere that connects them to their cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has run a fierce PR campaign despite most science/technology demagogues typically being welcomed and appreciated by public opinion. From a world-leader point of view Elon Musk having you by the balls technologically seems like a win-win for you until he flips and takes advantage of the power you gave him in your nation. He recently redid the power grid for Puerto Rico.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thinking projectionally, these types of situations will happen more and more as Musk develops an even stronger reputation until eventually he will be in a position where he has so many resources and so much information that he is able to redevelop any industry and spread his tentacle arms into every aspect of life around the years 2030-2040. He will have more power than any single political office holder of any nation and his power will be on a worldwide scale. Think Mark Zuckerberg but without public suspicion.

       The cure for your fears would be pushing science, space exploration and alternative energies by the public sector.

       When a private company receives billions in government subsidies, can you really not consider it a public sector venture anyway?

       Is the fossil fuel industry a public sector venture? Considering it receives 4 times the subsidies Musk received (in total) annually.

       eh, I disagree from his history of tech innovation.  He doesnt seem like one to take over existing spaces.  He makes his was in new industries that he creates.  paypal (online finance), spaceX (privitized space), tesla(electric automated cars), gigafactory(battery tech).
Doesnt seem like he wants to take over this world.  Why do that when you can build a new world on mars?

       He wants to be the king of Mars.

       Joe Rogan said in a recent podcast that he might be the smartest guy of all time lmao, I doubt he's super smart on the tech side of things; he probably has a really good team of designers/engineers nobody has ever heard of working in the background while he handles the vision &amp; PR side.

       I mean, having seen interviews with him, he actually DOES do a lot of groundwork and design first hand and delegates people to fine tune prototypes or time consuming digitalization of design concepts/ manufacturing. He is actually very personally involved in the ground work and overseeing every one of his projects personally. He's not just an investor, and he often has risked his entire fortune to pursue his inventions. Also, making your patents public domain isn't something an investor does if they are in it for the money.

       Ive been joking with people about this for years. Super genious/ scientist who is a turn key supervillan. All it would take it a real bad bout of depression or tramatic event. So far tho, he seems genuinely altruistic. He lables his motivations as solving the biggest problems facing humanity in the history of the world 6_6....

       Also, look into the glomar explorer project of a philantropist billionair publicised to be mining deep sea minerals if you want in on the conspiracy behind musk ;)

       Idk, a private entrepreneur solving the worlds resource problems, advancing transportation tech, creating secure online financing, and building one of the worlds most impressive space programs (the dude has better rockets than the entire nation of north korea) is kinda a libertarian poster boy wet dream. Hes done more for renewable energy than the entire nation of the USA. 6_6

       lolno. The world runs on hydrocarbons, unless you are deep state, in which case they probably run on free energy and exotic means of propulsion. Lithium ion batteries are shit and can't power shit except for small electronic baubles.

       Is the fossil fuel industry a public sector venture? Considering it receives 4 times the subsidies Musk received (in total) annually.

      <p>
       Or the telco giants?
