<blockquote>
<p>Epstein, 64, was a regular for several years at Mar-a-Lago. Testimony in a prior court case indicated that Trump flew at least once on one of the planes Epstein owned and Trump’s phone numbers were in Epstein’s personal phone directory.</p>

<p>Trump has also indicated publicly he knew of Epstein’s interest in “younger” women, although he never suggested the financier crossed any legal lines. “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy,’’ Trump told New York Magazine back in 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”

</blockquote>

<p>Just like Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey. Trump flew on Epstein&#39;s plane. Trump also has money laundering art dealing friends. Trump&#39;s art guy is Hilly Nahmad, who  owns the 51st floor of Trump tower.</p>

<p>Trump also gave money to Anthony Weiner.

    <div class="md"><p>According to James Patterson&#39;s book &quot;Filthy Rich,&quot; about Epstein, Trump and Epstein had a professional acquaintance that ended when Trump tossed Epstein out of Mar-A-Lago for hitting on a 15-year old, and barred him from ever coming back.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gossipextra.com/2016/10/31/donald-trump-perv-jeffrey-epstein-mar-a-lago-6462-68165">http://www.gossipextra.com/2016/10/31/donald-trump-perv-jeffrey-epstein-mar-a-lago-6462-68165</a></p>

<p>Also worth noting that if you got to Epstein&#39;s flight logs for his private plane, you&#39;ll see Bill Clinton traveled more than two dozen times to Epstein&#39;s private island. Trump traveled on it, once, one way, to New York City.</p>

<p>Even if Trump did throw him out which no one else can confirm, the article in which Trump was quoted in NYmag was made in 2013, where he said he knew him for 15 years. Supposedly that &quot;throwing out&quot; incident occurred in 1999. He known him since the late 80&#39;s.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve accused you of nothing. However..you yourself have accused two users on this sub of attacking you. And fortunately, all of the evidence needed to debate this particular issue is in full view for everyone to come to their own conclusions.</p>

<p>My opinion on Trump and pizza stuff - it&#39;s possible..I don&#39;t know. Personally, I don&#39;t consider someone to be guilty by association...more proof is needed.</p>

<p>Has another investigation into the allegations against him been started? Are there ongoing investigations into the allegations made against him prior to the election?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve made jokes about Bill Clinton and the Lolita Express. But not once have I ever stated or believed by default that just because he was on that plane, that means he&#39;s a pedophile.</p>

<p>Nor have I ever come to the conclusion that anyone/everyone associated with Jeffrey Epstein is a pedophile.</p>

<p>Lie.</p>

<p>I would like to not use guilt by association, but so far Clinton, Trump and Epstein have all been accused of inappropriate behavior. With only Epstein getting busted and only getting about two years for raping children.</p>

<p>And yes. Trump has never acknowledged his ties to Epstein or his rape allegations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, I can see both sides on this. On the one hand, there are allegations against Trump, he flew in Epsteins&#39; place and knows/knew him. However on the other hand, the allegations against Trump seemed to really just disappear with no legal action being taken for over a year about it. And there&#39;s evidence he flew with Epstein once, which isn&#39;t really that damning, as he could have goen there, seen what it was about and never returned out of disgust, who knows. It&#39;s not like Clinton who went there dozens of times. Then there&#39;s the fact Trump has pursued pedo rings and has publicly called out pedophiles on Twitter. I don&#39;t know, he doesn&#39;t quite fit the same way the others do in terms of pedo stuff. Although I suppose he could not be a pedo himself but just be involved in turning a blind eye to others, or facilitating horrible things for his guests or whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to comment on Pizzagate, what I will say, is that Trump will say <strong>anything</strong> to get your support.  He obsessively gobbles up shitty media from shitty sources and spews it back out on twitter and in his rallies.  </p>

<p>He said he&#39;d jail the Clintons because of two reasons, he saw how well it played among far right people and he got the loudest cheers when he said he would &quot;lock her up&quot;.</p>

<p>Look at his history, he is basically a professional when it comes to telling someone whatever they want to hear when he sells something to them.</p>

<p>Then it&#39;s your fault when what he sold you isn&#39;t what he claimed.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The paedo blackmail scam was set up by Ghislaines father who was Czech mossad and he was tasked by the Rothschilds with recruiting left leaning billionaires to the greater Isreal cause in the 80s and 90s. Trump was a left leaning billionaire and his wife Ivana was Czech mossad as well. Trump provided polaroids and Virginia Roberts to agents Maxwell and Epstein and he was in the club and had the full backing of the Rothschilds. After Maxwells disappearance Rupert Murdoch took over as the top mossad media mogul and needed more assurance so trump had to give his daughter up to Isreal  (Kushner) under orders from Wendy Deng Murdoch  (Putins Girlfriend). Trump is Rumored to have been given the nickname &quot;calpol Teabag&quot; by mi5 back in the day maybe based on the polaroids ivana took or some other material that they had seen. </p>
