       Lose of credibility for NASA. If earth was flat, then everything they told us would be a lie... even Moon landing. Did you know that the Moon is actually a hologram and no one can land on it?

       Please don't associate these to things. 
Flat Earth = Can be proven false, by any person with a telescope and math.
       <br/>
       Moon Landing = Can not be proven true, by anyone
By assisting them you lump the very probable moon landing conspiracy, with a very very very very very improbable FE conspiracy.

       And reflectors wouldn't even prove men had walked on the moon, only that reflectors were placed there.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, you're not even the one doing the experiment. You're just taking the word on blind faith from some observatory on television or the Mythbusters or whatever. They actually did this on Mythbusters and I urge anyone to go watch it; it all seems fake and the lady at the observatory seems like an actress.

       Can't be proven unless they go for the first time and actually do it. I already know they didn't do it in 1969-1972 because it looks so fake and everything about it seems fake, not to mention it hasn't been done since or proven since. Nothing can prove that they did it in 1969, in other words, because it's already been proven many ways they did not do it.

       If man went to the moon in 1969, it was on a different mission than the Apollo missions we were shown. If I were shown evidence of some other moon landing, I would consider it. But this would require technology in 1969 that doesn't even exist today. Nothing can convince me that the Apollo astronauts walked on the moon during the coverage the country was shown, but anyone is welcome to show evidence that some other party actually went to the moon during that time period.

       1) Watch the video. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum. The video clearly shows sounds being recorded during the Apollo missions.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The Orion eft-1 took a brief trip through the lower Van Allen belt. A circumlunar flight travels through both Van Allen belts (twice) and spends time outside Earth's magnetosphere. One expects that spending more time in areas of high frequency radiation would register on the dosimeters.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The cameras allegedly used on the moon used film. Film gets damaged when exposed to ionising radiation. One would expect to see evidence of such radiation on the photos and videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The Apollo lm allegedly used aerozine and tetroxide as their propellents. Such a mixture has a characteristic orange colour. This fuel signature was not observed on the Apollo 17 liftoff.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Etc... Means there's plenty more scientific anomalies I could go over. Skip jump reentry, for example. But the above 4 points have yet to be explained.

       Proof of what? I only claim that there are innumerable scientific anomalies present in the Apollo footage. There exists a critical analysis of this footage on youtube which you refuse to watch because it exists on youtube. If you dont want to watch the video, how will you refute my claims that sounds are heard during the Apollo missions,  which would be impossible if they were actually on the moon
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, i dont see any rebuttal to my previous arguments. What exactly are you trying to accomplish? You asked me what it would take to convince me the moon landing was real. I gave several anomalies which have yet to be explained. In return, you narrow in on the fact that i posted a youtube link which dispoays said anomalies, and you refuse to move from the position that because a video is posted on youtube, its invalid as evidence.

       Attacking the source of evidence rather than even considering the evidence itself is shill behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I claim to have a video which proves my claims, and that video appears on YouTube, then it certainly is a valid source of proof.

       FINALLY! You kept dodging and tap-dancing around it so much, it was getting ridiculous, lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the reason why personal blogs and YouTube videos aren't proof is because anyone can make a blog or video about anything. I can easily make a video or blog say whatever I want, regardless of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you believe me if I made a blog or video claiming I'm the goddess of the universe? Probably not, you'd demand to see verifiable and demonstrable evidence
       <em>
        (or at least I hope you would)
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, we both know that video recordings of an event don't show everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand

       Definition of proof: evidence or argument establishing or helping to establish a fact or truth of a statement.

       The video I submitted, which is footage of the Apollo missions, is proof of my claim that sounds we're observed during the Apollo missions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you refuse to watch the video and debate the substance of my arguments? It's highly disingenuous to insist a video fails to prove my claim when you won't watch the video.

       During the Apollo missions, sounds were heard during the recording. I have submitted a YouTube link which you refuse to watch. How do you suggest I provide you the same information?
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, you have yet to answer any of my arguments pertaining to radiation damage on the photos, the dosimeter readings of the Orion spacecraft or the missing fuel signature in the Apollo liftoff.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do YOU have of substance? What arguments do YOU have?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your entire argument is, as I understand, people can create fake videos. That's fine, but you refuse to watch the provided link to even verify if said video is fake. Your argument amounts to, because fake videos can be made, I don't have to watch your video.

       If people are told there is no creator and you are living on a tiny speck in an infinitely vast universe that probably contains other life forms so far away we can ever encounter them, they might be easier to control than if they knew that the earth is actually all we know and all there is.

       Funny... for most of human history, the idea of a creator god was used very successfully to control the people. In fact most of the world's population is still being controlled by people claiming to speak for god.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, it seems to me you have that completely backwards. The idea that the world is flat and was created by a god that speaks through chosen leaders is a far greater tool for control than a globe earth lost in an infinite void.

       You guys really need to read the best book ever created man...the Holy Bible...all your answers are in there....you just need the people who the book was written for, to explain it to you...because as you're well aware by now....all your world leaders worship satan!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       All you out here fawning over Q....lol
Q aint telling you a damn thing that the Hebrew Israelites on the street corners have been telling you for.....years!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       This world was made for the nation of people who the Laws of the Almighty God were given to....the 12 Tribes of Israel....not them fakes over there in Israel!!
      </p>
      <p>
       2 Esdras 6:55 KJV
      </p>
      <p>
       All this have I spoken before thee, O Lord, because thou madest the world for our sakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And not them fake caucasian 'Israelis' who you all know as 'Jewish' people either!!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Revelation 2:9 KJV
      </p>
      <p>
       I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Them fake khazars are the house of Satan....and that's where most of your satanism, pedophilia, LGBT push and in general, this worlds downfall comes from!!!
