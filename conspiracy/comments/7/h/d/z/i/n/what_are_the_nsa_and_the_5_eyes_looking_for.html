<p>This is the point of the database. It allows those who control it to manipulate not only Politicians but also current and future leaders of social and political movements, to ensure they can be crushed in the cradle and never grow into another Civil Rights or Anti-War movement. </p>

<p>Despite all the info they have at their disposal they&#39;re still getting hacked and leaking like a sieve when it comes to all their nefarious crimes and scandals.

<p>Yes they will have their individual files on people or whatever but 98% of internet users will be irrelevant to them.</p>

<p>They are looking for changes in collective conscious of the world population, of course they&#39;d be able to break it down into categories aswell. By continent, country, race, religion, gender. They&#39;d probably do little propaganda experiments and see how it affects each targeted category, the whole black lives matter thing for example or all this recent transgender stuff.</p>
