<p>That&#39;s great, but to continue supporting SA&#39;s actions because they allowed women to drive doesn&#39;t even equate in my mind.  We&#39;re helping them to commit genocide in a country we&#39;ve been drone bombing for 6+ years.  </p>

<p>Yes, yes, yes. I just had a conversation with a person yesterday about how he will be paying less in taxes on his $32K salary, just like I will be paying less on my $190K salary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is winning but he needs a supportive congress.</p>

<p>The battle is literally the globalist uniparty establishment (which sadly includes the judiciary below the SCOTUS) VS Trump and the American public. He cant win by himself.  If a MAGA congress is voted in, the MAGA agenda will eventually be enacted, if it isnt, he will be stymied at every turn, like he has been so far - he has succeeded wildly relative to the ferocity of the opposition</p>

<p>what about it - be specific</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What about giving every American affordable healthcare?</p>

<p>same question - what about it - you need to be specific with your &quot;whatabouts&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why isn&#39;t he bringing back jobs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who says he isnt? If I list a single job &quot;he&quot; has brought back, is that good? I could like a number of corp announcements to that effect, if you like.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is his new tax plan a tax break for the rich?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are are 2 &quot;tax bills&quot;, if thats what you are referring to. 1 passed the House, 1 passed the Senate. Which are you referring to, and specifically how are they a &quot;break for the rich&quot;? If they are, the President hasnt yet signed a combined bill, so how would any break to the rich in fact be &quot;his&quot;?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He was gonna improve the US&#39;s standing in the world: why is the world laughing then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The general public of the world <em>isnt</em> laughing, many people globally report an incredible support for Trump. his foreign visits of the last year have been considered massive successes with foreign leadership at each visit stop.  What you <em>may</em> be referring to is the global <strong>MEDIA</strong> hatred of Trump. This, although laughably obvious, is just as you say - they truly do hate him worldwide - but be aware they are just minions of the globalist CNN, which is on at hotels and airports etc worldwide. It is more here in the US that most people openly mock and laugh at the MSM for the joke fake news that it is, people in non US countries havent caught on yet, but they will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not whataboutism.</p>

<p>He was gonna build a border wall but can&#39;t even get that in his budget.</p>

<p>Affordable healthcare? He literally said his healthcare plan was going to be tremendous. Everyone was going to get healthcare at a cheaper price. You can see it in his speeches.</p>

<p>His attempt at that would&#39;ve made healthcare more expensive, kick millions of people off of their health insurance. Really MAGA&#39;ing.</p>

<p>For the tax plan, I&#39;m of course talking about the Senate bill that he supports. It adds a trillion dollars in debt yet won&#39;t grow the economy enough to offset that debt. The return on investment is horrible and the largesr tax breaks are for big earners and corporations.</p>

<p>Oh yeah those same corporations that benefit from it have said they&#39;ll pass on the profits to their shareholders. They&#39;re not going to use the money to create more jobs.</p>

<p>And finally about the standing in the world: dude, I&#39;m from Europe. I read English, German, French, Belgian and Dutch newspapers... He is a laughing stock. </p>

<p>Did his trip to Asia do anything? Nope.
China managed to strenghten their asian dominion. North Korea keeps doing the same shit. He didn&#39;t even dare mention Human Rights in the Philippines.</p>

<p>He just insulted Great Britain.</p>

<p>The US is the only country... <em>the only country</em> not in the Paris agreement. Hell, Trump isn&#39;t even invited anymore.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didnt say it was whataboutism I said be specific in your whatabouts - well, it was easy to tell you arent American, and that you read (and believe) the global media. Of course.</p>

<p>Every single thing you said please provide your source for. Let me guess. An article in a leftist rag of some stripe or another. I would challenge you to state those leftist talking points  attacks on the legislation u mention and provide backing sources without propaganda editorials telling you what they mean or how horrible they are, and why. Quote the actual LAWS themselves, not what CNN or WaPo told you..THEN we can debate.</p>

<p>For the legislative issues, from the border wall to healthcare to taxes, you do realize that he isnt Emporor Trump, right? I mean, I know him being a dictator was a leftist talking point and Hitler yada yada yada, but in reality, he can only sign bills that get to his desk. It is the job of congress to pass things. Still, Im willing to debate the actual legislation such as it is, but only based on reality not the propaganda - and I will be the first to agree that some of the actual legislation - for example some elements of the Senate bill - I dont like and dont agree with.</p>

<p>Why arent you asking these questions of the congress? Oh yea. Because Trump hate. Everything MUST be his fault. Because the newspapers (in 6 different languages) told you so.</p>

<p>You see, you just confirmed what I said. You are parroting leftist propaganda hate talking points, and I dont blame you, the media is pervasive and worldwide. Most people in the US laugh at them now.</p>

<p>But you want to keep believing what they publish, so you do, and then, not wanting to think you have been duped all along and played like a violin, you fiercely defend you rbeliefs, and reinforce your hatred. Its all Trumps fault (even though in truth, he doesnt even MAKE laws!).</p>

<p>Thats why there cant be a debate, because you are just parroting propaganda that you think is reality. Im not arguing fairly tales.</p>

<p>So because Trump picked them, they shit doesn&#39;t stink in your mind, but in reality their actions have already proven to be against our interest and in the interests of the corporations they came from.</p>

<p>Former Verizon lobbyist Ajit Pai is a perfect example of this. He&#39;s is fighting to take away our right to a free and open Internet to make his former company Verizon a  little richer. With their fast lanes, they&#39;ll be able to setup tolls and skim more from their users.</p>

<p>Another example is Scott Pruitt, who filed lawsuits to block the EPA from enforcing clean air, clean water, and climate regulations. He was paid by polluters to fight the EPA. Now this swamp creature is making our streams and rivers dirtier. He&#39;s allowed pesticides that will cause brain damage in our children. This is how we Maga?</p>

 Ars technica <strong>IS</strong> may be somewhat well respected in a technical sense, but like many industry publications in the last few years, they have been unmasked as having a political bias that colors - or even completely warps - their &quot;reporting&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>how is it &quot;mindless tribalism&quot; to ask you why, in your own words, you support &quot;Net Neutrailty&quot;?</p>

<p>Why is it somehow wrong to ask you to think and speak for yourself instead of being lazy and parroting the leftist propaganda you dutifully lap up?</p>

<p>All I asked was to state from the source material, which is the Net Neutrality regulations themselves. Tell me what about them you feel make them essential and an overall good thing. I dont mind if you paraphrase, but quote a source that is, well, the source, not what a supposed &quot;industry journal&quot; TELLS you it says, and why.</p>

<p>I ask this to also get you to employ the &quot;critical thinking skills&quot; you mention - dont parrot lines you have been fed, exposing that you have merely been indoctrinated without realizing it. Tell me in your own words, and use the source.</p>

<p>If you wont, and just want to insult me personally, instead, thats fine too, either way you prove my point.</p>

<p>We need Net Neutrailty because the industry has proven that without it, they cannot &quot;self-regulate&quot;. From Verizon blocking Google Wallet to Comcast blocking bittorrent that have proven that without protections they abuse their monopolistic power. </p>

<p>And no, I can&#39;t quote regulations because back then we didn&#39;t have them, but I could quote articles from lawsuits about those actions. Too bad you only seem to accept evidence from T_D propaganda.</p>

<p>showing you lack of critical thinking skills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>thats an odd position to take. I would think requesting that you provide ACTUAL source material to back your opinions would encourage critical thinking.</p>

<p>But you <strong>insist</strong> on playing the &quot;my propaganda is right, yours is wrong game, while at the same time accusing me of &quot;mindless tribalism&quot;.</p>

<p>OK, heres my volley back to your Ars Technica article:</p>

<p><a href="http://rightwingnews.com/democrats/what-is-wrong-with-net-neutrality/">http://rightwingnews.com/democrats/what-is-wrong-with-net-neutrality/</a></p>

<p>took me a 5 second google search. And Im willing to bet the author is &quot;highly respected too (David McClure is the president &amp; CEO of the US Internet Industry Association, sounds pretty official!!)</p>

<p>See, we can do this all day.</p>

<p>You spout leftist propaganda that LOVES NN, I regurgitate right wing propaganda that shreiks the opposite, fun isnt it? Then you can call  me names (like lacking in this or that &quot;skill&quot;, according to you, your highness), we can devolve into pure name calling, geez how productive!</p>

<p>But at least you did tell me in general terms what you like about NN. OK fine. You say the industry has &quot;proven&quot; it cant self regulate. I totally disagree. The NN rules were enacted in 2014.</p>

<p><strong>ALL OF THE INTERNETS MAIN GROWTH CAME WELL BEFORE NN</strong></p>

<p>And it seemed to &quot;self regulate&quot; pretty well. What NN <em>does</em> do, however, is add yet another useless layer of beurocracy that is open to more bribes, kickbacks, uneven regulation, heavy handed government interference, on and on. How is the cable monopoly &quot;regulation&quot; working out? HAS it been helpful to the growth of the industry, to innovation, to pricing for the consumer, to choice, or hurtful? Why is that? Does MORE government regulation of <strong>ANYTHING</strong> generally result in more innovation and efficiency, or less?</p>

<p>Might I suggest <strong>YOU</strong> attempt some &quot;critical thinking&quot;?</p>

<p>And if you spent 5 more seconds, you&#39;d see that a lobbyist group for Verizon and Comcast. I asked for <strong>unbiased</strong> sources and the be you can is find propaganda from an ISP lobbyist group that only seems to care about taking away our NN protections. </p>

<p>And where does you lobbyist post his propaganda? <strong>rightwing</strong>news.com. One step above T_D. baby steps.</p>

<p>Now unlike you I actually looked your source and it&#39;s full of garbage like this:</p>

<p>The FCC is concerned that broadband service providers will discriminate against content from competitors in order to more readily provide applications that would benefit them. Despite no evidence to this end</p>

<p>I already gave you 2 examples of this. Comcast throttling bittorrent and Verizon blocking Google Wallet. </p>

<p>Of course you failed to address that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha touche - youre a good sport, I appreciate that.</p>

<p>I also ready the Ars article.</p>

<p>one line struck me: &quot;Absent net neutrality protections, however, we suspect this restraint won&#39;t last, especially in areas with little real competition&quot;</p>

<p>I would agree with the theory, but disagree with the solution.  Im always for market solutions, and free competition solutions. Trying to force ANYONE, even the evil cable companies, to do anything is counterprpductive.</p>

<p>In general, I want LESS regulation, not MORE. What I want MORE of is competition, which will deliver better versions of the solutions you seek. Depending on mama government to coddle you cradle to grave is not the answer, because a) their &quot;help&quot; is always the most inefficient and expensive and b) it inevitably leads to rampant graft, corruption, and theft. Which is then covered up by more bribes, kickbacks, on and on.</p>

<p>Fewer regulations is the answer, not more. My point re the sources was that Ars was pushing an agenda just as the right wing one was. You think no one is paying Ars to write what they do? Just doing ot from the goodness of their hearts? </p>

<p>PLEASE employ some of that critical thinking, my friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for you reply. First time I finally felt like I was communicating with someone in good faith. I am a libertarian, but I do not trust monopolies to look after my best interest. And so I do agree with in theory with regulation, but in this case, if you look at ISP&#39;s history, we need protections. </p>

<p>At home I only have 1 real choice for true broadband, Comcast. And I personally have experienced their bit torrent throttling before we had any NN protections. </p>

<p>Anyways, hit me up tmr, and I&#39;ll be glad to talk more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoyed our back and forth too, you obviously know what you are talking about.</p>

<p>As a former card-carrying libertarian, I share your distaste for monopolies in general , but when the solution is more big government, as was the case with NN, to me the devils in the details.  Good concept? Sure, kinda goes without saying.</p>

<p>But like I said, more government anything is always bad. We have to live with a bare minimum only in emergency and security situations, where market efficiency isnt as important - in things like Internet service, the line is blurry, and NN to me was a land grab by TPTB...</p>

<p>But again, good conversation, I appreciate you.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Actually, traditionalists benefit the most in times of dramatic change because of the desire for moderation. Change moves in cycles of development and then stability/improvement. When you have too much development too quickly, you stray very far from original principals and tend to make some things better, and some things worse. Ideally, only the bad things would get fixed and the good things would get left alone. But since America has &quot;all or nothing&quot; party politics generally, you get drastic swings back and forth. Until the core issues of change which the majority decides are unfavorable are changed though, there is a big period for traditionalists to thrive. It&#39;s too easy to point out a few things that have gone badly when you have dramatic change everywhere. </p>

<p>I believe that the only good thing to come of Trumps victory is his own ineptitude at doing the aforementioned looting. HRC would have done it quietly and carefully, as they have done for the last 40 years. Trump&#39;s is in the open, which at least makes people think. Problem is, unless there is a non Corporatist to challenge Trump in 2020...this means <em>NOT</em> Kamala, or Deval, or HRC, or anyone in that vein of pathetic Neoliberal politics, then the looting of the country will continue and the Republic will not be halted on its careening course towards destruction.</p>
