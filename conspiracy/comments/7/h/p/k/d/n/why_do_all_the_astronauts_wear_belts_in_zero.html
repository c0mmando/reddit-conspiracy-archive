       Body moves. Pants which are not tightly attached to the body move less. Pants are now not exactly where you want them. Not to mention belts help keep things from shifting around in general. Elastic would work too, but it would look weird, and belts are already getting the job done.

       Yea! Well, the woman leave their hair 4 feet long. And they use a toilet that somehow is a vacuum within a vacuum. They would destroy that place with their own filth, if it could actually work like they say.

       ??? The inside of the ISS is pressurized.. you know... to prevent death. How would they destroy the place? Shit doesn't fly at random. From what I understand they use a glorified vacuum cleaner to push the shit into disposal.

       Use the toilet floating and then have to bag it and store it in a drawer. That's what they say they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what if the cabin is oxygenated, and pressurized. They are still floating in a vacuum.  Now, do you think a vacuum could suck something inside a vacuum?
      </p>
      <p>
       Stay with me, they have to suspend themselves in a weightless position and then somehow their waste gets sucked into this vacuum instead floating all over the place.  Think about this man, you can have you waste sucked into a vacuum while you are in a weightless suspended zero g environment.

       You don't know what a vacuum is. You think you do, but you don't. Vacuums and gravity have nothing in common. Outside of the ISS is space. Space is a vacuum(mostly). Inside ISS there is air at a similar pressure to that of earth, hence not a vacuum. If it was a vacuum people would pass and die within minutes.  This is fact. Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean its not true.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Because the air is being pushed from their ass into the trash by what is basically a vacuum cleaner. Stay with me, they use the bathroom, the waste exits their body and in 0 gravity it just sort of hangs around there until some force acted on it. That's why they have the vacuum cleaner. The vacuum cleaner then blows or sucks the air and waste into the garbage. Again, vacuums and gravity are two different things.

       I can show you all the experiments done in a vacuum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Combustion does not work in a vacuum. Air flow doesn't work in a vacuum.  Actually, the ship itself could not handle the pressure of a vacuum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most NASA supporters don't even look into vacuum chamber experiments.  Know what else is funny? NASA did one test in a vacuum chamber and the guy lasted about ten seconds before his guts started being pulled from his body. They shut it down and never did another, instead switching to Swimming Pools for training.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch what a vacuum does.

       Most NASA sympathizers don't even look at the vacuum. It disproves NASA.

      <p>
       No, because their's no air to create a pressure differential. But, if you put a large aluminum box in the vacuum of space and filled it with air, you could easily create a pressure differential.

       I think normal clothes look weird in space. Like baggy shirts floating all around... same with women's hair. Why do they always let it float around wildly rather than doing it neatly. Hell.. would you even want all that hair loose in the trillion dollar space station? It should be like a clean room... Nothing really makes any sense.. unless you imagine it's all fake....

       But you are right I mean you can come up with explanations to explain things if you try...it's not totally out of the realm of possibility.

       Yea, we used to talk for hours about NASA hygiene and whether satellites even existed. I have a great memory, almost photographic.   You were very defensive of NASA back then.  So I'm shocked to see you write they can't even get people up there. You have come a long way.

       Oh, ok, I was being hopeful. I thought it was a contradiction you would defend them wearing belts , then say NASA can't fly them up there. I see you have actually made no ground in your perception of the fake NASA, only made it into a Russian 'thang'. Maybe next year you will see the deception. I won't give up on you yet!

       It's not just costs though.. there's no reason for belts in space.. it's absurd just saying it. Polo shirts as well. I think people that don't see this are being naive or haven't given the video enough thought. They are hiding things intentionally.

       'Very low gravity' ha, it's either gravity or NOT.  They don't just have the earth gravity, but the sun, according g to them the sun has the largest mass and gravity.  You think there is Less of the sun's gravity while in earth orbit???

       No, they couldn't float if the e was gravity Anywhere in space.  And get cavity doesn't get weak inside a gravitational field.  It's a constant force. This is what science tells us.

       Do you understand that opposing forces an cancel out?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if I push you in one direction while someone else pushes you in the opposite direction with the same amount of force, you will not move in either direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does that make sense?
      </p>
      <p>
       So a spacecraft is travelling around the earth at a speed that would generate a "centrifugal force" of 1 g, but earth's gravity is pulling inwards at a force of 1 g too. These two forces cancel out and the spacecraft stays the same distance from the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       To accomplish this, the spacecraft must be moving laterally at high speed. This is called "orbit".

       It's not rocket science.

       Why? They're at the same speed and acceleration as the ISS. Think about driving in your car, you only feel the push of momentum when accelerating or decelerating, when your body is traveling at the same speed as the car, you can move about normally.

       In a car, the only thing causing the occupant to turn is the action of the turning vehicle... in orbit, gravity is acting upon the occupant equally to the vehicle.

      <p>
       Right, but it exerts an equal force in proportion to mass on both the occupant and the ISS so it doesn't affect the motion of those objects in relation to each other, so in the reference frame of the ISS and the occupant, you can ignore it.

      <p>
       Again, "Zero G" is a measurement of acceleration. The occupants and the ISS are traveling at the same speed with the same acceleration towards the Earth, the same acceleration towards the moon, the same acceleration towards the Sun, etc. Therefore, in reference to each other, there is zero G's of acceleration.

       Sometimes upside down. Some of their earlier stuff they experimented with hanging upside down and inverting the camera so simulate weightlessness. Not all, but some were done this way. Very red faces and hair is a giveaway.
