IF we did fake the moon landing... how could we have done this knowing that at some point in the near future some other country would actually land on the moon and then the world would see from inconsistencies that we faked it?</p>

<p>The only way they could fake it and know they would get away with it is if they KNEW that humans would never actually do it.</p>

<p>OR it&#39;s possible they might have some excuse to explain why they faked it. Like &quot;we had to win the cold war&quot;. But even then they probably knew it wouldn&#39;t be discovered for a long long time... and it hasn&#39;t... how though??</p>

There were reports about this someone at NASA read.. and there was no solution.

    <div class="md"><p>But I think you can see from the footage that exists that the old stuff was faked. Like how the astronauts can only jump so high.. how the dust flies.. how they slowed down the footage to make it look like they are on the moon.</p>

<p>Maybe they have a good excuse planned for faking it.. that&#39;s all I can imagine.. or they know that we can&#39;t leave the Earth for some reason...</p>

<p>Or maybe the people in control of the US at the time didn&#39;t care what our reputation was in the future... maybe they just didn&#39;t give a crap about the US&#39;s reputation. That&#39;s actually a big possibility. They could just blame people in charge at the time.. like how Oswald was a patsy in the JFK assassination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think Musk is legit. Maybe they are going to Mars though to avoid people seeing how the Moon was fake? Maybe that&#39;s why they faked the moon because they always knew the real target was Mars and everyone would go there so people would never see that the moon was fake?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>cmon. :D You can ping the laser placed on the moon. You can fly around the moon for prox. 90 million USD and yes you would see the now complete white flag. 
It was not a fake. It could be done again. And i think the chinese are planing to do so. I love the idea of a new moon landing. :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read that the surface of the moon itself reflects lasers.. but the mirror could have been placed robotically as well. The Chinese and many other countries seemed to be involved in the deception. Why would they all join together for this purpose? Just like the Antarctica treaty.</p>
