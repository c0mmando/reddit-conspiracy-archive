       Think about this.. IF we did fake the moon landing... how could we have done this knowing that at some point in the near future some other country would actually land on the moon and then the world would see from inconsistencies that we faked it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way they could fake it and know they would get away with it is if they KNEW that humans would never actually do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       OR it's possible they might have some excuse to explain why they faked it. Like "we had to win the cold war". But even then they probably knew it wouldn't be discovered for a long long time... and it hasn't... how though??

       If we were able to get to the moon in the 60's, think of the technology we have now.  You'd think going to the moon would be cake now. Why have there been no manned landings since then?

       Because there is no money in it. It costs a buttload, and there is nothing to mine,  nothing worth bringing back and selling. A moon base would be highly inefficient cost wise compared to ISS.

       I saw a video recently of some NASA person talking about the challenge of existing in the radiation beyond high earth's orbit, way above the ISS. When I saw that, I got confused, as I thought we had no problem with the radiation in space or on the moon in 1969 and the early 70's.

       There is one major thing that can't be explained. How could the lunar lander land on the moon and not disturb the soil below it when it came down? There is a huge rocket underneath it that should have blasted a crater underneath the lander when it came down. Totally undisturbed.

       Because the moon surface is a very fine dust and the rocket had a very narrow ejection area. And lander would have to come down in a very controlled way - straight down. There were reports about this someone at NASA read.. and there was no solution. Yet in the actual footage supposedly from the moon there was no crater and there wasn't even moon dust on the lander's feet.

       A governments number 1 concern when controlling their populace is to control the money, and taxes. Any stupid thing we won't put up a fight for them spending money on they will exploit to no end. Inflate people's egos and they will give you even more money. Similar to a used car sales man. Governments figured out it's a great way to scam the populace, and at the same time inflate their egos a bit. The human race is not going to ever leave this planet, so we might as well start getting our shit together.

       But I think you can see from the footage that exists that the old stuff was faked. Like how the astronauts can only jump so high.. how the dust flies.. how they slowed down the footage to make it look like they are on the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they have a good excuse planned for faking it.. that's all I can imagine.. or they know that we can't leave the Earth for some reason...
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe the people in control of the US at the time didn't care what our reputation was in the future... maybe they just didn't give a crap about the US's reputation. That's actually a big possibility. They could just blame people in charge at the time.. like how Oswald was a patsy in the JFK assassination.

       I don't think Musk is legit. Maybe they are going to Mars though to avoid people seeing how the Moon was fake? Maybe that's why they faked the moon because they always knew the real target was Mars and everyone would go there so people would never see that the moon was fake?

       cmon. :D You can ping the laser placed on the moon. You can fly around the moon for prox. 90 million USD and yes you would see the now complete white flag. 
It was not a fake. It could be done again. And i think the chinese are planing to do so. I love the idea of a new moon landing. :)

       I read that the surface of the moon itself reflects lasers.. but the mirror could have been placed robotically as well. The Chinese and many other countries seemed to be involved in the deception. Why would they all join together for this purpose? Just like the Antarctica treaty.
