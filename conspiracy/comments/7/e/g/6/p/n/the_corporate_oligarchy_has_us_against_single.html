       The bank bailouts in 2008 were single payer insurance and it  supposedly worked. Medicaid forall is the exact same system but won't work bc people have to actually work for the money and not scam. It just proves that the richer you are, the more you rely on others in the way they say if you're poor, you relie on others.

       Literally the only difference between us and the rich is that they have accumulated vast wealth and use it against us.  Other than that, they are people just like us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, somehow, the people who accumulate the most wealth in history regularly screw the poor so bad, violent revolution occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe, just maybe, we should have always been against anyone who hoards wealth.

       Its absolutely a conspiracy but good luck getting political commentators / leftists / economists to talk about it like that.  Or even other conspiracy theorists!
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we should be looking more closely at what private corporations are doing because that is clearly where the action is, conspiracy wise.  What happens in washington is basically stage management at this point, theater.  (Unless we are talking about what the intelligence agencies are  doing or what is going on inside the pentagon.)

       Yes, that is probably what they will do to mesmerize the growing number of people who support Sanders and are joining the DSA.  That does not mean they will actually do it in office -- they can always point at the Republicans and say, "they wouldn't let us do it!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The democrats routinely kill healthcare legislation like a public option during obama's first time, and legislation that even far right republicans support, such as the bill which would make it legal for americans to buy their perscription drugs from Canada.  Even now most of them won't make even a symbolic show of support for Sanders' medicare for all bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       The democrats will not do anything to help anyone.  Their job is to neutralize leftist political movements and shut down popular political policies that are left of the desires of the ruling class.  If single payer or a public option ever comes to america, it will be in spite of the democrats, and anyone who is serious about fixing the american health care system should abandon the democratic party and their internal politics.

       It was only reluctantly added to the platform in 2016 because of Sander's campaign -- it would not have been on there otherwise.  This is the party which openly and unapologetically cheated in their own primary elections to elevate a woman who said that single payer was impossible and would never happen in the United States. Then when she suddenly starts supporting a public option in the middle of a political campaign against a leftist insurgent, we are supposed to believe the party is serious about fighting for a public option?  The party that cheated to sabotage a real reformer in favor of a woman who literally told her wall street masters that she has a public position and another, different, private position?  You need to stop playing their game imo.  They work for the health insurance companies.

       Wealth and power has so completely transferred into the private sector that basically the government is wholly illusory.  The finance people control the entire countries wealth (and much of the WORLD's wealth) and have massive, completely unaccountable power.  Until ecological collapse destroys the present mode of civilization, the government's main job is to dismantle itself and misdirect people's energies.  Besides that, all it will be allowed to do is steal money from poor people and put it to use for society's masters, such as to fund the police state or military action against states which don't fall in line with neoliberal economic doctrine.

       Medicare is much more efficient than private health care and happens to be the most popular coverage plan by large amount. Private healthcare companies provide no real benefit and siphon off prophets as a rapacious middleman. This is why America has the most expensive Health Care in the world and it's not even close. Stop parroting the propagandized talking points of the right wing. They're not on your side.

       ? That is literally
       <em>
        all leftists talk about

       . This is why socialists advocate for socialism, because ownership of capital in our society is equivalent to ownership of power, and that power has been and always
       <em>
        will be
       </em>
       leveraged against the working class.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even forgetting
       <em>
        socialism
       </em>
       , if you want "pro capitalism, but anti-corporate/"big capital", that's pretty much descriptive of other leftie ideologies like Left-Wing Market Anarchism, which opposes corporations on the grounds that they give undeserved and unfair state privileges to specific businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberals are shitty treacherous dogs who'd all us all out for a good speech and a song, but
       <em>

       are absolutely the staunchest opponents of oligarchy in existence.

       You misunderstand me, I agree with much of your post and definitely leftists are interested in and talk about the stuff the OP is talking about.  What I meant to say before, is that leftists DONT talk about power in terms of a conspiracy theory.  They talk about it in a number of different ways, none of which are satisfactory and none of which offer any solutions in my view (you may or may not agree, but that isn't even the point I'm arguing for now, I just mention it to explain where I'm coming from).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why I called out leftists in my post is because I think a 'conspiracy' way-of-thinking (if you can kind of understand what I'm talking about?) is missing from their critique of power.  Like I'd like to see them start mapping out power relationships on a bulletin board with notecards connected by string, talking about specific people and specific institutions, concrete problems, instead of german idealism and 'capital', in the case of the marxists.  Leftists seem to be really averse to conspiracy-minded thinking, for some reason.  Chomsky is a good example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway we can discuss this more at length if you want but I just wanted to clarify what I was saying.

       From an outside perspective your lack of a nationalised health system does seem crazy. I think it's in part due to your two party system. Without a workers Labour party you missed out on healthcare sick leave, maternity/ paternity pay and decent amount of payed holidays that other countries enjoy. More parties representing the poor would help.

       I recently took an economics class. The professor explained that economists have been using super computers for years to determine how to set prices on a regional scale. This formula takes into account rent and property costs and salary then the products are  all assigned a category and percentage. So if you live in a low property cost area your food might be more expensive or cars might be more expensive.if you live in a high cost of living area then your food might be cheaper or maybe daycares are cheaper but your rent is very expensive. This is why no matter if you are college educated or a tradesmen everyone is trapped. When the professor talked about this I thought how is this capitalism? It's price fixing and gouging and it is done on a massive scale by these global conglomerates.

       There was something 5/7 years back where a team of economists developed a global commodities price software program (can't remember the exact name).  It sounded like the same thing you are talking about.  Then it was bought and kept secret before release.  I wish I had the link or could remember where to find it (ZeroHedge covered it).

       I heard about it in July. No one in the class was creeped out by it. In fact it seems this is common knowledge. Every price we pay is quantified by a complex system that measures our ability to pay for it. All that data mining is being put to good use.

       This sounds like bs. If you're in a low property value area, in other words a low income area, there's a lower limit to how high you can set your prices before people stop buying products.  In a high property value area, you can set prices much higher while keeping customers.  The assumption made is that the people in the low property value and high property value regions have the same income when they most likely don't.  This is why people complain about gentrification; when property values start to go up in a low income neighborhood, higher priced businesses open up because they now have the opportunity of reaching a higher income clientele.  Also if there are regional differences in prices on certain goods, it opens up arbitrage opportunities which tightens the spread between the low price where the product is bought and the high price where it is sold.  Price gouging isn't unethical and the only entity that fixes prices is the Government.

       I did not say it was price gouging. I said super computers are utiliz d by conglomerates to set prices to gain max profits. If prices are too low the business loses money. Too high and no one buys. Except this is done on a massive regional scale taking wages and housing into account. Needs verses wants.

       You need to think bigger. The computer models take wages into account, they know where people shop and who their target customer is. People on government assistance shop in the dollar store people who earn more shop in upscale stores. Price gouging is unethical if you charge one price to people in one income bracket and a different price to those in a different bracket. Price fixing is done by corporations all the time just look at pharma and health care. The government enables this. In fact I will go a step further in medical industry the correct term is predatory pricing.

       I think you're agreeing with me to an extent.  What you said before was they charge lower prices for certain goods in high property value areas, and higher prices for the same goods in low property value areas.  What you're saying now seems to be that they charge higher prices in high income areas, and lower prices in low income areas.  I don't think this is unethical primarily because every transaction is voluntary, but people can also travel to different neighborhoods if the prices are that much better and competition will undercut artificially inflated prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for price gouging, it is necessary when there are supply shortages.  For instance, during the recent hurricanes there were shortages of food and water.  Higher prices for those goods will entice producers to bring food and water to the area, because it is profitable to do so.  Same thing with Uber's "surge" pricing -- it entices drivers to give rides during emergencies, like the Sydney terrorist attack, which the drivers deserve because they are putting themselves in danger.  When it comes to medications, say for rare diseases, it is necessary for pharma corps to charge high prices in order to recoup the R&amp;D costs to produce the drugs in the first place, and when very few people have the disease the cost is spread over less people.  There is more research I need to do into healthcare, insurance and the government's involvement with it though so I don't have much else to say about that issue.

       Setting prices on a regional scale is not a neighborhood price a region of a country is vast. Not based on a neighborhood. Again we are not talking about a mom and pop shop selling milk. This is a complex system in which one area will charge a range for automobiles and a different range for insurance. Both are needs and it is not feasible to drive to another region however many dealers do just that. They purchase cars in a lower priced region and resell them in higher priced region. That is simple business and profits. This is common knowledge. What is not common knowledge is that these prices are set based on ability to pay as assessed by a super computer in conjunction with other goods so that everyone gets a slice of the pie. It is done with disclosure to the consumer. There are no consumer groups that can negotiate prices or rates and there is no way for the consumer to not buy necessities. I am not questioning that a company can set their price, I have a problem with them using income data mined on a broad scale and sharing data among other conglomerates while the consumer has no recourse to influence those prices. Necessities are not wants and must be bought....we are not talking about tv's.

       How is this price fixing? It's not competitors agreeing to raise prices and leave consumers with no choice. It's just a business finding out how much people will pay for something and charging that amount. It's a computer attempting to remove trial and error from a calculation of supply and demand. Basic capitalism that hurts no one.

       They are not making an educated guess though. Data mining eliminates the guess work. If you need food whether you like it or not you are going to pay 24% of your income in food. There is no choice when it comes to basic needs. So the price is not set based on cost but rather solid data of how much you have in your wallet. That might not creep you out but most people would be very disturbed that conglomerates are basing price on ability to pay and not costs. In addition this is how hospitals set their prices, if an insurance pays out 1000 for a test then that test is priced at 1000, another persons insurance pays only 500 for that same test. The actual term for setting prices based on insurances pay scales is called predatory pricing. It is considered very unethical. To do that to a consumer without disclosing it is predatory and not transparent.

       My problem with single payer is that I don't trust our government to do it right. Single payer only saves money when the payer negotiates prices aggressively. Medicare already doesn't negotiate any prescription drug prices. I don't see any reason why a more universal single payer system wouldn't fall prey to the same lobbyists and obstruction.

       It would require a paradigm shift and reevaluation of the system. Will the lobbying structure and power of big pharma/insurance companies go quietly, or shift? Will the obstructors within the major parties allow it to pass? The system is absolutely ingrained as it stands.

       Most people who pay attention and are objectively rational realized that he would be ineffectual if not a disaster. There were tons of people, from both sides of the isle, talking about how bad he would be.

       The guy consistently verifiably lied. The guy consistently made remarks that made it clear that he didn't understand. They guy consistently revealed that he didn't have the temperament for the job. We are in a period of anti-establishment, which is understandable, but that doesn't mean it isn't dumb to vote for any damn fool who walks in off the street simply because they are anti-establishment.

       While I had little interest in Clinton, she was clearly better suited to the role than Trump.

       And I can blame them, he proved himself a clueless liar over and over again throughout the race. Pretty much everything bad about Clinton, Trump was worse about, except for being "establishment." Hell, even then it is hard to call him anti-establishment, because he was wealthy and well connected, even in the political scene.

       I've got no problem calling people who voted for him stupid. He duped them. And it was obvious what was happening if you weren't so focused on voting anti-establishment.

       There was.  The United States decided they didn't want anyone to have that conversation and destabilized governments to prevent socialist revolution and did things like punishing Cuba just for being socialist for sixty years.  Our news equates social programs in South American countries with "socialism" and always presents it as the "failure of socialism." Maybe just maybe those news organizations all being capitalist organizations owned by Trusts has something to do with that.

       Don't forget that they ignore countries where socialist policies work. Or they point to certain times where the systems failed people and present them as reasons to why (for example) Canada's health system is a hellhole where people are dying on the streets.

       We could start a 3rd political party, like the Greens or the Tea Party or something. But, considering that the system is designed to prevent a 3rd party from becoming a major force, we can see that it may not work.

       What enlightening suggestions from a whisperingPenis.
I'm leaning toward a combination of 1 and 2. The US has grown soft in terms of protest, at least since Vietnam was the last major revolutionary/violent protesting. A departure from the twoparty system with some heavy/extreme protesting overshadowing the recent women's march would be a good step. "Guide to Civil Disobedience" is my recommended read for everyone.
      </p>

       Bitcoin will likely continue to rise on its own with the "Ubering" Peer-to-peer markets of remaining industries throughout the next few decades. With luck, the financial/economic repercussions of parallel currencies can shatter governments and industries. We would just need to embrace it.

       Conflating health insurance with the whole of the issue of access to healthcare is a bit nonsensical. Insurance companies are only part of the issue. It's just not that simple. Calling for single payer healthcare as a response to rising healthcare costs is like putting out a campfire with a fire hose. To investigate the issue completely, you have to look at the whole of the west. International pharmaceutical corporations sell to an array of markets, some with more price regulations than others. To make up for lost profits from regulated markets, they over charge unregulated markets. Your $25 pain medicine in the UK is part of why the same medicine costs me $75 in America, when the price needs to be about $50. Price regulations on international companies have to take into consideration international markets. 100 years ago if you tried to put a price ceilings on domestic drugs that made the production of drugs unprofitable, you couldn't do it. You'd kill the industry. Nowadays you can get away with it no problem, they'll just subsidize the lost profits by charging more in another market in another country.

       Healthcare facility costs are excessive, overly grandiose and decadent. There is a greater emphasis on amenities and luxury than healthcare. Go to a Baylor facility, you'll get what I'm saying right away-you'd think these were Ivy League university campuses or something. The only way around this is to go to more humble facilities and hope you are still getting great care.

      <p>
       Medical supply manufacturers overcharge healthcare companies, to the extent that something like $20 forceps end up being $700 forceps on a medical bill. This needs to stop, there need to be maximum prices for the sale of these products.
      </p>
      <p>
       Health insurance companies should be subject to federal mandates to provide care for people with pre-existing conditions. Period. The taking on of such patients should provide a tax credit to compensate.

      <p>
       Am Canadian. We don't have health insurance to see doctors. We have insurance for stuff like Dental and Optical which makes those industries very much like the US. As a result, dentistry is insanely expensive here.

       Ditch the Insurance companies altogether. They're nothing more than parasites and enablers for the other industries that jack up the costs.

       I can't speak to your situation specifically in Canada, but in America, healthcare costs were rising dramatically fast long before health insurance was in wide use. In fact, the HMO was the solution presented by the state via subsidies to combat these rising costs.

       If the US were to implement single pay health care, it'd just make each State it's own independent care provider. You guys have 50 states and they'd all be doing the same thing which is buying in bulk and shopping around for the best bang for the buck products. That means there's no shortage of competition.

       Innovation happens in both the private sector but also the public sector, and in the academic sector as well. The private sector has no lock on ingenuity. They may spend more on R&amp;D, but they also charge the most so they're not really in it to be altruistic.

       True. You're just confused about providers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making a State government a health care provider instead of the myriad of insurance companies makes it way easier to eliminate a lot of the red tape which is a huge waste of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, you still need companies to sell products. They still compete against other companies. It's just that the Government pays them rather than the insurance companies.

       The rates are very close. Yet they live longer and spend half as much healthcare as america. And they are the single, largest, most comprehensive single payer health system in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       So please try to explain your reasoning behind competition driving down costs, and increasing quality in the health care market? Because the facts would hold that is not true.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for innovation, I'd call that a wash. Free market brings innovation, but not the kind that benefits people. Free market health care favours innovation in search of better profits. Single payer health care favours innovation in search of increased efficiency and better patient outcome as it reduces demand on the system.

       There isn't a free market for health care in the us. Costs are only higher much later after Medicaid went into action. Check out the book "Capitalism and Freedom" by Milton Friedman. He predicted the destruction of the us market back in the 60s. He was arguing we already had socialized health care back then

       It is seriously pathetic that we don't have proper universal healthcare yet. We are supposed to be the top nation in the world yet we can't even pay for peoples hospital bills. They need to seriously rework the whole healthcare system from top to bottom.... you know a regular routine blood test costs like $200? An ambulance ride is like $800. These prices are ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       We as a country should unite and push this issue to the extreme. I want my taxes to pay for local stuff, health and education of community, not wars in foreign countries. Make it happen. Universal healthcare is possible, the Medicaid/medical assistance program that gives you several choices to pick from works very well while still incorporating most of the existing health insurance companies (under gov't supervision).
      </p>
      <p>
       Other focus should be education. Free breakfast/lunch for poor kids, free daycare, improved studies, more in depth "health" class that goes over wider variety of subjects like career choices, planning your money, how to do basic taxes, with more emphasis on safe sex since way too many people having kids who shouldn't. Scholarship incentives for poor kids. Lower tuition across the board for colleges.
      </p>
      <p>
       We spend billions on military and americans get dicked. Why the fuck do people keep letting this happen? Instead we argue with each other about stupid, useless shit like race or gender.... which are non-issues since both can succeed and have no barrier to success anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to vote every 2 years too, congress is just as important if not more then the president. I wish they would just clean house and replace them ALL with new candidates. Greed has made me sick of these damn politicians.... they must be seriously in debt or have done some fucked up shit and being blackmailed to be this arrogant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The corrupt republicans will have corporations ruining the government, and the corrupt democrats will just end up with the same thing but corrupt government officials with corporate backing screwing shit up... either way americans get fucked. I keep hearing that we need a third party, and I'm all for libertarians getting in the mix, but they don't seem to support stuff like healthcare or programs/aide for low income people.... democrat seems like the best way to lean but they need to clean house.

       Every blood test I've had through several illnesses over the decades, I've not paid for a single one. My last suicide attempt? Ambulance showed up, took me to hospital, I thanked them and they went on their way to help someone else. Never had to pay for it. Tests and treatment for a cancer scare, depression, even minor surgery?
      </p>
      <p>
       Never paid a penny. Not directly, as a bill for service, at least. More as part of my taxes, if anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love the NHS. Still pretty shocking that basic affordable healthcare isn't a thing in the US.

       Yes, well that is how much those services usually are charged for, but insurance will pay some or all of it.... like the blood test will be $20-30 out of pocket. Doctors and hospitals tend to overcharge for stuff because insurance companies don't pay the full amount, say only 65% of it, and depending on your plan you may or may not have to pay the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its all just too expensive, doctors should charge less, insurance should pay more, pharm meds should cost less, and patients should pay less out of pocket. There will be pushback but its gotta be done.

       There isn't a free market for health care in the us. Costs are only higher much later after Medicaid went into action. Check out the book "Capitalism and Freedom" by Milton Friedman. He predicted the destruction of the us market back in the 60s. He was arguing we already had socialized health care back then
