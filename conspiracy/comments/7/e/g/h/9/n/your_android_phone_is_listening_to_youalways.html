My phone was next to me during the show. I have never heard of this brand, let-alone seen the commercial that they played in the show, which appears to be 30ish years old. Well 2 hours later, while selecting a new video on YT, that very same commercial came up on my phone. Again, I have never heard of this company or item before 2 hours ago. It&#39;s listening...</p>

Was doing a friendsgiving and telling friend A about how friend B gets a discount from his healthcare provider if he wears a fitbit and hits a certain number of steps daily. Next day an ad popped up on <em>Reddit</em> for healthcare companies who give fitness discounts. I don&#39;t have the reddit app but I do go on it on my phone from time to time.

    <div class="md"><p>IIRC somebody wrote an app (that required root priveleges to run) that would allow you to override individual app permissions on a one-off basis.</p>

<p>Basically, if an app wanted access to your microphone, camera, address book, and phone log - you could install the app with the permissions it required - and then immediately say &quot;nope, you&#39;re actually not getting access to microphone and camera - but you can still have access to address book and phone log&quot;.</p>

<p>Needless to say Google removed it from their app store.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if you can still download and manually install it or not, or if it&#39;s being maintained. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After this episode many people went to youtube to check out this comercial so it was kinda trending at this moment and this is why it was suggested to more people, like you? +selective perception?</p>

<p>Is this possible? </p>

<p>I mean, I could imagine phones listening all the time, but I find it odd, that they would let this data be used for delivering tailored comercials.</p>

<p>If there is some hidden &quot;always listening and and saving&quot; function, it&#39;s purpose would be more than giving us tailored comercials and they wouldn&#39;t risk us noticing this feature, by using it for those comercial stuff, don&#39;t you think?</p>

If you DON&#39;T like what&#39;s happening then, get rid of all your WiFi instruments. Go back to landline phone, antenna tv, typewriter and snail-mail.
You&#39;re all contributing to the cause while calling it a problem. The idiosyncrasy is stunning.</p>

One of my friends is an INFJ so we discussed that for a few minutes. Later that night as I was browsing through Instagram, I got an ad targeted specifically towards INFJs. That&#39;s the only time I&#39;ve observed something like this myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, yes, yes. I have been telling my friends this. My boyfriend and I were having a fun little chat in the car  one night about going on a cruise, and then of course when he took out his phone later to look something up, the ads on the page were for cruise deals. </p>

<p>Also, the smart tv listens. One night I started talking about some conspiracy stuff and a red light came on at the bottom of the screen where the mic is. It was moving with my voice and then it turned off again. It was so freaking weird. Another thing is whenever he wants to be silly if I ask where he’s going, he always gets a hillbilly accent going (his fave) and exclaims that he’s going to Vietnam. We literally never speak of Vietnam in any other context, but then Spotify started recommending a bunch of Vietnam playlists for him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. They don&#39;t need cameras on us because we put them on ourselves. Say or do something not in line with the status quo and you face the possibility of being publicly shamed on social media. We absolutely have to do something to get people to understand the implications of what this technology is doing to us. It&#39;s only going to get worse. It&#39;s destroying our very humanity. It is absolutely a DIRE situation but it&#39;s as if no one can really see it. </p>
