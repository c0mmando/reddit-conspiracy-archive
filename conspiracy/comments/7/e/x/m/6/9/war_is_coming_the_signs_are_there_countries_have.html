        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We are in the grips of a cold WWIII. Sounds crazy, but recent events are starting to make more sense when looked at under this lens. Factions within the US making moves, other countries stockpiling weapons, countries all dotting t&#39;s and crossing their i&#39;s in making sure everyone knows who&#39;s on who&#39;s side.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/zimbabwe-crisis-did-china-have-hand-military-plot-against-mugabe-n821286">https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/zimbabwe-crisis-did-china-have-hand-military-plot-against-mugabe-n821286</a></p>

<p>A coup in Zimbabwe.. A place where China gets uranium from. Iran has also shown interest in uranium deposits in Zimbabwe. People scrambling to get nukes up and running. Isn&#39;t it weird North Korea went from having shit technology to all of a sudden having the tech and had an &quot;accident&quot; where the tunnels caved in. I believe something big happened over there and people are pissed.</p>

<p>&quot;The 2014 Red Book notes 1400 tU as reasonably assured resources in the $130-260/kg bracket, and also speculative resources of 25,000 tU. Other reports mention a deposit at Kanyemba, north of Harare, in which Iran has expressed some interest.&quot;</p>

<p>Australia, China, Russia, and even Korea have been mining the uranium and planting their flags on mines all over Africa. The US too of course. It&#39;s going to suck when Africa&#39;s descendants realize their ancestors sold out all the countries resources for a quick buck.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/others/uranium-in-africa.aspx#ECSArticleLink14">http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/others/uranium-in-africa.aspx#ECSArticleLink14</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ewsks/china_unveils_19030mph_hypersonic_scattergun_nuke/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ewsks/china_unveils_19030mph_hypersonic_scattergun_nuke/</a></p>

<p>In a post earlier by a fellow redditor China unveiling super hypersonic cluster nukes. They are ready to make their move to be a world power, or they are signaling India to fuck right off. Tensions with China and India are really bad right now. This border tension is a bigger deal than it&#39;s made out to be. I believe WWIII will kick off in India. </p>

<p>China is also preparing for something happening in Korea. Again, I don&#39;t believe that tunnel collapse was a mere accident and I think China is pissed now that there is a risk of nuclear waste affecting  them. Or if the rumors are true and the CIA or some shady organization runs NOKO, then they may have recently found out and are double pissed.</p>

<p>The USA moving missile defense systems into South Korea, now of all times signals a few things. Either North Korea has missile nukes we are actually scared of. Or we are using this excuse of North Korea to get more military muscle near China and Asia in general. It also could be in preparation of war that is coming with India. It is hard to say if the USA is allied with China and would back something like a border dispute with India.</p>

<p>Russia and China are best bro&#39;s, they <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/881313/World-War-3-North-Korea-Russia-China-US-missiles">are practicing anti-missile drills in Beijing</a> and preparing for something to pop off. They are also super pissed about the USA&#39;s THAAD air defense saying it&#39;s radar penetrates into Chinese territory.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s signing of the space deal also was almost completely about military defense. We are preparing for major high tech battles. We are deploying military defense in our atmosphere for god&#39;s sake. Either that or the world is getting ready to fight aliens. (possible)</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about that South China Sea. Without it China is cut off from it&#39;s major import of fuel. India has the superior naval forces now with help from our US arms deal and selling them new Submarines. So it&#39;s looking like WWIII will be in Asia instead of the Middle east. China is pissing everyone off, their artificial island and claim to all of the south china sea compounds this.</p>

<p><a href="https://thelibertarianrepublic.com/china-duterte-south-chinese-sea/">https://thelibertarianrepublic.com/china-duterte-south-chinese-sea/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Neighboring countries are not set up with China overtaking the region.  Japan, for example, bought up the disputed island group of  Senkaku (Japanese)/ Diaoyutai (Chinese) in 2012 which led to a Cold War in the region. The United States are often prevented from entering the region by a provoking Chinese navy â€“ sometimes threatening to go to war.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>US/Israel/Saudi Arabia/European Nations/India vs. China/Russia/North Korea/Iran. Australia is kind of a wild card.. has to choose between regional allies and stability or allies abroad. Japan is also another wildcard. They could harbor resentment against the USA for nuking them, or they could want to put the bully China in it&#39;s place. As with the other countries in the area, their allegiance is hard to place. I think this is why Trump had a tour of all the asian countries and meetings with their leaders.</p>

<p>I believe it is unavoidable at this point guys. The powers that be want war and are willing to distract us by sacrificing the pedo&#39;s in our government to gain the support for it. Trump becomes the hero right before asking us to engage in WWIII. Thoughts folks?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isolation is happening both in military and economically.</p>

<p>Look at NAFTA, TPP and Paris Climate Agreement.</p>

<p>White supremacist (European Political Zionist) under the guise of the Republican party didn&#39;t want to have a deal that put money everywhere in the world so they pulled out.</p>

<p>All of Rothschild&#39;s money is tied up in dirty energy, coal, oil, etc. Green energy combats that directly. So that is why Trump is so against it. Such a plan would bring countries like Saudi Arabia to it&#39;s knees and even Kill the petro dollar. </p>

<p>So naturally, they fight it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think we have much more time left before this goes hot. We see that the economy is getting worse and worse all over the world. Economic warfare is almost finished, sanctions can only last so long.</p>

<p>Although everyone won&#39;t agree with the policies, our President still has the power to make our country look better or worse. Sadly, this time, all the chips were stacked against us and we still decided to bet big. As I always say, it will be pride that ends us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you really look at it there has been only one war waged on the average person with intervals for the elite to show each other their fancy new toys, we call those periods &quot;hot wars&quot; If only we could gain some perspective we might decide to quit this grand blood letting,  problem is that the only war that ever matters is the war on our hearts and minds. Rest assured we will have another hot war, It seems to occur during our technological leaps. We have been prepped for the 4th revolution. when it is through, they say, this world will be unrecognizable. Get ready for the hot war with drones the size of bees swarming through villages, massive network blackouts, and then a grand solution. Most likely a Sophia of some kind, the logic of AI One supreme being, the birth of our new savior, ex google exec has already started the church, such a forward thinker!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because China is getting too big and they dont have enough resources so a country must expand. They know if they attack Japan they will be dealing with the US. If they expand North than they go against their only alliance which is Russia. Only way is to go is east and I mean even though India would be a tough fight India would probably be fighting two fronts. East which is Pakistan and West which is china. A quick war that will bring many countries into the mix especially if nukes are introduced(which I really doubt). China is advancing in tech very quickly these past few years. thanks to hacking of government and private industries along with their own research and development. Currently China is the only country with Hypersonic bombers and nukes and a quantum satellite and ground stations that are no longer vulnerable to hacking and may even over power other nations cyber security and electrical grid </p>

NSA warning against quantum computer attacks that could destry modern day encryption and cryptography. If China is succesful in taking of getting into major computer controlled industries such as military(nukes) or into the power grid there for makong Indias nukes useless.

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessary. I don&#39;t count that as strategic it&#39;s more economic.</p>

<p>Foremost it&#39;s about redundancy. No matter what it&#39;s of most importance that you can keep your logistics running. Frontline is very resource hungry. If you can&#39;t keep up the supply for example tank shells than those 1000&#39;s of tanks are just lawn decoration.
Factories need raw materials to produce everything from bandage to bullets and machines. Water, Gas, Electricity can&#39;t be down. Otherwise the whole machine grinds to a hold</p>

<p>Can&#39;t rely on just one road leading from a harbor (inport raw material) to a industrial zones located who knows 100 of miles away from the shore. You want to make sure when a bomb falls on a intersection you can reroute those lines to 3, 5 or more alternatives.</p>

<p>The silk road is one line, in time of conflict it would be a unreliable and you can bet it will be targeted in the early stage of conflict. It&#39;s only good for a first wave surprise assault but later in the conflict useless </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two more important factors:   1)  The economic meltdown of 2010 was a cover-up,  and economic factors have been rigged ever since,  such that pension funds,  personal debt,  government debt are going to default and war is the most obvious political solution in the face of a public that will revolt.  2)   With millions of refugees already,   hundreds of bombed cities already,   millions already ruined from a &quot;regional&quot; war in the Middle East and Northern Africa,  but spilling over with a refugee invasion in Europe,   when the start of this new &quot;Cold War&quot; is identified,  it will go back to:</p>
