       I agree 100%. As a person who actually studied the effects of TV violence in college, I can say with absolute certainty that Adult Swim is some of the worst media poison I have ever seen. I highly recommend staying away from that garbage. It’s absolutely toxic and can lead to deep loathing, depression, anger, and aggression.

       Elsagate has been some more of the nastiest stuff I have ever seen, and the YT allows and copyright infringement doesn't shut it down and that is has millions of views is way suspect.

       Elsagate looks like MK ultra.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2 main media forms of poison are:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Physical Violence which creates street violence on a massive scale, causes bursts of anger among people leading to fights, causes antisocial criminal behavior, and much more on a MASSIVE nationwide scale.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Psychological Violence found most commonly in TV comedy sitcoms where someone is constantly saying something manipulative or insulting and the audience is laughing at the same time. This leads to social degeneracy, lack of empathy, division, relationship problems, and much, much more on a massive nationwide scale.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The third popular media poison is the display of poor behavior in dramas which leads to misery, division, confusion, and social disorientation on a massive nationwide scale.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Each show is like food in that each one has its own flavor and is designed to do something specific. Sometimes they want to make you believe disinformation for social control purposes. Mostly they want to fuck up your mental health by attacking it in various ways per show. The mind is so vast that one show can only attack one part of it at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
       These Zionists who control our media are sick puppies. It takes very demented people to do things like this to the unsuspecting masses. The biggest secret is that you don’t realize it happening. You think everything bad that happens is just the way life is but in reality, the media poison is responsible for many of life’s woes.

       Do decent people feel the impulse to disengage?  I find myself able to acknowledge when a carrier message is in a program and don't watch much tv as a result.

       Web you enter the tain you are willingly accepting the story you are told as an archytype. Your guard is down and you are getting instructions on what other monkies like you have done to get results you witness. Something wholesome like leave it to beaver will package a paternal life lesson about a moral dilemma. Something like an adult swim will teach antisocial pathological and absurdly violent images and archytype that impart chaos and confusion in your limbic state.

       Let’s just put it this way. I feel like I am a full blown media poison specialist that can be an expert witness in court to testify against it and if I watch Adult Swim for a few months, every corner of my life will suffer in some way.
      </p>

       It’s not all happening in the conscience mind. A lot of it is happening in the unconscience mind which we cannot control. Just as a random example, an annoying nagging friend might make you snap and yell at him or her. In your mind, he or she was being so obnoxious that you lost your cool. In reality, Adult Swim shortened up your fuse so that you end up snapping faster and ending up on an arguement that has the potential to divide you from your friend and weaken society. There are many examples like this. It’s uncontrollable outside of a few things such as people who will never kill anyone no matter how many times they see it on TV. That’s just what’s happening on the surface though. Most of it is beneath the surface.

       Reminds me of the GTA series.
Not even considering the voice, but if you've noticed the NPCs are constantly belittling the player.
When I'm high and playing the game I can't help but think that they're trying to psychologically program people playing the game.

       Can you explain? I don't really see how. Not trying to be rude or dismissive. To be fair I haven't really watched any Adult Swim since Tim &amp; Eric stopped making new episodes so it has been a minute. If you don't mind pointing me in the direction of some links or anything it would be appreciated.

       I read this in college textbooks so no links but in a big nutshell: Monkey see, Monkey do.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, you see people first fighting in a movie. Your mind is experience this fighting as you watch the movie. This experience brings you a few steps closer to actually mimicking the behavior in some form (ie verbally attacking, road rage). Since it makes it more likely for this behavior to occur, it ends up increasing the number of hostile situations you run into.

       But what about Adult Swim in particular. Let's just take the show Aqua Teen Hunger Force, for example. It seems pretty mindless. Is there something in it that you find poisoning? If not, what shows are? (Again, sorry for all the questions, just trying to understand)

       I haven’t seen much or Adult Swim because irs way to gross and I don’t want or ruin myself but I’ll gice random examples of stuff I rememeber seeing.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         People kept puking over an ugly women that the audience never saw. The puking people would say horribly offensive stuff after puking. The puke creates a feeling of disgust. The show makes the viewers think this is how to react when seeing someone one finds unattractive so it increases bullying and division.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         That mike Tyson show is meant to create a scenario where the audience laughs at a well meaning man for being stupid. The idea here is to increase division, make dumb people feel ashamed of themselves, and to make society laugh at dumber people instead of healthier behavior.

       In fairness so does most everything. This subreddit does. It's not as bad as 4chan by any means but I've been on r/conspiracy for near 7 years now over a dozen different accounts and have seen the most stable level headed individuals slowly drive themselves to madness.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I'm sure most everyone on here would agree with me, the most important thing is not allowing yourself to be conditioned which is merely a matter of having a clear line between reality and entertainment. Also not going to hardcore on the conspiracy stuff. I spend a good amount of time reading on here but have greatly limited my posting just because we can get kinda salty with each other

       I️ personally have felt weird about some cartoons for a long time. I️ remember shows like Johnny Bravo and Ren and Stimpy made me feel strange, like I️ probably shouldn’t be subjecting my psychological well-being to them.

       John k changed a lot of ren/stimpy after the network approved the episode  - very unethical and possibly illegal. It's why the early ones had scenes that seemed bolted on and very inappropriate subject matter
