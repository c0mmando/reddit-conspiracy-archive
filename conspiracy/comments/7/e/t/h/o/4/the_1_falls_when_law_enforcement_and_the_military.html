    <div class="md"><p>Monarch systems, the military serve and protect the queen and king. The global oligarchy system resembles a monarch in many ways. Perhaps you can brainstorm about how past monarch systems fell.<br/>
Rome was severally weakened by the introduction of a new religion (Christianity). The power of intention has super-natural influence. Sorry if this sounds weird, but the rise of contrary belief systems seems to destroy cultures and societies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I entertained the idea of getting the people
to bribe congress back (fight fire with fire type thing).
But I dunno.
Really I think the public awareness should increase about
getting money out of politics + nationalizing the FED + ending the CIA.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing these are the biggest 3 hurdles against democracy but  I&#39;m not certain it&#39;s a full proof plan but definitely a good start
at weakening the elites.
Doing something about corporate media propaganda would also help (regulations against lying? If a viewer reports a false fact, TV media outlet has to spend significant time retracting).
I dunno, what are other slightly less brainwashed countries doing
with their media? U.S. media is so blatantly dishonest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot; <em>In penetrating into the origin of the great fortunes, this vital fact is constantly forced upon the investigator: that Law has been the most valuable asset possessed by the capitalist class. Without it, this class would have been as helpless as a babe. What would the medieval baron have been without armed force?  But note how conditions have changed. The capitalist class, far shrewder than the feudalistic rulers, dispenses with personally equipped armed force. It becomes superfluous. All that is necessary to do is make the laws, and so guide things that the officials who enforce the laws are responsive to the interests of the propertied classes. Back of the laws are police forces and sheriffs and militia, all kept at the expense of city, county, and State--at public espense. Clearly, then, having control of the laws and of the officials, the propertied classes have the full benefit of armed forces the expense of which, however, they do not have to defray. It has unfolded itself as a vast improvement over the crude feudal system.</em> &quot;</p>

The 1% are largely just the business owners who create jobs and generate wealth.
The 1% has ca. 40% of the wealth. True. BUT. The 1% also foots ca. 50% of the bill.
This is why socialism always collapses a country. When you strip the 1% then who picks up the bill? It is you. And without the people to continue to generate wealth there is collapse and poverty.</p>
