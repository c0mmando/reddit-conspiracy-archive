       Very true. The military originally chose trump to go against the cabal. This is how trump is protected from the cabal. So we have them already but we need all law enforcement agencies to help trump too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm pretty sure trump flipped the nsa to help us too. Now we have evidence of the swamps crimes in digital format.

       When you look at that person's post history it is clear that they have only woken up within the few years at most. They will come around eventually. We're not all on the same path in the same spot.

       Monarch systems, the military serve and protect the queen and king. The global oligarchy system resembles a monarch in many ways. Perhaps you can brainstorm about how past monarch systems fell.
       <br/>
       Rome was severally weakened by the introduction of a new religion (Christianity). The power of intention has super-natural influence. Sorry if this sounds weird, but the rise of contrary belief systems seems to destroy cultures and societies.

       Money is the biggest belief system of all. And money as we know it is disrupted as we speak. Decentralized digital currencies are slowly becoming the new paradigm. Centralized fiat currencies will be obsoleted - not now, but also not too far in the future. In hindsight people will say that was clear from the get go.

       Money is a great tool for prosperity. For most people (not being able to comprehend the powerful shared illusion that money is) it's a tool for their own self-enslavement. In the hands of people knowing about the philosophical background of money it's a tool for freedom.

       I entertained the idea of getting the people
to bribe congress back (fight fire with fire type thing).
But I dunno.
Really I think the public awareness should increase about
getting money out of politics + nationalizing the FED + ending the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm guessing these are the biggest 3 hurdles against democracy but  I'm not certain it's a full proof plan but definitely a good start
at weakening the elites.
Doing something about corporate media propaganda would also help (regulations against lying? If a viewer reports a false fact, TV media outlet has to spend significant time retracting).
I dunno, what are other slightly less brainwashed countries doing
with their media? U.S. media is so blatantly dishonest.

       The 99% give all their power to the 1%. It's not that one person has actual power over another. It's the self-enslavement of the mind that has to come to an end if you want to change your world.

       My dad used to talk a bunch of bull about all of the rich assholes in the world and how when the time came he was going to be leading everyone to go and get back all of the money they'd been stealing.  I'd say to him, what are you going to do?  Go to their house, kill them, and then what?  You'll have their car, you'll have their clothes, but you won't have their bank account, you won't have their stocks, you won't own their property.  No one keeps a million dollars under their mattress.

       He doesn't bring that up so much anymore.

        In penetrating into the origin of the great fortunes, this vital fact is constantly forced upon the investigator: that Law has been the most valuable asset possessed by the capitalist class. Without it, this class would have been as helpless as a babe. What would the medieval baron have been without armed force?  But note how conditions have changed. The capitalist class, far shrewder than the feudalistic rulers, dispenses with personally equipped armed force. It becomes superfluous. All that is necessary to do is make the laws, and so guide things that the officials who enforce the laws are responsive to the interests of the propertied classes. Back of the laws are police forces and sheriffs and militia, all kept at the expense of city, county, and State--at public espense. Clearly, then, having control of the laws and of the officials, the propertied classes have the full benefit of armed forces the expense of which, however, they do not have to defray. It has unfolded itself as a vast improvement over the crude feudal system.

       It's sad the whole 'We are the 99%' movement died out.

       Now its FUCK the left or FUCK the right. We are all in this together, we are the 99%. Divide and conquer tactics work so well, this is why they say we must study history so we don't repeat, man-kind has come together and pushed apart over and over and over again.

       Worry about the 0,00001% that are screwing us all via globalism.
The 1% are largely just the business owners who create jobs and generate wealth.
The 1% has ca. 40% of the wealth. True. BUT. The 1% also foots ca. 50% of the bill.
This is why socialism always collapses a country. When you strip the 1% then who picks up the bill? It is you. And without the people to continue to generate wealth there is collapse and poverty.

       Money is a weapon we can use as well. I’m assuming none of us are filthy rich, but couldn’t we all contribute to a mass effort of sorts? A dollar here, a dollar there to fund what we need to do?
