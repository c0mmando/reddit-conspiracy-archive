        So I'm guessing you all saw this image being passed around.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And you know what I see?  Reasonably priced internet at about $30/month.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what else I see?  Social media is 20% of that bill, and you can opt out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to
       <a href="https://www.blogdumoderateur.com/facebook-baisse-usage-2017/">
        an article from r France
       </a>
       people are already spending less time on Facebook than they used to, so it doesn't seem too unreasonable to see this as a barometer for the whole of social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, recently Comcast strong-armed Netflix for exactly what we're being told will happen to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's exactly nothing to indicate our bills will change beyond showing itemized lists of what we're paying for, and there's already nothing stopping ISPs from raising their prices "just because".
      </p>
      <p>
       There's the argument that ISPs will use it to censor information and promote websites who pay for the privilege... but we already know that Reddit and Google and Twitter and Facebook and Amazon already do that, so there's no change for us in that department...
      </p>
      <p>
       So either we have so much to lose by restoring things to the way they were in 2015 or the people telling us so do.

       I didn't downvote, just making sure to let you know most American cities only have 1 or 2 ISPs letting them control and throttle without having another option available is FAR worse than Google targeting their searches and you being able to use another web search for the same price without throttles if you so wished.

       Your top image is from Portugal, but it's not reasonable internet at $30, those are extra charges you get after running out of your data plan on mobile. If you pay the extra $$ you can visit these sites, but any MB going anywhere else are your usual overcharges. It's not a 30$ access to the entire internet, it's a pre-listed set of sites that you pay extra money to on top of your usual phone bill so you don't get hit with overage charges. It's not an unlimited plan.

       They could but they also can't arbitrarily cut you off from one website unless it's illegal for you to do so (like cp or terrorism stuff I think). Net Neutrality keeps the internet free, everyones bits are the same.
      </p>

       So they'd start double-dipping, you have to pay to acess Netflix at reasonable streaming speeds, and Netflix has to pay to get lanes to its customers.

       But they can't charge you more for certain services to drive you away from their competitors. You know how ISPs are also owned by media conglomerates? They can't charge you Extra$ for Netflix now, but when they can they'll all charge you for Netflix (perhaps even when Netflix pays them), and then not charge you for their partnered services. That locks you into having to either pa extra to get Netflix, or being stuck with whatever company they partnered with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of you have Comcast internet? Gonna have to pay extra to get to ESPN.com since it's owned by Verizon-partner Hearst Communications.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if all the big names in entertainment get good deals from the big names in ISPs, that's stifling to innovation cause then the big ISPs will charge people and the startups for equal access to the market. New guys won't be able to compete.

        That locks you into having to either pa extra to get Netflix, or being stuck with whatever company they partnered with.

       Okay.  But this sounds like "charge me more money because they can".  Same outcome for me.

       This is what my post is about.  ISPs will squeeze websites and services for money.  That's why those websites and services are telling us we need Net Neutrality.

       Why would reddit be on the chopping block? If anything, removing net neutrality would cement all of the largest Internet companies' positions at the very top. Any hopeful competitors to reddit are the ones who need to start sweating. Reddit will have access to the most content and best connections because they can pay ISPs more money. Anyone new to the game is going to be crushed.
