<p>Demons are real, the government has been trying to show us, to warn us, for many years.</p>

<p>Examples depicting the reality of the situation appear in media such as but not limited to:</p>

<p>1.Insidious - The Further is a realm accessible in sleep or meditation that is full of evil beings that want to steal your soul and take over your body</p>

<p>2.Nightmare on Elm Street - Freddy is an evil being that committed atrocities on earth and now lurks the &quot;Dream realm&quot; looking for prey </p>

<p>3.Stranger Things - Government trains a child from birth to be able to enter the &quot;upsidedown&quot; a dimension layered over our own but dark and spooky, her goal is to gather intelligence/secrets for the CIA, evil beings lurk this realm ready to consume you and have the ability to escape into the real world</p>

<p>4.Poet Anderson - Tom Delonge claims all his media will hold nuggets of truth wrapped in fiction, this story revolves around a lucid dreamer who enters a &quot;shared consciousness dreamscape&quot; inhabited by evil beings that want to eat his soul and take over his body</p>

<p>5.Religion - Nearly every major religion speaks of a hellish dimension you can end up in one way or another</p>

<p>6.CIA Document on Gateway - the CIA released a document(linked below)vetting the reliability of training agents to have physic powers the document is nearly 30 pages and acquired from CIA.gov the most stand out quote comes in the conclusion </p>

<p>&quot;Be intellectually prepared to encounter non -corporeal energy beings when time-space boundaries are exceeded&quot;</p>

<p>So what am I getting at what is the point of all this?</p>

<p>I knew about 1 - 7 for years now but it took an outside perspective and one final piece for me to understand the bigger picture</p>

<p>8.Kyle Odom</p>

<p>Kyle was a 12 year US marine, after which he maintained a 3.96 GPA and acquired his Master&#39;s Degree while acquiring his Ph.D. in human genetics he began to as he puts it &quot; experiment with meditation and extreme states of consciousness&quot; he describes entering another dimension where he is separated from his physical form. In this dimension, he encounters a being which he claims he immediately gave into which then merged with his mind and gave him the most intense feelings of ecstasy ever experienced, after this encounter he was never able to Astral Project again and he descends into paranoid schizophrenia, either he actually was stalked and surrounded by evil beings from other dimensions or the original being he encountered was a mind parasite which drove him insane (leading to him shooting up a church) Other notable information relating to Odom includes claims that they were trying to force him to be the next school shooter and that most of those terrible events are perpetrated by these other dimensional beings, furthermore the shooting that he is notorious for he claims the man he shot Pastor Tim Remington was a shapeshifting alien, crazy right? well the pastor survived 6 - 12 gunshot wounds atleast 2 in the head from a .45 and I should also mention Odom won ribbions for his marksmanship skills.</p>

<p>We are living in a world where each and every one of us has the power to enter other dimensions at will with the proper training, in these dimensions lurk evil beings which are capable of trapping us in their dimension and taking over our physical bodies</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tl;DR</p>

<p>Humans can access other dimensions with the proper training, in these dimensions lurk beings that would like to take our physical bodies, or eat our souls, or torture us, or force us to commit atrocities in our own dimension.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hopeful their are good beings there as well but I&#39;m just going off the media that seems to provide the most blatant allusions</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh ya. 80% of all universal beings are generally good. The ones that got corrupted will eventually bounce back in a future life. The ones beyond repair are extinguished. Also, a lot of people have figured out how to Astral project and go it these odd realms. </p>

<p>I basically learned all this whIle researching the matrix simulation theory. There is a lot more to it. It&#39;s highly complex but life is mostly good so that is the good news. Evil is like an illusion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is all very real, it&#39;s the type of shit they lock you in a padded room over - but real nevertheless. </p>

<p>People are all full of all sorts of advice, and I&#39;ll go ahead and post mine. Stay away from astral projection, it can go sideways pretty quickly. You may end up creating a doppelganger and we don&#39;t need anymore soulless entities running around there are plenty. Also, learn to perform your operations without the influence of mind-altering substances. While it&#39;s true that they can be used as tools and can net results, more often than not they end up becoming crutches. Start reading, read A LOT, then read some more. You will find what you are looking for all on your own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm. Well I can tell you from my experience that my depression went away. I guess there are some studies that it &quot;resets&quot; your brain and helps stop smoking. I&#39;m no smoker so I cannot confirm that.</p>

<p>I hated driving and I didn&#39;t even have a license back then, this was like 2 months ago. Like the thought of having to drive, I just wanted to kill myself it was that bad. But when I took shrooms. First you feel weird, I laughed like a maniac, that was pretty bad. But as it was hitting the climax and starting going downhill, I felt better, like I could literally write up a large essay or do something that would literally bore me for hours. I felt the energy to do it, it was weird. It felt like my brain cleared up and I was, felt like, thinking smarter. Hard to explain but I really did enjoy it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah ya. My theory is that shrooms temporarily break down the filters of consciousness. Those filters chip away as we mature in life elevating our intelligence and allowing us to us more of our brains potential. Since shrooms lower that filter temporarily, our mind has a chance to think in a more optimized form and can figure out how to eject the urge for smoking or get rid of depression. </p>

<p>I try to mimic this with meditation. Fluoride adds to that filter. I’m hoping to take it at a hospital under a doctors care one day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to be careful when you start to go into deeper dimensions. I personally wouldn&#39;t try to haphazardly astral project after watching some youtube video. It&#39;s like teens who run away from an abusive home only to get raped and manipulated by some creepy pimp. Maybe follow an already established path like yoga, buddhism or partake in rituals(ayahuasca) with Shamans that are well established. That&#39;s just my 2 cents.

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. Telekinesis is the ultimate form of self defense in the Astral. It is the ultimate ability. I have used it many forms. If significantly developed one can easily move cars, lift and project boulders, hold off groups of beings and even take down an astral UFO if necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is what has worked very well for me. 1)Watch movies/t.v. shows of people using telekinesis. Even though it is fiction is not important as you are showing the mind how it looks when it is done. This is similar to studying film of a pitcher or goalie. This film can be seen for free and is a good example: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjhLdCfksSM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjhLdCfksSM</a> 2)Video games are virtual realities and are excellent hands on experience. Force Unleashed 1 and 2 are the holy grail in my opinion. Playing them standing in front of large tv screen has been crucial to my development of the skill. When this is done on a regular basis it starts showing up in your Lucid Dream and A.P. experiences. There are many deceased humans in the Astral who are what I call &quot;counselors&quot; (who program the deceased with massive guilt and acceptance of karma and reincarnation. there are also what i call &quot;security/cop types&quot; and they are very aggressive. both groups work to keep all the other deceased behaving and in line with the agendas. they will get absolutely infuriated if you are seen doing T.K. as it is illegal there. They know people could easily band together and defeat them and the Archon Hierachy with telekinesis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. Everyone needs to know Demons/Astral aliens are REAL. They are the reason this world is so messed up. The Satanic Global Elite worship these Demons/Astral Aliens and make sure their is massive financial and emotionally suffering on this planet. I have seen Grey Aliens, Reptilians and what would be called Demons in the Astral Dimension. The Elite used Satanic Ritual Majick to allow them entrance into our dimension. Astral Travel can be scary, but my opinion is that is necessary. Everyone gets sent to the Astral Afterlife after their physical death. I have been training myself in that dimension to develop my skills as much as possible. Telekinesis is very real in the astral and can be a very powerful ability for self defense. If people are going to refuse to be abused by them in the Astral development of strong telekinesis must be developed on the Astral level. Some esoteric mystery schools/secret  societies actually would meet up and train in certain astral locations while still alive in this dimension. </p>

<p>5.Religion - Nearly every major religion speaks of a hellish dimension you can end up in one way or another</p>

<p>6.CIA Document on Gateway - the CIA released a document(linked below)vetting the reliability of training agents to have physic powers the document is nearly 30 pages and acquired from CIA.gov the most stand out quote comes in the conclusion</p>

<p>&quot;Be intellectually prepared to encounter non -corporeal energy beings when time-space boundaries are exceeded&quot;</p>

<p>So what am I getting at what is the point of all this?
I knew about 1 - 7 for years now but it took an outside perspective and one final piece for me to understand the bigger picture</p>

<p>8.Kyle Odom
Kyle was a 12 year US marine, after which he maintained a 3.96 GPA and acquired his Master&#39;s Degree while acquiring his Ph.D. in human genetics he began to as he puts it &quot; experiment with meditation and extreme states of consciousness&quot; he describes entering another dimension where he is separated from his physical form. In this dimension, he encounters a being which he claims he immediately gave into which then merged with his mind and gave him the most intense feelings of ecstasy ever experienced, after this encounter he was never able to Astral Project again and he descends into paranoid schizophrenia, either he actually was stalked and surrounded by evil beings from other dimensions or the original being he encountered was a mind parasite which drove him insane (leading to him shooting up a church) Other notable information relating to Odom includes claims that they were trying to force him to be the next school shooter and that most of those terrible events are perpetrated by these other dimensional beings, furthermore the shooting that he is notorious for he claims the man he shot Pastor Tim Remington was a shapeshifting alien, crazy right? well the pastor survived 6 - 12 gunshot wounds atleast 2 in the head from a .45 and I should also mention Odom won ribbions for his marksmanship skills.</p>

<p>We are living in a world where each and every one of us has the power to enter other dimensions at will with the proper training, in these dimensions lurk evil beings which are capable of trapping us in their dimension and taking over our physical bodies</p>
