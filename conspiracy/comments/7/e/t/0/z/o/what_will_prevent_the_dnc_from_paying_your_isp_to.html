       They will parrot whatever they are told to, it's a cult at this point. There is no rhyme or reason, they just want to win at any cost and make anyone who disagrees feel the anger they've felt all their lives. Did you notice the uptick in activity when incels was banned? It's not a coincidence.

       The difference is one side tends to try and push the crazy ideologues to the sides (at times going overboard and silencing voices that need to be heard), and the other tends to amplify the crazy voices to build energy (at times going overboard and giving the crazy ideologues total control over their direction).

       If it's the basic premise, I'm with you -- there's nothing stopping them. ISPs will have the full ability to censor content of their customers, in situations where they'll mostly have a monopoly over a service area.  It's super fucked up.

       Net Neutrality currently does nothing, and has never done anything, it has never been acted on. It was approved in 2015, but the rules never had a chance to take effect. So, it has nothing to do with why people can visit conservative sites. However, with the new rules some think it would become possible, even inevitable, that undesirable political opinions will be classified as hate speech and then filtered out at the ISP level under orders of the FCC.

       what is preventing them from doing it now?  what makes you think they're not doing it now?  and not just ISPs.. the censorship on Google, facebook, twitter and all of reddit (minus td) is there for all to see.  why are you not losing sleep over that?  what have you done about that?  other than vilify the t_d?  your outrage is manufactured and bogus.  try crying wolf a little more.

       That kind of censorship literally has nothing to do with NN. NN isn't even about censorship. It's about making sure all isp's are on a level playing field.

       If I ran an ISP and my business model was to simply not allow video streaming, that should be my prerogative.  My money, my business model.  Selling that would be my headache.  But the govt should have no business telling me how to run my business.

       Also, it is a little rich for non-td assholesto hold forth on level-playing fields and censorship.  and oh btw.. the NN freakshow most certainly touches upon censorship.  the "throttling websites, data and services"
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       censorship.  Except, you're trying to portray it as if evil corporations will do it to the small fish.  otoh.. what we have right today right now is Google, FB, reddit, twitter and others running a downright fascist show of censoring opposing viewpoints.

       and good luck with that.  anti-trust is coming for your asses soon.

       You need an update on net neutrality. Before it was implemented, new technology was in fact violating it. Over time, that would get worse and worse.

       I don't think we have a handle on this issue. I don't think existing regulations protect us at all. I don't think the new NN provision protects us either. This is being hailed as the golden BB that will solve the problem of ISP and government interference, and I do not think that is the case. I think they need to start over.

       Nothing is ever solved. We just try to make improvements. Then we adjust them or make more. Or we have people trying to repeal improvements. Taking away NN is taking away an improvement.

       Here's foreshadowing of a future without NN.
