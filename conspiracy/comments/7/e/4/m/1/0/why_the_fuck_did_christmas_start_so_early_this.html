<p>I say this as an agnostic. </p>

<p>Why do other people have to enjoy a religious holiday? Are you trying to make Ramadan less Islam? Are you trying to make Yom Kippur less Jewish? No. Nobody is. Nobody <em>should</em> be. Those are holidays for their faith, not holidays for people who aren&#39;t part of their faith. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s the point. There has <em>absolutely</em> been a singling out of Christians and their holidays. A Christian celebrating Christmas has little to do with your ability to enjoy the winter season. </p>

<p>Again, I say all that as an agnostic who hasn&#39;t stepped foot in a church since my parents last forced me to...... over 20 years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Removing religious ceremony from public schools? It&#39;s a public school. Should they also celebrate Purim and Ramadan? Where do they stop? What if there is a kid in school who&#39;s a member of the Church of Satan? Can she celebrate her Satanic holiday on school time and make everyone else participate? </p>

<p>Kids can still give one another Christmas cards, but the school can&#39;t teach religion. So they don&#39;t do lessons on Christmas or take time out to celebrate. If this is important to you, there are tons of choices for religious schooling. </p>

<p>And outside of school, there hasn&#39;t been a reduction in Christmas. Radio stations still play a month of nonstop Christmas music. Your local drug store has had a Christmas display up for a month already. Every shopping website is already promoting Christmas shopping deals. You still get off from most jobs on Christmas, children get out of school for like two weeks for Christmas and New Year&#39;s. </p>

<p>Other than <em>in school</em> do you have any examples of how Christmas is being taken away? </p>

<p>I never said they shouldn&#39;t. People are so defensive about being called out for something they likely had nothing, personally, to do with. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>make everyone else participate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where the hell did you pull this from, your ass? Where did I ever advocate for the schools forcing anything on anybody? </p>

<p>For instance, I think schools should still do a moment of silence after the pledge. Most out my way do not. Do you know why? Because some people pray during them. It&#39;s fucking absurd, and anybody with an unbiased view of it can see it&#39;s absurd. </p>

<p>Just because one person decides to pray during that time doesn&#39;t mean the school is forcing all students to pray. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, they cannot in my daughter&#39;s school. Hanukkah cards are still allowed though. Figure that one out :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you have any examples of how Christmas is being taken away?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The absolute consumerization of Christmas, is one. Can&#39;t blame that one on atheist, but is certainly part of the larger &quot;plot&quot; (if I dare call it that) to remove the religious aspects of the holiday. </p>

<p>The belief that Christmas is a holiday everybody needs to be able to celebrate, which is a down right absurd belief. Nobody has a right to celebrate a holiday. </p>

<p>The fact that we treat it as a national holiday hasn&#39;t helped. Force Christians to use their PTO just like they do for every other holiday. That would go a long way to showing our society that not everybody has the right to take part in a religious celebration for a religion they are not part of. </p>

<p>Those are just a few. </p>

<p>I recall one of the cool things about WCBS was that it did not play exclusively Christmas music. It would play some sort of fabricated all time top hits list during the holidays.</p>

<p>Anyway, the whole extended Christmas music thing probably started about 12 to 16 years ago -- after consolidations. Now, everyone&#39;s doing it. Thank Jesus for streaming radio. :)</p>

<p>I used to lifeguard suring my summers and listen to their station all summer. They even did a thing where if the temp hit 101 degrees in July, they&#39;d play a Christmas song to cool things off. We had a heat wave one summer and it hit and stayed at 101 outside their offices and they played &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; and it was surreal. Got laughs from a bunch of beach patrons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s obvious why they start early with advertising. It makes companies a ton of money.

<p>But like you said, the holiday season is just a fun time. The decorations, the food, the memories, the music. It&#39;s the reason I start early and I&#39;m not religious at all and haven&#39;t bought a single &quot;Christmas&quot; item yet or started my shopping. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. I think Jesus would love the whole Peace on Earth message. Besides, Jesus was born in the spring. That is why the shepherds were out with the sheep, that is what they do in the spring.  </p>

<p>This error is easy to explain with the fact that the Jewish calendar shifts around the year, so it has slipped into winter. Then of course the Romans wanted to combine the holiday with Saturnalia. Jesus is not the reason for the season and he would know it. I think there are a lot of things about Christmas that Jesus would really enjoy. </p>

<p>Last year I was in Honolulu in mid-October. Because it&#39;s on an island and it takes forever to ship anything there, they have Christmas decorations for sale well before Halloween in Home Depot.  It was kind of surreal seeing Jack-O-Lanterns and witches next to Santa.</p>

<p>Christmas music is nostalgic to your childhood. The excitement of the gifts waiting under the tree make you want to shop in hopes of reliving that memory. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>we just want other people to enjoy their winter season holidays as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I say this as an agnostic. </p>

<p>Why do other people have to enjoy a religious holiday? Are you trying to make Ramadan less Islam? Are you trying to make Yom Kippur less Jewish? No. Nobody is. Nobody <em>should</em> be. Those are holidays for their faith, not holidays for people who aren&#39;t part of their faith. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s the point. There has <em>absolutely</em> been a singling out of Christians and their holidays. A Christian celebrating Christmas has little to do with your ability to enjoy the winter season. </p>

<p>Again, I say all that as an agnostic who hasn&#39;t stepped foot in a church since my parents last forced me to...... over 20 years ago. </p>
