       i've been in multiple consumer-driven cities and christmas (commercials, public decorations) have started much earlier than usual:
      </p>
      <p>
       on october 31st i spotted various christmas decorations around on the swanky, Yuppie neighborhood of 14th st NW in dc...iin san diego on oct 30th a 50 ft+ tree was erected at the mall in san Diego. w just a week until thanksgiving, now all commercials are in their "christmas" themed phase.
      </p>
      <p>
       what the fuck-- christmas/consumerist commercials and culture has begun sooner and sooner.

       While nobody is "stealing" Christmas, there has absolutely been a concerted effort to remove any religious meaning the holiday had... largely at the hand of left to far-left Atheists/non-Christians.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, let's be fair to Fox, they are not
       <em>

       wrong in this case.

       I haven't seen any reduction of the celebration of Christmas even as our population has been dramatically increased by immigrants with non Christian religious, not just Muslim, but Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christmas is a huge retail bonanza and you can't blame that on only Atheists. There aren't that many and it is counter to the argument that atheists and leftists are a bunch of penniless nobodies on welfare.
      </p>

       I guess my point is,   just how are atheists killing Christmas?

       celebration of "Christmas"... just not the religious Christmas.. instead it's this new consumer driven Christmas.

       Do I need to tell you about my daughter's school, where students are not allowed to give other students Christmas cards because someone may not be christian/catholic? They can give cards for other holidays, though.

       Sure. But why does that matter? They give Valentine's day cards to their class mates. Why not a Christmas card to friends? Or even the whole class?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's petty things like that that make me think the way I do about it. There's just no need for it. And there's no need for any parent to be mad enough that a kid gave their kid a Christmas card.

       I don't think you have provided evidence that Athiests are trying to make Christmas not-religious, I think that is done by retailers.
      </p>
      <p>
       As fof public tax supported schools,  is it the right place to encourage any religious tradition to be recognized.

      <p>
       I say this as an agnostic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do other people have to enjoy a religious holiday? Are you trying to make Ramadan less Islam? Are you trying to make Yom Kippur less Jewish? No. Nobody is. Nobody
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be. Those are holidays for their faith, not holidays for people who aren't part of their faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's the point. There has
       <em>
        absolutely
       </em>
       been a singling out of Christians and their holidays. A Christian celebrating Christmas has little to do with your ability to enjoy the winter season.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I say all that as an agnostic who hasn't stepped foot in a church since my parents last forced me to...... over 20 years ago.

       Removing religious ceremony from public schools? It's a public school. Should they also celebrate Purim and Ramadan? Where do they stop? What if there is a kid in school who's a member of the Church of Satan? Can she celebrate her Satanic holiday on school time and make everyone else participate?
      </p>
      <p>
       Kids can still give one another Christmas cards, but the school can't teach religion. So they don't do lessons on Christmas or take time out to celebrate. If this is important to you, there are tons of choices for religious schooling.
      </p>
      <p>
       And outside of school, there hasn't been a reduction in Christmas. Radio stations still play a month of nonstop Christmas music. Your local drug store has had a Christmas display up for a month already. Every shopping website is already promoting Christmas shopping deals. You still get off from most jobs on Christmas, children get out of school for like two weeks for Christmas and New Year's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than
       <em>
        in school
       </em>
       do you have any examples of how Christmas is being taken away?

        Removing religious ceremony from public schools?

       I never said they shouldn't. People are so defensive about being called out for something they likely had nothing, personally, to do with.

      <p>
       Where the hell did you pull this from, your ass? Where did I ever advocate for the schools forcing anything on anybody?
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, I think schools should still do a moment of silence after the pledge. Most out my way do not. Do you know why? Because some people pray during them. It's fucking absurd, and anybody with an unbiased view of it can see it's absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because one person decides to pray during that time doesn't mean the school is forcing all students to pray.

       No, they cannot in my daughter's school. Hanukkah cards are still allowed though. Figure that one out :)

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        do you have any examples of how Christmas is being taken away?

      <p>
       The absolute consumerization of Christmas, is one. Can't blame that one on atheist, but is certainly part of the larger "plot" (if I dare call it that) to remove the religious aspects of the holiday.
      </p>
      <p>
       The belief that Christmas is a holiday everybody needs to be able to celebrate, which is a down right absurd belief. Nobody has a right to celebrate a holiday.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that we treat it as a national holiday hasn't helped. Force Christians to use their PTO just like they do for every other holiday. That would go a long way to showing our society that not everybody has the right to take part in a religious celebration for a religion they are not part of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are just a few.

       My local oldies station, WCBS-FM, does all Christmas music and isn't owned by iHeartRadio. It might be something iHeartRadio does, but it's not exclusive or necessarily started by them.

       I don't know how people can tolerate a month of exclusively Christmas music.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recall one of the cool things about WCBS was that it did not play exclusively Christmas music. It would play some sort of fabricated all time top hits list during the holidays.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the whole extended Christmas music thing probably started about 12 to 16 years ago -- after consolidations. Now, everyone's doing it. Thank Jesus for streaming radio. :)

       I love WCBS-FM's hit lists. They'd do either a Top 1000 songs ranked list during Memorial Day or Labor Day weekends, or they'd do "all our songs alphabetically".
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to lifeguard suring my summers and listen to their station all summer. They even did a thing where if the temp hit 101 degrees in July, they'd play a Christmas song to cool things off. We had a heat wave one summer and it hit and stayed at 101 outside their offices and they played "Winter Wonderland" and it was surreal. Got laughs from a bunch of beach patrons.

       Especially the ones that have been monetized, Valentines Day, Easter, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Halloween, Christmas, less so for  Independence Day, Thanksgiving, though they are big boosters for celebratory eating and drinking and the lowest on monitizing, President's day, Veterans Day and Labor Day.

       Yeah, it's obvious why they start early with advertising. It makes companies a ton of money. It's like being able to buy a pumpkin spice latte in almost August at this point, even though autumn doesn't start until Sept 21 and the "fall season" doesn't start until like mid October.
      </p>
      <p>
       But like you said, the holiday season is just a fun time. The decorations, the food, the memories, the music. It's the reason I start early and I'm not religious at all and haven't bought a single "Christmas" item yet or started my shopping.

       I disagree. I think Jesus would love the whole Peace on Earth message. Besides, Jesus was born in the spring. That is why the shepherds were out with the sheep, that is what they do in the spring.
      </p>
      <p>
       This error is easy to explain with the fact that the Jewish calendar shifts around the year, so it has slipped into winter. Then of course the Romans wanted to combine the holiday with Saturnalia. Jesus is not the reason for the season and he would know it. I think there are a lot of things about Christmas that Jesus would really enjoy.

       It was out before Halloween at my local Walmart. Dollar Tree rolled it out the day after Halloween.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last year I was in Honolulu in mid-October. Because it's on an island and it takes forever to ship anything there, they have Christmas decorations for sale well before Halloween in Home Depot.  It was kind of surreal seeing Jack-O-Lanterns and witches next to Santa.

       It’s called conditioning. As soon as you hear that Christmas music you’ll start shopping.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christmas music is nostalgic to your childhood. The excitement of the gifts waiting under the tree make you want to shop in hopes of reliving that memory.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality you never will but you will always chase it.

       Just so companies can make money, but in my neighborhood less and less people put up decorations every year. I fucking love it. I can't wait til Christmas is dead so there's no more celebrating early.

        we just want other people to enjoy their winter season holidays as well.

      <p>
       I say this as an agnostic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do other people have to enjoy a religious holiday? Are you trying to make Ramadan less Islam? Are you trying to make Yom Kippur less Jewish? No. Nobody is. Nobody
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be. Those are holidays for their faith, not holidays for people who aren't part of their faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's the point. There has
       <em>
        absolutely
       </em>
       been a singling out of Christians and their holidays. A Christian celebrating Christmas has little to do with your ability to enjoy the winter season.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I say all that as an agnostic who hasn't stepped foot in a church since my parents last forced me to...... over 20 years ago.
