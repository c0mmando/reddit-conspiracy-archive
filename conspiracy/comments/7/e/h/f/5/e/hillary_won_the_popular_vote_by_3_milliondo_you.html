       Here's an MSM article from before last years elections. Iit explains how a huge popular vote win is an increasing thing for the Dems.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also explains how that doesnt mean a win.

       Its a fact many of those were illegals. States have come out and said as much. There even is a film on YouTube of Obama telling an illegal that Illegals can vote without being afraid. Its come out that many dead people have voted as well. people are in prison now because they did that this election

       I wouldn't doubt that some voted in the Presidential election. To what extent, I have no idea. 3 million is a lot. I remember reading an article about some illegal votes that were found for an election (not sure if it was the presidential one). I tried to look for the article, but found this instead.

       Cases of voter fraud
      </p>
      <p>
       A woman in Iowa who voted twice. Terri Lynn Rote had the enormous misfortune of bad timing. Right as the candidate she supported, Trump, was drawing attention to fraud cases, Rote decided to try to vote twice in Des Moines, and got caught. The case made national headlines simply by virtue of the fact that it happened when it did, and that she voted for Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what it's worth, she suggested that the fault lay with Trump. “The polls are rigged,” she said to a local radio station by way of explaining her multiple votes, echoing another of Trump's complaints.
      </p>
      <p>
       A man in Texas who voted twice. Phillip Cook was arrested on Election Day after voting twice. He claimed to be an employee of Trump's campaign who was testing the security of the electoral system. He wasn't an employee of the campaign — and the polling location's security worked perfectly well, it seems.
      </p>
      <p>
       A woman who cast a ballot on behalf of her dead husband. Audrey Cook is a Republican election judge in Illinois. She and her husband applied for absentee ballots because he was ill. He died before completing his, so she filled it out for him and sent it in. The ballot will not be counted.
      </p>
      <p>
       A woman in Florida who marked absentee ballots. Gladys Coego was hired to open absentee ballots in Miami-Dade County. One of her co-workers noticed that she was going a step further, filling in the bubble for a mayoral candidate with a pen she had in her purse. She was caught in the act and arrested. There's no evidence that she changed any presidential votes

       On the one hand, I think both sides engage in illegal voting voter fraud, with the US left having an edge of several million votes. That both sides are engaged is the insurance needed to keep any serious investigation from getting too far.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, I know that a considerable number of votes are nullified every election, and that this likely constitutes the most serious form of voter fraud in the US, with illegally cast votes serving as a red herring.

       How are they nullified?  In what state?
I'm a poll worker and the only votes I've seen nullified are those who can't show id.  They get a provisional ballot.  If the number of provisional ballots do not exceed the amount of difference between the two candidates, then they aren't researched.
They must be nullified past where I see them or perhaps other states handle things differently than we do.

       If that was the case I'm sure we would have seen the proof of that by now.  Remember when Trump and some jackass both said they had very compelling evidence that 3 million illegals voting in the election?  It was months ago and they were supposed to release that evidence and of course they never did.

       Forget the guys name but his group was called True the Vote. A few months back they said they were no longer auditing the election due to lack of funding...so, they were useful when Trump needed to cast doubt on the popular vote difference, but then kind of shyly receded without producing any data or results.

       If there's no voter ID, there never will be proof.  Just walk up and pretend to be one of the 2/3 of people who don't vote.  You need their name and address, that's it.

       Well it can't be true that there's no proof because Trump an this other dipshit who was investigating the alleged voter fraud said that they not only had proof of illegal votes, but they had proof of 3 million illegal votes.

       Are you sure you are not getting confused with the illegal alien driving licences that California provides to people? If that's what you are referring to, you cannot vote with them.

       If theres some kind of discrepancy, such as verifying an address, then you would need to provide information. Some people within districts are required to show ID. Aint you ever volunteered at a polling place? And theres a deadline to be able to vote prior to the actual date of voting. I dont know if its different in other states but if someone tells you these things are permissable then they don't know what the fuck theyre doing and just want to get their little paycheck.

       It's a slippery point really. Non-citizens can apply for a driver's licence online, but through this avenue one is not allowed to register to vote. Citizens can do all kinds of things through the online system, including voter reg. A few other states also do it this way.

       Jerry Brown passed a Motor Voter law a few years ago that allows anyone with a driver's license to be eligible to vote.   To get a drivers license in CA you do not have to prove citizenship.   CA has the highest concentration of Illegal immigrants in the country.... they all need drivers licenses.

       No the law doesn't allow anyone with a DL to vote.  But if you are a legal citizen you are registered to vote when you get a drivers license if you choose to be.

       Getting a DL does not automatically register you to vote.  If you are not a citizen, no voter registrations.

       We had the Jill Stein recount in our state.  The ballots were a mess.  Some boxes had broken seals, many didn't have the same amount of ballots as the computer readout said, some from our bigger cities were lost.  Trump actually ended up with more votes so they stopped the recount.

       Well it can't be true that there's no proof because Trump an this other dipshit who was investigating the alleged voter fraud said that they not only had proof of illegal votes, but they had proof of 3 million illegal votes.
