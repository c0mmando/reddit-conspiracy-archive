        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been obsessively following the movements of Tom Delonge and his new organization To The Stars Academy of Arts and Science because of the profiles of the people Tom has assembled to be a part of his team. I believe they are getting ready to show unequivocal proof that Extraterrestials have visited Earth (as well as unveiling new energy propulsion technology) and will use this evidence to project their opinions and ideas about the phenomena to the mainstream public. </p>

<p>If you are unaware of what I&#39;m talking about feel free to read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6s5w54/oc_compilation_of_research_on_extraterrestials/">this research post</a> I made awhile back which tried to be a compilation of official documents surrounding the phenomena. I actually tend to agree more with Graham Hancock&#39;s interpretation of the phenomena (the idea that it is interdimensional in nature) but nevertheless it matters more what narratives the people with credibility start spewing.</p>

<p>Tom has started getting a lot cockier about feeling vindicated in recent weeks. But his most <a href="https://imgur.com/a/m3Aej">recent posts</a> are what concerns me. He feels that he will be vindicated within 3 weeks which means that some type of new evidence will emerge (either from his group or not) that is going to kickstart the E.T. conversation into the mainstream media. We also have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/7ealls/solar_systems_first_interstellar_visitor_with_its/dq3pvo8/">astronomers seriously discussing an interstellar vehicle</a> on the front of Reddit. Anyone in the UFOlogy community knows that whistleblowers have been describing cigar shaped vehicles for decades now. </p>

<p>TL;DR: I&#39;m <em>very</em> concerned that a modern age Project Blue Beam will be initiated in the coming weeks as the cabal&#39;s stranglehold over global powers are further diminished.</p>

<p>Anyone else concerned?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I mostly agree with that. I don&#39;t think that &quot;Project Blue Beam&quot; as we know it will be instituted but I do think that the military as more than likely war gamed a new narrative and storyline which will play out in the mainstream press regardless of what &quot;conspiracists&quot; believe. I&#39;m sure they have some type of plan in place that will be meant to confuse us all and make us all feel like we don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening. Maybe I&#39;m a pessimist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was part of the initial plan for PBB. Serge Monast is a great source of information on this topic. I honestly am not convinced that TPTB would use that same recycled plan as it has already been massively exposed. I see it being much more likely they use ancient artifacts or technology to cause the breakdown of religious affiliation.</p>

<p>The bigger point you are making is important. Their ultimate goal is to use advanced technology to control the mass population and convince them their previous beliefs and ideas are wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mainstream right now is releasing a ton of information surrounding exoplanets (maybe as a type of preparation) but you&#39;re right... it is all underground right now. I believe TTS has enough talent on their team to start introducing previously classified technology (warp drive tech) which <em>will</em> kick this into the mainstream.</p>

<p>Even if it&#39;s not his company that gets mainstream press I think it&#39;s certainly possible for MSM to come out with a story in the next few weeks that will confirm the existence of alien life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a believer in Martin Luther&#39;s teaching, in fact quite the opposite, the Catholic faith is the truth IMHO, I&#39;m familiar with the text you referenced, and the simple fact that Jesus directly asked us to do the Eucharist in remembrance of him, and he explicitly said, unless you eat my body and drink my blood you will not be saved and lost many followers that day is a great place to start. I would refer you as well to check out The Vortex on YouTube by Church Militant, recent episodes talk very freely of the 500 year anniversary of Luther&#39;s rebellions and the damage it has done to the truth of Jesus teachings, especially in the fundamental issue if contraception, and non pro creative sex and it&#39;s effect on societies value in human life and it&#39;s sacredness as the image of God. Very rarely do Catholics convert to another form of Christianity, so while I appreciate the attempt, please, respectfully know it to be pointless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Southern Baptist Christian here, and I may get downvoted into oblivion, but I&#39;m still going to expound on my opinion, and have to somewhat agree with the poster above you. I don&#39;t believe 100% of it has been faked (example: satellite footage being legit, etc), but I do believe NASA has been pumping out false events for generations. I am not however a flat-earther like so many NASA debunkers are (had to throw that in there lol). I&#39;m middle of the road on the moon landing. I&#39;ve seen the evidence for both sides, and I&#39;m still not sure where I stand on it. </p>

<p>However, I HAVE seen the ISS videos with the harnesses, and wholeheartedly believe Project Blue Beam will be making it&#39;s way into the mainstream <em>at some point</em>. The doc Unacknowledged opened my eyes to this. I think the reason why they even allowed the doc to air on Netflix in the first place is because they knew the majority wouldn&#39;t take it seriously, and would simply go on with their lives as if they never saw it to begin with.</p>

<p>Do I believe it&#39;s possible life exists elsewhere in the universe? Absolutely. It&#39;s possible. Do I think they&#39;d waste their time and energy on such an ancient civilization (compared to their tech standards) as we humans? I highly doubt that. Think about it: the gov&#39;t has had levitation tech since the 40&#39;s-50&#39;s. Fast forward 60-70 years, and the advancement of that tech alone is probably mind-bogglingly convincing. I personally believe the anti-Christ <em>could</em> come in the form of Project Blue Beam, we humans looking for a &quot;savior&quot; to protect us from the &quot;invaders&quot;. But, that&#39;s just like, my opinion. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I upvote when you contribute to the conversation, and you did that. I might have direct experience that leds me to believe that multiple other species are indeed interested in our race for multiple reasons, while believing in Jesus Christ, Mary and the Holy Spirit, but personal experience is not proof and I don&#39;t talk about it because it just sounds looney. It is also true that governments lie to the people for control. All of these things can be true and likely, and still have little relevance to day to day work, sleep, work, sleep life. I&#39;m Catholic, and I believe in Jesus as teacher, King, savior, and when it was written that we struggle against powers and principalities, that reference isn&#39;t as elusive it sounds.</p>

<p>Further, how does that work with directional antennas pointed at the sky, in the direction of the satellite you want to communicate with? Seeing as y&#39;know, directional antennas only work when you point them directly at (or nearly directly at) a transmitter. </p>

<p>Ok, so how are the balloons propelled? How come no one ever sees all these weather balloons floating around? They&#39;re <a href="http://images.spaceref.com/news/2012/balloon.jpg">absolutely massive</a> when fully inflated. That&#39;s a capsule with a person in it at the bottom. </p>

<p>Balloons capable of supporting the weight of a large communication system would be even more massive than that. For smaller constellations of communications systems you&#39;d need 10s or even 100s of balloons that size floating around. I take it the government has cloaking devices they install on them too? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes those pictures are all fake. Do you see how close to the ground that first shuttle picture is?</p>

<p>You can&#39;t see how close to the ground it is... You can infer it from the size of surface features/clouds, but when it comes to pictures depth is hard to actually see. The focal length of the lens used can make objects far apart <a href="https://2dhnizrxqvv1awj231eodql1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/focal-length-comparison.jpeg">look as though they are right next to each other</a>. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You also never commented on the pictures I posted of the ISS/Shuttle taken from the ground. Care to comment? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t need to start my awakening process, I need to people to stop talking utter shite. You don&#39;t believe scientists or the government when they say the earth is round, but you believe some random dude on the internet that says it&#39;s flat? If you&#39;re going to argue that the earth is flat at least come up with a reasonable argument other than &quot;NASA IS FAKE, SATELLITES AREN&#39;T REAL&quot;, because anyone with a radio, directional antenna and a telescope can disprove that claim. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>itd be a simple task to convince the masses into thinking space shuttle launches are real. put the space shuttle (just a fancy looking jet) in the rocket, launch rocket, cgi begins (in space) , while space shuttle secretly lands back on the ground to refuel (days, weeks go by), then takes off on its own (its a jet) with no rocket, reaches high altitude, cameras roll, and woooowwww, the space shuttle is reentering our atmosphere!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so the shuttle lands hundreds of times, secretly, without <em>anyone</em> noticing? </p>

<p>Jets require jet engines, which require air intakes. The Shuttle has neither. </p>

<p>Not to mention something reentering from space is rather visible, you know, due to the super-heated plasma that surrounds it...  </p>

<p>The idea that you can see a satellite from the ground but we can&#39;t even see high flying aircraft is a joke.  I was more looking for a photo of it from space like perhaps from the fake ISS  They don&#39;t exist and are all CGI.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve spent lots of time recording the moon and a satellite never crosses in front of it.  It&#39;s all fakery and propaganda.  Sorry to ruin your childhood but at least you might be able to find God and avoid eternal damnation.</p>

<p>Talk about a mind being made up:</p>

<p>Rom 1:21  Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. 
Rom 1:22  Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, </p>

<p>2Th 2:10  And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 
2Th 2:11  And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: 
2Th 2:12  That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. </p>

<p>Mhmmm... So how does that work when you&#39;re in the middle of nowhere, with no towers for hundreds of miles, and no cell service, yet satellite phones and GPS still work?</p>

<p>Further, how does that work with directional antennas pointed at the sky, in the direction of the satellite you want to communicate with? Seeing as y&#39;know, directional antennas only work when you point them directly at (or nearly directly at) a transmitter.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll add more. If it&#39;s radio towers, how come GPS/Satellite communications either act up or stop working completely when you stand under a bridge (or anything similar) and have no line of site to the sky? Yet cell phone service continues to work in that same situation? </p>

<p>And this is where the baseless speculation this sub spews over and over is dangerous. You do not know any of this. Mueller is not the only person to submit sealed indictments.

<p>My point is that he doesn&#39;t realize it&#39;s disinformation.  You make it sound like he&#39;s broke and is desperate for some cash flow which I don&#39;t think is the case here.  </p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is he still comes off as a genuine nice guy just wanting to spread what he believes is the truth that has been held back from the masses... that&#39;s a noble thing to use your fame for.  </p>

<p>I think his motives are pure, just being used as a patsy.</p>

<p>Look at this direct thread. </p>

<p>Not to bright, pushing somebody else&#39;s agenda because of his pop culture position. Nobody laughing, but everybody pointing (this usually happens after publicity events like the TTSA launch). </p>

<p>The UFO community is exceptionally sceptical of him because of what he says, who he associates with, his lack of understanding the technology he&#39;s trying to sell, the disinformation aspect of refusing to separate &quot;facts&quot; and science fiction in their planned media, the fact that DeLonge&#39;s company has to pay DeLonge&#39;s Other company 200.000 of investors money and the list goes on.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but me and him are not the same, we don&#39;t believe the same things and I believe his actions are directly harmful to the credibility of the truth so naturally I won&#39;t treat him as a &quot;colleague&quot; or friend.</p>

<p>Do you think nobody&#39;s told him? </p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_E._Puthoff">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_E._Puthoff</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1967, Puthoff earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford University.[1][2][3] He then worked with, and invented, tunable lasers and electron beam devices, concerning which he holds patents, and he is co-author (with R. Pantell) of Fundamentals of Quantum Electronics (Wiley, 1969), published in English, French, Russian and Chinese. Puthoff published papers on polarizable vacuum (PV) and stochastic electrodynamics topics, which are examples of alternative approaches to general relativity and quantum mechanics.
Puthoff took an interest in the Church of Scientology in the late 1960s and reached what was then the top OT VII level by 1971.[3] Puthoff wrote up his &quot;wins&quot; for a Scientology publication, claiming to have achieved &quot;remote viewing&quot; abilities.[4] In 1974, Puthoff also wrote a piece for Scientology&#39;s Celebrity magazine, stating that Scientology had given him &quot;a feeling of absolute fearlessness&quot;.[5] Puthoff severed all connection with Scientology in the late 1970s.[6]
In the 1970s and &#39;80s Puthoff directed a CIA/DIA-funded program at SRI International to investigate paranormal abilities, collaborating with Russell Targ in a study of the purported psychic abilities of Uri Geller, Ingo Swann, Pat Price, Joseph McMoneagle and others, as part of the Stargate Project. Both Puthoff and Targ became convinced Geller and Swann had genuine psychic powers.[7] However, Geller employed sleight of hand tricks.[8]</p>

<p>Extraterrestrials that are billions of years ahead of human civilization define Infinity as Unity, ultimately everything is part of All there is/Infinity and thus everything can&#39;t help but be the Creator/Universe experiencing itself.</p>

<p>Nature of reality/existence is of Oneness. Everything is Divine, there is only truly Freewill. Law of One also talks about the creation story of &quot;God&quot;/existence as well:

<p>Here are some favorite Law of One quotes from Q&#39;uo:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The heart of your journey is to seek the Creator that is within you, the Creator that you are, the Creator that is all things. There can be no other way of looking upon an infinite creation of unity. The Creator took pleasure in making this, what you call creation, in order that it might know itself through the free will of each of its entities that it has created. From the Logos of every star within your skies, to the planet upon which you dwell, to each of your entities that you share the illusion with, each of you has free will to exercise however you wish. Each exercise of free will teaches the Creator more of itself, and fulfills the purpose of the illusion. Each of your actions reveals more to you of yourself, and if you are conscious of the seeking process, of the Creator itself, it is a journey of lovers, the creator loving you with unending love, you seeking and loving the Creator with a growing love. At some point, you will find the Creator, there is no other outcome for the end of this journey. At some point, the creator will know all that you know and will thank you for all that you have taught it of itself. At some point every entity within this great one infinite creation will coalesce again into unity, bringing home to the Creator the fruits of this journey through the octave of densities in which you now travel. Q&#39;uo transcripts September 4, 2016</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as well as </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let us look first at the first choice and that was the choice of the Creator to know Itself. In choosing to know Itself the Creator flung from Itself innumerable and infinite sparks of love which coalesced into each awareness that dwells within the infinite awareness. Each of those sparks of awareness is the Creator, and yet, because the Creator chose free will in the manifesting of sparks of self, each spark is unique and has been unique since before time began. Each of you is eternal and in many ways immutable, a citizen of infinite nature, worth and value. Each one a holograph of the Creator and yet each one different.
Thus, the choice that birthed each of you was a choice to know the truth, to know the self, and as the Creator is love, so is each entity love. This is the central truth. This is that which does not change. Yet this is that which is ever wrapped in mystery. Each within this circle has come through many planes of existence, has learned a great deal, and each within this circle chose not only this incarnation now being experienced but also that cast of characters with whom each entity interacts in the family, in the close associations of friends, and all those who have significant connections with the self. There were agreements made before incarnation, most notably with the parents and those within the bonds of kinship of blood and of commonality of interest. Each difficulty, each crux that leaves one in a position of being forced to discover the self has been placed not with a hand that desires to punish but with a hand of loving self that wishes to serve ever more deeply, ever more purely. -Q&#39;uo @the_law_of_one (May 18, 1997)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>New Age Christians?</p>

<p>How about historians, anthropologists, and mystics? If aliens were real (and I&#39;m familiar with the DMT entities--having seen a double helix from them), then we&#39;ve been speaking with them for tens of thousands of years in our altered states of consciousness. In fact, these may be the daimones who&#39;ve acted or possessed men and women for all recorded human history.</p>

<p>Whatever they claim to be, it will be easy for us to gauge their legitimacy, by their mastery of altered states (equal to a poet, prophet or king/queen of an older age).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, but you have been watching too many YouTube and &quot;Illuminati&quot; videos, my young friend.</p>

<p>Learn Latin or Italian.</p>

<p>&quot;Lucifer&quot; means Light Bearer. What&#39;s Greek &quot;Christos&quot; mean? It&#39;s like a chrism, dish or vessel. Hmm...What do you think fills that cup, my friend?</p>

<p>Now, &quot;Illuminati&quot; is just Italian for &quot;the Lit.&quot;
&quot;Illuministi&quot; is what you&#39;re looking for, my droog. It refers to the thinkers of the late Enlightenment--namely, that famous man who translated the Emerald Tablets, and played with Mercury. </p>

<p>Isaac Newton is the father of the modern Western mystic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the &quot;Light Bearer&quot; is exactly who the Masons and other elite worship.  It&#39;s also all over pop culture (Game of Thrones for instance)</p>

<p>Isa_14:12 (KJV)  How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!</p>

<p>Interesting how all other Bible version edit this verse to remove the reference to Lucifer and also give him the title of Jesus Christ from Revelation.</p>

<p>God can speak English just fine and he tells us exactly who Lucifer was and who he is now.</p>

I resent that opinion but even if I can&#39;t win that argument I think its immoral that any man or woman who is involved with advanced technology projects who is allowing that technology to be abused by the military instead of bringing it to the public for commercial benefit doesn&#39;t come forward. There seems to be a serious scientific consensus deep within the intelligence community that the UFO phenomena is real and human thought/consciousness is deeply intertwined with it. That information is vital for us to understand our place in the universe and what kind of lives we could leave for our children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Step Three is &quot;Telepathic Electronic Two-Way Communication.&quot; </p>

<p>It involves making people think their god is speaking to them through telepathy, projected into the head of each person individually using extreme low frequency radio waves. <strong>(Atheists will presumably hear an absence of Richard Dawkins.)</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think true telepathy involves thought transfer, but involves a much more inclusive technique that requires trust and the conveying of feelings (albiet these &quot;feelings&quot; are tuned and directed for communication). Intrusive thoughts, however, sound more like what you describe above. </p>

<p>If thoughts were able to be projected intrusively into someone else&#39;s mind, the subject would have a tough time deciding whether or not he was insane. Perhaps a strongly religious person would immediately jump to the god conclusion as you mentioned, but even an atheist would have trouble. That struggle with sanity would weaken the structural walls of  the person&#39;s ability to reason and logic, casting doubt into decision making. Eventually they would be far more susceptible to manipulation simply from the wear and tear of constant internal battling. </p>

<p>IMO a person can come to a decision that these thoughts are in fact not their own... however by doing so would be forcing themselves to build reality from the ground up once again as this would open up a shit ton of possibilities to consider. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at who&#39;s he&#39;s working with. They&#39;re all HUGE hitters in the government. Some even quit after 30+ years of service with kushy pensions and shit just to bring this about. He actually was talking to the Clinton Administration and Podesta , those came out in the email wikileaks dump. I&#39;m an avid fan of blink and have been for over 20 years... this has been everything Tom has done his whole life. When he got signed to MCA records, the first thing he did was buy a computer so he could research alien life. It&#39;s all the guy ever does. But the people he&#39;s working with a very serious people that have been part of the DOD, Pentagon, NASA, Aerospace Engineering for the government, The Whitehouse , people involved in National Security and the Defence sectors AND espionage. (Spy&#39;s the American government) that are all credible and outing themselves in preparation for something. The only reason why Tom is heading it is because he&#39;s the one who for three years has been flying all over the world getting these people together. Tom is also a 33rd degree Mason which has definitely got some pull in this case. A lot of these people heard what he was doing and contacted HIM straight from the Pentagon . I suggest you really look into this before running a smear campaign because he&#39;s a musician , and furthermore from a fart band like
Blink-182 . I believe something is coming. They have aerospace engineers who have blueprints on shit like Anti Gravity that they plan to build and show exists and has existed for decades... if you doubt, just have an open mind , but I think it&#39;s coming. I&#39;ve been following very closely for years. </p>

<p>And? Does this make him an authority on the subject? No. It makes him an expert on the loads and loads of false and misinformation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Stop being sensational, where did I ever smear him? Oh wait, I didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Do you actually think if he was about to reveal some mind-blowing, world-changing technology that TPTB are just going to sit back and let it happen? Come on, surely you don&#39;t believe this, right?</p>

<p>I understand that you might have been following &quot;this&quot; for years, but that really doesn&#39;t mean anything. Until you, or Mr. Delonge provides  any type of real fact based evidence, it is all a publicity stunt. People have done worse for attention.</p>

<p>You really think it is unacceptable to question the credibility of a person that isn&#39;t known for his professional work in physics, or any science for that matter, or government, or military or any other relevant field.... rather is known for being a musician..</p>

<p>In your owns words, I&#39;m running a smear campaign and berating him for simply questioning his credibility? Lol, ok. You do know what forum you are on, right? You are allowed to pose theories, and I am allowed to call bullshit, that is how this works.</p>

<p>Literally everything he quotes and references are shady articles and grainy youtube videos. Yes, I admit he seems to have the buzzwords and phrases memorized pretty well, but he lacks depth and actual proof.</p>

<p>But as he says... he just needs a little more time, just keep tuning in and waiting... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read through both of your posts, very interesting connections and well documented. Hard to say whether this has any real connection to disclosure though. I always feel the connection weakens/breaks when you start referencing the leaked emails. Here is my thought process:</p>

<p>Without the emails, you have a very interesting team assembled with an incredible history, and probably have intimate knowledge of technology and research not available to the public currently, but that&#39;s where it ends. Not to say that&#39;s not impressive, which it truly is, but..</p>

<p>With the emails, we have inter-dimensional ETI, hidden technologies way beyond our time, secret cabal controlling it for their profit, and an entire species of humans who are more or less cattle controlled with the guise of free will.</p>

<p>That leap is big to make, personally, with the emails provided. They almost look like spam from people who know JP is a space-nut and in a position of political power / knowledge.</p>

<p>This is not to knock your theory but to simply point out where I lose the connection. For example, that space-treaty email just looks hardly professional, and the talking points email is 10,000 words of articles copied and pasted from websites.</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to discuss and to continue looking into this, but this is simply where I get lost.</p>

<p>On a side note, I&#39;m interested in any information you might know about remote viewing. I&#39;m an avid lucid dreamer and I feel like this would be similar to OBE and something I may be able to try.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I accidentally stumbled across the Joe Rogan podcast yesterday and have been fucking obsessed with Delonge since. he has become my new hero, if even a shred of everything he claims he can prove, the entire history as we know it will probably have to be rewritten.</p>

<p>i have binged, in the past few days, on old videos of testimonies, podcasts, and high ranking people talking for hours about this subject. I&#39;ve been a fan of UFOs for years but they took a backseat while I was in college, but upon finding this video I&#39;m now so fucking hyped there are no words. I am completely convinced there is a MASSIVE coverup that started around Roswell (as DeLonge points out - something many people including me have missed - The CIA was formed 90 days after roswell happened - check Wikipedia).</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a believer but practically praying he will be able to pack up even a fraction or all of what he is saying.</p>

It&#39;s like he deliberately tries to make zero sense and I&#39;m not sure of the reason for that.

<p>If ANY information regarding ET&#39;s or UFO&#39;s comes through our current media then it is a controlled narrative. They have probably been thinking of ways to change and alter the UFO narrative to fit their ends for 50 years and maybe now they have come to something.</p>

<p>It&#39;s entirely possible UFO&#39;s have all been government aircrafts and the whole UFO phenomenon is a bit of a psy-op.  Honestly could of started with Rozewell, they knew if they retracted that story the seed would be planted even further. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bill Cooper was probably the brightest light the conspiracy movement has ever seen. The level of depth to his research is continuously astounding and his manner of explaining things makes some very dense material comprehensible. </p>

<p>On his radio show, he spoke of disclosure and aliens for many years, quoting insider sources whom he&#39;d trusted for years, before declaring that he&#39;d come to realize that he&#39;d been used as a mouthpiece for disinformation. He&#39;d come to realize that the alien narrative he&#39;d been made to spread was false and deliberately crafted by his nemeses. </p>

<p>A little while later, maybe July or August 2001, he&#39;d announce on his radio show, that something terrible would be going down soon and that it&#39;d be blamed on OBL. Cooper was shot by a cop in November of the same year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think blue beam tech has been used on me before.
When I was very young on two separate occasions I saw very strange ... objects troll me when I was about to go to sleep, once a talking glove and then a year or two later a ghostly woman in a dress floating in my room.</p>

<p>My two cents on the alien part:
Lets say outer space is out there and this planet is floating around in the cosmological web.
It wouldn&#39;t make sense that aliens would come to earth in physical ships or resort to trolling humans with parlor tricks.
If you&#39;re a civilization capable of intergalactic space travel then you&#39;ve reached the point where you are:</p>

<ul>
<li>able to virtualize yourself and teleport your consciousness and form to other points in the universe</li>
<li>create a new universe of your own</li>
<li>possibly inhabit other dimensions of reality</li>
</ul>

<p>So if you become an omnipotent lifeform (say artificial super intelligence) capable of much more significant pursuits why would you beam yourself to earth and troll humans?
You wouldn&#39;t even need to play this out over the course of decades, I mean at that stage you could manipulate humanity in all sorts of ways what&#39;s keeping you from deleting us from existence or sucking us up into a black hole.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even well versed in science but if you read enough futurist blogs and articles you&#39;ll eventually get an idea of what actual aliens would be like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Back in the late 90s/2000 - 2001 when the chemtrails started appearing everywhere I remember one night at an apartment complex I was living in at the time there were lots of people gathering outside standing in the parking lot(s) staring out in to the sky.
There was this really strange formation of colors in the sky.
I never forgot that.
This combined with the &quot;hallucinations&quot; I experienced at a very young age have me convinced that the government has been planning this out for a long time and that it will happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OMG I just had to reply because I had similar things happen to me. When I was 17 or 18, I was completely terrified one night by a ghostly old woman in a white dress floating above me while I slept. She was in a standing position, not floating horizontally and I don&#39;t even think I perceived that she was aware of me, but when I noticed her, I flat out screamed and screamed in such a way that I can&#39;t even replicate when waking. It was a scream of pure terror. I, and my family, remember that scream very clearly and I remember the cause of it too.</p>

<p>I also had a vision of a classic grey alien standing on the roof outside of my bedroom and kind of peering in through the window. I don&#39;t really think this was an actual alien visitation, just an extremely vivid dream that happened to be completely mundane except for the grey alien staring at me through the window.</p>

<p>After those 2 events, I used to have various crazy-object dreams where I got the impression that I was being trolled or messed with. This was in my 20&#39;s. Some that I can remember: an animated box of Kraft macaroni and cheese being pulled across the ceiling over my bed on some sort of system of ropes and pulleys. I say animated because the rest of my room was dark but I could clearly see the Mac and cheese box and the rope was kind of like a clothes line rope, like thick and braided. </p>

<p>Another one that has actually recurred a couple times I heard a sound in the wall and noticed that it was kind of peeling, like paint or wall paper, so I start to peel it back and inside the walls are these insectoid beings about the size of shrimp methodically moving along lines of what appears to be circuit boards. One time I actually physically picked up my twin mattress and tried to use it to build a makeshift barrier between me and the creatures before I woke up.</p>

<p>Other times I have very vivid impressions of a serpent or snake like creature that disappears into or among the covers of my bed and I have been know to actually get up, turn on the light, and very frantically try to find the creature before I eventually wake up.</p>

<p>Sorry to hijack, I was just really taken by the similarities. Hasn&#39;t happened in awhile though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I honestly don&#39;t. Not everything is a psyop. If there&#39;s a simple explanation it&#39;s probably true. It&#39;s perfectly viable that it was caused by extreme drought conditions high winds and shorting electrical transformers. </p>

<p>If there&#39;s no inconsistencies there&#39;s really nothing there generally, imo. Flashes could easily be flames or sparks from electrical wires. </p>

<p>This is 100% going to be Blue Beam related.

This will be a sly way of both capturing everyone&#39;s data/information, and satisfying the curiosities regarding the UAT&#39;s they built-up in their little promo presentation.

It could have been a real plan at one point (hence the existence of the conspiracy), but pulling something like that off is just not feasible. Even if it was &quot;feasible&quot;, it relies on chaining of speculation to predict whether or not people would even accept what bluebeam is trying to offer.  Besides, there are UFO buffs that may believe what they are investigating. In DeLonge&#39;s case, he is most certainly a disinfo agent, or not very bright - because working with Podesta on anything right now is sheer retardation.

He&#39;s convinced he knew so much they decided to just start telling him shit because of a fiction book he co-wrote. In any case PBB is starting to look legit, they&#39;ve been priming us for awhile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole idea of “hidden super technology” just fails.  And it fails for a simple reason:  money.  The alleged technologies would be so insanely profitable that they wouldn’t be hidden.  War, even, is fought so many ways that hiding some weaponized form would be the least effective geopolitical use of it.</p>

<p>If there were “free energy antigravity whatever” the oil companies could not suppress it because they would not be able to <em>afford</em> to suppress it any more than Walkman cd makers could not suppress the iPhone.  When a technology comes about that will be so valuable that it renders the market and wealth of a previous one obsolete and insignificant, it cannot be suppressed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have my doubts about delonge but what if he was part of the same community that Q is a part of, another arm of their agenda? Any occult anything on delonge? He has a couple weird lyrics about aliens, but he also shows concern for negative aliens, unlike greer, whom I suspect is an agent because of such. Just curious as we know aliens are real and so are craft, and imo they are physical in nature as well as interdimensional and even spiritual too - the universe is unbelievably huge </p>

<p>The evidence is overwhelming for all of this and our true history too - obviously us in a thousand years would have craft like this <em>I think</em> I mean we&#39;ve been on a tear lately with technology </p>
