    <div class="md"><p>I was just talking about this with a few friends. Every day there&#39;s a new claim of sexual assault. Eventually it&#39;s going to get to where people don&#39;t care because they&#39;re &quot;yet another one&quot; and the shock factor is gone. That&#39;s when a few big names get dropped and will hardly get any media coverage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure about what this is about. But I do have an idea about the Louis CK thing. He was trying to get attention for his movie using his well-known behavior. It backfired in the current climate and they had to pull the movie. It&#39;s well known that a lot of people in Hollywood are perverts. It takes that kind of twisted mind to come up with the &#39;edgy&#39; stuff that we love. It&#39;s not that it happens. It&#39;s the fact that all of a sudden it&#39;s all over the press. Nothing really changed. But some pr firm is behind making an issue of it. I think it&#39;s just like the sexual harassment issue of the 60s taken to the next level. It used to have to be actual sex. Now the change is just asking for it, or doing something weird yourself and never even touching the victim. This will change legislation on workplace behavior. This might be because of the Cosby thing. He certainly made a splash, but since it was only the one guy nothing changed. So they had to turn up the heat. &quot;Well, that didn&#39;t work. Let&#39;s just get everybody who has a story to start coming forward&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think so, because it doesn’t get much bigger than Weinstein and Spacey (Spacey’s accuser included pedophilia). The Elsagate stuff is normie territory...out in the light of day for the whole world to see, I️ think that outrage is actually more grassroots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s so most people will just not care if anything comes out, or they will just assume it&#39;s bullshit. He&#39;ll I&#39;m there now with most of them. They are calling light harassment rape. So when an actual rape pops up most will associate it with harassment. They are destroying words. Calling people nazis, rapists, etc... These words now mean nothing to me. </p>
