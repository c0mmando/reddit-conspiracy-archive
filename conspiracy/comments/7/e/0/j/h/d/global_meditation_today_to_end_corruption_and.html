        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Bring your Heart into your Third Eye. The lower vibrations get ripped apart and we can transcend our problems because we look at them from a wider perspective.  Imagine Love emits from your awareness and goes for miles around you connecting to everything.</p>

<p>In about three hours or so, but it can be anytime there is sunlight  today to connect to the current of the collective energy.  </p>

<p>What I do is just close my eyes and see my heart energy as a pulsating emerald green light and then visualize it moving into my pineal , third eye area, and then forming an aura around me.  Everyone can do it their own way, not everyone is visual, just feel it or think it. </p>

<p>Get your love on, conspiracy.  The more that can get into this state of awareness of love the less their will be all these negative actions that originate from lower vibration consciousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes because virtue signaling for the &quot;feels&quot; really helps instead of doing proactive things to help. If you really wanna help people, go volunteer at the homeless shelter (I do) and you will get all the feel goods while actually making a difference in some lives. Spend enough time there, you will see how rude many are, but it&#39;s all good. It&#39;s worth the frustrations to help the ones that are nice and truly desperate to get back on their feet. Almost half of them in my experience are content living shelter to shelter though and that&#39;s frustrating. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a sermon to preach. I have this line: &quot;One of the biggest issues that we, evangelicals, face is that we have aligned ourselves too closely to one political party. This faulty approach of political loyalty has given away our prophetic voice for a bag of political buttons. And what have we got in return?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When we live in the love vibration, our energy resonates at a high frequency and we express the God-qualities of compassion, forgiveness, tolerance, respect, generosity, joy, peace—all that inspires, empowers and enhances life. The love vibration lifts us to a higher state of consciousness and frees us of the thoughts, feelings, and actions that minimize and victimize us. Gone are any neurotic fear, guilt, judgment, greed, envy, arrogance, and the ego&#39;s stubborn need to be right. “Vexations of the spirit” lose their power over us. Free from the baggage of negativity and limited thinking, we begin to feel lighter and shine brighter. We become the magnet attracting our good.</p>
