        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am being constantly attacked, by &quot;unnamed users here&quot;, </p>

<p>I am attempting to design an earthquake prediction application yes.</p>

<p>But there is a conspiracy it seems that began the day I attempted to crowd source for finances to contract employees to fast track my project. I don&#39;t know if these are Leo&#39;s or crazies, but it is quite uncomforting.  </p>

<p>I was attacked immediately and called a scammer in this forum by users, at the pique of my performance. I&#39;ve done some amazing shit in this sub. Including calling block coin crashes, inspiring users to take possession of crypto currency. I even built a website to help you all get into bitcoin last year. (at 700.00 per coin). </p>

<p>Several users greatly thanked me for my help, but my earthquake project I take very seriously---</p>

<p>These users began attacking me because the request was for 600k which was a loose figure. (It seems like alot of money), but in terms of what I hoped to accomplish its quite laughable. The eventual end product (if successful), would be worth billions. I can say that because mexico lost 3.5 billion last week in a danger zone that I claimed just this year. Not to mention human lives are in jeopardy.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You know its not so much I ever even claimed that I was right or that this project would work with any level of guarentee, I called this a &quot;personal donation&quot;, which would go to three primary causes. Cause one; marrying my gf, Cause 2 getting us a place closer to her fathers, and cause three dumping the change on the project and overhead itself-</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was always intended to be a positive thing, and between the potential for saving lives, and helping to reduce national property damages. It would have been a moment for us all to come together for something positive. </p>

<p>Look I&#39;ve seen reddit give hundreds of people, hundreds of thousands of dollars, for reasons like being harassed, and assaulted. Yet in mexico the 8.0 killed 350 people. </p>

<p>I am not saying that I could have saved a single person. What I mean to say is that earthquakes are destructive, and in 2018 earths rotation will be slowing and the suns solar cycle will be in minima creating a vast amount of coronal holes to surface. </p>

<p>We need a more sophisticated earthquake prediction system, and truthfully my idea might just work, and over the last year I have tried my damnedest to show you all that. But the users attacking me are stealing that from you. </p>

<p>I even hit this quake today-

<p>Post: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7djtdw/potentially_another_large_quake_in_iraq_in_the/">Here</a></p>

<p>Reference:
Estimated Magnitude: 6.3-6.8
Just my thoughts- Not many aftershocks of high magnitude there, but the activity could also move somewhere else. I haven&#39;t been on the board lately-
Maybe Turkey, Papua New Guinea, or Vanuatu,</p>

<p>Have some cool stuff to share with you all soon. Hang in there!!!</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7e023n/x_marks_the_spot_64_magnitude_earthquake_74_km/">The post itself found here</a> Was taken down in karma and redacted from the board immediately-</p>

<p>There are people literally attacking me and my what? 
My goal to help people?
My goal to have a successful and happy life?</p>

<p>I mean over my last year here I have literally hit at least 10 significant quakes, and out of a list of 35 that&#39;s remarkable. 8 of those were very very close to the respective epicenters, and my posts were produced using a single cell phone. My infrastructure was shit, and Low and behold an un-named mod, is who factually helped me get a doctor appointment, and get my computer back.</p>

<p>So seriously how come every time a article hits front page its about some &quot;just cause&quot; that leads to some huge crowd sourcing campaign over &quot;being bullied&quot;, but here in our sub I offer a solution to potentially curbing earthquakes? WTF. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not like I expected to accomplish my goal overnight, but my social networks were literally slammed with users calling me a scammer, and now I am personally being attacked for doing my best to literally be my best. </p>

<p>I have an awesome gf, and some big dreams guys. </p>

<p>At this point I stopped my campaign due to fear  from stalkers. </p>

<p>I had no intent to do that, but I had no intent to scam anyone either. I literally gave (some mods) all my details, and personal contact information. They approved my request to campaign, and literally, it just feels like reddit is fake. Like the PR news pieces saying redditors came together for x y z is all bogus happy chatter, and like the efforts I placed forth are unworthy. </p>

<p>Eitherway, I love you guys as people and I am sorry, because this isn&#39;t really about the campaign anymore. </p>

<p>Its just the people attacking me, and wow- 
Just wow-</p>

<p>I&#39;ve worked my ass off for a year, and met with hundreds of users. I&#39;ve learned so much about so many things, and dedicated so much real time into this project. So It&#39;s disheartening to be called a scammer in the end. </p>

<p>Please put an end to those rumors-
Ty-</p>

<p>Sorry to rant; I just find value in what I am doing, and I truly hope you guys did too. 
KK, Night reddit- I am off to bed- </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it shouldn&#39;t take a specialist. It shouldn&#39;t be someone else&#39;s job to pore over your post history to tell how accurate you are. You should be tracking your <em>own</em> record, and making the data available in an accessible format, if you seriously want to demonstrate that your predictions are better than random.</p>

<p>It shouldn&#39;t be hard. Start tracking your predictions in an Excel spreadsheet, instead of scattered posts with broad, vague language. </p>

<p>Of course you aren&#39;t obligated to take your own ideas seriously. But if you don&#39;t, why should anyone else? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My user history on both my reddit accounts, Plus all known accounts I&#39;ve operated past and present per extended social networks. 
I don&#39;t need to track my results, as I am taking a non traditional route. If this was a &quot;requirement&quot; per person, then I&#39;d assume they weren&#39;t interested, because its a charity; I am not selling anything-
So why design a &quot;sales platform&quot;. 
My donations are attributed to formula, and work ethic. Not to be confused with given promises? As I very well don&#39;t know if those I contract will ultimately produce a working product in the end. I will pay them to do their best all the same, and I will take the liberty in getting the best for the money spent. 
Its not every day you ask for a half million dollars to give away in &quot;charity&quot;, so I think its safe to say I would do my best to see its those that deserve the most that get it in the end. :)</p>

<p>Seriously, just put some visuals together and let people visually see your predictions coming true. Why is this so complicated for you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is crazy! I saw your post about the predicted earthquake in Iraq, that also mentioned Vanuatu when you posted it. And then there was an earthquake 6.4 just by Vanuatu today.</p>

<p>Ignore the people who are attacking you. There are good people here, but remember that a LOT of people here are extremely suspicious by nature. It&#39;s a shame because it&#39;s good to be kind to your fellow human beings and to give people the benefit of the doubt unless they prove you wrong. I wish you lots of luck with your project! Maybe start a YT channel and patreon account or something? There are channels like Higher Truth Channel that look into earthquakes and solar activity and stuff you could contact them maybe they&#39;d feature your work and help you get an audience and support?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you need 600k to regurgitate publicly available data from suspicious observers, which comes from publicly available data on solar and geological activity?  Your predictions suffer from the same inconsistencies as theirs, implying that you haven&#39;t refined their model much, if at all.</p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty of theoretical and modeling issues to work out, before you try to get fairly large amounts of money from people.  I think the field you&#39;re studying is fantastic, and hints at the future of geological and cosmological studies, but you&#39;re not on a &quot;unique&quot; path, and asking for 600k for something developed by others seems odd.</p>

<p>The same area had a 6.6 quake on November 1 and a 6.8 quake on October 31. These sorts of quakes are hardly a rare phenomena in that area.</p>

<p>I note you didn&#39;t predict those earlier quakes...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>FWIW I always read and upvote your posts. I guess the funding requests rubbed people the wrong way, but ffs it&#39;s not like you can take this research to a university.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re good with funding critical surgeries for people in this country, then individuals should be able to exercise their own critical judgment about whether or not they&#39;d like to contribute to possibly cutting edge scientific discoveries. The pushback reminds me of the Fleischmann/Pons cold fusion research. They were clearly onto something, and people just lost their minds about it because it was difficult to reproduce and - more importantly - didn&#39;t conform to existing knowledge. Plenty of science is hard to reproduce but if it confirms biases, it somehow gets published.</p>

<p>Anyway, long reply to say I think you&#39;re onto something. Keep following your dream and your research. It&#39;s not at all irrational to imagine that intense magnetic forces would have an impact on geo processes.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

There is a lot of &quot;fountains&quot;, but they are literally just &quot;referral links&quot; for the owner. </p>

<p>The point I am trying to make, is its a very dedicated directory. I have no idea where the owner will take it from here?</p>

<p>This channel is specifically for Earthquakes, and his predictions are usually pretty spot on. So I&#39;m not sure why you need 600k to do something a youtuber is able to do from his home and he isn&#39;t charging people to warn them of potential disaster.  Also You might be able to get donation through  a youtube channel yourself. Maybe some more backers. Have you considered a kickstarter? or something.</p>

I have just created a youtube, and I am currently producing a video, jam packed with the data, plans, and concerns I have on my own project. It was crowd sourcing that lead to my &quot;brigade&quot;. The issue is that users are calling me a scammer which is &quot;bias&quot;. 
At no point have I ever attempted to scam anyone- </p>

<p>The users doing this have crossed a line, and I merely wanted to bring that to the other users that share our forums attention- </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re a smart guy, but you&#39;re acting dense in this case.  Are you unaware of <em>why</em> you&#39;re being attacked?  Surely, you know:</p>

<ul>
<li>The earth is experiencing the most frequent and prevalent earthquakes in recorded history and situation is getting steadily worse</li>
<li>The USGS secretly downgrades every one of its recorded seismic events</li>
</ul>

<p>Point #1 has a <em>cause</em>.  Point #2 is an example of the effort to suppress the public&#39;s curiosity about the <em>cause</em>.  The attacks you&#39;re experiencing are another example.  If you get popular, you can count on the attacks intensifying.  You think these are average-joe users trying to discourage you?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Etherdoge is available for purchase via etherdelta present day, and still retains a minute value in ethereum. The currency isn&#39;t a scam. It is a ERC20 Token with a crap developer-</p>

<p>However much like dogecoin, as crypto currencys continue to accelerate in value, Etherdoge will gain worth via trading platforms. 
Its near valueless I couldn&#39;t agree more; Yet it isn&#39;t a scam as you claim it to be. Nor, am I a scam artist as you still continue to insinuate. </p>

<p>It just goes on to show your bias towards-
Which is also available for others to see as well. </p>

<p>I personally take no offense at all, in my hoping that etherdoge was a successful online digital commodity. Nice try though-</p>

<p>If users want to know how accurate it is, then prior to calling me a scammer, that is something that they themselves should explore and prove. Because its their own admission, and to openly harass someone without evidence is not cunning; No sir not at all.</p>
