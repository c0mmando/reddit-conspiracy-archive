       Hi readers,
      </p>
      <p>
       So I was in bed with my partner. We were both on the way to going to sleep, eyes closed, facing each other. Everything is quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then all of a sudden my left ear rings for around 3 seconds. (Gradual up, sustain, gradual down). This was an internal ringing, not an audible sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wait 5 seconds after it finished.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I ask my partner if her ear just rang.
      </p>
      <p>
       She tells me that her left ear rang for a few seconds moments ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       How could that happen? That's either some insane coincidence, OR there was an external field of some sort that affected both of us at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can anyone explain this? Was around 11pm.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Woke up, my bird had died overnight. There are a few mentions (mostly on what I would consider bogus websites) that a ringing in the left ear indicates a death close to you. Still not enough to rule out coincidence, but I'm a bit spooked

       Maybe your neighbours were playing around with something that emits a frequency? There's devices that do this.

       I will often hear ringing and I think could be multiple things. In my house it's typically an electronic emitting a frequency. However, I'll sometimes hear ringing when I'm camping and there is a Doppler effect so I can tell the source of the ringing is moving.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the rare occasion when I see an "entity" they're preceeded by a frequency, low frequencies for the horrible ones and higher frequencies for the neutral ones.

       I experienced the same thing last night! I was doing some audio editing so my first thought was that my interface was acting up. So I muted it and I continued to hear it for another few minutes! Very odd.

       That's pretty normal actually, what was odd about this was that it happened to both of us at the same time which leads me to believe it was external, not internal

       Yep it happens to us as well. I've noticed a high pitched frequency coming from the television. If you turn the volume down it stops. Now all TV's are digital hmmm it makes you wonder wth is going on

       In some cultures if you hear ringing in your ears the believe it means someone has just died. I was with my sister in her cabin some years ago and she said to me that her ears rang. Her mother in law also said her ear rang at the same time. A mother was walking her baby and a car hit them killing both that evening.

       I don't have links to the patents but messing with brain waves in a certain way can do this.  The patents talk about altering the brain, almost downloading information to it, and the recipient would only heat a ringing.  I think it has to do with the digital meters.

       Do you happen to know the name of the device(s) or equipment that might be able to do this even if you can't link or remember precisely what it's called? Do you know any keywords that I could use to try and find the patents?

       my wife and i also get these "ringing" episodes. it's not tinnitus. your way of describing it as sort of an internal ringing is quite appropriate. not sure what it is, a lot of people talk about it. check out r/retconned. also

       Heard ringing in my ears about the same time last night... ramped up, 3 seconds and gone. Your bird dying got me to thinking about all the missing birds. Don't know if you are aware but where I am for quite a while the birds seemed to have just disappeared. I found 1 dead bird in the yard early in May, but then in late July they just seemed to vanish... it was eerily quiet outside, no cicadas or crickets either... high strangeness. Then I found if I expected to see and hear birds one or two would show up, but the usual abundance has never returned.
Then I saw a youtuber who runs a gardening YT channel mentions that the birds seemed to have disappeared. Then sync another YT channel who has a farm mentioned no flies and no birds to speak of. Different parts of the country. 
I noticed the severe decrease in birds around the time the ear ringing started for me. Now the other YTers had noticed it earlier in the year/different times than I did and since I live in a place where birds are and have been abundant year round because birds migrate here for the winter the lack is disturbing. 
I have always fed the birds and used to have flocks and flocks of them and squirrels. They just disappeared except for a few. A new squirrel just showed up, but it doesn't tease my dog, so I know it isn't the same one. The bird seed sat for 6 weeks untouched. Just over the last week some birds have started to reappear. Enough that I now am back to refilling the feeder about a third as often as before.
I just found the coincidence? of ringing in the ears and your bird dying to my experience with the birds disappearing around the time I noticed ear ringing start up.

       Life is all about frequencies. One of you could have raised the vibration of the other simply by vibrating higher, or it's simply God (doing this to everyone to wake us to our inner reality) If you really want to understand what is going on you will have to reactivate your third eye, use this it's free :

       Fear is an illusion.
It's all about Love.
We are One.
      </p>
      <p>
       If really you are going through your spiritual awakening you will eventually be able to control the ringing to go higher or lower so no stress here.

       Much love dear One.
