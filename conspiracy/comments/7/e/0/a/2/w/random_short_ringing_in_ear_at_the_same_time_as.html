        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi readers,</p>

<p>So I was in bed with my partner. We were both on the way to going to sleep, eyes closed, facing each other. Everything is quiet.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden my left ear rings for around 3 seconds. (Gradual up, sustain, gradual down). This was an internal ringing, not an audible sound.</p>

<p>I wait 5 seconds after it finished.</p>

<p>Then I ask my partner if her ear just rang.</p>

<p>She tells me that her left ear rang for a few seconds moments ago.</p>

<p>How could that happen? That&#39;s either some insane coincidence, OR there was an external field of some sort that affected both of us at the same time.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain this? Was around 11pm.</p>

<p>EDIT: Woke up, my bird had died overnight. There are a few mentions (mostly on what I would consider bogus websites) that a ringing in the left ear indicates a death close to you. Still not enough to rule out coincidence, but I&#39;m a bit spooked</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will often hear ringing and I think could be multiple things. In my house it&#39;s typically an electronic emitting a frequency. However, I&#39;ll sometimes hear ringing when I&#39;m camping and there is a Doppler effect so I can tell the source of the ringing is moving. </p>

<p>On the rare occasion when I see an &quot;entity&quot; they&#39;re preceeded by a frequency, low frequencies for the horrible ones and higher frequencies for the neutral ones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Heard ringing in my ears about the same time last night... ramped up, 3 seconds and gone. Your bird dying got me to thinking about all the missing birds. Don&#39;t know if you are aware but where I am for quite a while the birds seemed to have just disappeared. I found 1 dead bird in the yard early in May, but then in late July they just seemed to vanish... it was eerily quiet outside, no cicadas or crickets either... high strangeness. Then I found if I expected to see and hear birds one or two would show up, but the usual abundance has never returned.
Then I saw a youtuber who runs a gardening YT channel mentions that the birds seemed to have disappeared. Then sync another YT channel who has a farm mentioned no flies and no birds to speak of. Different parts of the country. 
I noticed the severe decrease in birds around the time the ear ringing started for me. Now the other YTers had noticed it earlier in the year/different times than I did and since I live in a place where birds are and have been abundant year round because birds migrate here for the winter the lack is disturbing. 
I have always fed the birds and used to have flocks and flocks of them and squirrels. They just disappeared except for a few. A new squirrel just showed up, but it doesn&#39;t tease my dog, so I know it isn&#39;t the same one. The bird seed sat for 6 weeks untouched. Just over the last week some birds have started to reappear. Enough that I now am back to refilling the feeder about a third as often as before.
I just found the coincidence? of ringing in the ears and your bird dying to my experience with the birds disappearing around the time I noticed ear ringing start up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Life is all about frequencies. One of you could have raised the vibration of the other simply by vibrating higher, or it&#39;s simply God (doing this to everyone to wake us to our inner reality) If you really want to understand what is going on you will have to reactivate your third eye, use this it&#39;s free : <a href="http://www.eso-garden.com/specials/awakening_the_third_eye.pdf">http://www.eso-garden.com/specials/awakening_the_third_eye.pdf</a> </p>

<p>Fear is an illusion.
It&#39;s all about Love.
We are One.</p>

<p>If really you are going through your spiritual awakening you will eventually be able to control the ringing to go higher or lower so no stress here.</p>
