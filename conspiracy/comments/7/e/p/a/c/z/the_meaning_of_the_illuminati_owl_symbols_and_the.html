        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Bohemian Grove Owl = In Greek mythology, a little owl (Athene noctua) traditionally represents or accompanies Athena, the virgin goddess of wisdom, or Minerva, her syncretic incarnation in Roman mythology.[1] Because of such association, the bird — often referred to as the &quot;owl of Athena&quot; or the &quot;owl of Minerva&quot; — has been used as a symbol of knowledge, wisdom, perspicacity and erudition throughout the Western world.</p>

<p>Baphomet= In Greek religion and mythology, Pan (/pæn/;[1] Ancient Greek: Πάν, Pan) is the god of the wild, shepherds and flocks, nature of mountain wilds and rustic music, and companion of the nymphs.[2] He has the hindquarters, legs, and horns of a goat, in the same manner as a faun or satyr. With his homeland in rustic Arcadia, he is also recognized as the god of fields, groves, and wooded glens; because of this, Pan is connected to fertility and the season of spring. The ancient Greeks also considered Pan to be the god of theatrical criticism and impromptus.[3] The word &quot;panic&quot; is a tribute to the god.
Pan, God of nature, the wild, shepherds, flocks, of mountain wilds, and is often associated with sexuality
Symbol-Pan flute,  In the 18th and 19th centuries, Pan became a significant figure in the Romantic movement of western Europe and also in the 20th-century Neopagan movement.</p>

<p>Greek Goddess of Wisdom and War. Athena, also referred to as Athene, is a very important goddess of many things. She is goddess of wisdom, courage, inspiration, civilization, law and justice, strategic warfare, mathematics, strength, strategy, the arts, crafts, and skill.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minerval_insignia.png">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Minerval_insignia.png</a></p>

<p>This is the original insignia of the Bavarian Illuminati. It pictures the owl of Minerva - symbolising wisdom - on top of an opened book.</p>

<p>Minerva was the Roman goddess of wisdom, medicine, commerce, handicrafts, poetry, the arts in general, and later, war. In many ways similar to the Greek goddess Athena, she had important temples in Rome and was patron of the Quinquatras festival.</p>

<p>In the mystery cults of the highly syncretic Hellenistic era,[18] Pan is made cognate with Phanes/Protogonos, Zeus, Dionysus and Eros.
Accounts of Pan&#39;s genealogy are so varied that it must lie buried deep in mythic time. Like other nature spirits, Pan appears to be older than the Olympians, if it is true that he gave Artemis her hunting dogs and taught the secret of prophecy to Apollo.</p>

<p>Pan is famous for his sexual powers, and is often depicted with a phallus. Diogenes of Sinope, speaking in jest, related a myth of Pan learning masturbation from his father, Hermes, and teaching the habit to shepherds.</p>

<p>Part of the Hymn to Pan by Aleister Crowley</p>

<p>With the lonely lust of devildom.</p>

<p>Thrust the sword through the galling fetter,</p>

<p>All-devourer, all-begetter;</p>

<p>Give me the sign of the Open Eye,</p>

<p>And the token erect of thorny thigh,</p>

<p>And the word of madness and mystery,</p>

<p>O Pan! Io Pan!</p>

<p>Io Pan! Io Pan Pan! Pan Pan! Pan,</p>

<p>I am a man:</p>

<p>Do as thou wilt, as a great god can,</p>

<p>O Pan! Io Pan!</p>

<p>Io Pan! Io Pan Pan! I am awake</p>

<p>In the grip of the snake.</p>

<p>The eagle slashes with beak and claw;</p>

<p>The gods withdraw:</p>

<p>The great beasts come, Io Pan! I am borne</p>

<p>To death on the horn</p>

<p>Of the Unicorn.</p>

<p>I am Pan! Io Pan! Io Pan Pan! Pan!</p>

<p>I am thy mate, I am thy man,</p>

<p>Goat of thy flock, I am gold, I am god,</p>

<p>Flesh to thy bone, flower to thy rod.</p>

<p>With hoofs of steel I race on the rocks</p>

<p>Through solstice stubborn to equinox.</p>

<p>And I rave; and I rape and I rip and I rend</p>

<p>Everlasting, world without end,</p>

<p>Mannikin, maiden, Maenad, man,</p>

<p>In the might of Pan.</p>

<p>Io Pan! Io Pan Pan! Pan! Io Pan!</p>

<p>Athena, and Hephaestus are worshipped together. Athena as the Goddess of Wisdom, and War, and Hephaestus as the Creator of the great weapons of war for Gods, and Men. Hephaestus was the God of Fire and the Forge, the patron god of smiths, craftsmen, sculptors and artisans. He was the weapon maker of the Gods. In Greek mythology, Hephaestus was the son of Zeus and Hera, the king and queen of the gods. In another version, he was Hera&#39;s parthenogenous child, rejected by his mother because of his deformity and thrown off Mount Olympus and down to earth. As a smithing god, Hephaestus made all the weapons of the gods in Olympus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes of course. Although to the elite this is what these symbols mean. To us maybe a man behind a curtain playing an all powerful wizard. The elite believe they have the blood of gods pumping through their veins, and the profane sheep must be controlled for their own good, but ritual does not rule the world. Ritual leads to a world that rules itself. Everything is named after the gods. All the plants, science, and trade. All the NASA &quot;moon landings&quot; named after Apollo the God of light. The statue of Liberty is no woman it is Helios the sun God. The Goddess Columbia reigns atop The U.S. Capitol building, and named after the Goddess The District of Columbia. MERCURY the messenger god meets you outside the Capitol building. The modern EMT symbol, and symbol from medicine comes straight from the Greeks, and the good Apollo&#39;s son teaching medicine to man. The snake emblem also reflects the Rod of Asclepius, widely used as the symbol of medical care worldwide. There are several theories as to its development; it is named for the Greek mythological figure Asclepius, who was said to have possessed healing power.  ALL religions worship these same gods unknowingly Hades=hell, Apollo=Lucifer, Zeus=god, Samson=Hercules, Moses=Hermes, Devil/great dragon=Typhon, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The actual history of the statue is rather more than that. The statue of ‘Libertas’ or the Roman Goddess of Freedom is actually a like-for-like representation of the original Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, statue of ‘Colossus of Rhodes.’ The similarity doesn’t end there.</p>

<p>The Statue of Liberty was designed and built to the scale and design of the original Colossus of Rhodes (at least as it was believed to have looked at the time Liberty was constructed).</p>

<p>Beginning work in 292 BC, it took Charles of Lindos and his designers nearly twelve years to complete the 110-foot statue, which was then erected on a 50-foot pedestal. The base was carved out of white marble and joined to the cast of feet at the ankles. The status was believed to be dedicated to the Greek God of Sun, Helios (or Apollo), whose blessings were supposedly the driving force for Rhodes’ victory Cyprus (305 BC).

    <div class="md"><p>The nephilim are the offspring of fallen Angels mating with the daughters of man. Not Gods. The fallen were cursed to watch their children die, then sentenced to be bound in hell until the time of the end. Hermes and Moses were very different people, with very different laws and beliefs. Hermetic teachings are the antithesis to the thesis of Torah. They are completely incompatible. The Bible rejects the men of renown as being an abomination, cursed to roam the Earth as evil spirits after their deaths.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Now a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a garland of twelve stars. 2 Then being with child, she cried out in labor and in pain to give birth.</p>

<p>3 And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great, fiery red dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads. 4 His tail drew a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to give birth, to devour her Child as soon as it was born. 5 She bore a male Child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron. And her Child was caught up to God and His throne. 6 Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that they should feed her there one thousand two hundred and sixty days.</p>

<p>The Python used to dwell on Mount Parnassus, in central Greece. Wherever the Python went, it diffused an obnoxious smell and spread mischief and death.
Python was once sent out by Hera, the wife of Zeus, in order to chase the pregnant Leto, a lover of Zeus, so that she couldn&#39;t settle anywhere to give birth. Zeus felt sorrow for Leto and transformed her into a quail (ortyx) in order to give birth to their twin children, Apollo and Artemis. </p>

<p>By the time Apollo, the son of Leto, was only four days old, he was already a strong boy. A silver bow with golden arrows, given to him by the blacksmith Hephaestus, made the young god decide to kill Python and take revenge. Soon, Apollo went to the  creature’s cave to seek after Python. When the creature faced Apollo, it started boiling with rage and lunged at Apollo to devour him. But Apollo was faster and managed to throw an arrow to Python, piercing him right on its forehead. Python cried of terror and his scream could be heard all over the  canyons of Mount Parnassus. It struggled hard to survive... but in the end it surrendered to death.</p>

<p>The death of the Python filled Apollo with joy, so he happily took his lyre and started playing a song of victory, giving joy to people all around.
This was the moment when Apollo became  the god of the Music!
Right after he finished his song, Apollo took the creature and buried it under the slopes of Mount Parnassus. On its surface he built the oracle of Delphi, the most famous oracle of ancient Greece.
However, Apollo had committed a crime and, according to the laws of Mount Olympus, he needed to be purified. Therefore, Zeus ordered from Apollo to institute the Pythian Games at Delphi so that athletic and musical competitions could be hosted. Apollo followed the order and he even took part in the games himself. From then on, the Pythian Games were held every four years in Apollo&#39;s honor.</p>

<p>Now when the dragon saw that he had been cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male Child. 14 But the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent. 
And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.</p>

<p>2 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon (Apollo).</p>

<p>And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, 8 but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them[a] in heaven any longer. 9 So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</p>

<p>Known as the &quot;father of all monsters&quot;, Typhon was a fire-breathing dragon who had one hundred heads that never slept. After the Titanomachy, Gaea wanted to punish Zeus for imprisoning her Titan children in Tartarus; thus, Typhon was born. Typhon confronted Zeus and in their first battle, managed to repel almost all of the Olympian gods and tear out Zeus&#39; tendons. Hermes managed to get the tendons back and give them to Zeus,.   Zeus recovered his strength, he made a sudden descent from heaven on a chariot drawn by a winged horse. Hurling thunderbolts, he pursued Typhon    who eventually threw his lightning bolts against Typhon and overwhelmed him. He finally trapped him underneath Mount Etna.</p>

<p>And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all.</p>

<p>Zeus had raised up his might and seized his arms, thunder and lightning and lurid thunderbolt, [855] he leaped from Olympus and struck him, and burned all the marvellous heads of the monster about him. But when Zeus had conquered him and lashed him with strokes, Typhoeus was hurled down, a maimed wreck, so that the huge earth groaned. 
But when the blessed gods had finished their toil, and settled by force their struggle for honors with the Titans, they pressed far-seeing Olympian Zeus to reign and to rule over them, by Earth&#39;s prompting. So he divided their dignities amongst them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re taking the Bible literally. A woman in biblical prophecy is a church. The dragon, representing Lucifer, having 7 heads are 7 kings, 10 horns means Earth is divided into 10 sections (it was, and very recently)  Stars from heaven are the Angels. 1/3 of which followed Lucifer to earth. </p>

<p>Apollo was worshipped as a god, however in the exact text you quoted he is a fallen angel, otherwise known as a demon. This puts these beings at odds with both Christianity and Judaism. Funnily enough the star on Israel&#39;s flag today is the star of Molech. Portrayed as a bull throughout history, it is the god (fallen angel) the ancient Hebrews built an alter to when Moses went up the mountain to receive the law.</p>

He, along with Dionysus, absorbed the role of the chief Phrygian god Sabazios in the syncretic deity known in Rome as Sabazius. The Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes erected a statue of Zeus Olympios in the Judean Temple in Jerusalem.[65] Hellenizing Jews referred to this statue as Baal Shamen (in English, Lord of Heaven).[66]</p>

<p>Dragon , and Lucifer are never mentioned being the same beings in the Bible. The dragon would be Typhon he made war with the gods in heaven, and was cast to the earth. The Olympian gods were not cast to the earth. Angel in the Greek true meaning simply means messenger, nothing more.  Who is the serpent in genesis to you? Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made.  Here the serpent is referenced to a beast of the field that god had made. We know Satan if a fallen angel cast here is not of this earth, so neither a beast, or an earthly made creature. </p>

<p>Satan (Hebrew: שָּׂטָן‎‎ satan, meaning &quot;enemy&quot; or &quot;adversary&quot;; Arabic: شيطان‎‎ shaitan, meaning; &quot;astray&quot;, &quot;distant&quot;, 
The Devil (from Greek: διάβολος diábolos &quot;slanderer, accuser
As a word, &#39;satan&#39; is an untranslated Hebrew word which means &#39;adversary&#39;, while &#39;devil&#39; is a translation of the Greek word &#39;diabolos&#39;, meaning a liar, an enemy or false accuser. 
Dragon-Greek word δράκων, drakon (genitive drakontos, δράκοντος) &quot;serpent, giant seafish&quot;
sepent-fidi or fidisio kormi. This is the Greek word for &quot;snake&quot;</p>

<p>Demon-Disembodied spirit, Not a fallen angel. To mate with the daughters of man, and have sex with them, and create children they care about, they would be physical beings.
Daemon comes from the Ancient Greek word δαίμων, which originally referred to a lesser deity or guiding spirit. 
The Bible never mentions the name. Lucifer to refer to the 3rd of the angels that rebelled against god. It says Satan, devil, that old serpent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1stly, Lucifer isn&#39;t even a name. It is capitalized due to bad translation. When speaking of &quot;Lucifer&quot; it is said he is fallen. There is only one group of beings fallen, the watchers. The Greek and Romans have many stories of &quot;the gods&quot; including Zeus laying with the daughters of men, and bringing forth children. This matches the story in Enoch, Jubilee&#39;s, and Jasher. The nephilim were originally physical beings, part human and partly divine. Upon their deaths, as they were neither human not divine they were cursed to wander the Earth as evil spirits.</p>

<p>I fail to see how any of anything you&#39;ve said leads to biblical characters such as Moses being &quot;the old gods&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where in anything bible, or otherwise does it say that the gods have died. It says there were nephilim in those days and after. It says I observed Lucifer as lightning falling from heaven. If Lucifer isn&#39;t a name why are you constantly using it as one, but I can&#39;t? &quot;The watchers&quot; sounds like they are doing a lot more than just watching to me. Lucifer means light bearer. Who was the light bearer? Prometheus gave fire, or light to man, and was punished severely for it. I believe Lucifer gets mixed up with Prometheus, and Apollo. Would not Prometheus be the light bearer cut down , and weaken the nations? Man didn&#39;t know fire until the light bearer gave us knowledge of it.Jesus= Zeus. The letter Just wasn&#39;t invented in those times, but take off the J it = Zeus. T</p>

<p>Why is it so hard for you to accept that the Bible is opposite the old gods of the Greeks/Romans/Egyptians/Sumerians? All throughout the Bible the Israelites are at odds with those who worship these gods. Daniel, Ezekiel, Joshua, Noah, Jesus cast out nephilim spirits. Is there a mental block, where you are so determined to mix the stories of the Bible with the stories of false gods? The Sumerian, Egyptian, Roman, Greek, gods are all the same beings under different names due to language. Judaism and Christianity have the same singular God. Jesus didn&#39;t throw lightening bolts or turn into animals to sleep with women. You&#39;re pulling bullshit out your ass to convince yourself of lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read Blavatsky, Pike, and Bailey. I know they believe that Lucifer is the good god who brought the light of knowledge to mankind. While the God of the Jews, Adonai, is an inferior dumber &quot;god&quot;. They created the Gnostic philosophy of a &quot;bad creator,&quot; where &quot;Lucifer&quot; (their Christ) saved us from ignorance by giving us his knowledge to eat. </p>

<p>They teach the immortality of the soul as separate from God. However this is exactly the ideology that got the devil thrown from heaven in the 1st place, his attempt at raising himself to the level of God. The &quot;new age&quot; is simply a return to the old anti-deluvian belief system implemented by the fallen after the garden. We are approaching the time of the end, and Jesus said it would be as the time of Noah, where these nephilim and &quot;Watchers&quot; walk the Earth. (&quot;Alien&quot; disclosure coming right up) Many will be decieved. Hopefully you&#39;re not part of that group. </p>

<p>With &quot;Christ-mas&quot; coming up shortly, we celebrate by decorating a tree. Originally decorating it with apples, now with bulbs of red color. The tree represents the tree of knowledge, and we often put an angel of light on top, otherwise known as Lucifer who can even appear as an angel of light to decieve us. While Jesus was born in September, the whore of Babylon  (catholicism) moved the day of celebration to December 25th. Birthday of many pagan sun gods.</p>

Pan signify the natural harmony of the spheres, and the god himself is a symbol

    <div class="md"><p>Those trees are often guarded by crawly monsters. In Greek Mythology, gods ate ambrosia and drank nectar. Both words mean one thing: immortality. ... Gods used it as food but also in order to wash their body and as smearing for the dead bodies of great mortals.
And out of the ground the Lord God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Genesis 2:9
When Adam and Eve ate from the forbidden Tree of Knowledge, it appears that God alerted other Gods to be on alert because man should not eat also from the Tree of Life and become immortal like them.
Then the Lord God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever, Genesis 3:22
It is written in the stories of the Greek gods that ambrosia and nectar was the food and drink of the immortal gods and this first appears in the Greek mythology relating to the birth of Zeus. Before the ‘invention’ or ‘discovery’ of ambrosia and nectar by the gods, it was written that they would feed by ‘sniffing’ the vapours of their dead enemies, as if they would feed from the energy of the dead souls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>God bestowed upon Moses a copper serpent that was to be attached to a stick and used for curative purposes. The mythical Greek character Hermes also carried a serpent stick called the “Caduceus” that was divinely bestowed upon him, and which became the worldwide symbol of the medical profession. . But, of course, it is also true that Moses had another “serpent stick” that he carried on his missions to bring God’s messages to the Pharaoh.</p>

<p>We are told by Jewish sources such as the writer Eupolemus, who wrote about 150 BC, that the alphabet was invented by Moses while, according to Greek sources, the same alphabet was invented by Hermes. The Egyptian Hermes -- whom they called “Thoth” -- is credited with inventing hieroglyphic writing while the Babylonian Hermes, whom they called “Nebo,” is credited with inventing cuneiform writing. Nebo, a word that means the “Prophet,” was a common nickname for Moses, and when Moses died he was buried upon Mount Pisgah which is also called, no doubt in memory of Moses, Mount Nebo.</p>

<p>Needless to say Moses was a prolific writer of sacred texts. In this regard Hermes was apparently no slouch either. So-called Hermetic books dealing with the religion of Egypt were mentioned by Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Porphyry, and Jamblichus. Since Clement even says that the books of Hermes were carried by the Egyptians in religious processions, one surely wonders if they were kept in an ark like the law of Moses during the religious processions of the Israelites. However well known these Hermetic writings were in ancient times, it wasn’t until the middle of the 15th century that some of these previously lost Hermetic texts had supposedly been found in the libraries of the Byzantine Empire. Suspect though they are, these books are accredited to the semi-mythical figure named Hermes Trismegistus (thrice greatest) whom the Gnostics insist, while not being Moses himself, was a contemporary of his.</p>

<p>an ever present characteristic of any image of Hermes is his petasos, a cap which featured a wide circular brim. The fact that this petasos looks, even to the casual observer, remarkably like the halo of a Christian saint may be a clue to it‘s origin. For the corona of Moses, which is Scripturally attested to at Exodus 34:30 (&quot;and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him&quot;), probably was represented pictorially as a circle around his head and, therefore, more than likely served as the origin of the petasos of Hermes.</p>

<p>Hermes also had another form of headgear that was intended to hide him, known as the cap of darkness or the helmet of invisibility. We know this because, according to Hyginus from his Astronomica (2.12), he once loaned it to Perseus: “Perseus ... received from Hermes, ... petasos, and, in addition, a helmet which kept its wearer from being seen ... the helmet of Hades (the Unseen One)...” Moses also had a headdress that he wore for the purpose of hiding his face. His corona was frightening to people so he used a veil to conceal it, as explained in the book of Exodus at 34:33: &quot;And until Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.&quot;</p>

<p>Hermes is often depicted as wearing winged sandals, but the Greeks would certainly know enough not to take this literally. The Greeks would understand that traveling upon wings was merely symbolic and meant nothing more than going swiftly. Moses was sent to deliver the Israelites upon eagles wings as at Exodus 19:4: &quot;You have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles&#39; wings, and brought you unto myself.&quot;</p>

<p>Casting of Lots</p>

<p>Among the Greeks Hermes was considered to be the inventor of casting lots as a method of divination, but Moses also instructed the Hebrews, at a very early date, in the use of lots to divine the will of God. The iconoclastic Moses taught that no images should be made and, accordingly, there is some evidence that Hermes too was at first an iconoclast.</p>

<p>The name of Hermes originated in the Greek word “herma” meaning a “stone heap” -- probably from the custom of erecting a “herm” consisting of an upright stone surrounded at its base by a heap of smaller stones. These unpretentious monuments were often used as landmarks for travelers or to mark territorial boundaries. A mythical origin for these stone heaps may also be understood for, to quote from the Etymologicum Magnum, “when Hermes killed Argos, he was brought to trial by the gods. They acquitted him, and in doing so each threw his voting-pebble at his feet. Thus a heap of stones grew up around him.” The point here being that the more recent images of Hermes result from apostasies of his earliest teachings, and that the original icon of Hermes, namely, the modest stone heap, was indeed one that would have been acceptable to even Israel himself. Notice Genesis 31:45-46: &quot;And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap.&quot;</p>

<p>Moses taught that one out of every seven days was to be revered as holy and called the Sabbath, while Hermes also took one day out of the seven, calling it Wednesday after his name.</p>

<p>I was not the first one to identify Moses with Hermes. In fact, this was noticed thousands of years ago -- at least as early as the second (some think that he could possibly have lived in the third) century BC -- by the Egyptian priest Artapanus who some think may have been Jewish. Eusebius (ix. 27) quoted from a lost book that was written by Artapanus and called Concerning the Jews that said of Moses “he was beloved by the Egyptians, who called him Hermes, (dia tên tôn‘ierôn gramattôn‘ermêneian).” The Greeks themselves seem to corroborate Artapanus by admitting that the Ibis headed Egyptian god Thoth was just another version of their god Hermes. The Greeks even tell a story of how Hermes had come up out of the land of Egypt where he once had lived disguised as an Ibis. Similar to the Hebrew Scriptures the followers of Moses, in the story told by Artapanus, were plagued by poisonous serpents. However, the Moses of Artapanus (instead of the copper serpent) employed the Ibis to attack the snakes. This was the reason, Artapanus says, for which Moses/Hermes revered the Ibis so.
If Hermes was Moses, as Artapanus states, and Moses was a younger contemporary of Inachus the father of Io, as cited by the ancient chronologists, then it is very conceivable that the Hermes in the story of Io’s wanderings is a mythic Greek version of Moses in the Hebrew story about the wandering Jews.</p>

<p>The earthly wife of god was in bondage, so god sent his serpent stick carrying messenger -- on eagle’s wings -- to lead her out of her captivity. The messenger of god smote the head of her captor and delivered the Earthly wife of god. Did he lead her directly home? No, this is when she went on her famous wanderings, known to the Greeks as the wanderings of Io. There was a mystifying cloud cover, a gadfly plague, and a miraculous water crossing. She gave birth to the &quot;Egyptian&quot; calf god, &quot;Epaphus&quot; (Apis). But, most telling of all, she approached the special mountain where the creator of mankind was bound, and talked to him. Prometheus told Io that she could expect the savior to be born to her, as one of her descendants, thirteen generations hence. After all this she finally returned to her homeland, Phoronea.</p>

<p>“Prometheus told Io that she could expect the savior to be born to her, as one of her descendants, thirteen generations hence.” This point, overlooked by many, is exceptionally strong evidence for equating the Greek and Hebrew traditions. A quote from Prometheus Bound (a play by Aeschylus, who wrote as early as 500 BC) runs thus: “PROMETHEUS: She (a future wife of Zeus) will bear to him a child, And he shall be in might more excellent Than his progenitor. IO: And he will find No way to fend off this strong stroke of fate? PROMETHEUS: None save my own self when these bonds are loosed. IO: And who shall loose them if Zeus wills not? PROMETHEUS: Of your own seed. IO: How says you? Shall a child of mine release thee? PROMETHEUS: Son of yours, but son the thirteenth generation shall beget. IO: A prophecy oracularly dark.” Is it not amazing how exactly -- down to the smallest details of theology -- that the Greek and Hebrew traditions match on this point? With the advent of this “savior” Prometheus would no longer be “bound” to the mountain.</p>

<p>How many stories do you know of where the creator of mankind will be released from his binding contract through the fulfillment of a prophecy predicting the future arrival of the son of god and the seed of a woman? (The story of Atlas is also remarkably similar but, as I hope the reader will come to realize, the two stories were intricately related.) The entire genealogy of the Greek savior -- all thirteen generations -- are known to this day as if it were the thirteen generations from Abraham to David!
Can any other &quot;myths&quot; claim to pay such attention to the details of lineage? </p>

And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.
And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.
Why can&#39;t you see the similarities? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>CAPITOL, n. 1. The temple of Jupiter in Rome, and a fort or castle, on the Mons Capitolinus. In this, the Senate of Rome anciently assembled; and on the same place, is still the city hall or town-house, where the conservators of the Romans hold their meetings. The same name was given to the principal temples of the Romans in their colonies.</p>

<p>The Roman Jupiter is the equivalent of the Greek Zeus.
 Traditionally the Temple was dedicated on September 13, the founding year of the Roman Republic, 509 BCE according to Livy.[12] According to Dionysius, it was consecrated two years later in 507 BCE. It was sacred to the Capitoline Triad consisting of Jupiter and his companion deities, Juno and Minerva.</p>

<p>Reigning atop The u.s. Capitol is the Goddess Columbia, outside a statue of MERCURY the messenger god. Once inside you find another giant statue of the Goddess Columbia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The owl is an occult symbol of discovery. Why?</p>

<p>Because it can find it&#39;s way in darkness. It&#39;s a natural metaphor for the process by which an unenlightened mind navigates through ignorance to attain knowledge/wisdom.</p>

<p>Same applies to bats. When I heard about this my first idea was that this was the reason why Batman (essentially a detective) used a bat for his symbol. Also, for those who know the Watchmen, ask yourself which one is the closest to Batman? Night Owl. Same deal... and not a coincidence. Watchmen writer Alan Moore knows a <em>lot</em> of esoteric stuff. </p>

<p>You guys can laugh at this if you like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>hmmm.</p>

<p>something just occured to me.</p>

<p>Both the bat and the owl can &#39;see&#39; in the dark.</p>

<p>Thing is, they use different ways to do so.</p>

<p>The owl uses his eyes.</p>

<p>The bat uses his ears.</p>

<p>I have no idea where im going with this. Like i say, it just occured to me.
But for some reason ,it seems like it could be a weird rabbit hole.</p>
