    <div class="md"><p>You are right you know who is most hurt by these regulations. ISP start ups. I&#39;m sure Comcast loves Net Neutrality. Although they would also love the ability to charge Netflicks or anyother online entity bandwith premiums. I think a deregulated internet is more of a threat to their overall market shares. Also they don&#39;t have to innovate now because they can say the meeting the demands for Net neutrality is a costly affair. They can guise themselves as being opposed. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>How many “ISP start ups” have there been? Essentially zero. The cost to build a network is prohibitive and the large ISPs have paid off politicians to make it difficult for one to start regardless. For example, they block municipal networks. </p>

<p>Also, net neutrality rules aren’t onerous to follow. They just say to treat traffic equally. That’s what the system does naturally. </p>

<p>There are no “innovations” being stifled by treating non critical all traffic equally. I know people who work in the industry, there simply aren’t any. Their “innovations” are wanting to charge people more to get more profits. We know it isn’t to improve their network because we’ve given them huge tax breaks to do so and they just passed the money to their executives and shareholders. </p>

<p>That doesn’t show it at all. The fact they’ve spent millions trying to buy the votes of Republicans to overturn it shows their opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Net neutrality is that all non-critical traffic (basically anything you do on your phone, at home, etc) is treated equally regardless of the site. So the speed for getting Netflix is the same for Hulu, the same for HBO Now, etc. </p>

<p>Without Net Neutrality an ISP could basically throttle Netflix because they own stake in Hulu or vice versa. Or it could prioritize Hulu over everything which means that any new streaming start up would essentially be dead before starting.</p>

<p>We’ve had net neutrality for decades. There’s a reason that the vast majority of people agree with it and want it. Because it makes sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Forget NN title 2, replace NN with title 2, find out the details on it, and it&#39;ll all make sense. Why did Congress roll back privacy protections from ISPs, what does this have to do with reddit? How does Reddit make money? Advertising, how does Reddit advertise? Not just in your face ads, and sponsored posts, and paid for upvotes, and Reddit gold, yes those are sources of revenue, but the biggest one is taking user data (subs you subscribe to, things you submit, your comment history, etc) packaging that and selling it for targeted ads. This is the same invasion of privacy ISPs have just been granted by Congress. In other words the ISPs are able to use the same advertisement methods as Reddit. This is competition, it will cut into your profits, so what do you do? Well you use your platform to try to social engineer a narrative that will give you support from your huge user base.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. NN speaks out against paid prioritisation. But the hypocrisy is reflected in that FB, google, reddit has an entire business model which exists on paid prioritisation of content. Search ads, newsfeed ads etc </p>

<p>The ranking of content has become pay to win essentially and selected content deemed to be unfavourable can also be filtered out - like RT et al. </p>

<p>Netflix also does a flip where they have different pricing tiers depending on how many screens you have. Yet their growing strain on ISP bandwidth should not incur additional costs becaause my data is all equal when it costs me something. This pro-NN campaign is literally a battle to preserve their profits, not some crusade for our freedom and rights for fair and neutral internet. </p>

<p>All data is equal, but some data is more equal than others, provided your adspend is sufficient. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anything, arguments AGAINST net neutrality are being censored.</p>

<p>Think about it, of course your big content providers like Google, Reddit, Netflix, etc are supporting net neutrality. Because without it, they have to pay their fair share.</p>

<p>I hate to use this analogy, because the original premise is bs, but it might help some people understand. The big companies supporting net neutrality are the 1% in the internet world. A limited number of content providers are responsible for a large majority bandwidth usage. Google (including YouTube) and Netflix account for somewhere around 50% of ALL internet traffic in the world. Do you think they pay 50% of all the ISP and hosting costs in the world? Of course not.</p>

<p>Big content providers like reddit have a sweet deal right now. They pay relatively little for the bandwidth they utilize to push ads to us that they get paid for while we get stuck footing the bill to the ISPs. Heck Reddit especially gets a great deal because all their users are the ones doing to work to aggregate the content. </p>

<p>We pay the cable companies for the privilege of &quot;working&quot; to create content for reddit while reddit sits back with low overhead costs and gets paid for ads they show us while we&#39;re working. Of course they don&#39;t want that money fountain to go away!</p>

<p>As with anything, follow the money. Supporters of it have potentially more to lose than opponents of it have to gain by it going away. </p>

<p>The answer to all this is to stop letting local governments make shady deals ISPs and cable companies to allow for actual competition. Just Google (or Bing, or whatever as its hard to trust Google these days) &quot;ISP franchise fees&quot;.</p>

<p>Net neutrality lets big content providers get away with not paying their &quot;fair share&quot;.</p>

<p>The reason ISP monopolies exist is due to government right-of-way control over the land where infrastructure needs to be installed. The answer to excess government power is not to give the government more power...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll paint you a picture of what will happen.</p>

<p>Say you have Comcast and some startup ISP in a particular area.  Realistically most areas have little to no choice, but lets just say that there is a choice in this particular area.  As it is, the startup ISP probably has tighter profit margins than Comcast, but is managing to get by.</p>

<p>Now in a world without net neutrality, Comcast goes to Netflix and says &quot;hey, we have a huge number of customers, and we&#39;re going to slow down your traffic unless you give us $1 per customer.&quot;  Lets say they do this across a dozen different major tech companies.  Boom, $12 savings passed along to the consumer, awesome right?</p>

<p>But now what about our little startup ISP?  They go to Netflix and friends the same way, demanding $1 per customer.  Do you know what they&#39;re going to get?  Most likely absolutely nothing.  Netflix isn&#39;t going to bother paying a small startup ISP anything for their customer base, because they know that that ISP needs Netflix more than Netflix needs them.</p>

<p>Now we&#39;re in a situation where Comcast is $12 per month than the startup ISP, while also maintaining stronger profit margins.  Maybe they even push that discount lower to really put the squeeze on the startup ISP.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few years and there isn&#39;t going to be a startup ISP anymore, they went out of business because they couldn&#39;t compete on price with Comcast anymore.  And low and behold, those savings that Comcast had previously passed along to consumers have disappeared, because why compete on price when you don&#39;t have competition?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow you&#39;re really buying in to the propaganda.</p>

<p>Tell me, with net neutrality laws in place, what person or business in their right mind would invest in new infrastructure to become a startup ISP when they don&#39;t have the freedom to decide how that infrastructure is used? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean there won&#39;t be startup ISPs regardless of net neutrality, there are deep reasons why the industry is the way it is, and net neutrality isn&#39;t going to move that needle at all in either direction.</p>

<p>Net neutrality is a necessary protection for consumers because of the lack of competition in the industry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What shift are you talking about?  Net neutrality has been how the internet has worked from the beginning.  Sure, Google and Netflix benefit from net neutrality, so does every small 3 person startup, so do individuals, non-profit groups, journalists, basically everyone other than ISPs.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason the ACLU and EFF are for net neutrality, and they&#39;re certainly not pro-Google.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are right you know who is most hurt by these regulations. ISP start ups. I&#39;m sure Comcast loves Net Neutrality. Although they would also love the ability to charge Netflicks or anyother online entity bandwith premiums. I think a deregulated internet is more of a threat to their overall market shares. Also they don&#39;t have to innovate now because they can say the meeting the demands for Net neutrality is a costly affair. They can guise themselves as being opposed. </p>

<p>Obama did meet with Comcast CEO before this was implemented. So it is clear they might have opposed initially but came to agree. </p>
