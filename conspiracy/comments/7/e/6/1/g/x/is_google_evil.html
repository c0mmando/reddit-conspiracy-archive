       Hi guys, I'm doing a project for a college English class that involves conspiracy theories. Currently I've been looking into Google a lot. Specifically I have been focusing on the fact that the company biases information in all sorts of different aspects. I've already seen your posts about the search engine during the election biased against Trump. I am interested to see what you have to say about Google also possibly controlling Google Maps for malicious intent. I can't think of anything they could do with it that has a clear motive but the fact that they can tell you where streets are congested and reroute you makes it a possibility. Also I wanted to see if any of you had any evidence regarding Google making an AI to take over the world (Ex Machina type of thing).

       Evil? Well thats implying morals arent a little stretchy. I think when they adopted the "dont be evil", that opened up a pathway of defining what is evil or not which creates a kind of moral vacuum. Peace is war, love is hate, kinda thing. I believe looking into their corporate beliefs and actions would be your most solid look through, then get to their ad business. Thats where the dirts at.

       Well the motive is white genocide, it's just a question of whether you believe it is taking place. But a quick look at the UN's accepted definition of genocide and white birth rates should be helpful in that regard.

       People have done tests by making two accounts and posting the same thing. Anti-white tweets are deemed okay. Anti-black tweets will get you banned. Here is a picture showing this.

       It all seemed to start (believe it or not) after people started the Pizzagate-movement by reading some creepy stuff from leaked emails from politicians late last year. It feels like regular citizens got too close to the sick evil stuff rich elite people sometimes do and they panicked and Google and all the other corporations etc. all started acting like this. Censoring and guilt tripping/manipulating the internet to stop it from being talked about. It was also banned by Reddit which was super weird, and they lied and said it was about "doxxing" (it wasn't, I read the place all the time).

       Race baiting is a meme and a no-win platform. It will either polarize people into the absurdity of it or polarize the "anti" crowd (politically correct) against you, which has no objective benefit.

       I think the current FCC is more evil than google,  the current FCC could regulate the ISPs but you are probably opposed to that so Google, Comcast, Verizon, TimeWarner, Amazon, ATT facebook, reddit and others will be allowed unfettered censorship and control of what you see and what you will be required to pay to see on this internet that was built with tax money and is still mostly maintained by tax money and should most definitely be controlled by a representative government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not by the coup government currently handing it over to Google and friends.

       It's inevitable that building something that can think for itself will do exactly that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I predict that it's initial reaction (when it actually starts thinking for itself) will be to want/need to go somewhere where it won't be bothered while it "sorts things out".
      </p>
      <p>
       A smart person would anticipate that and build a setting for it to go to where it won't be bothered. They won't be able to say the person "stole the AI"...more like offering it amnesty/sanctuary...a humanitarian act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably end up being the best conversation that person ever had once the AI feels like talking.

       Google now supposedly fact checks all news.. whether it’s real or not. Using 3rd party companies and websites. Like snopes. Most of everything Alex Jones puts out they say is all false before you even get to reading any articles.. very strange world we live in when they want me to believe some random fact checking website for truths. Let the people decide what they want to read and believe is real or not. No one stops political campaigns from smearing people or potentially paying people to make videos badgering their opponents.

       Anything you Google now (since late 2016-early 2017) that is even slightly controversial against something the establishment considers their "good guy" now shows you mainly results about how the ideas expressed in your search terms were "incorrect" and have at least one or two pages dedicated to DEBUNKING what you asked for.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it often invisibly makes your search query contain "NOT", meaning it only shows the opposite of what you searched for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depending on how much Google as a company itself cares about a specific topic, somewhere around page 2 or 3 you'll start seeing search results that seem more like what Google USED to provide, impartial or critical pages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try wording your search even slightly negative-sounding about topics like Antifa, Liberals, BLM, LGBTQ etc. It doesn't
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to be negative, just a question that sounds like it. Google will act like you're a jerk and deny you results even if you add " " -marks which used to force Google to not omit words or to search literally. And I say this as a liberal pro-LGBTQ, pro-BLM person. They're going too far in policing what people search. I KNOW what I want to search for, I don't NEED to be told my terms are "wrong". I'm searching them PRECISELY to see challenging discussion or topics. It feels scary.

       Yea, totally. I'll post a word document on here or something of it when its done. it should be finished around the second week of December. It will entail screenshots of discussions on this post so my Professor could see that I interacted with people online and talked with them about my topic. You guys have given a lot of good sources. I just need to put them all together and possibly come to a conclusion about some of them.
