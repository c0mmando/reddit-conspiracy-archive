        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hi guys, I&#39;m doing a project for a college English class that involves conspiracy theories. Currently I&#39;ve been looking into Google a lot. Specifically I have been focusing on the fact that the company biases information in all sorts of different aspects. I&#39;ve already seen your posts about the search engine during the election biased against Trump. I am interested to see what you have to say about Google also possibly controlling Google Maps for malicious intent. I can&#39;t think of anything they could do with it that has a clear motive but the fact that they can tell you where streets are congested and reroute you makes it a possibility. Also I wanted to see if any of you had any evidence regarding Google making an AI to take over the world (Ex Machina type of thing).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evil? Well thats implying morals arent a little stretchy. I think when they adopted the &quot;dont be evil&quot;, that opened up a pathway of defining what is evil or not which creates a kind of moral vacuum. Peace is war, love is hate, kinda thing. I believe looking into their corporate beliefs and actions would be your most solid look through, then get to their ad business. Thats where the dirts at.</p>

It feels like regular citizens got too close to the sick evil stuff rich elite people sometimes do and they panicked and Google and all the other corporations etc. all started acting like this. Censoring and guilt tripping/manipulating the internet to stop it from being talked about. It was also banned by Reddit which was super weird, and they lied and said it was about &quot;doxxing&quot; (it wasn&#39;t, I read the place all the time).</p>

<p>A smart person would anticipate that and build a setting for it to go to where it won&#39;t be bothered. They won&#39;t be able to say the person &quot;stole the AI&quot;...more like offering it amnesty/sanctuary...a humanitarian act.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anything you Google now (since late 2016-early 2017) that is even slightly controversial against something the establishment considers their &quot;good guy&quot; now shows you mainly results about how the ideas expressed in your search terms were &quot;incorrect&quot; and have at least one or two pages dedicated to DEBUNKING what you asked for.</p>

<p>And it often invisibly makes your search query contain &quot;NOT&quot;, meaning it only shows the opposite of what you searched for. </p>

<p>Depending on how much Google as a company itself cares about a specific topic, somewhere around page 2 or 3 you&#39;ll start seeing search results that seem more like what Google USED to provide, impartial or critical pages.</p>

<p>Try wording your search even slightly negative-sounding about topics like Antifa, Liberals, BLM, LGBTQ etc. It doesn&#39;t <em>have</em> to be negative, just a question that sounds like it. Google will act like you&#39;re a jerk and deny you results even if you add &quot; &quot; -marks which used to force Google to not omit words or to search literally. And I say this as a liberal pro-LGBTQ, pro-BLM person. They&#39;re going too far in policing what people search. I KNOW what I want to search for, I don&#39;t NEED to be told my terms are &quot;wrong&quot;. I&#39;m searching them PRECISELY to see challenging discussion or topics. It feels scary.</p>
