    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say he is not wrong on &quot;the Americans are stupid&quot; part. This is what you get when you let your primary education (elementary and high school) go to shit. Whether this was a part of some grand plan to dumb down population or not is besides the point. The fact is, this happened.</p>

<p>Wat now? Hand-holding the stupid is not doing them any favour. You may &quot;protect&quot; them from this &quot;threat&quot;, but guess what? They&#39;re stupid for life, which means that without powers of reasoning, something else will get them down the line. You can&#39;t protect them from everything, forever.</p>

<p>The true solution to this is to own up and admit that we created several generations of idiots. They&#39;re fucked for life, but at least we can save the future generations by teaching them to think critically.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. But the whole reason this ridiculous position has been allowed to survive this long is because we have idiot population who couldn&#39;t see through the bullshit and call the Russian interference theme for what it was -- a stupid attempt at a deflection.</p>

<p>If we had population that was a bit smarter (better educated), this would not have happened. That was my point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been going on for decades and decades, but now it turned into inverted totalitarianism on steroids.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Inverted totalitarianism reverses things. It is all politics all of the time but a politics largely untempered by the political. Party squabbles are occasionally on public display, and there is a frantic and continuous politics among factions of the party, interest groups, competing corporate powers, and rival media concerns. And there is, of course, the culminating moment of national elections when the attention of the nation is required to make a choice of personalities rather than a choice between alternatives. What is absent is the political, the commitment to finding where the common good lies amidst the welter of well-financed, highly organized, single-minded interests rabidly seeking governmental favors and overwhelming the practices of representative government and public administration by a sea of cash.</p>
