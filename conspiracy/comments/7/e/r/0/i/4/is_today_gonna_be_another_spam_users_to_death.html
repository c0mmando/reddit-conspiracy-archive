<p>It&#39;s funny, I knew this would happen and I considered tiptoeing around it to try to get a straight answer, but I figured it would be interesting to see if you did indeed latch onto the one easy target and dismiss everything else I wrote. I wonder if you&#39;ll actually say something of substance this time, or continue the fruitless bickering?</p>

<p>I&#39;d be happy to have a real discussion about anything regarding net neutrality, if you&#39;d like. What&#39;s your issue with it, since you seem to be saying it isn&#39;t related to Obama?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you just ignore the fact that Net Neutrality is good simply because it was passed during the Obama administration.</p>

<p>By repealing Net Neutrality, you empower ISPs to directly regulate what you can see on the internet.</p>

<p>Anyone who is pro free speech or thinks corporations are already stifling their right to free speech should be pro net neutrality.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand how a conspiracy subreddit their values scepticism and free speech can have members that actively want to limit those values, which repealing Net Neutrality can and will do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My biggest concern with net neutrality is censorship. It&#39;s pretty apparent that mainstream media sources don&#39;t come out against things like gutting net neutrality because the corporate interests who own them stand to profit. There have been a lot of decent independent news outlets, or smaller outlets pop up due to the fair really of some of the bigger guys lately. A good example is the DAPL protests. There was pretty much a media blackout outside of Democracy Now and some of these other publications. Now these ISP&#39;s can potentially just throttle any inconvenient sources that might adversely affect their bottom-line in the long run. Obviously I&#39;m concerned about the ten new fees Comcast will probably create to allow me to watch Netflix or play my PlayStation online as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. Congress could pass a bill protecting net neutrality if they wanted to though. They won&#39;t obviously, but they could. This proposal also prohibits states from making net neutrality legislation. Funny coming from the party of small government and &quot;states rights&quot;</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, this doesn&#39;t seem to be a bad thing. The INTERNET worked well before Title two was implemented.  I will keep reading. That 400 page document, I scanned it earlier. Not sure if I will take the time to read all 400 pages. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, we are already seeing heavy censorship of anything to the left or right of center in things like the demonetization of YouTube channels. If you look at what they are already doing and want them to have more power that is insane. I voted Obama once, and found him to be a shit president. I don&#39;t, however, understand this tribalism and people who want to just dismantle anything he had a hand in. It&#39;s infuriating to me because it&#39;s only things that don&#39;t matter too. Trump overturns Obama&#39;s ban that blocked police from receiving bayonets. When the fuck are they going to need those? Maybe get rid of the part where Obama took away Habeus Corpus for US citizens? Nope, Republicans would rather talk about potentially using that to send the NYC terror suspect to Guantanamo without charge. It&#39;s madness.</p>
