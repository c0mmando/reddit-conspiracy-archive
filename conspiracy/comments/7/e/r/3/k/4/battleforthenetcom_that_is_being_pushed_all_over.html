       FYI.  if you scroll to the very bottom of battle for nets website, it says built by "fight for the future." Once you go over to fightforthefuture.org you can see their financial supporters and one of them is the Open Society Foundation along with other democratic donors.

       Thanks, very interesting.

       I just had the thought that Soros does not really have a political agenda on his own, but is just the TPTB specialist for protests. The money he makes by betting against countries or corporations before a set-up protest might just be a by-product for him.

       That is an interesting thought.  Basically giving him less of a cynical reasoning he does what he does.

       In this case, I have no idea what's at play ..I just thought it interesting that this site pushed all over the place is Soro's funded.

       The idea that Soros does not have a political agenda is ludicrous. He's a brilliant economist (not saying all his theories are correct, however he has some groundbreaking views) and he translates his views into his agenda. It has falsely been presented often as liberalism, which I would actually argue against. He sure has what many here would call "a globalist agenda", but then again, from his economic views it makes sense. In my opinion he overestimates the value of revolutions, and he seems to fund a lot of them around the world. But then again I am more of a pacifist liberal so that might be the difference.

       Agreed. I was all for NN based on the arguments I've read--they seemed fact-based and reasonable--but now that I see that someone I usually disagree with supports it, I've changed my mind.

       They've done it before though. AT&amp;T tried blocking skype once, Verizon blocked 4chan for a couple days, etc. And pretty much the only people that would care about this shit are reddit neckbeards because normal people use the internet for work and social media, not for niche sites and games that will probably get throttled or blocked.

       I know people here see Soros as the embodiment of evil, and I don't really think that's completely fair. He is a corporate lobbyist, trying to push an agenda. However does the fact that he has an agenda mean that he's wrong on every single point? I feel like simply naming his name is enough to make people do a 180 switch on their stances, while I would rather discuss on merit as opposed to names.

       I can tell you why. George Soros is in many ways and for many reasons against market fundamentalism. He sees internet as a human right and tries to keep it as accessable as he possibly can. He does the same in third-world countries.

       If you look at his 20/20 interview, he doesnt really seem like a man who is largely for human rights. He makes it very clear his goal is to make money. When you say that he sees the internet as a human right, how do you know that? What do you think his intent is? I think he makes his money through protests, movements, and organizations that "stir the pot." I don't think George Soros cares about human rights,I think he's only supporting tbis organization to profit.

       Ya, I don't think I can make any sense of this comment. You say Soros is more conservative than the Koch's? There is a huge difference between the Kochs and Soros. Koch bros are doing everything they can with their money to increase their own wealth, I don't believe they have any other motive than that (not being judgemental, if the option exists, why not use it?) Soros is way stranger to pinpoint, as he is not always into politics out of financial stimuli, but many a times because he actually tries to improve the world (not judging, we can argue on whether he actually does if you want to). I have no idea what to make of your comparison between russians and jews, but feel free to explain.

       I think he means that Soros is the conservatives' billionaire lobbyist boogeyman, the same way that the Koch brothers are to liberals.  Similar to how (in the above poster's view, at least) liberals blame everything on the russians, and conservatives blame everything on the jews.

       The difference is that Soros is literally going against his own personal interests on many dossiers and is pretty unpredictable, whereas the Koch brothers are unbelievably predictable. Whatever nets them more money is what they support.

       This doesn't really mean much tbh. If anything it's always possible he funded it on purpose to partially sabotage it. Think about it; conservative news networks loathe George Soros and name drop him constantly to try and disavow anything they don't like. Big networks like Fox News and Breitbart could get ahold of this and start spewing lies about it being a lie so that they can support their donors by helping net neutrality get revoked.

       I really just saw the website all over the front page and was curious who was funding it.  Similar to how we need to know who's lobbying against Net Neutrality, I wanted to know who is lobbying for it.  It's raises questions in my mind is all and I thought I would share.

       The Koch's teaparty supports shutting us off the internet and  is pushing for Comcast, does that mean you are opposed to net neutrality and on the side of the corporate lords?

       No, I think you originally brought the Koch's into this as if they are the mech champion for conservatives since OP described Soros as the Dems head mech. Now we are just arguing fighting robot dick sizes so we have a good excuse to hate each other. It's like sports, but even more ignorant.

       I think if no country had banker wars, corruption, corporate exploitation (globalism, slave wages, etc.)
and had adequate legit social programs (no corporate interference like crony capitalist Obamacare has) then no one would care to immigrate.

       Exactly. Different people can support the same thing for different reasons. Simply saying, "This person supports it for X reason, thus you supporting it for Y reason are wrong." is pure ad hominem.

       The entire reason I believe soros, google, and facebook support net neutrality is because it allows them to collect unlimited data from their users. Once you have to pay to use facebook and google, a lot of people will not be able to afford social media and the social giants lose all their data that they use for nefarious reasons.

       OP did not say net neutrality, this is about why a soros funded website is being up voted tens of thousands of times across several hundred subreddits. You can support NN without backing the soros website.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real question is why a George Soros operated website has such popularity on Reddit.

       The question is not whether NN makes sense (it obviously does), but what would Soros backed legislation on the topic look like. That's where the conspiracy is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump instituting net neutrality would actually pre-empt and somewhat firewall against the eventual passing of it by others, who will no doubt structure the statutes in ways to subtly and completely reverse the entire purpose of it. I honestly don't trust Trump, except insofar as he is the enemy of my enemy, so I don't expect him to do this unless he sees some kind of advantage for his image from it (he should, this would be like a Teddy Roosevelt move that would endear him to many in the millenial and younger category).

       I'm sure he does in a general sense but the money is given to s foundation. They have a board that decides where that money goes and it may end up at another foundation where the same thing happens again. It's not like he's signing checks and approving everything.

       Under the current rules there is a vague "general conduct" rule which gives the FCC the right to censor anything they deem to be "harmful" (no definition for what is harmful). So basically the current rules are exactly why Soros cares so deeply about it: they give the FCC the final say in everything online.

       The vote this week is not about NN though.  The vote is for a repeal to classifying ISPs as public utilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The result of this is that more government approval will be necessary every time new fiber is laid.  For big companies (Comcast, for example), this hurdle actually helps them, because they'll probably have an entire office staffed with multiple full-time people just for dealing with the extra red tape.  Their smaller rivals will not be as well suited for dealing with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Title 2 of the Communications Act of 1934 also allows public utilities to have a pass on selling customer data.  Public utilities (and currently ISPs) are allowed to do anything they want with your data.  By removing ISPs status as public utilities, they will no longer be able to sell customer data any time they want.

       You’re being downvoted, but you are correct. It’s the monopolies that fuel the cries for Net Neutrality. If Comcast is the only ISP allowed in your town (because your municipality said they could), then if NN continues, it won’t matter. They can jack up prices for any reason, and you’ll be screwed until you move.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if monopolies break up, it opens the door for more competition, lower prices, and better options.

       The entire reason I believe soros, google, and facebook support net neutrality is because it allows them to collect unlimited data from their users. Once you have to pay to use facebook and google, a lot of people will not be able to afford social media and the social giants lose all their data that they use for nefarious reasons.

       They will collect data either way. Don't use those sites if you're scared they're collecting data on you. But don't give up on net neutrality because of those sites and their shady ways, the internet is much bigger than them.

       You think that when the ISPs start raping the internet that the big social media companies are going to STOP collecting info to advertise with? It would RAMP UP to recoup losses.

       I'm saying when people have to specifically start paying money for social media packages the user base will shrink, and the advertisers will pay less money because their advertisements are reaching less people. Also, less user base means less profiles for government agencies. Facebook is free because your the product, but once you have to pay to be the product no one will use it.

       Holy shit this is a well constructed nonsense argument. It almost sounds real, it really does. I bet it convinced a lot of people who can't think for themselves and just want to doubt everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       At its core, it makes absolutely no sense at all, but goddamn if it doesn't try it's hardest to almost make sense. Just enough to hit the emotional hard points that can make some people shut off their brains and believe nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would almost admire it, if it were not so despicable and greedy. I fear the future you are trying to push for. If you really understand and believe what you are preaching here, you scare me. You scare me at what you might convince people to give up out of ignorance and ego. I hope you are not an American.

       I think you are greatly overestimating how much this would hurt their user base.  Worst case scenario Google/Facebook/whoever make a deal with ISPs so that users will never see a 5.99 price tag to access google sites or facebook.  Data collection will continue unabated.

       Boogeyman isn't real.  Its like MSM pushing KKK or other dead organizations that are basically CIA or FBI fronts.  Soros can be traced and seen.  Countries have declared him a terrorist.  It is fact he tried to short the british sterling and destroy the country.   You can find his financials and posting ridiculous, obvious insider trading based gains in excess of 50% for a decade straight breaking out under Rothschild money with multiple Rothschilds on his board.   It is fact he and his organizations have pushed diversity, refugees, immigration and billions funneled into paid protests and organizations like BLM and Antifa.  Both fall off a cliff the minute he announces funding is pulled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying he's a boogeyman is bullshit.  He's the face and target for any backlash for Zionists and a very real and tangible global terrorist.

       I sympathize with the top-level desires of libertarians, freedom and liberty, it's just that I think they have blinders on their eyes as to the full range of actors (not just the State) capable of restricting it.

       The reasonable part is the ok social policies, (generally anti war and stuff)
but the economic ones are messed up.

       I think when a lot of Americans say libertarian,
they mean extreme right libertarians like
Ron Paul, Gary Johnson (pro-TPP Koch bros shill)
France's Rothschild banker Macron, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on the political spectrum,
the social axis goes from authoritarian to libertarian.
So there can be left/right libertarians of moderate and extreme degrees.
E.g. libertarian socialists (democratic socialists, anarchists, anarcho-syndicalists,
and other non authoritarian socialists)
and moderate right to centrist libertarians.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe extreme right (NEOliberal to full retard free market/no regulations extreme right libertarianism)
economics and extreme authoritarianism both lead to the NWO.

Once or twice, but the amount of bullshit on this sub and the people thinking everybody is out to get them, whether the thing they're against would actually hurt them or help them - as in the NN case, it would be the latter - is an insult to my intelligence. So I tend to stay away from the lunatics, for my own mental health.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why am I here now, posting on this sub? It's because I feel I have a duty to inform the deluded people when they're so obviously wrong or undergoing some kind of psychological disorder, which I'd say 90% of the "regulars" here are.
      </p>
      <p>
       And nope, I'm not a "shill" before you accuse me of that, because shills get told what to say and post, which is against my personal beliefs to willingly oblige. I'd rather do and say things because of my own mind having me do/say them, rather than be told what to do/say. Plus, shills get paid money to comment online, which I most assuredly do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I do find it odd that this sub blocks people from posting for up to 10 minutes sometimes. Hilarious how the sub claiming to be full of shills fighting against their "reality" and "we can't give in to what we think are lies purported by big business and government to stop us from having a voice" is the one sub that stops people from having a voice. As though perhaps the "you are doing that too much, try again in x minutes" thing that comes up to block people from commenting is designed to have the more sane people stay away from this sub, because it won't let them try to help those who are very obviously not well, psychologically.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would u/illuminatedwax care to comment and explain this policy of denying free speech in such a way?

       There actually have been moments in the past in which ISPs got cute with their service, I think it was Comcast. I'll look it up tomorrow, but if you want to find it I think John Oliver mentioned some examples when he covered the topic, so it's on YouTube. In any case examples exist and can be found. If I don't deliver feel free to remind me.

       2005 - Madison River Communications was blocking VOIP services. The FCC put a stop to it.

       2005 - Comcast was denying access to p2p services without notifying customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       2007-2009 - AT&amp;amp;T was having Skype and other VOIPs blocked because they didn't like there was competition for their cellphones.
      </p>
      <p>
       2011 - MetroPCS tried to block all streaming except youtube. (edit: they actually sued the FCC over this)
      </p>
      <p>
       2011-2013, AT&amp;amp;T, Sprint, and Verizon were blocking access to Google Wallet because it competed with their bullshit. edit: this one happened literally months after the trio were busted collaborating with Google to block apps from the android marketplace
      </p>
      <p>
       2012, Verizon was demanding google block tethering apps on android because it let owners avoid their $20 tethering fee. This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn't do that as part of a winning bid on an airwaves auction. (edit: they were fined $1.25million over this)
      </p>
      <p>
       2012, AT&amp;amp;T - tried to block access to FaceTime unless customers paid more money.
      </p>
      <p>
       2013, Verizon literally stated that the only thing stopping them from favoring some content providers over other providers were the net neutrality rules in place.

       I am sure there is a beneficial reason why Soros would defend NN and I am sure we will find out later and regret it. Soros has proven to be deceptive and care less for the little guy.

       All the more reason not to buy into the hype. There’s more here and what’s happening on Reddit right now gives me a high level of certainty that this is not an organic show we’re seeing and it’s more a political battle being fought by huge corporations.

       if you go to the BattleForTheNet website (sponsored by Open Society, etc.) it says they're fighting for FREE SPEECH. that is such obvious bullshit. the whole goddamn thing stinks to high heaven. and come on, the pro-NN shit flooding all was not some organic thing; it was fucking paid for.

       it just kills me that 90% of reddit is whipped into a frenzy over something
       <em>
        they don't know anything about

       so-called Net Neutrality gets people fucking hysterical.

       Doesn't bother me that its fucked by anyone, but the obvious agenda is there. Texting "Resist" is a way they found to get people to unknowingly support the democrats agenda as they have been using that as an anti-trump slogan. Thats a bit annoying. Seems like a subtle way to get people on their side unknowingly. I hate politics, this would've been something we had to fight against no matter who won but each side will continue pretending like they are against it

       The fight to save NN has always felt a little off to me, I don't want a closed off internet, but I don't actually know that that is what is happening here. Having not read the laws myself, I can't just go off memes and FB posts, those are controlled education.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never thought I'd side with FCC on this one, and still don't, but I am starting to consider that this, like every other fucking thing that shows up online, is just more BS being thrown at me. Time to go look at the details myself.

       Young voters care more about NN than older voters, and young voters tend to be a Democratic power base more than a Republican one. Therefore, Democrats are historically more likely to vote to protect NN and Obama's FCC was more protective of it than Trump's. Democrats want young people getting politically motivated about NN, because some of those people will stay politically motivated about other things they care about, and become reliable voters, activists, and small-money donors for their own pet causes, which nets out to a gain for the blue team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Net Neutrality shouldn't be a partisan issue, but it kind of became one naturally because everything eventually does. The solution is NN to become so popular than politicians wouldn't dare cut it, even Republicans. And that means activism.

       I don't know much about net neutrality but in my country we've never had it and it's been a good thing for consumers and smaller companies because of the growth in competition and innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we do have very strong consumer protection laws that cover both individuals and businesses. From what I can gather through experience is the US seems to have weak consumer protection laws and is I think is the main reason why companies like Google are able to get away with tweaking algorithms to suit themselves. Those kinds of anti competitive practices would be against the law here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other difference is that we only have one infrastructure network for our telecommunications which is free and open for anyone to set up their own service provider company and offer different products. This means the competition lies with different telecommunications and internet products rather than access to the network.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think if the US dumps Net Neutrality it probably needs to strengthen consumer protection laws so individuals and smaller companies access are protected.

       I think it is something he would have no concept of how it affects people.  He's got enough money that they could charge 1k a month for internet access and it wouldn't make him flinch.  Plus he is old, and most old people don't have a very clear grasp on how the internet operates.
