       Before blindly siding with George Soros INC on NN, I suggest you research the other side of the issue.

       We know how much our government likes to pass acts like "the patriot act" which ends up being the exact opposite of what the title would imply.  So why do you think net neutrality is going to be any different?

       Have you not been watching? Soros is one of the hated good guys whether you like it or not. Our government (here in America) are against Soros for a reason.

       Soros literally funds everything that our neocon government doesn't want to happen. There is a reason for this. There is a new gang in town and they are a necessary evil for without them, our government will devour us. I suppose people will understand this when it all starts to happen.

       I know, because life is about perspective, it will never make sense to your eyes. For the LORD has put a difference and everyone has their lots.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are not suppose to see the same outcome because there is a spiritual barrier that denies us the privilege. I know why Soros is hated by this community and much of the conspiracy realm. It's pretty damn obvious but I still like to put it out there for the people who see things from the other side.

       Is it even possible right now to read all the NN documentation? I just saw a comment that made me think we don't have access to the actual wording, just the requests for public comment on the interpreted goals of NN. The comment was basically calling this a Pelosi, where we have to pass it to see what's in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has the entire doc describing NN been released yet? And if so, where is it at please?

       We the people have researched it. We don't like it for many reasons including the fact that consolidated companies will cheat to push their own integrated services ahead of everyone else's, the fact that ISPs will charge content providers opening a whole new source of income to replace actually building more bandwidth, and the fact that we like independent conspiracy sites which will be the last ones capable of paying the content provider fees especially since they were all thrown off Google AdSense.

       The increase of rates in insurance slowed after the PPACA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you can thank Republican Marco Rubio for taking away some of the funding in a must pass budget bill in 2015. At the time, he boasted that higher rates would hit just before the 2016 election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, Republican Donald Trump is deliberately "collapsing" the program without providing his "terrific" health plan that was going to cover everyone for less.

       You are not going to get a reaction from this guy, as he is a T_D guy, that comes here every now and then to push shit from that subreddit. However I can probably tell you what he hates about it. He feels like conservatives are being censored because of NN, and he believes that freeing up the market will increase competition to Comcast. I cannot tell you how he thinks that scrapping NN will lead to less censoring or how prizes for internet will go up rapidly, because every single statistic ever points against either of these points.

       Do you call anyone who disagrees with you antifa? Because I don't actually think antifa has a position on this matter to be completely honest. Their name kind of gives away their political position. They are anti-fascist, no more and no less.

       Yes just like it's perfectly normal to "ignore the message" from Nazis, it's similarly normal to ignore the message from antifa.   What you have is the Gestapo versus the Gulag, both are stupid ways to treat people and both can be ignored.

       I would actually rather call it the blindspot of liberatians. The ever continuing problem with monopolies. The idea that removing government regulations always creates more competition has been proven false so many times, and the answer to this problem has still not been found by libertarians.

       without regulations on the free market, the world would still be stuck in the gilded age, where corporations treated their workers little better than slaves, the environment was being raped and destroyed with reckless abandonment, and consumers had no protection against scams, fraud, or faulty products.

       i think you are the one that needs to do your research. organized labor, aka unions, led the fight against all those practices.
      </p>
      <p>
       but the corps would literally just hire mercenaries to be "union busters" to straight up attack, intimidate, and even kill labor activists.
      </p>
      <p>
       government protections were key to giving those unions the upper hand in that fight, and in lobbying the government for laws that would protect them.

       In a free system, if two companies collude to set prices higher or service levels lower, they leave themselves wide open to some new competitor offering lower prices or better service. Only when governments
       <em>
        prevent
       </em>
       competition (directly, like with ISP regional monopoly grants, or indirectly by subsidies, tarriffs, regulations, and other means) is that kind of collusion possible.

       Until 5G gigabit wireless becomes standard there is no way for anyone new to enter the market. They can't just lay fiber wherever they want.  Even with wireless tech there is limited bandwidth that must be purchased from the govt.

      <p>
       Free market infrastructure is impossible and to pretend it can be on principle is just ignoring reality.

       “For almost twenty years, the Internet thrived under the light-touch regulatory approach established by President Clinton and a Republican Congress. This bipartisan framework led the private sector to invest $1.5 trillion building communications networks throughout the United States. And it gave us an Internet economy that became the envy of the world."
      </p>
      <p>
       “But in 2015, the prior FCC bowed to pressure from President Obama. On a party-line vote, it imposed heavy-handed, utility-style regulations upon the Internet. That decision was a mistake. It’s depressed investment in building and expanding broadband networks and deterred innovation."
      </p>
      <p>
       “Today, I have shared with my colleagues a draft order that would abandon this failed approach and return to the longstanding consensus that served consumers well for decades. Under my proposal, the federal government will stop micromanaging the Internet. Instead, the FCC would simply require Internet service providers to be transparent about their practices so that consumers can buy the service plan that’s best for them and entrepreneurs and other small businesses can have the technical information they need to innovate."
      </p>
      <p>
       “Additionally, as a result of my proposal, the Federal Trade Commission will once again be able to police ISPs, protect consumers, and promote competition, just as it did before 2015. Notably, my proposal will put the federal government’s most experienced privacy cop, the FTC, back on the beat to protect consumers’ online privacy."
