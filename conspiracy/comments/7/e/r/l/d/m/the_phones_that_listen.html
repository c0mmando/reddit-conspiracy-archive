       Lately this page has had a larger amount of posts about phones and computers showing advertisements for things they've only spoken about around them. We already know Google uses your searches to fine tune the ads you see, sometimes startlingly accurately, but if they're listening... its a different story. Can anyone share their stories with  this? I'm going to compile all the evidence, maybe run a few tests too. 
EDIT: Do we think this is done by people? Or is there an Advanced AI running keyword searches.

       I've recently started purchasing Perrier water because it was on sale. So when I would drink it I had a couple people comment about the water I was drinking and I would tell them it was Perrier. A couple days later I started getting Perrier advertisements on my Facebook.

       Definitely only voice? You didnt perhaps send someone a message saying the waters name?
Im not past the idea that they also read everything you type, but I'm certain they listen too.

       I've only talked about it. I've never looked up their website, I've never texted about what water I was drinking. This was all face to face conversations. It could just be chance that they paid for more advertising on Facebook after I started buying it, but I know for sure this was just mentioned to people that noticed the bottle and asked me where I got it.

       God damn... thanks for sharing! My advice to you mate is to run a lil test, talk about a random specific brand. A lot. Out loud to yourself or others and keep  an eye out. Im gonna try it on a new phone WITHOUT linking it to Google through gmail or whatever, see if that changes anything

       I'm not sure if typing  a name will ruin this, but perhaps choose a random irish based airline company. Something you'd never have to search for really. Especially if youre not in Ireland.

       It just more data collection.  If for some reason they needed to track your patterns and whereabouts.....they have it.

       Most people don't have to worry about this.  However, for me it's just the fact they are doing it that bothers me.

       This happens to me on a regular basis. I'll be talking about something to someone and the next day it shows up under the 'Explore' feed of instagram or I get an ad in my home feed.
      </p>

       It could be as simple as a show I was interested in watching but never looked up online and someone's random post about that show will pop up.

       Jesus.. its pretty widespread. My worst experience was when (long before the move) i got an ad for audible for stephan kings it with THE EXACT cover i had. It wasnt the original or anything, it was some weird reprint.  I never spoke of it once. Very concerning, unless.. someone was watching through the phone camera and saw it. Hm.

       Id recommend going to somewhere with free wifi so you're isolated from your ISP and phone internet network. Then have a fake conversation about a purchase or a trip that you would never follow through on. Like buying a new water heater for the house youre (not) thinking about buying. Helps if you're somewhat knowledgeable and can mention specific brands and retailers.

       Was randomly talking about life jacket/swimming aids for dogs once, not even half an hour later an ad popped up in their Facebook feed with a dog swimming about in a pool with a life jacket on!

       It doesn't seem to happen on my phone, not sure if it's because of playing about with permissions or that I don't bother updating apps.

       Back in the day i had zonealarm firewall that basically would show if any traffic was going in or out and you could block any instances.  Isnt their something like that for phones?? Specifically a traffic cop for all data in or out.

       Surely though it'd be better hidden? They could transfer it with the regular data in micro amounts and compile it slowly, which explains why every story is "a few hours later _____"
Or Google could pay them off. Im not paranoid I swear. I just don't see something so very suspicious going unreported if the answer was that simple.

       I was talking with a friend in his backyard while we were listening to pandora, I forget what the topic was specifically, but within minutes an ad played specifically about the topic we were speaking about. After that, I placed my phone on the wireless speaker we were using to broadcast, and then placed it at maximum range from us. They're always listening.

       I've only talked about it. I've never looked up their website, I've never texted about what water I was drinking. This was all face to face conversations. It could just be chance that they paid for more advertising on Facebook after I started buying it, but I know for sure this was just mentioned to people that noticed the bottle and asked me where I got it.

       I've never found the idea of them knowing where I was too troubling. Its.... odd sure. But what could they do with that information?
