We already know Google uses your searches to fine tune the ads you see, sometimes startlingly accurately, but if they&#39;re listening... its a different story. Can anyone share their stories with  this? I&#39;m going to compile all the evidence, maybe run a few tests too. 
EDIT: Do we think this is done by people? Or is there an Advanced AI running keyword searches. </p>

Im gonna try it on a new phone WITHOUT linking it to Google through gmail or whatever, see if that changes anything</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Id recommend going to somewhere with free wifi so you&#39;re isolated from your ISP and phone internet network. Then have a fake conversation about a purchase or a trip that you would never follow through on. Like buying a new water heater for the house youre (not) thinking about buying. Helps if you&#39;re somewhat knowledgeable and can mention specific brands and retailers. </p>
