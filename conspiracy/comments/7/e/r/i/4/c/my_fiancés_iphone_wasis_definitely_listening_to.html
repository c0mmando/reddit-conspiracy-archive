        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have an Android and Reddit is basically the only social media that I ever use. She has an iPhone, I have no idea which model, and uses Twitter, Facebook and Pintrest and probably a few other things as well. Nothing out of the norm. We were talking last night about our upcoming wedding. She starts talking about the colors that she wants to use. She suggested that I wear a gray suit with a blue vest and a pink tie. She goes to look at her phone and what&#39;s the first thing on her Pintrest? Pictures of gray suits, blue vests and pink ties. She says &quot;That&#39;s so weird. We were just talking about that!&quot; I askd if she&#39;s fucking with me because she knows I get paranoid about this shit. She swears up and down she&#39;s not and she never added this stuff to her Pintrest. I believe her. I&#39;ve known her long enough to know that if she was in fact playing a prank on me, which is already out of the norm for her, she would have admitted to it if I asked.</p>

<p>The only conclusion I can come to is that the phone is definitely listening to our conversations when its turned on. Whether or not there is some nefarious plot going on I&#39;m in no position to say. But it&#39;s listening in some way for some reason for some goal.</p>

<p>I have been coming to this sub for several years and this is the first time I&#39;ve felt inclined to share an experience with you. Again, I don&#39;t want to get into the whos and whys of it all because I don&#39;t know. I just know that it happened and it feels really, really strange.</p>

I&#39;ve sung songs before and then turned on the radio and that song was playing at that exact moment. Doesn&#39;t mean that the radio is reading my mind. </p>

Maternity scares me ,I never searched for kids stuff or had any publicity about such things. Two months ago I adopted a small dog and she&#39;s so small we are always saying - she&#39;s such a baby,tiny baby... Guess what?About a month later I started getting ads for baby lotions , diapers and baby promotion ads from local supermarkets.For instance, in Daily Mail (don&#39;t judge please) I used to get local UK market deals like Asda and Tesco (I&#39;m in Portugal). I think they have code word triggers and baby is of course one of them . Funny thing is I hate salad so I started saying the word a lot hoping that ads would come and prove me right,well , baby did it too. </p>

<p>Maybe try to switch to Android (with a custom ROM such as LineageOS) , use as much open source apps as you can and give permissions to app only that you need.</p>

<p>Maybe you could also wait for this phone the Librem 5 puri.sm that releases in 2019</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont see how anyone could be so sure about something that they didnt even experience first hand. If someone you trusted a lot who has never lied to you just said they saw big foot, would you believe them so strongly? This is one single example, which could be explained in countless ways. Coincidences happen all the time, and I’m sure shes been searching for wedding related stuff on her phone a lot. The odds that an ad with that exact combination of colors would pop up is rare, but coincidences are bound to happen given the massive amount of ads we see all the time. There is a quote that goes something to the effect of “the only truly unusual day, would be a day where nothing unusual happens.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no doubt they are listening. I had the most specific fucking add appear on my fb feed it was ridiculous. I sleep hot and and a while ago there were 2 nights it was just too warm so I slept on the couch. Talked with my gf about how our mattress was too warm after the second night. Next day, an advertisement for some &quot;cool matress&quot; popped up with a slogan like &quot;too warm at night?&quot;. Never searched for any such thing. Period. Not on my phone. Not on my computer. Fuck.</p>

<p>I was watching a show on my iPad and my phone was next to it. I went to go to Safari to go to a website (Kohls.com) and in the suggestion bar the topic the couple was discussing showed up to search on. Talk about freaky! </p>
