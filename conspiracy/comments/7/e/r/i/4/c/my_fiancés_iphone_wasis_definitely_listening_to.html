       I have an Android and Reddit is basically the only social media that I ever use. She has an iPhone, I have no idea which model, and uses Twitter, Facebook and Pintrest and probably a few other things as well. Nothing out of the norm. We were talking last night about our upcoming wedding. She starts talking about the colors that she wants to use. She suggested that I wear a gray suit with a blue vest and a pink tie. She goes to look at her phone and what's the first thing on her Pintrest? Pictures of gray suits, blue vests and pink ties. She says "That's so weird. We were just talking about that!" I askd if she's fucking with me because she knows I get paranoid about this shit. She swears up and down she's not and she never added this stuff to her Pintrest. I believe her. I've known her long enough to know that if she was in fact playing a prank on me, which is already out of the norm for her, she would have admitted to it if I asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only conclusion I can come to is that the phone is definitely listening to our conversations when its turned on. Whether or not there is some nefarious plot going on I'm in no position to say. But it's listening in some way for some reason for some goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been coming to this sub for several years and this is the first time I've felt inclined to share an experience with you. Again, I don't want to get into the whos and whys of it all because I don't know. I just know that it happened and it feels really, really strange.

       i got this same feeling when i was once singing a song to myself , turned on my pandora and it was the first song it played. a pretty obscure song at that.

       ive determined that yes, this is definately happining to target advertise to us. for now anyway.

       I'm on the fence about it. I mean, I'm not in favor of it at all. I think it's utter bullshit. But if it is just advertising, I can deal with that. It's easy enough to shut out all the "buy this, buy that" bullshit in our society. I just hope there isn't something more going on.

       Funny thing about Pinterest, their content ranks huge for SEO on Google. I tell clients looking to increase search ranking that Google loves Pinterest because it ranks so we'll against huge competition. No surprise at all they're so quick offer recommendations and related content.

       Coincidence. And not even a really unusual one if you think about it. If you're singing a song it's probably one that you've listened to a few times recently. I've sung songs before and then turned on the radio and that song was playing at that exact moment. Doesn't mean that the radio is reading my mind.

       Yea this goes for any google connected ad sense. Also it isn't just what you say it is what you think. we are talking about waves of electricity. to freely be intercepted by anything capable of it doing so. Point is you want something, and the system gives you a way to buy it.

       That suit, tie and vest combo is popular and if she's using multiple social media platforms it's likely she's come across it before and done something to indicate her interest. If she was talking about you wearing a 70s leisure suit or something out of the ordinary that might be more convincing. You should test that out.

       I was talking to my best friend about how my grandmother used to wear wigs when she would get dressed up and later that day my FB feed was FULL of ads for wigs. It's happening.

       that's what i thought, but i couldn't recall. and a lot of apps ask for that i think... maybe not a lot but some do - but it's hard to believe they actually would go through your messages and read them/pull data. what a time to be alive...

       Your close, but facebook actually follows you traffic around the we. Heres how they advertised a rug to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your mom looks up rugs on the internet and facebook sees this. Facebook will prioritize rugs for people in your moms network because if you are friends with your mom then you most likely have similar interests. Your mom messages you making you "top friends". Facebook sends out rug ads to you and your mom and people in her network.

       Facebook and Pandora do this if you install the app (it's in the terms &amp; conditions, and permissions). I believe you can use fb and Pandora with a mobile browser without the spy mic, or better yet, don't use fb or Pandora.

       Call me crazy but I'm 100% sure that is real. Long story short I don't have kids,I never wanted to have kids. Maternity scares me ,I never searched for kids stuff or had any publicity about such things. Two months ago I adopted a small dog and she's so small we are always saying - she's such a baby,tiny baby... Guess what?About a month later I started getting ads for baby lotions , diapers and baby promotion ads from local supermarkets.For instance, in Daily Mail (don't judge please) I used to get local UK market deals like Asda and Tesco (I'm in Portugal). I think they have code word triggers and baby is of course one of them . Funny thing is I hate salad so I started saying the word a lot hoping that ads would come and prove me right,well , baby did it too.

       I believe it to be in the terms and conditions everyone blindly agrees to.  It has to do with targeted marketing. We give them permission to record us so they can generate ad revenue.  I’m sure that’s not the only reason they record us though.

       I dont see how anyone could be so sure about something that they didnt even experience first hand. If someone you trusted a lot who has never lied to you just said they saw big foot, would you believe them so strongly? This is one single example, which could be explained in countless ways. Coincidences happen all the time, and I’m sure shes been searching for wedding related stuff on her phone a lot. The odds that an ad with that exact combination of colors would pop up is rare, but coincidences are bound to happen given the massive amount of ads we see all the time. There is a quote that goes something to the effect of “the only truly unusual day, would be a day where nothing unusual happens.”

       There is no doubt they are listening. I had the most specific fucking add appear on my fb feed it was ridiculous. I sleep hot and and a while ago there were 2 nights it was just too warm so I slept on the couch. Talked with my gf about how our mattress was too warm after the second night. Next day, an advertisement for some "cool matress" popped up with a slogan like "too warm at night?". Never searched for any such thing. Period. Not on my phone. Not on my computer. Fuck.

       I was watching a show on my iPad and my phone was next to it. I went to go to Safari to go to a website (Kohls.com) and in the suggestion bar the topic the couple was discussing showed up to search on. Talk about freaky!
