<p>Today a lesbian couple posted an engagement photo and all similar comments that were popular on yesterday&#39;s photo were downvoted to hell.</p>

<p>I posted the following comment, got about 30 upvotes in 10 minutes then it was removed by the mods and I was banned from the sub for &quot;spam&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The engagement <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7efg9h/yesterday_she_said_yes">photo</a> posted yesterday with the straight couple was heavily criticized for &quot;sharing a private moment with strangers.&quot; All comments along those lines were upvoted. And it was actually a neat photo. </p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7eqsf3/my_girlfriend_also_said_yes_even_with_the_ring">photo</a> is a shitty cell phone pic but it has a lesbian couple so it&#39;s &quot;progressive&quot; and all comments questioning why they share this moment on Reddit are downvoted. </p>

<p>Both photos are on the same subreddit depicting the same moment. Target audience is the same today as it was yesterday. </p>

<p>Just sayin.....</p>

<p>Not just more interesting, but it&#39;s also liberating to be able to share that moment which had been taboo and stigmatized until recently (And still is in my areas of the US). Straight marriage isn&#39;t overcoming any taboo or stigma or shunning, they don&#39;t have that added dimension, so they&#39;re neither interesting nor liberatory.</p>

SMA = cows milk, SFM = soy milk
“Weight gain and formula intake were similar in both feeding groups. SMA-fed males had mean testosterone levels of 2.8–3.1 ng/ml, typical of the ‘neonatal testosterone rise’, whereas SFM-fed males exhibited consistently lower mean levels (1.2–2.6 ng/ml); paired comparison in SMA-and SFM-fed co-twins at day 35–45 revealed 53–70% lower levels in 11 of 13 co-twins fed with SFM (P = 0.004). Further evidence for suppression of testosterone levels in SFM-fed males came from comparison of the frequency of low testosterone levels (&lt;0.5 ng/ml). In historical controls aged 35–45 days, two out of 22 values were &lt;0.5 ng/ml, a similar frequency as found in control SMA-fed males (one out of 15 values &lt;0.5 ng/ml). In contrast, 12 out of 15 values for SFM-fed males were &lt;0.5 ng/ml (P &lt; 0.001). “</p>

<p>It&#39;s not my position personally, but I&#39;ve seen two angles. The first is a libertarian one that&#39;s, well, against <em>anything</em> government does. The second is from religious people who feel that the govenrment&#39;s involvement damages the sanctity of it. I disagree with both.</p>

<p>Feels like bait for some fervently anti-LGBT comments. User must have heard this place is t_D 2.0. I suspect if the desired responses don&#39;t manifest, someone will use some throwaway accounts to provide them, purely so they can point at the thread as evidence of this sub&#39;s intolerance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you kind of missed part of the critique of yesterday&#39;s photo. It wasn&#39;t as much the sharing of a private moment, as it was the obvious photo setup (feels more voyeuristic and less authentic). The today one feels more authentic. But that&#39;s just my 20 cents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My reading of this situation, and the only one that I have because you refuse to answer my question, is that you see this added praise for the lesbian couple as unjust.</p>

<p>Now, if we work from a position where all marriage is equal, your aggression towards this topic simply wouldn&#39;t make sense. Is it that the picture is of lower quality that bothers you? Again, with only my own immediate reading of the events, I have to assume that&#39;s not what&#39;s causing you concern.</p>

<p>Rather, it would seem the reason that you&#39;re calling this out is that you don&#39;t approve of the added significance that homosexual marriage has currently in this society. Your discomfort or intolerance of the subject is the reason that you read this as out of line.</p>

<p>So, what is it about this that caused you to be so distraught as to comment in the original post, and then further righteously pursue it onto another subreddit? What do you perceive to be the deeper conspiracy here?</p>

<p>Your overreaching pursuit of this seems odd to say the least, and intolerant to assume the most. </p>
