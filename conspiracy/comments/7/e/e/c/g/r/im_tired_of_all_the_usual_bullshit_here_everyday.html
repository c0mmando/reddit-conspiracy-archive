       Not really in the bigger picture. Reality, soul, creation, and existence far outweigh politics and money. The elites don't care about money they care about controlling the topics I've mentioned. What you mentioned are merely distractions.

       I have a theory on why we can't intercept Alien communication to and from Earth. Mainly due to large distances a faster than light means of communication is necessary. I present
      </p>
      <p>
       Tachyons, theorized particles that have negative mass but travel faster than light(might even reach infinite speed over time due to Cherenkov radiation if charged and not neutral).
      </p>
      <p>
       Theoretically possible but quantum fluxtuations suppibly condense tachyonic fields before values cross into negatives. Normally a tachyonic field(like Higgs Field) poops out a Hadron like the Higgs Boson which is not tachyonic.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an advanced civilization could subdue quantum fluxtuations they could collect tachyonic particles and use these as faster than light communication.
      </p>
      <p>
       These particles would be hard to detect outside of sensors such as particle accelerator collision chambers(we have yet to detect one there). An advanced civilization should be capable of detecting them.

       FTL or Real Time communication I believe is an absolute possibility. I've also theorized this though I tend to lean more towards some sort of utilization of the "spooky action" concept. If we could figure out a way to control the nudging of particles some type of morse code could be done. Manipulate a particle here on earth and it's quantum pair would be manipulated as well. Whether on the moon or 100 light years away. Cheers to knowing I'm not the only one who's considered it!!

       John Lear (Lear Jet family) claims there are 250,000,000 humans living on the moon:

       that's the question of the millennium.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crrow777 (who was the guy who originally "discovered" the wave) speculates that it's evidence of a holographic "shield" (for lack of a better word) that disguises / hides the true surface of the moon.

       You are right. Hypothetically speaking, just because it would be easy to fake doesn't mean that it is. 
That being said, I am not convinced it is real either. Interesting, though.

       It can be simulated and there is basically no real evidence of it happening. Basically, I do not believe that of all the people who have viewed the moon throughout time have somehow missed this phenomenon or even better, they have all decided to keep it secret.

      <p>
       Even if it was real, why the fuck would who ever or whatever has the capability to cover the moon in a hologram still have what basically amounts to a refresh issue that any Joe schmo with a telescope could witness?

       Well, we're both wrong actually. Atmospheric disturbance does make stars twinkle and it's exactly because stars are so far away. On the other hand, it doesn't make things like planets and the moon twinkle because they're much closer.

       Sounds like a nice change of pace. I'm in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buckle up, this is going to get weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, a little background information about me, to provide some context.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been interested in every kind of weird shit there is for quite some time, around 37 years, since I was 8. Not a "true believer" mind you. There's some things I believe, but it's maybe ... 25% of what the stereotypical "tin foil hat" guy believes. And even then there is very little I believe 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       As there is so much noise involved in these subject matters, I decided that objectivity was absolutely vital, and so at the age of 8 I became a Scientist. To be clear, I mean that in the methodological sense, not in the sense of a profession.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also very interested in the field of memetics, basically how ideas propagate through our culture, and observing the conspiracy subculture is a fantastic resource in that regard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to give this comment some time to sit to gauge if people want me to continue.

       I've thought about memetics in this regard too. I've recently gotten into the UFO lore and it seems to have evolved into a more complex pattern over time, but there are elements of people's testimony that corroborate back. This could be that people already familiar with the lore are contributing their own "LARPs" to make it seem realistic, or that there is an undercurrent of truth to the stories. I'd like to believe the latter but it could really go either way. Hell, we could be living in a dome under a flat earth for all I know.

       You nailed it. Aliens = demons. It's just more palatable for the public to accept aliens. But demons would never reveal themselves at their own will, it's like "Men in black" just without comedy.

       I'm down. I think the Gnostic take on things is more or less accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hyperdimensional overlords that have humanity enslaved in a matrix. That we're being farmed for our energy and kept in lower frequencies by usually invisible hostile entities. Archons, Jinn, Reptilians, Greys... I've had a few strange experiences. From straight up mystical to absolutely terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know without a doubt that their is way more going on than we can perceive. Politics are bullshit. Most religions are bullshit at best, at worst they are a smoke screen that hide sinister motives. External displays for the dumb sheep that hide the esoteric teachings for the privileged few.

       Through periods of intense meditation I have determined that this Universe is merely an, "energy colony" to power the CRYOSPHERE to maintain Overlord ZOUL's vital functions.  His cohort Lt. ZANZIBAR currently meddles in human affairs by means of shapeshifting in order to further the agenda.  I have more information if you're interested PM me.

       Humans can't be farmed for energy, like in the movie. In the original matrix story, it was for the computing power of our brains. But back then "processing power" was deemed too technical for the general public, so the studio went with the presumably 'simpler' explanation.

       There is a lot of truth in the is post. I write 10k comments about pretty much the same stuff. Why? I get triggered by related matters and peck out most of these on my phone using SwiftKey.

       I strongly believe there is something to this myth. I experience an unwanted phenomenon daily. These beings are inside
       <em>
        all of our minds
       </em>
       I now believe. They didn't reveal that to me willfully nor immediately. I had to figure it out while they were messing with my mind. They are connected to the chatter in our minds we try to temporarily abate with meditation. It's not actually our mind. Their inputs seem like our own minds. Our only hope is to not choose to be like they are, because if we do, they will be the ones inputting much of the information we will be acting on.

       I know exactly what you mean. These beings even try to create delusions. They operate in ways that will be unproveable to our collective. They will avoid revealing themselves to individuals too, but sometimes they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       They first came to me as unnamed, benevolent beings concerned with my spiritual development. They repeatedly jumped on my case as I failed to live up to my personal goals. They would use that failure as an anchor point of known truth to slip in their deception. They would imply or directly send ideas that indicated spiritual doom, abandonment to dark forces eventually in the future. They use the truth to sell plausible deception. The purpose is to   cause the target mind to enter negative emotional states. Fear of the future, especially about something severe, will cause a lot of negative emotion. Our beliefs/perceptions elicit our emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       After I figured out what they were doing, by experiencing the pattern enough times, I called them out as malevolent. I was full of conviction and I articulated myself well. Then they revealed a nasty alien voice to me. It sounds nasal, anxious, contemptuous and it is often used to intimidate, irritate, distract, confuse, or taunt me without using words. It reminds me of how Nelson from the Simpsons often said, "ha ha!" when someone was down. They do this at times when I enter negative emotional states. They want to make them more intense. If I start to instead get upset about their interjections, they often say, "you hate me" "we hate you" or "we're done." Anger feeds them too. It's hard to resist at times.
      </p>
      <p>
       They repeat a few phrases in English. However, they send me ideas too, which contain a lot more detail. They generally play the role of divine judge, even now. They like to point out faults. They seem to do best at attacking with truth. So, if I feel guilt, shame, insecurity or fear about something, they play on what I believe to sell me plausible ideas that make me feel negative emotions. They keep trying to impersonate benevolent identities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I figure if they do this well, they can keep their target from feeling empowered to change themselves or the world, keep them feeling negative emotions and also destroy their perceptions of benevolent beings. They also feed me ideas, that I perceive as mine, that lead into distrust and other divisive emotions toward benevolent groups or individuals. They apparently want us disempowered, feeling negative emotions, blaming others instead of ourselves so we don't change, feeling separated and afraid of others, and also perceiving, thinking, feeling and acting in pure selfishness.
      </p>
      <p>
       As this went on for years (about 10 total, now) I figured out something very disturbing. Not only were they sending me these thoughts, but other thoughts that I previously thought were mine became suspect. I noticed that certain things were very much connected to this influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all get thoughts to do self-serving things that harm others and even ourselves down the road. I have no doubt that
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       of these temptations are from them, because their interactions were intertwined with them repeatedly. They also sent violent and disturbing thoughts and imagery, especially as I interacted with the people, places and things that I love. They would send me judgments of others, pointing out others faults. I have learned not to judge others this way, as it diminishes the quality of interaction with those I've judged. So, not only do they want to make us feel negative emotions, they appear to also seek to crush positive emotions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all done in a way that appears to be from one's own mind. However, their vocalizations and other forms of interaction revealed to me that they are actively involved in doing this. I can't say that all of these experiences came from them, but I know some did for sure and they are very much like how I've experienced them even before they came as benevolent otherworldly beings 10 years ago. THAT realization was heavy. They've been here my whole life.
      </p>
      <p>
       After reading descriptions of similar phenomena from the Gnostics and other sources like Don Juan Matus, I couldn't help but notice the similarities. COBRA, another interesting source of information, said that these archons also control the reincarnation process here. They pose as
       <em>
        divine judges
       </em>
       and sell you that you need to either spend some time in "hell" or willingly reincarnate into an obviously disadvantageous situation to pay off bad karma.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       they choose to attack me and what appears to work best in that endeavor, the idea that they pose as benevolent divine judges on the other side seems to fit quite well. They seem to have a lot of practice with that theme. It's also a theme well set up by the Abrahamic religions that were shoved down our throats with war, punishment and deception. How convenient for their potential deception shtick on the other side, I must say. Most religious people would fall for it. I fell for their crap initially while I was alive. I imagine if they pretended to be benevolent beings and used my actual shortcomings as a cause to punish me, I would have probably fell for it before these experiences I've had. The ingenious thing about it is that you effectively concede your free will to them, due to the deception. You agree to be punished or set up for a bad life. You think you deserve it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through all of it they keep your soul trapped, feeling negative emotions, yielding the emotional energy they prefer. They are farming us as their golden geese. They let us have some good emotions to create more energy, but we always get more negative emotions to feed them our golden eggs. If they just openly attacked us in an orgy of destruction, they'd get a little more gold for a short time, but then we'd not be able to make more later. With too much trauma and fear, we'd become disconnected from positive emotions and then slowly we become like them. If we become like them, we won't be able to make this energy either. Misery loves company is a preview of how we'll be, enjoying the misfortune of others to feel good again.
      </p>
      <p>
       This world is a loosh farm for them. They are spiritual parasites feeding on consciousness in fear and pain. We are just a resource to them. They rely on deception and coercion to overcome the inconvenience of free will. Nobody wants to feel fear and pain. So these beings can't negotiate a deal we would accept. They have to deceive or coerce to get what they want. So, these loosh junkies manipulate others to serve themselves as their way of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       They easily predict, influence and coordinate those who think as they do, like predictable self-serving machines. In a way, those beings are already somewhat integrated with the hive and don't know it. We all have it in our minds, but most of us resist it, because we want to be in balance with the self-interests of others. These beings do not. They are a hive, because taking control of other beings with technology is of high utility. It destroyed their individuality, creativity and independent mindedness. Their strength is something like a Google AI in all of their minds, informing and coordinating them. Our strength is individual self-development, making us diverse, creative, independent minded beings that have a wealth of perspectives. They learned to use the creativity of their targets to make up for their own lack thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems that by choosing to be independent minded, by seeking the truth as if you are the only authority you can fully trust, you grow in mental integrity. As you choose personal responsibility afterward, you shed vulnerability to these beings playing on your fear, guilt, shame and insecurities. If you take care of what you know you should, you remove their most viable ammunition, the truth. The key is choosing to care about the self-interests of others. By doing that while developing your own independent mind, you no longer even want a divine authority. You really don't need one. It is a scam sold by these space trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       We thirst for justice, but we need to realize that everything just is. Injustice will happen and unless a being cares to stop it, it isn't stopped. These beings play upon the need to deal with the inevitable self-serving machine personalities (psychopaths) by impersonating those who we imagine would correct injustice. Yet they generate much of it covertly. It's a very profitable arrangement for them. They have us believe in belief systems that keep us from dealing with it in more effective ways. Leave it up to God, many religions suggest. Well, it's a recipe for inaction. We tacitly consent to our enslavement.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems very compelling to me that these beings are part of an experiment of being. The idea is that God is all that is. So, that means that you and I are God. It means unity is at the base of it all. It means that these beings have a purpose. Well, don't they make us often exclaim, "there is no God!"? That is their purpose. They are incentivized to keep us from knowledge that leads us back to knowing our connection to all that is. This includes scientific ideas, showing consciousness affects reality and that it is interconnected at the cosmic level. Religion obviously does this, as one of the greatest sins is to consider the idea that you, yourself, are God. How much power over you would these religions have if you believed that? None.
      </p>
      <p>
       These beings and their minions often use false dichotomies. Science assuming that consciousness is an illusion and that there is no creator keeps us in a false dichotomy, where both apparent opposites lead us away from the truth, science vs religion. The truth is a combination of elements from both and neither though. God is your awareness, the same awareness inside of all life. In this way, the suffering and joy of all life is important.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evil is seen as unprofitable from the perspective of oneness with all that is, but it seems inevitable while forgetting connection with all that is.

       That's right. These entities operate on the frequencies of the mind. Consciousness, unconsciousness/subconscious are the battlegrounds. Deception and divide and conquer is the name of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Our only hope is to not choose to be like they are..." Yes and no...
It's complicated.

      <p>
       "Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster, and if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you."
      </p>
      <p>
       The answer is that if you want to or have to fight (as opposed to running or ignoring) these "monsters" you have to develop your own inner monster. At least recognize you have one.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a very fine line to walk. If you don't want to be prey then you have to become a predator... while still trying to remain benevolent.

       What worked for me was simply trying to understand. I find these being to be simple, yet complex, like chess. Basically, they want mind/spiritual/emotional energy and control to obtain and maintain their access to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their apparent complexity comes form having an old, thick playbook of options for a given situation. Their weakness is having an old thick playbook of options for a given situation. They appear to be uncreative, yet astonishingly proficient in hacking the mind. So, I and others are able to discern patterns in their behavior. They're still better at the game, but since we are forced to play the game, we are better off learning how they play it than not.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are aware of our thoughts. So, if you think you'll be able to get one up on them, you won't, unless you are spontaneous. If you could read others thoughts, deception would be quite difficult to pull off on you too. They are also apparently integrated  with AI technology into a sort of hive mind. So, they could use this resource for individual, group and racial deception coordination purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to understand what evil actually is. These beings are very evil, but it's something we can understand. That helps reduce fear quite a bit. Evil is simply self-serving behavior even at the expense of others. These beings are self-serving machines. This makes them somewhat predictable, to those who can discern their perceived prospects for gain, loss and the risks involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Benevolent behavior is much less predictable, because it deviates from that simple self-serving machine script. Instead of just seeking benefit for the self, benevolent beings will do what is worse for themselves in order to help others. I believe this is a big reason why the cabal on this planet requires initiates to do something abominable. They want to make sure and weed out the good eggs, because they would be the ones to grab documents and spill the beans, endangering themselves greatly in the process.

       YES. They absolutely fear courage. Spontaneous Random Truth telling and Kindness/compassion/unconditional love is exactly how you can defeat them. Or at least throw a wrench in their machine. Feign ignorance while planting seeds of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Create as much chaos and disorder as you can. Bounce the polarity around to the point of insanity then spontaneously strike a merciless blow by telling the truth at the most opportune moment. That's the thing about real love. It isn't sweet. It is salt. It is the friend who will slap you in the mouth when say something dumb.

       Yes but it's hard to know where to start so I'll just give you the meat and no potatoes.

       I did my dead level best to "wake up" a christian cult I worked for (as an outsider). I would of left well enough alone but one of their leaders was just too much of a tyrant for me to let things slide.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used intuition, deception, divide and conquer tactics, psychological warfare, chaos magick and in the end good old fashioned honesty to drive the point home.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really a long, tragic and complicated story... For my actions I was attacked by shadow entities on two separate occasions. One in particular was a smokey full bodied black mass with fiery red eyes that appeared unexpectedly and literally out of thin air. Its eyes pierced my soul. Like I could literally feel it feeding of my terror. It communicated telepathically and pretty much warned me to back off, that I had done enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also the cult accused me of terrorism and I was questioned (not charged) by men in black type agents. They did the whole good cop bad cop routine. Tried to entrap me. I just played dumb and laughed at them. I could swear the "bad" cop was reptilian in some way or another. He kept demanding I take my sunglasses off "so we could talk". I refused. Then the "good" cop handed me his card and they left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that I've seen a couple UFO's, saw my twin sister passed out drunk while playing ouija board, and have had more than a couple prophetic/visionary mushroom trips. Also intuited my mothers death. Like I knew she died the moment she died despite being miles away and not being told... I could go on but that's the juicy stuff.

       Yes 👍. I listened to the Joe Regan and Tom Delonge podcast yesterday and it was pretty interesting.  Looked into the To the Stars Academy thing which led me to some Grant Cameron interviews about Delonge. The whole situation is pretty crazy.  Even started listen to some Blink 182 haha.

       Can we also talk about the loud booms heard this week in Alabama, Florida, Michigan, and Australia? That could certainly be alien related.

       I agree with what you’re saying but there are conspiracy theories within everything. Personally I would enjoy more talk on the paranormal rather then every post being about politics.

       I really think there is something to the theory of a societal reset. Who knows how many times this has happened in our past. Wouldn't surprise me in the least if there were advanced races of humans elsewhere. I just want some fucking disclosure already.

       This is a theory I follow and research quite a bit and I'm near 100% convinced that there were one, or more, advanced civilizations of humans that we still know nothing about.
      </p>
      <p>
       A great place to start is Graham Hancocks book "Magicians of the Gods", it introduces the theory very well and after that there is lots more evidence to start exploring.

       Thanks I'll definitely check it out. Interests me quite a bit and I haven't really read much on it just put two and two together. Pretty trippy to think about the idea that if Aliens ending up being real, they were actually just a much more advanced race of humans.

       I'd wager is because political stuff is just simpler to understand, closer to reality than aliens. Hence most normal people are able to fathom only a political conspiracy

       But the question is whether it's a conspiracy. We aren't in r/politics are we? I would much rather Wade in tides of bullshit, than have to wave through anything political.

       It could all be a giant conspiracy to keep us on politics while they (whatever they are) focus on interplanetary travel and all the other cool shit, for all we know. However, I do not believe in the slightest that humans can maintain that grand conspiracy without blunders, which there hasn't been many of. I think it's just how the world works, certain patters lead to predictable results: capitalism leads to consolidation of money in the hands of the few, they fight tooth and nail to preserve it, form groups as a result, and do the nasty shit that we know of. It's not that they
       <strong>
        consciously
       </strong>
       decided to form secret societies and try to hold the entire world's affairs in their hands, it's more of an effect of how they accumulated wealth --&gt; that led to power --&gt; power corrupts and requires more power. So basically it's the way that we've been heading for all our existence, and current events are a natural outcome. I'm more of a determinist in that way, so I believe that everything could be calculated if we were to account for all the different variables (which is impossible, atm, obviously) like human decisions (which aren't made of free will, they are part of cause and effect as well,
       <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/theres-no-such-thing-as-free-will/480750/">
        here is an interesting article on that
       </a>
       ), climate cataclysms etc., then if we were to put all these variables into an equation, we'd 100% accurately simulate where we are now and where we'll be in the future. Sounds kinda crazy, but it makes sense to me. I'd be happy to discuss it further, should you wish.

       Some of these are hard to explain.  I think we have a legitimate rover on Mars, but we also use pictures from the island north of Canada they test the rovers on.  I don't know how else you explain the picture of the rodent.

       Aliens could be a good explanation for supernatural events that many people claim to have had happen to them. That being said, I've always been of the opinion that aliens definitely exist, but they are faaaaaar away.

       Aliens exist. I am sure there are many levels of intelligence to their species. We probably don't hear from most of them because they are still evolving into a form somewhat like ourselves or beyond. Some might be microscopic, and still growing.

       Idk if people will really agree with me on this but I’ve always believed that nothing can travel at the speed of light or anything like that, because if there was, then aliens that had popped up before us would have long since colonized at the very least a sizable chunk of the galaxy, likely in the way of Dyson Swarms (thousands, if not millions, of habitats, solar collectors, etc. all orbiting around a sun) which would be visible on many different wave lengths. Because we have yet to see this, either ftl travel isn’t possible, or intelligent life is extremely rare, to the point where we would likely never encounter them. To me, the former is more likely, so although we may share our galaxy with a handful of other species, it is unlikely they would have had a chance to visit us in the past. We haven’t been giving off signs of life for long enough for them to reach aliens AND for them to reach us. Who knows though, they might be on their way now, though I doubt it

       I'm with you on this.. I don't think we are alone in our galaxy. And I don't think it's possible we are the most

       advanced species of our galaxy either.

       My guess is if FTL speeds were possible, there's a high likelihood that alien life would have reached us or at least reached out to us by now.

       I suggest searching up the “Dyson Dilemma” on YouTube by Isaac Arthur, that video is the main reason I think that although life exists elsewhere in the galaxy, and may be more advanced than us, that life is rare enough to make an incredibly advanced alien civilization unlikely, and if ftl travel is possible, we likely would have been visited by several species at this point, perhaps not even from this galaxy, the idea that none of them would attempt to contact us seems ridiculous, perhaps one or two would have something stopping them from visiting us (eg. Their version of the Prime Directive from Star Trek) but certainly not all of them

       I can imagine a scenario where both of your assumptions are wrong. Nobody thought heavier than air flight was possible but it is. I think it's extremely naive to think that FTL is impossible. Secondly, what if beings consume energy differently as they progress technologically? A Dyson sphere is something we'd imagine a type 2 civilization could build, but what if they found a way to harness energy by some other means? I know zero point energy is a concept describing utilizing the energy contained within the vacuum of space itself. No need for an static physical hardware to attach to the sun like a corded phone in your kitchen. Also they may know how to change the frequency at which they exist, so maybe they are all around us and we can only interact with them when they decide to match our density of existence. Of course these are all assumptions as well.

       Even if they found a different way to collect energy, a Dyson Swarm is used for more than just energy, like I said it’s imagined to be a combination of both solar collectors AND habitats or massive processors if they’ve gone virtual, and I agree that a species may interact with the universe as we know it differently, HOWEVER, that requires the assumption that all species have reasons not to construct Dyson Swarms, that every intelligent species that has achieved interstellar travel doesn’t need energy, processing power, or even living space, which is what makes the Fermi Paradox so difficult to come up answers to, because any solution you come up with has to apply to either all or nearly every species.

       The more we learn about physics and space the less we know. Like dark matter or particle physics are super unknown. So FTL travel is a massive question mark which is my roundabout way of saying it's 50/50 of being possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the Fermi Paradox- I am with ya, I think life is super friggan rare. Like there would be a dumb amount of filters for life to reach what we are now.

       This is probably crazy but here's my answer to WTF life is-
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans got fkn lucky to get where we are and things are about to get real. What I think will happen is AI/Nanotech goes crazy from here out and grows exponentially eventually conquering the universe. Our universe is basically a cell in a body, tiny. Our now nano dominated universe adds to some unfathomable thing beyond my comprehension

       I personally believe that since we have billions of planets just in our solar system, and there are perhaps billions of other solar systems, some much older than ours, that the chances that intelligent life doesn't exist elsewhere in the universe seem slim.  Have they been here?  I don't know, but imagine another intelligent race got a million year head start on us and I don't think it's out of the question that interstellar travel would have been mastered.

       If there are such aliens which got a huge head start on us I don't think we will ever communicate effectively with them. Not for a long long time at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       The classic example is an ant versus a person. Earth is the ant and Smart Aliens are the person. Our dumb little worker ant brains cannot even fathom what humans are doing, it never enters the mind.

       I think most manifestations of aliens that we're familiar with (Greys) could be time travelling humans from the future here to correct issues, learn about the past or just generally fuck with us.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more likely, that some random civilization would take an intense interest in us, or we'd take an intense interest in ourselves?

       Can someone explain why Aliens and UFO's rarely visit Europe, Russia and China for example?
      </p>
      <p>
       OR could it be that most UFO sightings have something to do with imagination and of course secret military operations and Experiments. The Roswell incident some say has to do with some experiments of the military to spy the soviet secret nuclear test and this story was released to distract the public interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least i think it's absolutely possible that there are other extra terrestial life forms, but this could be anything, from bacterias to highly intelligent aliens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming those UFO's were real aliens, we can say relatively sure, that they must be technically much more advanced than we are, otherwise it would be hard to reach our solar system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, assuming this highly evolved technology they should be able to communicate relatively easy with us, by hacking our TV or Radio for example (if they really want to communicate).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also i'm not sure if i would like to meet some Aliens whose technology is superior to ours, because who knows if they are friendly. If they were not, earth really would be fucked. I mean they didn't need to be bad Alien guys really, imagine they organize like an ants state, with some kind of collective intelligence and no personal conscience. Perhaps they would only see some kind of resource in us and collect everything they can get. To make this not so much creepy and frightening i would say there could be a little chance that they were vegetarian. :)

       I've got lots of theories on the subject, but this is my favorite:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When Aleister Crowley was living in New York, doing various magickal experiments in a place on West 9th, he did what’s called the Amalantrah Working. It’s theorized this process created a deliberate channel in ephemeral cosmic influences so that extra-dimensional entities could enter our universe. In short, he likely created a portal for what we know as gray aliens to come visit us.
        <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mvpvyn/magickal-stories-lam">
         [more]
        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       After Crowley had opened the portal then it was widened further by Jack Parsons and L. Ron Hubbard by means of a rite known as the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babalon_Working">
        Babalon Working
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Crowley thought this was reckless behavior! Note that it took place in 1946, one year before Roswell...

       I can offer some random thoughts I have had.... just theories, no proofs, but maybe some will be worth discussion....
      </p>
      <p>
       I have not given much credit to aliens honestly. Life seems to be a pretty rare event, and human level intellect even more so. If aliens were active here, I feel like we would know more about em plus I don't see any incentive to come here. If they have technology to space travel, then they could easily terraform nearby planets instead of travel to ours.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do like the idea of aliens having used genetic breeding to create the first humans.... the human intellect and consciousness seems pretty unique and I am curious if its more then just monkeys with bigger brains.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also thought about perhaps a fungus, parasite, or virus type species, from meteorites or something, that managed to invade into other species on earth and cohabitated to evolve into higher thinking. Take mitochondria for example, the "powerhouse" of the cell, it has its own DNA (RNA) and important step to larger, advanced organisms, and mito rna is theorized to be bacteria that was absorbed by the cells. If humans did really eat mushrooms to trip balls and gain some perspective, maybe an alien fungus on those shrooms helped boost the intellect.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have an alternate theory on how humans came about.... large, widespread, instant spread of genetic mutations cause by solar flash flares from the sun that pierce thru skin and effected embryo's in the womb or chimpanzee gonads which cause various mutations for the new generations, some good and some bad, and the good ones lived to reproduce with perhaps higher intellect. I personally think this seems possible with the nature of evolution being driven by random mutations. The solar flash could even have caused other natural disasters like floods or volcanic eruptions.... plus the idea of a flash of light causing people to have "powers" is something Hollywood or popular fiction has used a few times in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also.... what about Antarctica and mole people lol? I think a species that has lived underground would be very interesting and more plausible then aliens. I'm not sure if there is really anything goin on at the south pole, if there is actually a hole or crater there... but its certainly interesting to talk about. There has been talk of an ancient species/civilization that may have lived there too. I could imagine an underground civilization that has created its own energy source.... they lack sunlight but plenty of natural resources like metals or gemstones like diamonds, maybe use of heat/pressure and some manipulation of electromagnetism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bit of a stretch I know... but I am curious if anything more is going on down in antartica. I especially think its odd how Argentina is known for ties with illuminati/freemasons, lots of corruption or hiding nazis, and they are almost connected with Antarctica.... the other two countries most south is south Africa, the only country that white people (british/dutch) stayed in and populated after colonialism, and Australia... also originally british. I'm sure these are useful trade harbors, but could there be more?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also read some research reports about possible alternative origin of human species, or multiple origins.... not just Africa, but people with east Asian features may have come from origins along the east side of asia from china, Thailand, or even Australia... then traveled across to Americas. There was related research about the "hobbit" sapiens found in that area. All that is real stuff from research reports, but a related conspiracy theory is that this recent "23 and me" push for people to give their DNA is so gov't has larger samples of dna to look more closely at possibility of multiple origins for human species.

       You mean the ones who have climbed in your eye and parasites your mind??  they live in symbiosis with the host/hostess at the base of the brain and top of the spine called The archipallium or primitive YOU KNOW THE REPTILIAN brain, comprising the structures of the brain stem – medulla, pons, cerebellum, mesencephalon, the oldest basal nuclei – the globus pallidus and the olfactory bulbs. ARE YOU A WALKING PARASITE? TAKING ORDERS FROM A SOMETHING THAT USES YOUR BUILT IN SYSTEM MEANT FOR AUTOMATION.. It's a tricky son of a bitch..
