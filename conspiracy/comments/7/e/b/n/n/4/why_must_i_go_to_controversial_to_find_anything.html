       I'm always thrilled to read anti-Clinton stories. These people need to be kept in check. So why is it that I can't ever find any anti-Trump stories here without going to new or controversial?
      </p>
      <p>
       How can folks claim this sub is unbiased when everything anti-Trump is immediately relegated to controversial (if it even makes it out of new)? Trump won, he's the President. Don't you want to keep our President in check? Wouldn't you have wanted to keep Hillary in check if she won? How is this any different?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying the sub should be pro-Clinton and anti-Trump, but I don't see how it makes sense for
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to be pro-Trump when he's literally the President. I honestly don't think this is a "shilling" problem, as it seems like most of the folks downvoting these posts which are critical of Trump are actually real readers, so is it safe to assume that everyone here just loves Trump and thinks he can do no wrong? Is it really wise to give the sitting President a pass, to not even investigate or consider negative stories about him? I understand Trump is more liked than Hillary, and rightly so, but should we really be making a concerted effort to keep anything negative about him off the front page of the sub?
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the stuff you find in controversial isn't even hearsay or rumors, it's known facts. Surely you guys care about some of this stuff?

       Nice spin. Too bad it's bullshit. Top story in controversial now is this one:
       <a href="https://medium.com/@caityjohnstone/10-trump-administration-atrocities-going-under-reported-amid-russia-hysteria-35dc07cd9393">
        https://medium.com/@caityjohnstone/10-trump-administration-atrocities-going-under-reported-amid-russia-hysteria-35dc07cd9393
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Talking about how the tax cut to the rich will hurt America and how we are about to lose our Net Neutrality protections. The fish food BS was pushed hard by the right. Breitbart/Fox news ran with it. Only the right wing snowflake tried to make a story out of nothing.

       The problem is that I'm anti-bullshit, and politics is absolutely pro-bullshit. I don't want to read the fantasies of rabid liberals, I want to know what our President is actually getting up to. This sub at least has the appearance of being anti-bullshit and pro-truth, so it is at the moment one of the best places to try to glean some truth out of the propaganda. It's just a shame that it can't be non-partisan. Hell, if there's any conspiracy the readers here should be investigating, it's the politicization of this sub.

       I want this subreddit to be nonpartisan. Sorry, I thought I had made that clear. So I want to seek out anti-Trump posts and anti-Hillary posts, and anti-whoever else posts.

       This is one of the corners of Reddit where we won't shame you for voting for trump.  It's natural therefore that many trump supporters were marginalized here.

       You should always be shamed for supporting the President of the United States on a conspiracy board. You have to be the biggest idiot in the world to believe that the same 'shadow governments' that start wars and assassinate people at will, messed up and let good guy Trump become President.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you need to explain why Trump has done nothing to help anyone, or convict anyone. Only indictments have been to members of his team.

       Oof. Nice dodge. Your entire argument is that you don't want to discuss negative Trump stories because they are just MSM talking points. But apparently you love discussing MSM talking points as long as they are saying bad things about people you don't like.

       But you're either blind or demented by partisanship if you don't notice that the MSM blasts negative news stories about Trump 24/7. And all of those stories are on every reddit news sub. Constantly.

       It's a valid question. I have sought the answers and it seems to be because there really hasn't been any leak or real like, actual evidence lately against Trump. I saw a well put together Trump Russia post the other day and he sourced over 25 articles. But when I got into the sourcing it was repeating the same accusations over and over.
      </p>
      <p>
       It boiled down to, Trump has said funny things about the e-mails and made jokes about Russia having the e-mails. Trump Jr. was caught talking with Wikileaks. Wikileaks was offering campaign advice to Trump I believe to get the scoop on his taxes and try to bargain for a pardon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks is basically Putin himself. A meeting with a lawyer where nothing happened with kushner, Jr, Manafort. Manafort being indicted for being a shithead in Ukraine but literally nothing to do with the election, laundering over 50 million dollars. Trump colluding with Mercer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow this equals impeachment level collusion to steal the election with Russia.

      <p>
       Here is that thead. He went around throwing the tired tactic of "Then debunk all my points" in classic fashion. As no one in their right mind is going to read 25 articles of propaganda and refute them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well I did anyway knowing that he was employing that tactic and I got my ad hominem attack as reward and that was that :/. I don't know if I truly refuted everything but it's a prime example of, a lot to say but no substance. Go ahead and read it. They took great care with their formatting to look extra professional.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Look how fast they abandoned ship once someone came in and actually called them on their bullshit. A real person would of defended their post that they put so much time and work into. They just copy pasted a comment from politics hoping to rub it in our face or something yet won't even back their pilfered words.

       Because we're not all perfect and we don't all agree but talking about politics is an addiction most of us cannot find release.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's assume there a few types of people on this sub:
      </p>
      <p>
       Woke - don't believe in political parties, don't believe in Presidents. Won't post about trump unless he is party to a bigger story. Subject of story will likely not be Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nihilists - almost woke - will post negative stuff even it's really just political and not conspiracy related. Will post about Clinton and Trump. Also, I'm going with the popular definition of Nihilism here. It's a pretty dope school of thought that you should check into for a by the book definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Establishment Red Shirt - does not frequent reddit. Except maybe for bad porn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Establishment Blue Shirt - frequents reddit since it became a battleground for free speech. Prefers to talk in echo chambers elsewhere. May still be lurking and sending in some bots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free Thinking Blue Shirt - aware of the insane imbalance of power and wealth. Sees Trump as a side show to the true injustices of the intelligence/military industrial complex, the fact that we're getting hosed in the tax plan (in both the short and long term), and to top it all off the guy's just a fucking embarrassment. This is the only source of anti-trump posts you're going to get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free thinking red shirts - have so little trust in government Donald Trump is a trojan horse that doesn't even know it's a famn trojan horse. They cheer as Rome burns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Friends of the Donald - True Believers and Trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what you're asking is why aren't there more free thinking blue shirts and nihilists. Well, nihilism is an uncomfortable state that you think yourself out of so it can be considered temporary in most.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free Thinking Blues? I consider myself one. I guess I feel like such a fucking unicorn these days I don't say much anywhere. I am so damn ashamed I am still registered D. I just keep trying to get to Woke.

       Because in terms of "conspiracy," Trump is at the center of one involving MSM filtration of relevant news.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the biggest issues trump supporters, and fence sitters like myself have with the current status of the media is that Trump seems to get tagged by literally any story published about him, while dems on the left, pedos on the right, seemingly guilty of much worse don't get traction on the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result, every story about trump is "controversial" because there's a lag between when it goes public and when we as the public find out it's fake or backed by legit evidence.
