        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was hearing the normal anti-trump rhetoric of the news and found myself silently defending trump. This made me question why I actually wanted to defend him, since I still think he&#39;s displayed the morals and intellect of a child.  I realized that all of the posts on here and 4chan (Q/Mega/Etc.) made me believe that Trump is fighting the man quietly behind the curtain and I just can&#39;t see clearly what&#39;s going on (Hundreds of Indictments, Uranium One, Pedo stuff, JFK files, all of which we are still waiting on something concrete to happen with).  Meanwhile, the government is encroaching on multiple fronts with the net neutrality battle and the proposed tax plan, with issues like gun control and insurance &quot;reform&quot; looming overhead.</p>

<p>Is everything a cleverly crafted PSYOP to gain the support of the internet community so that when the current administration tries to take more power from the people, the people will be more divided on whether to oppose the administration? Or are these just problems that are being generated from another piece of the government (i.e. not Trump&#39;s side of the field)? What&#39;s you guys&#39; take on the current situation? I know I&#39;m sort of being hypocritical in asking the source of a potential PSYOP, &quot;Hey, are you a PSYOP?&quot; But I figure we have some regular humans on here, too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sealed indictments will be the only indication of what Trump has actually been up to. I think we can safely say he is doing something behind the curtain, but the indictments could just as easily be MS13 leaders or something. </p>

<p>I think at a certain point everything ends up being turned to their advantage by the political leadership and deep state actors, foreign and domestic. So, everything is a psyop of sorts, everything is manipulated, and the situation with Q is no different. Personally, I&#39;m leaning towards it being a psyop to hide a huge coup and consolidation of power by Israel/NWO actors. But we just don&#39;t know anything until the arrests happen. I think it is safest to consider the whole thing a massive waste of time until something substantive takes place. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll gladly eat my words, but Trump was always presumed to be on Israel&#39;s jock by way of Kushner. The timing of Kushner&#39;s trip to KSA right as the coup took place tells me something is very fucky about that whole deal. And they are prolonging the reveal on the indictments because that is when we see the trap snap shut, and they want to make sure the game is locked before they do so.</p>

<p>That is just the assumption that gets thrown around because of his seeming affection for Israel. I don&#39;t think Trump actually likes Israel at all myself, I think he has been forced into that alliance due to past business and resents the shit out of their control. Speculation on my part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a couple observations... we pay corporate taxes... they are are not paid by corps... they pass them on to the customers in the price of goods and services... and for most people this is a better deal on taxes because MSM is not covering the doubling of the standard deduction. This means most people will get double the deductions without having the massive nightmare of record keeping and filing. PLUS, a lot of people cannot itemize because they don&#39;t meet the level of deductions you need to itemize so they never get to take advantage of those provisions to deduct on their tax return and thus pay more in taxes. The stuff that is being eliminated is the stuff only high, high-income earners deduct. The doubling of the standard deduction helps all but some of those people. Do your own research, don&#39;t believe the MS narrative... do you really believe they have your best interests at heart?</p>

<p>Also, back when Net Neutrality was going to go into effect the people who I believed were totally against it. After doing research for weeks on both sides it became apparent that like all &quot;Gubment&quot; labels that name for what they were trying to do was the complete opposite of what it would do. Therefore, repealing it would be a good thing in my judgment. But that is for me. Again, do not take my word for it or anyone else&#39;s. SEEK information of what both sides are claiming... NOT thru their media filters. This is true for most everything... the BEST LESSON FROM Q whether LARP or not is this... ASK QUESTIONS... SEEK THE REAL ANSWERS BEHIND THE SMOKE SCREEN OF THE OFFICIAL NARRATIVE. Trust NO MAN... put your faith in God and your God-given brain to break out of the matrix programming. Think for yourself. Challenge everything you think you believe. You must in order to find the real TRUTH. Anyone who takes any news at face value is being taken for a ride on someone else&#39;s agenda train. It&#39;s an easy ride until you reach the end of the line.</p>

<p>If this isn&#39;t the use of directed satire (in a user reply), then it appears you are stating de facto they did invade. Could we then say you&#39;ve now eaten your <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7e68h6/there_are_reports_now_circulating_that_a_special/dq3ll64/">bull-shit?</a> or was it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7e68h6/there_are_reports_now_circulating_that_a_special/dq44872/">dog shit?</a></p>

<p>It seems you&#39;ve cornered yourself into a place where either you <em>eat shit</em> or claim they invaded [in defiance of a previous declaration]. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our whole political system is designed to split the public.</p>

<p>If we required 60% vote for things instead of 51% people would actually have to work together and find common ground, instead we are always split. </p>

<p>Often you&#39;ll find that even phrasing matters, someone may agree with something phrased one way, but disagree when it is phrased another.</p>

<p>Start by asking if the person believes everyone should be treated equally. Then ask if they believe black people should be, or gay people, or woman. And you may get another answer. </p>

<p>When confronted on this you&#39;ll see that they will spit out some stuff they heard on the news to separate those people from the everybody. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve been doing this for as long as we&#39;ve existed as a country. </p>

<p>So to answer your question. Yes, it is perfectly possible it is, the worse realization, is that people aren&#39;t even doing it consciously. </p>
