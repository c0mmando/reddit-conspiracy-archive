       If you go on r/all today you will see many posts from different subreddits displaying this same message:
      </p>
      <p>
       Join the Battle for Net Neutrality! Net neutrality will die in a month and will affect [Insert] and many other websites and services, unless we fight for it!
      </p>
      <p>
       These are some of the posts I've seen:

      <p>
       Now I don't have strong opinions on the Net neutrality issue but I do try to investigate shilling, corporate manipulation, and astroturfing when I see it. Regardless of your position on this issue you have to realize that these posts are suspicious and that Reddit could be a prime target for Pro-Net Neutrality companies to spread their propaganda. Net Neutrality is a complicated issue that can confuse the uninformed citizen and this propaganda seems to immediately persuade them to view it as negative. Technical issues like this seem particularly vulnerable to shilling so watch out!

       Are we sure its for a good cause? Giving more control of the internet over to the government is not something I would rather avoid. Anti-trust laws should be amended to address this issue, instead.

       The biggest thing that might be a concern for people, especially in this sub, is that it gives the government greater control over the internet. So they will have a greater potential for abuse and censorship.

       I think that it would be better to simply amend Antitrust laws to address this problem.

       I have been against NN and recently have had the legal reasons why I was against NN shown to be wrong because of newer amendments to the law in question.

      <p>
       But I just can't get past the fact that the accounts that I know to be shills are pushing for it, the deep state corporate media is pushing for it, the hive mind of reddit is pushing for it, it happened under NWO Obama's watch,  and it is government power and regulation based on a strawman problem.

       I agree with him. Problem is, you can't be 100% positive someone is a shill, and you can't call them out without getting banned. You can call bullshit if you want, but I've noticed the same exact thing.

       Alot of people label people shills because they simply disagree with their viewpoint. Given that NN is something almost everyone agrees on it's not unreasonable that you would agree on this with someone you otherwise don't have much political agreement with.

       Ok? I'm not sure what your point is. Shilling definitely happens, and this pro-NN push looks shilly as fuck.

       I don't know a single person IRL that is against net neutrality. I work in the tech industry and have lots of well informed peers. It's not shilling it's just sensible policy. Lots of people are anti-murder, it doesn't mean that lots of posts that are against murder are paid shills. No payment is necessary for people to speak up against nonsense policy. People being widely against something is not evidence of foul play, not everything requires a 50/50 split.

       Same here. All the usual suspects are shilling for this, which means we should be wary.

       This is true.  I tried to watch a gif of this gonewild chick stripping, but she covered her nipples and pussy with a superimposed pro-net neutrality banner.

       Twitter, Google, Facebook, etc already collect user data, sell your information and do everything net neutrality is supposed to stop ISPs from doing.  ISPs already face FCC regulations regarding these things and have been sued/fined for their actions.   The people making money and doing all the shady things without restrictions are the ones shilling net neutrality the most.   It's definitely astroturfing and paid posting for these reddit posts.  Similar to tesla comparison posts making front page instantly and anti-trump spam from boards lucky to get 50 upvotes on average - people with money pushing their agendas.

       What in gods name are you talking about? This makes NO SENSE. How would ending net neutrality prevent them from doing this? Net neutrality isn't ALLOWING this companies to collect data and sell it.

       The pro-NN outrage just doesn't appear organic to me. I don't have hard evidence, just life experiences to go by. I know what real outrage looks like, and it's not something you can turn on and off like a faucet
