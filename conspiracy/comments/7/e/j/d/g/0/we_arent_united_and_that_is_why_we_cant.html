       It seems obvious. But we fail to look at the bigger picture because of petty shit. There are still people in this subreddit saying that Hillary is a nice person that actually cares about us and would’ve done everything should could for us if she was elected.

       As long as you have an open source like Reddit, that will always be the case. Paid bots, larpers, you name it. What would really do this sub good, and I see it from time to time, is well articulated posts, going in detail about a problem, and how to fix that problem, and let the comment section just run its course. Nowadays you only find clickbait titles, and concern posts like these. Not helping at all

       Maybe making a strict, unbiased database for new people could be a start? Showing real information and not fake news? Not adding anything new until it’s read and shown to be actually helpful and with actual evidence? You are right, this post might not be giving helpful information, but at least it’s getting us to communicate, which seems harder and harder as time goes by.

       No, you are completely right! I can’t contribute with anything new atm. I only thought getting a conversation started might be helpful. And you actually said something that’s very true, bots basically run reddit and that’s why it’s getting harder and harder to find legit credible information!

      <p>
       I have never seen anyone on this subreddit say that. I do see a lot of pro-Trump and lock-Hillary-up posts though. I agree Hillary would have been a bad president, as is Trump, but for you to say we need to be more united, and then attack only one political party is very hypocritical.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is not any individual person, the problem is the system. Any politician that fails to fight to revolutionize the system has failed their constituents. Every Republican or Democratic leaders I've seen in my lifetime has just served to maintain the status quo. Bashing Trump or Hillary (like you just did) only further separates people and takes attention away from the real systematic issues.

       We need to quit ostracizing those with different views and start formulating an agenda made up of shared goals. Leftists, conservatives, independents, who gives a shit? We all have the same enemies and we need to react accordingly. The first step should be figuring out how to sway enough people to kick the snowball over the edge.

       So then who are the enemies? Clearly there are different perceptions on that question if there is no unity. That means to get unity you need to change peoples perception of who their enemies are.

       Another problem is that most people here probably don't have the ability to make a change. If we are serious we need resources and a plan, but in reality we are just strangers in a subreddit and anonymity is a barrier because we know nothing about each others abilities.

       Both established parties and their dependence on insane amounts of cash to operate. The parties in and of themselves aren’t bad, but the system has morphed so that our representatives must hustle for that cash to get re-elected. The most cash comes from corporate lobbyists and that is who they represent. If raising money wasn’t an incentive they could focus harder on what the people want instead of repeatedly trying to destroy the internet as an example. So I’d say the enemy is an abstract one in that it is our system. So... fight the system? Rage against the machine? I don’t really know but Lawrence lessig talks about “root striking” which should be one of our main focuses I think.

       Above all else, we need organization. We can have conversations and debates all over the internet until the cows come home but without a basic level of organization, we will all forget these conversations in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re right, we’re all just strangers on a subreddit. Let’s start there, why don’t we? What are our (and the people’s) desires, ideas, our wants and needs? I’m confident we can knock that out of the park. Next step is a plan. So, what about a dedicated thread or sub for these initial conversations?

       very simply, those people who support Greed and are prepared to conspire to benefit from other people's losses e.g. banks and most large business' that use the "it's for the shareholders/I was just following orders" ... when I ripped them off/tricked them/scammed LIBOR!
      </p>
      <p>
       FFS, it's basically the Neuremberg defense!
      </p>
      <p>
       So "who are the enemies"?  We All are to some degree, becoz we 'sell ourselves' to make the money we need to survive. It's a bit of a catch-22 there, but I don't include the people who aren't in a position to "invest to make more" in the group I consider "the enemy"
      </p>
      <p>
       they are the people who are happy with the status quo and are doing their damndest to keep things the way they are -- as naivve as such thinking is, these people are the 'troops' of the conservatives who like things just the way they are, well, the shareholders
       <em>
        do need
       </em>
       better returns ...
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, IMO it's the people who have blinkers on, tend to not know better than to "believe the official narrative"
       <em>
        about whatever
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       these people 'prefer not to think' ... so they let the MSM do the thinking for them. These people are the "mindless enemy" who support the Killarys of this world ... becoz they were gently sold to!

       Think globlally, as you are, and 'act locally' .. start doing this IRL in the world around you, start spreading this message IRL, "let's ALL STOP FIGHTING EACH OTHER and start
       <em>
        working together
       </em>
       becoming friends ...
       <em>
        then
       </em>
       that develops into a unified group that has it's 'beginings online' aka "cyberspace" which is nowhere and everywhere at the same time, so nobody 'owns' this, like anonymous BUT REAL!
      </p>
      <p>
       Now how do you do this? Social media's a good start BUT not everyone, esp the "old hippies" who are in their 60's and 70's and probably right behind ideas like this, are internet savvy BUT their knowledge is priceless and needs to become a part. How do we also touch such people? Through the grandkids social media? lol

       It's going to be difficult when the mainstream media controls the narrative, and the "alternative media" is infiltrated as well. Not to mention the establishment keep tabs on all of our communications. Any movement that legitimately has potential to be a threat will just be broken up and infiltrated by their agents. It's nearly impossible to get the average untrained people to organize effectively.

       We need to be more understanding and patient in our daily lives, and abandon the idea that we know everything.  We have to be more respectful of other people and their viewpoints, and we have to love each other no matter how ugly the other person seems to us.  Once their is a culture of mutual respect and understanding, a love of people and their unique ideas, everything will become clear I think.

       I totally disagree. It’s more that people are lazy and they won’t even do the things they believe in on a day to day basis. Basically, it’s hard to get your shit together.

       Working long hours makes me just want to crash when I get home... I would love to get out there and do something but do I miss work? do people want to give up time with the family after they get home from work? Basically working a shitty job has done wonders to demotivate my fight against the man. I missing my hockey game this weekend to go to work. I don't even get a chance to do the things I believe in.

       Umm I have to work to sustain them?? Lol, a job gives me financial stability. I wish I had my own business or maybe my own farm to grow food to sustain them by other means.

       I think you underestimate the danger of unity. We're nutters, interested in the shades of reality. We believe in things, not because of vast evidence, but because we are not satisfied with conventional explanations. All of us have different preoccupations and a different way of processing information. Why would we give that up? To me, it would take the beauty away from it, as it would reduce us to no more than a lobby group.

       We could start by making a poll of conspiracies to see where the general sub membership stands on subjects.  Create polls to see what issues that are facing us today that we can agree on and take action.  We are blinded by the partisan politics, but no one is leaning all the way right or left all the time.  Situations develop, facts come to light, personal experiences come into play.  Most would say I lean right...if you only knew... A person is so much more than left or right.  We go left and right on many different issues in our lives.  Let's find the stuff we agree on and kick some ass.

       IMO the problem isn’t the division, it’s the forced unification that creates a lot of problems. Expecting a government to have complete control because it has drawn borders glosses over the fact that people have things that tie them to certain communities and will make them feel less loyal to the broader version of “us.” As opposed to respecting that, governments force themselves on people, and inevitably there will be issues of “division,” if it’s assumed we should all be combined.

       Unity is the missing link and our greatest potential to generate insane amounts of power that will transform this world into a paradise.
      </p>
      <p>
       The formula for unity is N(squared) where N is the number of united people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government has knows this for years and that is why they pushed "divide and conquer" so hard all this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       To unite, people have to stop thinking about in-group and out-group and just consider the world one giant in-group. The cabal members would simply be seen as people too insane to be free and have to be locked away for the sake of everyone's safety but if we find a cure, we can cure them.

       TPTB are united via blackmail / death threats, i.e. brute force and fear, and worshipping their false god ... is that what you really want?
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the Protocols and you'll see how they systematically dismantle rallying points of unity ... family, nation, race, religion etc.  Family is torn apart through fornication and divorce, nation and race is torn apart by self-hating communists, religion is torn apart by schism and atheism.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO I think it is unity under the Christian God is our only hope of transcending natural differences in family, race, nation ... in other words, a miracle.

       Christ said wrt the Christian Church "the gates of heck will not prevail against it."  This promise is not extended to any other nation, state, organization, or institution.  TPTB are literally the body of anti-christ and worship heck and are united through their false religion, and they have infiltrated and prevailed against almost every nation and institution.

       I realize that it is politically incorrect and unpopular to say and it pains me a little that all of you ignore this reality.  They worship demons, and only the Church can possible defeat them, and yet you ignore and jettison the Church as irrelevant.  Political movements, rallies, get-togethers are all good ... but they are not enough in the face of a spiritual enemy ... and you have all thrown away your spiritual weapons.

       Well, if you aren't wrong about that, do you really think one faith alone will be strong enough to stop them?  I've met some pretty good souls out there who aren't Christian.  If I were fighting against the Antichrist I would want them on my side.

       One faith alone?  Yes, it is the faith that is invested with the divine power and crushed the head of the serpent on Mt. Calvary.

       'Good souls' (whatever that means) are a good thing.  But fighting against spiritual evil with 'human goodness' is like fighting with sporks ... cute, but useless.  I'd rather have the intercession of spiritual giants like Theresa of Avila, Paul of Tarsus, and Francis of Assisi.  Fighting against the demonic with sporks?? You're waaaaay out of your league my friend.

Open source everything and let's take the decision making out of government and back into the hands of the people.

       Government can melt to the bureaucracy that files our papers. And that can be uploaded to a blockchain and a few essential services.

       We need to quit ostracizing those with different views and start formulating an agenda made up of shared goals. Leftists, conservatives, independents, who gives a shit? We all have the same enemies and we need to react accordingly. The first step should be figuring out how to sway enough people to kick the snowball over the edge.

       It's going to be difficult when the mainstream media controls the narrative, and the "alternative media" is infiltrated as well. Not to mention the establishment keep tabs on all of our communications. Any movement that legitimately has potential to be a threat will just be broken up and infiltrated by their agents. It's nearly impossible to get the average untrained people to organize effectively.

       We need to be more understanding and patient in our daily lives, and abandon the idea that we know everything.  We have to be more respectful of other people and their viewpoints, and we have to love each other no matter how ugly the other person seems to us.  Once their is a culture of mutual respect and understanding, a love of people and their unique ideas, everything will become clear I think.
