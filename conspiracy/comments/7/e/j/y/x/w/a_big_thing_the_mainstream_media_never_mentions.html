       Was kind of shocked to learn on the Joe Rogan Podcast that 70% of Pakistan and possibly half of the muslim/arab world are inbreeding. (marrying their first cousins in most cases)
      </p>
      <p>
       30% of birth defects in the UK are from Pakistani immigrants (which represent 3% of the population)
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a pretty big strike against that part of the world. Respecting culture that is different to your own is one thing -- treating a culture as equal when they are backwards and wrong is another.... even tribal cultures know not to inbreed.

       We all like  to act like Muslims are a thousand leagues from us. I'm irish (duh) and Christianity was once as powerful here as Islam is.. well anywhere Muslims are. People were subjugated by the shackles of religion. Not to say all Christians and all Muslims are good, but surely we should work towards liberating our fellows from those shackles instead of villanising them and calling them barbarians. 
Whether you want to admit it Islam is a beast the west created.  The Iran war killing thousands of families, drone strikes going on even now, IsIs made by America. And lets not forget what happened with Israel. Their extremism is caused by all of that.

       No I am not "oh all Muslims are good." But i thought the idea of this subreddit is that people were at least a little woke.

Inbreeding wouldn't  be the issue it is if we didnt segregate Muslims so heavily AND if they weren't so bound by the twisted words of the Quran.

       Not saying they are bad. Im saying they are inbreed and should be treated as such. Inbreed people have lower intelligence, and more aggression. They need to be taught the difference between right and wrong, whcih, in this case is entirely objective. Inbreeding causes massive birth defects and shallows the gene pool.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should look at countries that have 70% inbreeding as contemptible, backwards and wrong. I believe in tolerance and freedom for different cultures -- not cultures which are harmful to themselves and others.

      <p>
       If a person is harmful to themselves, we stop them, not tolerate them.

       Oh I know,  but thats just it. The religious leaders gained power when "The western devil" came and started their oil wars . It gave them fuel and power over the entire Muslim people and thats whats got us in this situation and them in their six-fingered-webbed-feet situation

       This may seem like an attempt to whataboutism and perhaps it even is. But I have always wondered about this, and I feel like maybe someone could answer this. If you read the old testament and about the first humans and genesis in particular, you have to notice that they're all having children with their family. How did not half of them become retarded? (Same goes for the Quran i think, it's just that I've done way more studying on the Bible than I have on Quran)

       Plus, even though I think all these religions are basically fairy tales, I still respect the Old Testament as a historical document that was attempting to preserve actual historical information which had been previously kept alive by an oral tradition. These stories are describing actual things that people believe they experienced. Now, their interpretation of events I might have an arguments with, but I do not doubt for a second that these events transpired in some manner consistent with the books. In that regard, I believe much of the genealogy is more accurate than anything else. Because keeping track of that was of the utmost concern to the authors and society from which it came.

       Didn't inbreeding happen all the time with European royalty and in some cases is still happening? There are still cases of it happening in North America. Are you outraged at that?

       I also am not sure if I believe the numbers you provide, do you have something to back up that 70% of the population of Pakistan are inbreeding or about 50% of the entire muslim world?

       They dug up the entire Brittish royal family, and the genetic results were shocking. Half of them were clinically retarded and/or deformed. It's actually quite impressive that GB managed to become so big when all their leaders were (in some cases literal) mongoloids.

       Physical deformity has nothing to do with ability to retain governmental power via familial reigns.
      </p>
      <p>
       THe fact they inbred was about property and familial control, and this seems to ALWAYS be the case in generational success and acquisition of wealth.

       Dont let your daughters take the family money outside 'the house [of].'

       Sons, to right up until the time of universities and public schooling, had sons maintaining the family wealth, as there was no other formal protections for that wealth and property.

       The Middle East has uniquely high rates of cousin marriage among the world's regions. Certain Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia, have rates of marriage to first or second cousins that may exceed 70%.[1]

The BBC’s research also discovered that while British Pakistanis accounted for just 3.4% of all births in Britain, they accounted for 30% of all British children with recessive disorders and a higher rate of infant mortality.

       I think we'd have to see some stats about that 70% number in order for it to be believable. And 30% of ALL UK defects are from Pakistanis? That's pretty hard to swallow too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever practices they have in Pakistan, it's clearly working out OK for them up to this point and who are we to try and change cultures "for their own good." That has traditionally not be very positive. There's a fine line between legitimate concern and eugenics.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if it's actually as you say in the UK with immigrants, then I can understand the concern. I'd think the public health system would be on top of it from a cost control perspective.

       Touché good sir. It's an incredible statistic that sounds unmanageable by the public system in the long term. I hate the idea of mandatory DNA tests, but some intense education programs at the minimum seem in order.

       In the UK there are certain areas that have a huge Indian/Pakistan settling, the children born in to these families have so many disabilities (because of inter breeding), the local governments, schools and NHS literally cannot cope with the huge number of kids and adults that need support.

       I wouldn't be surprised given how hard my relatives try pushing it when I visit India. It's definitely common and accepted and in remote areas where there's not much choice they probably do it a lot.

       1st cousin marriage is distant enough to be safe the first time around since only 12.5% DNA is shared but it's not a good idea to keep doing it after that.
