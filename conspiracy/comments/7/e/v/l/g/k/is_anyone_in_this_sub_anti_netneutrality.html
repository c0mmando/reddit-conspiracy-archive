       I know people in this sub usually have "unique" views of the world - and that's not a bad thing. However my question is: does anyone in this sub actually think getting rid of net neutrality will be good?
      </p>
      <p>
       I see the front page of reddit all PRO net neutrality so it would be interesting to see what you guys think!

       There's quite a few, it's largely just T_D lemmings that literally can't put themselves opposite Trump on any issue, so they crowdsource and reverse-engineer rationales and counter arguments to meet their need to back daddy.

       If anything at all turned me against net neutrality it was the blatant spam and shilling that flooded Reddit today. I admit I didn't  know much about net neutrality at all prior to today, but just the fact that /all was so forceful in pushing for it today raised major red flags in my mind. No subtlety at all.

       No it dont? 
Nd net neutrality isnt only in United States. That wiki article you linked, if you had bothered to actually read it, you can see that net beutrality have been a subject of discussion and in some cases implemented, but it wasnt law untill 2015.

       Holy shit, they deleted it. Guess it went to strong against the narrative. It basically said what I am saying, net neutrality has been an issue and debated for more than a decade. Did
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       read the wiki? "Between 2005 and 2012, five attempts to pass bills in Congress containing net neutrality provisions failed. Each sought to prohibit Internet service providers from using various variable pricing models based upon the user's Quality of Service level, described as tiered service in the industry and as price discrimination by some economists." Sound familiar?

       I think if it comes down to it as to who is here to do what, you might be unpleasantly surprised as to who has more support from the people here, so maybe you might want to be really sure before you start down that road, hombre.

       Btw it's obvious you're from tmor. You belittle every conspiracy theory. And have no opinions on any of your own. Really sad that you have nothing better to do than to talk down to people you think you're better than.

       Not "good shit". Real shit. Things that are actually happening.

      <p>
       Things like the fact that Donald Trump seems to be compromised by Russia.

      <p>
       Things like the fact that the Alt-Right movement seems to have been hijacked by the FSB.
      </p>

       Things like the fact that the flooding of this sub with anti Net Neutrality posts over the last couple weeks seems to be part of this, probably being run as a joint venture of Cambridge Analytica and the FSB.

       Real Shit.

       Lol. Yeah if that's what you consider good shit and real conspiracy material your definitely tmor. Those are so entry level.

      <p>
       The Trump Russia connection? You're looking for mainstream media. Not conspiracy. You know the alt right is a fake term? And who is behind the FSB? Again some very low level conspiracies. What's a real conspiracy you prescribe to? You wouldn't be in a conspiracy forum unless you had a few.

       I think Oswald was a CIA Agent tasked with infiltrating Cuban and Russian communist groups, in order to create the appearance that he was a communist agent, in order to set him up as a patsy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that Woody Harrelson's father was one of the real shooters, and I am leaning towards thinking J. D. Tippit, (Dallas police officer, and John Birch Society member) was killed by Oswald in self defense as he was trying to kill Oswald under the cover of arresting him in order to stop him from being able to talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think when the whole truth comes out, there will be a statue of Oswald as a hero who tried to warn the FBI of the assassination plot.

       You can't dig yourself out of what you said. The way you said it clearly showed that you think you're better than people who post what you consider stupid. If you're here to mock people you are from tmor. It's that simple. And you wouldn't all of a sudden try to be nice if that wasn't the case. Not such a smart guy after all.

       I am all for net neutrality, the main argue I see against it is that the government shouldn’t have a hand in the internet but no matter what they will always have a hand in the internet. I however would prefer Comcast to not fuck my asshole any harder which is basically what getting rid of net neutrality will do. I have worked for Comcast and they are the second most evil company I have worked for (Walmart being the first)

       The slower connection here in the U.S. costs about $45.50 per month on average, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In South Korea, the much-faster hookup costs $17 per month less. An average broadband bill there runs about $28.50. A note to add to that is that they have the fastest internet in the world and that is said from many sources. Yes South Korea has net neutrality. : )

       I don’t know everything lol! I am trying to keep up. I believe that is how it works but it’s not just that it loads faster, I have heard loading times for sites taking as long as 5 minutes. Would you wait 5 minutes to read an obscure news article? Or wait five minutes for a page to load for a small online business when you could go to amazon and get it in two seconds? Also it allows cable companies to block certain things and to look at exactly what you’re doing (if they don’t already)

       I did a bit of research on a Portugal sub and they were basically saying it's greatly over exaggerated (mainly) not that bad because the apps shown have unlimited access - similar (I guess) to how a tv plan might have access to certain channels.

       However they still said you can access regular websites too, just their internet was not "the best" prior.

       I really don't think it'll negatively impact consumers. I mean why would they dial back quality in order to make a profit. I know you're probably thinking "of course they would" but look at nvidia with graphics cards. Imagine if they were to dial down on improvements only to release more graphics cards down the line.

       Anything can be exploited, and almost always is. I think a lot of people are unsure what it is and probably did jump on the bandwagon. I am also sure a lot of people read about it and learned why it is a good thing and then supported it. I see the reason against it which is people wanting a free market, but the problem is in America there are essentially three giants and they will use it to charge more and make it harder for people to get what they need. They will line the pockets of the rich and make it harder to access less popular sites. Most people in America have one choice for a provider because not all providers service areas.

       I am not going to force anyone to think my way. I’m glad you did research that’s important ! Most people don’t. I just having worked for Comcast know what they already get away with and taking away another regulation will only allow them to get away with more. They charge people illegally all the time, and they add things they aren’t authorized by consumers to add. They slow down connection to people who don’t bundle internet and cable. Along with numerous other things.
