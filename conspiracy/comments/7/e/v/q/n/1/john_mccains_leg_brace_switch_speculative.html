       He may have a sealed indictment against him. That means he has had charges laid against him but he cannot say a word about it to anyone or he will face serious charges on top of the existing charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe he's wearing the boot to hide a gps tracker. So he gets his photo out there with it on his right leg. 2 weeks later he releases a photo with it on his left leg.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's managed to let people know what's going on without saying a word about it. He's sent out an unmistakable signal to his fellow conspirators.

       This is plausible and likely. We also gotta rule out natural possibilities, which there seem to be none, because what reason would there be for someone to switch casts on legs? Doesn't make sense, which makes this more plausible, or at least the fact that he's trying to hide something.

       I don't think old, sick US senators are a flight risk. And they'd unseal the case before giving him a monitor anyway--he'd be past the arraignment phase. And if they did give him a monitor, he could just accidentally flash it in a photo rather than playing boot games.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything is possible, but I haven't seen any good reason at all to believe he has a monitor or that the boot is intended to hide one.

       Yes. If he's got issues on both feet, like bone spurs, they'd do one foot and then the other to preserve his mobility.

       I have no idea what happened. I know that no judge in the country is going to find that a US senator is a flight risk, that even if they did there's no point in putting a cuff on the guy them letting him fly all over the country, and that if they did it would be front page news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider, for example, that even Manafort didn't get a cuff--and he's got explicit ties to a foreign regime. And it's not a sealed indictment, a cuff would only be applied following the arraignment/custodial hearing, by which time cases are invariably unsealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea what's going on with his feet. I know that the GPS cuff theory is about as serious as speculating that he's turning into a robot and those are his robot feet.

        THIS IS YOUR THEORY!

       I agree it's ridiculous, but it's yours! You're suggesting that 81-year-old John McCain recovered from his achilles surgery
       <em>
        that took place TWO WEEKS AGO
       </em>
       and then swapped his boot to the other foot either because he's a cyborg or he has super-human healing powers while simultaneously snapping a new tendon twice a month.
       <strong>
        This
       </strong>
       is the explanation you are using to discredit the hypothesis that maybe he's using the boot to either hide something, or communicate something cryptically to the audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're being obtuse for the sake of being a contrarian when you probably think you're some skeptic savant. Come up with something better, clown.

       This  is the most reasonable suggestion I have read, but it is curious that they stated he had an Achilles tear on the right , if it was serious enough for a boot I wouldn't think it would be healed sufficiently to be transferring weight to it by put the opposite foot in a boot.
       <br/>
       I also think there are a lot of easier ways to cover an ankle monitor.

       First off, the pic isn't flipped, unless McCain himself flipped it before posting on his Twitter account.

       My scenario would be he was forced to go in to get asked more questions, maybe change out the battery on the anklet.   Trump orders someone to switch it to his other leg just to see what he'd do.  lol

       A brace for foot drop is much smaller and fits inside your shoe. Neurological issues from his brain surgery would not change legs.  The other thing I have seen people say is he needs it because of over use on the other foot. That is not a logical thing. A boot does tend to increase hip or back pain but would not cause and injury to the other foot. Boots are heavy and awkward and I find the swap a leg very odd.

       Maybe. If it was a tear yes but surgery usually requires a cast. I haven't worked in several years but the protocols should be the same. While I find the tracking device theory questionable the boot changing sides is very strange.  When you wear a boot it changes your center of gravity and causes stress on other parts of the body but not the opposite foot. You can put two different type shoes on an get an idea.  It is very odd.

       Sealed indictment doesn't mean secret trial and outcome. Most of the time they are just used until a person is first brought in but as far as I know at that point they need to be charged in open court. You don't get a grand jury or other indictment, even a sealed one and then go past a bunch of levels of the criminal process in secret. That's not the point of the grand jury, even a federal grand jury or sealed indictments in the first place. Grand Jury doesn't mean secret court, all it does is hear one side (prosecution) and agree if there is ground for charges or not in the case. They don't do the rest of the legal /wave hand/ stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really do fear a lot of you don't understand how the US System of justice works. Due process and how/why/what a grand jury is etc. I'm not even sure if legally a person can have a Sealed indictment against themselves that prevents them from talking about themselves or the charges with others. That sounds like it would run into all sort of issues with due process and the bill of rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there is anyway to legally charge McCain or anyone not a minor to the point of them being under some sort of technical arrest/monitoring etc without open court proceedings.

       except you seem to over look that an ankle monitor/house arrest etc is not part of the indictment process. They don't plan to charge a person, seal the charges, not charge that person in open court (where it needs to be done) and then throw that person in jail/ankle monitor/house arrest anyways. All while saying, in pretty much direct violation of a bunch of bill of rights issues that the person can't say anything about their now secret incarceration of some nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       if that was something that was even an option we would not even need the patriot act. Just charge a person by way of sealed indictment in secret court and lock them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're looking at steps A, B and C and acting like A covers B and C too. Even when B and C are totally different process.

       because he would have to be charged first in order to have a condition on his release, other wise what is he being released from in the first place? I'm pretty sure those charges would have to happen in open court. The system doesn't let law enforcement say they will charge/plan to charge later while still punishing you now. It's why there is such a rabble rabble over the indefinite detention side the patriot act or whatever bill number/title that is going by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The feds can do all sort of sneaky crap with secret warrants in a close court for searches/wiretapes etc but that's a different system too. It's why we see high profile cases, even murder cases, with prime suspects still free as the case is worked. I know that seems crappy when it's clearly a scum bag but those limits are in place to protect everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       The funny thing I'm willing to bet anytime there are rumors of this nature some poor intern for a media network is tasked with going to the court house and doing a record search just to make sure. On that topic I'm still annoyed Sacramento's (my home town) court system took their free online record checking system off line. You either have to pay for the info or go down there and use their little kiosk system. It's BS, the process should be more transparent than that, IMO.

       An indictment is a formal accusation of a felony, issued by a grand jury based upon a proposed charge, witnesses' testimony and other evidence presented by the public prosecutor (District Attorney). It is the grand jury's determination that there is enough evidence that the defendant committed the crime to justify having a trial voted by a grand jury. In order to issue an indictment, the grand jury doesn't make a determination of guilt, but only the probability that a crime was committed, that the accused person did it and that he/she should be tried. District Attorneys do not present a full case to the grand jury, but often only introduce key facts sufficient to show the probability that the accused committed a crime.

       A grand jury indictments don't just take effect at the time the grand jury comes back with a verdict. Those charges still need to be filed in a court of law for any sort of punitive/legal process to officially start. Then someone might be "released" from whatever process is put in motion by the court case being filed against them. 
As I keep saying, law enforcement can't charge someone, not bring those charges to court in some way and still just hold a suspect or require them to wear say a tracking band for a chunk of time. That's the entire point of having arraignments and preliminary hearings, almost all of those happen in open court. That's also when a judge will put restrictions on a suspect. Law enforcement doesn't get to to do that side of it. At this point I'm sure if you are just trolling me or stuck in a loop being my explanations suck.

       Check out what went down with Manafort... he went before the court and the appearance was sealed and not released publically for 3 months. Many commentators on both sides think it was because he agreed to wear a wire and did during that time period.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that people can go all the way through the court and it not be released publically until it is unsealed... yes, court proceedings can be sealed also including outcomes, deals cut and conditions of release, etc.

       I thought Manafort time between federal indictment and his first court date was less than a week, not 3 months. He was under investigations before that but being a rich powerful dude I just figured he was zero help and lawyer'ed up.
      </p>

       Most of the time when court stuff is sealed it for high risk issues. Like witness could be killed or whatever. I'm not sure old guy with cancer and a current US Senator falls into that range. Yet it's fun to speculate of course.

       Between the time he appeared in court and it was revealed he appeared in court and what happened was 3 months. If stuff is "classified" and could comprise an ongoing investigation like this stuff likely does. They can seal everything for a very long time or forever if they make it a "states secrets" thing.

       That being said, I can’t get behind this. I think he’s an old dying person who has old dying person injuries, and that’s it. I’ve known lots of old dying people, and tons of weird medical shit happens to them that we wouldn’t even think of.

       You can hide an ankle monitoring system with, oh, I dunno, pants, or socks, or any combination there-of. I haven’t seen an ankle monitor in person since the early 2000’s, but even they they were hidden by pants - easily, I might add.

       He's a globalist piece of shit. His Viet cong handlers called him the songbird. He sang. And 3 minths before that he caused the Forrestal ship fire that killed over a hundred sailors by wet starting his airplane. Look it up. Then he fought for years against looking for pows left in Vietnam. Then he's been behind selling all kinds of arms to sketchy people aroind the world.

       Look it up. McCain is a piece of shit.

       If he were publicly charged we'd know his crimes wouldn't we?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if you've noticed, but we don't know what he's charged with, or even if he has been charged with anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your question is what the discussion is about. And until the sealed indictments are unsealed it is all speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But..... he is a piece of shit.... and he was running a private foundation with very questionable donors, very similar to the Clinton Foundation. .....And he's a high ranking and powerful Senator, with the very present possibility of him being tempted with illegal and lucrative "offers". Who knows what he's been up to. He was involved in the Uranium One debacle.
      </p>
      <p>
       We will see what crimes, if any, he's charged with in due time.

       The thing is that some of us have been following these events for a long time and have look at info from many many sources over a long period of time. We know who the actors are and we know their histories. We know lots of shit that we can't just link to and say "there it all is".
      </p>
      <p>
       That's one area where it is difficult to just point to sources and say "there it all is". So, no, we're not going to educate you there. You need to do your own due diligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there are other simple facts that are easily searched for online. I'm not going to waste my time if you don't have the desire to educate yourself on such simple and well known facts. Much of it is an internet search away. if you can't be bothered then fuck you.

       Politifact is a globalist apologist rag. McCain is a globalist.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the middle of multiple massive 500 lb bombs, and other armaments, going off and exploding on the deck of the Forrestal, with flames consuming a quarter of the deck space, guys still risking their lives to put out the flames, with dozens dead and dozens more gravely injured, they started evacuating the injured....
      </p>
      <p>
       ...but the first guy on the evac helicopter was McCain. Uninjured. That is a known fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was it top priority to remove him first?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because he caused it. He had earned the nickname "Wetstart Johnny" by his colleagues. His juvenile act of wetstarting his plane cooked off and fired off a missile from the plane behind him which started the conflagration. he was the son and grandson of admirals. They covered it up and saved his ass. But from then on, the Navy and the Pentagon has owned his ass. That's why he's in the position he's in. To further the goals of the military industrial complex.

       The background of the situation is not made up. He is a piece of shit. He has a private foundation just like the crooked Clinton foundation. He is the tool of the military industrial complex. He is a globalist. he is a crooked house of cards ready to come down. He is part of the deep state.

      <p>
       There are more than 1800 sealed indictments right now. Very likely one of them is for him.

       Now look at the title of my original post:

       "John McCain's leg brace switch speculative explanation"
      </p>
      <p>
       "speculative explanation".
      </p>
      <p>
       "speculative".
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes the words give it away.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were unable to see what was being speculated about versus what is fact, the problem lies with you.

       Why would they need to use an ankle monitor on an incredibly old, very famous, dying Senator...just because he'd supposedly been indicted?
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems to be an instance where someone had an idea -- ankle braces could hide ankle monitors! -- and now a whole "reality" is forming around the idea without an critical thought, just because it seemed like a "clever" idea at first.

       except you seem to over look that an ankle monitor/house arrest etc is not part of the indictment process. They don't plan to charge a person, seal the charges, not charge that person in open court (where it needs to be done) and then throw that person in jail/ankle monitor/house arrest anyways. All while saying, in pretty much direct violation of a bunch of bill of rights issues that the person can't say anything about their now secret incarceration of some nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       if that was something that was even an option we would not even need the patriot act. Just charge a person by way of sealed indictment in secret court and lock them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're looking at steps A, B and C and acting like A covers B and C too. Even when B and C are totally different process.
