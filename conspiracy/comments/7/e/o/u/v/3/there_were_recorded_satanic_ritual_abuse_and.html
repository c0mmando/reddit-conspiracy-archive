        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The cult in question is the cult of Bacchus. Its members where called &quot;Bacchians&quot;, the equivalent of today&#39;s satanists. This event occured in the 2nd Century BC and is known as the &quot;Bacchanalian Conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt from Book 39 of Livy&#39;s history:</p>

<p><em>&quot;From the time that the rites were performed in common,60 men mingling with women and the freedom of darkness added, no form of crime, no sort of wrongdoing, was left untried. There were more lustful practices among men with one another than among women. If any of them were disinclined to endure abuse or reluctant to commit crime, they were sacrificed as victims. [11] To consider nothing wrong, she continued, was the highest form of religious devotion among them. Men, as if insane, with fanatical tossings of their bodies, would utter prophecies. [12] Matrons in the dress of Bacchantes, with dishevelled hair and carrying blazing torches, would run down to the Tiber, and plunging their torches in the water (because they contained live sulphur mixed with calcium) would bring them out still burning.61 [13] Men were alleged to have been carried off by the gods who had been bound to a machine and borne away out of sight to hidden caves: they were those who had refused either to conspire or to join in the crimes or to suffer abuse. [14] Their number, she said, was very great, almost constituting a second state; among them were certain men and women of high rank. Within the last two years it had been ordained that no one beyond the age of twenty years should be initiated: boys of such age were sought for as admitted both vice and corruption.&quot;</em></p>

If you think it is impossible for not only these accounts but the many others of ritual torture to ever exist or continue to then I hope you can learn to process inconvenient possibilities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, we used to disembowel bodies and eat human hearts on top of pyramids on massive industrial scales, 80,000 humans in the span of 3 days. To say ritual torture and sacrifice is not real, is completely FALSE and makes you complicit in the crimes committed. </p>
