       Sorry if I sound like newbie; it is because I am.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently a co-worker and I were debating what we should get for lunch on our break. We decided we wanted to get food from a certain fast food chain. Within 2 minutes of that conversation, I got a YouTube ad for said fast food chain, and my coworker got a few banner ads for the chain as well. The weird part is that we both never had any search history relating to the food chain. It was spooky to the both of us.

       I had a buddy recently become woke to WTC7.  I told him welcome to the club, where have you been?  A few weeks later I apologized to him for being dismissive because he was just waking up.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said not at all, he just realized all the underhanded shit our gov't had been doing since Trump got into office.  That's what allowed him to explore things like 9\11 and such.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realized I had to be delicate with those just waking up.  I think I over compensated because I've been labeled crazy for so many years.

       pressure cookers can be used for certain chemical reactions and to build bombs. i think it isn't related to food in this case. :)
      </p>
      <p>
       in this context it is a
       <em>
        somewhat
       </em>
       legit phrase to monitor, tbh... it's just...
       <em>
        { sigh }

       there are so much more words/phrases being monitored, which make zero sense except "covering ones trails"...

       Yup. Happened to me recently - we were talking about how storage places were popping up everywhere as we drove by one. Went onto a website on my phone about 5 minutes later and saw an ad for a storage company. No history of it (have no need for one either!!) Was freaky.

       I noticed this a damn long time ago. I find at the recently the creepiest thing is if I'm watching a catch up channel on my computer (no mic on my computer but it makes you sign into your google/fb) the ads on that show will be directly linked to what I'd been talking about days before or that day. It's fucking insane.

       I had an ad literally shout my IRL name!!! It was for fcking yogurt! Obviously doesn't listen when i talk about how I don't eat dairy!

       Story time... Buying vape stuff online and the site used a 3rd-party payment processor that required phone number confirmation (they send a text, and you confirm by responding with a code from the website).
      </p>
      <p>
       As I texted the confirmation code my wife came into the room and yelled our son's name (I'll call him Ralph here).
      </p>
      <p>
       The payment processor immediately texted back "Thanks, Ralph", though it already had my name (which is nothing even close to the kid's).
      </p>
      <p>
       No way I can believe thier automated system did that without phone mic input, it was my only time using the site and our son has never bought anything online.

       I've posted more details on an older post, but here's the short version: 1) used the word "fags" in lieu of "cigarettes" and an ad popped up for FAGS on my fiancÃ©es phone about 20 minutes later on Instagram. 2) her dog's name (which I wont type now so I can for sure say we've never typed it) popped up in an Instagram ad, she has 3 dogs and somehow they picked up on the name of this one

       Today I was listening to a podcast (on iphone) with a female guest, and when I went to research her on the pc her name came up after the 1st letter of her name. Geez.

       Ok. This for reals felt like some magic but...
      </p>
      <p>
       Yesterday while visiting my older bros apt who loves to cook and has his fridge legit stocked with all sorts of awesome.. I noticed after getting all the thanksgiving food his fridge is waayyy too tiny and lacks proper shelving... so I happened to say...
      </p>
      <p>
       Hey wouldn't it be awesome to get a new fridge that could keep up with your cooking lifestyle?
      </p>
      <p>
       We even went so far as to entertain the idea by looking up fridges on Best Buy. I even thought about helping him buy one for him and just chatted conversationally about all the epic models, colors and options...
      </p>
      <p>
       And we eventually decided a nice idea would be to take everything out of his fridge, clean it nicely and organize it all so the Thanksgiving food containers could all fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       All items removed and placed on countertops. Outdated stuff tossed in trash. Drawers and shelves out. Total spray down and wiped it super clean. As soon as I am ready to start putting items back in...there is a knock at the door...
      </p>
      <p>
       Brand new larger sized fridge is ready to install ...nothing super fancy but in comparison its like a dream come true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like Im either psychic or magic because my brother and I were completely shocked by the timing of it all. Or someone was listening as the Universe seems to listen and reward me but the turnaround on this was just like...bam!
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes I can think of a million examples of my phone listening and seeing it in my web search history. I once discovered an entire page devoted to my "voice searches" and lots of them are when I dont even activate the Hey Google option and are total random strings of chatting. Soooo... yup.
      </p>
      <p>
       And on a random note sometimes it feels like glitch in the matrix. The Wheel of Fortune game will always have 1 puzzle per day that is ridiculously spot on with something from my day. Its to the point where I will screen shot the solved puzzle and send to my fiance like...seriously? Wtf. It is truly too detailed and we laugh at it but once it happened when my phone was at home the entire day (accidently) and that totally creeped me out because I realized all my email accounts are on my work computer and his device so basically whatever apps youre logged into are listening too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too much!
