    <div class="md"><p>Ive had a weird issue with my hearing and never had a good way to describe I️t, but this might be completely what I’m experiencing too. When you say television frequencies, do you mean that kinda high pitched “sound” that you hear when a television is turned on and left on? Like if you walked into a room you would know I️t was on even if the screen was blank? Or do you mean static? </p>

<p>When it happens to me it’s almost a feeling as well as a sound. I could be in a completely silent room, listening to nothing, but i can feel my normal hearing basically shift. The “silence” i heard before becomes even more muted and distant. Almost as if you were outside, in silence, then dunked your head underwater and things become even more quiet. I feel that shift in sound and then that high pitched but also very mute noise strengthens and takes hold until sooner or later my hearing just clicks back to normal. I have had other symptoms related to odd things but never thought of them as connected to this before. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I lived about a mile from a fracking site and was having trouble sleeping at night. I eventually distinguish the variable deep bass sound of the fracking pumps at work. I had some trance music I played that allowed me to sleep. Where I live now there is a train track and I can hear the train engine as it climbs the grade to the power plant.  The hours between 2 and 4 am are the most disturbing. A fan or an air conditioner provides enough white noise to cover most nights. I realize these sounds are not yours but you may try to identify possible sources and find a way to cover those noises with some that you control.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The ringing, for me, started about 6 or 7 years ago.  In the time since it started, the number synchronicity has been daily.  11:11, 9:11, 12:34, 2:22, 4:44, 5:55.  </p>

<p>I did notice when I smoke pot that I can focus on the ringing much better.  It’s not so much in my ears but more in my head.  I can even isolate 3 or 4 different tones that feel like they are going off in different parts of my head (front, back and right and left side).  Some are solid tones.  Others oscillate.  They have a repeating pattern.  They never stop.</p>

<p>I live in Calgary so, this past summer, I drove out into the mountains down a seasonal road.  I was about 80 KM’s from anything.  There was no cell reception or man-made structures anywhere.  It is the only time that there was no ringing.  It was a surprising relief to not hear/feel them.  I did this as an experiment.  What led me to do this was that I felt that it was all the electronics that we use today.  Wifi, cell phones, Bluetooth, etc.</p>

<p>A friend of mine had an interesting theory.  I’m 48 and have some old school metal fillings in my teeth.  He felt that since metal resonates to various frequencies (like an antenna), the fillings may be picking up the frequency signals from all the tech we live with.</p>

<p>I tend to lean in the direction that technology is causing it but I have no idea why the number synchronicity started happening at roughly the same time.  Would really like to know what causes it.  Would also like to hear from anyone else who has experienced this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>if you are hearing a noise coming from the tv that is actually the sound of a capacitor leaking. Check other electronics in you house for this occurance maybe. Fridges microwaves stereos even smoke detectors can also have leaky capacitors. If you open the device they are easy to find because they will be bulged up and bloated. You can desolder and replace them in most cases to eliminate the sound.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its fine capacitors are little components that hold voltage in a circuit , they are mass produced and often times go shitty. somewhere on the motherboard one of the caps is leaking. It isnt really a problem, eventually it could cause some issues but by then your laptop will be outdated enough that you will probably have replaced it. When the &quot;caps&quot; fail they get shitty and leak, it makes a sound that is what your hearing . Find a small local pc repair shop and the nerdlingers there should be able to fix it for you relatively cheap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I experienced something exactly like this! I am also in Canada!</p>

<p>It happened after I did some work in the garage, grinding and cutting out old rusty metal floorboards without hearing protection.</p>

<p>My understanding is that the noise I was hearing, is the cells that register the particular frequency where I received damage, are dying.</p>

<p>It sounds louder at night simply because there&#39;s less background noise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting that I&#39;ve kind of had the reverse of this happen to me. I used to have Tinnitus all the time (sounded like a speaker crackling out at time then high pitched tones and attributed it to too many Rock shows. I went to an Otolaryncologist who stuck a camera up my nasal cavity that felt like it was pushing on my brain only to tell me he couldn&#39;t find anything wrong. Had problems as a kid with ear infections - not sure if related. Still have problems to this day with swimmers ear. However, Tinnitus has completely disappeared as of a year or so ago. Not sure what caused it to go away.</p>
