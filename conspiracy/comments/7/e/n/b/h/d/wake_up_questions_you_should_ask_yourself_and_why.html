<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/hdh0EEf.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/hdh0EEf.jpg</a></p>

<p><strong>Deprogram yourself by asking these questions:</strong> (I was going to provide more detail, but it would make the post way too damn long)</p>

<p><strong>How many points on the spectrum are there?</strong>
(If your answer is two, you&#39;re wrong. It&#39;s.... -- drum roll -- a spectrum. Many shades of authoritarian and libertarian versions of left and right with massive variation in between in policies.)</p>

<p><strong>Do all leftists and all rightists think alike?</strong>
(No, they are not hive minded robots -- leftist is literally just anyone on the left HALF OF THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM.
Fascists and moderate capitalists are both rightists....see what I mean? It&#39;s pointless using it to describe someone&#39;s leanings, extremely vague, divisive.
Are all left wingers vegans and all right wingers monster truck fans??? Lol come on)</p>

<p><strong>Who taught you what left wing, centrist, right wing, moderate, extreme, etc. means (who taught you your political &quot;knowledge&quot;)?</strong>
(Corporate media/TV? I&#39;m shocked I tell you.)</p>

<p><strong>Who controls the U.S. MSM?</strong>
(6 Corporations.)</p>

<p><strong>Are corporations &quot;leftist&quot;?</strong>
(Is the penny starting to drop yet? :O Obviously they&#39;re not left wing. They&#39;re EXTREME right wing. $$$ justifying economic slavery for those psychopaths)</p>

<p><strong>Does left wing = &quot;SJW&quot;?</strong>
(No, just like right wing does not equal racist.)</p>

<p><strong>Who pushes &quot;SJW&quot; propaganda?</strong>
(Not real well informed left wingers, but lying corporate MSM, Democrat party which is not left wing, brainwashed people parroting propaganda, etc. 
The establishment pushes this for manipulative reasons, divide and conquer, 
muddying the waters and making people jump to idiotic conclusions on what left wing really means, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>Does being in between Democrat and Republican, make you a &quot;moderate&quot; as MSM claims?</strong>
(No, being in between two extremes is STILL EXT<strong>REEEEEE</strong>ME. If you say you&#39;re part way between a sociopath and psychopath, you&#39;re not a damn moderate!!!)
Does being in between Pepsi and Coca Cola, make you balanced? Same unhealthy soda.</p>

<p><strong>Who is the far right?</strong>
(Corporate media pretends far right just means authoritarian.....ironically it actually just means
extreme right economics....something the DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN PARTIES BOTH PUSH. They&#39;re deflecting. &quot;We&#39;re not far right, THOSE NAZIS ARE FAR RIGHT!!!&quot; See?
Far right is basically corporate/elite economics. Hitler wasn&#39;t that right wing, but he was very authoritarian.)</p>

<p><strong>Does preferring natural gender roles, family values, Christianity, etc. make you a &quot;conservative&quot;?</strong>
(No. These are propaganda talking points. Like Gandhi, Jesus himself was a libertarian socialist, i.e. non authoritarian socialist. He cared about the poor
and drove out the money lenders/banksters from the temple and was anti-establishment. Compare that to
Republican politicians, who like Democrat politicians, shit on the poor and do the bidding of corporations, wallstreet and elite central bankers.
Them helping corporations does NOT help your little business. Pro- or anti-business are silly oversimplistic terms.
A true Christian cares more about helping others than $$$$ business opportunities. Although you can have a balance but
neither party is balanced, Ron Paul/Libertarian party isn&#39;t moderate either. All extremists.)</p>

<p><strong>What is &quot;liberal&quot;?</strong>
(Supposed to mean &quot;pro-liberty&quot; BUT FOR WHO? PEOPLE freedom/liberty or CORPORATE freedom/NEOliberalism?
Hence &quot;liberal&quot; itself is a vague ass term. I don&#39;t use it. It doesn&#39;t clarify what type of liberty.)</p>

<p><strong>What is &quot;conservative&quot;?</strong>
(Rebranding of NEOliberal. Conserving a low waged population = economic slavery. Extreme deregulation of the market = increasing corporate control.
Low taxes for the super rich = accumulation of wealth at the hands of a few at the expense of everyone else: trickle down Reaganomics is a proven SCAM.
Wealth trickled from us UP to the elites, NOT from the elites down to us.
Pretending the national debt will go down if you remove social programs = lying scum (people go into MORE debt without assistance).
It&#39;s the same bullshit. Republicans who call themselves conservatives, Ayn Rand sociopaths, doesn&#39;t matter, different label, virtually the same shit. They&#39;re all corporate NEOliberals.</p>

<p>Liberal vs conservative is a scam. Don&#39;t get emotional, this is not part of <strong>your identity</strong>. It&#39;s just politics. Remove yourself from the equation.
MILLIONS of Americans have been duped into this Dem vs Repub / Lib vs Con false paradigm corporate narrative. We need to start waking people up.
Remember when most right wingers thought left wingers were nuts when they said &quot;corporations are evil&quot; ? The tides are changing.
The truth will out. Unfortunately, there are still people who are so brainwashed to think left wing = SJW, I&#39;m so disappointed with the lack of critical thinking and logic with that.
Although some of these people might be paid shills.)</p>

<p><strong>What is liberal vs conservative?</strong>
(Corporate marketing. If you never heard of these terms, you wouldn&#39;t be so loyal to these corporate scam parties: 
&quot;I&#39;m a proud liberal/conservative&quot; is a sign of brainwashing and manipulates you into crawling back and picking Pepsi or Coca Cola, I mean Democrat or Republican....when both are almost
the same corporate crap, shitting on the people each time they come in power, just different shades and flavors of NEOliberalism deregulated corporate extremist economics and NEOconservativism warmonger foreign policy.)</p>

<p>LGBT rights? Good for LGBT people, I&#39;m happy for them (as long as no one pushes LGBT stuff on children, they&#39;re too young)
but the elite want us to forget about ECONOMIC ISSUES. That&#39;s what hurts the elites. Protests about &quot;DON&#39;T BE A BIGOT, YOU BIGOT&quot;
is not helpful at all. Protest against NEOliberalism, crony capitalism, and protest FOR nationalizing the FED, and then we will start winning.</p>

<p><strong>What is left vs right?</strong>
(Not rational thinking. Oversimplistic and fuel for divide and conquer. It&#39;s stupid like &quot;BIG GOV VS SMALL GOV&quot; or &quot;TAXES VS NO TAXES&quot;. Usually
the non-retarded option is a balance in between. Not always but easily most of the time. Center left for example, is more precise than
idiotically saying &quot;I&#39;m a leftist&quot; as if the vague phrase means anything beyond &quot;I&#39;m not right wing&quot; and nothing else. Democratic party is NOT left leaning.
It sprinkles left sounding stuff and throws a bone occasionally but overall almost completely NEOliberal like Repubs.
Republican party are NOT moderate right. They&#39;re extremist maniacs like Dems.)</p>

<p><strong>Do we have socialism or capitalism?</strong>
(Both are economic components most countries&#39; economies have, a mix of both. Mostly a shit ratio
but still a mix. Social security, social programs, roads, schools, etc. are generally socialistic in nature and aim to improve society for the majority
and without these, it would be a hellhole. But it&#39;s not quite black and white: Obamacare is technically a social program but it&#39;s not socialistic, it&#39;s crony capitalistic as big pharma and insurance
companies profit at our expense through crony contracts and bribing lobbyists. People who think Obama is a communist,
that&#39;s ridiculous, he&#39;s a crony capitalist NEOliberal and NEOconservative. As is Clinton and Bush. Just slightly different shades.
Same establishment model. Screwing the poor to benefit the ultra rich/powerful.)</p>

<p><strong>WHY SHOULD I PAY FOR YOUR SHIT?!</strong>
(Calm your ass. Turn off the caps lock. YOU are not paying
for someone else. WE ALL chip in proportionately, to help EVERYONE. Costs vastly go down.
I WORK and contribute to the economy and so do YOU. I pay TAXES, and so do you.
You are not superior to me or vice versa.
Neither of us are wealthy to be stuck up about &quot;paying for someone else&quot;,
our contributions are drops in the ocean. Let the egos deflate.
This propaganda is pushed by extreme capitalists
influencing poor people to vote against their interests.</p>

<p>And besides, millionaires would not be so without customers, workers and tax funded things like roads. We should both be getting value for our taxes.
What you see in Obamacare is crony capitalist corporate profiteering interference. Think of it like
intercepting taxes to generate profit. Very different to altruistic
non-profit or at least fairly regulated against unreasonably extreme profits driven socialized single payer universal healthcare which is more efficient than the U.S. Dem/Repub shit models of healthcare.
Canadian drug prices are cheaper than U.S. ones, for example. America is getting ripped off. Insurance isn&#39;t even necessary in single payer.)
A benevolant democratic gov is more trustoworthy than a full deregulated free market/corporate paradise playground of no rules.
Free market is extremist, while the balance between personal and economic freedom is important. FDR and Bernie were fairly balanced (social democracy/near centrism).</p>

<p>The main intention of this post
was to destroy the idiotic &quot;left wingers are all SJWs&quot;
bullshit that shills keep shitting out.
Divide and conquer is for idiots.
Real truth seekers unite.</p>

<p>Stop using the terms &quot;THE LEFT&quot;/&quot;THE RIGHT&quot;.
The MSM used these divide and conquer propaganda hive mind terms
during the Antifa VS NeoNazi psyop.
Two boxes do not represent the entire spectrum
and the major parties are BOTH EXTREME RIGHT, EXTREME AUTHORITARIAN.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it&#39;s a confusing mess.
A lot of Americans think liberal = left wing
but not necessarily. Even if it did,
it wouldn&#39;t stop the establishment going for extreme right
economics.
Not sure how the rest of the world views liberal/conservative terminology
but I guess they&#39;re not as brainwashed with the
&quot;you&#39;re either a liberal or conservative&quot; lie.</p>

<p>Look at France&#39;s election:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/4GBqQRg.png">https://i.imgur.com/4GBqQRg.png</a></p>

<p>An extreme right libertarian Rothschild banker shill (Macron)
VS zionist authoritarian Le Pen VS corporate near-fascist Fillon.
It&#39;s revolting the choice they gave.
The only decent ones there are Hamon and Melenchon.</p>

<p>Look how ridiculous Germany&#39;s election was:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/tyQLPQJ.png">https://i.imgur.com/tyQLPQJ.png</a></p>

<p>1 left wing, 2 moderate right.
The rest are establishment NEOliberals.</p>

<p>And people thought Merkel (CDU party) was left wing just
because of the immigration stuff?
This is how the establishment pulls the wool over peoples&#39; eyes.</p>

<p>The elites have used &quot;liberal&quot; in a way that sort of resembles Orwellian double speak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good on you mate. Yeah Bernie is probably a center left democratic socialist at heart but watered down his policies to near centrist social democracy to make a compromise.</p>

<p>Really weird thing, Corbyn&#39;s brother: Piers Corbyn,

and this website makes a reference to him and the electric universe theory.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.weatheraction.com/">http://www.weatheraction.com/</a></p>

<p>Piers&#39; twitter is also strange (in a cool kind of way)</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Piers_Corbyn">https://twitter.com/Piers_Corbyn</a> </p>

<p>I&#39;m seeing hashtags of wallstreet, EU, climate change, enslavement, globalist, etc.
I&#39;m under the impression Piers doesn&#39;t believe in CO2 accelerated climate change
or at least thinks there&#39;s a sneaky component like the carbon tax (which I agree
seems like a shady NWO type backdoor).</p>

<p>But of course either way, clean renewables are better than scarce pollutant
sources of energy.
I currently think the climate change stuff is probably accelerated by
(something) humanity has caused (HAARP weather manipulation?)
maybe not necessarily CO2 but who knows how clear cut it is.
I may have to do more research, I&#39;m intrigued lol.
He seems awake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lower as in less authoritarian?
Yeah the Clinton part of the graph gives her way too big of the benefit of the doubt. She likely would have flip flopped on a hell of a lot of
policies including TPP (which is basically a corporate takeover).
So I would say Clinton is a lot worse than shown in the graph.
(The Syria &quot;no fly zone&quot; policy alone should make her an authoritarian scumbag,
it would likely lead to WW3 or at least cause a scare we don&#39;t need.)</p>

<p>This graph shows Clinton&#39;s 2008 primary position, 2016 primary position
and 2016 position after Bernie was rigged out of the race (surprise, she started flip flopping lol)</p>

<p>Not sure how 2012 Obama was different to 2016 Obama
but he was almost as bad as Romney lol. Not really sure where Bush is
but he&#39;s clearly a monster like the rest.</p>

<p>NSA state surveillance for example is extremely authoritarian.
I&#39;m guessing one reason Obama is less authoritarian than Rubio
is perhaps the pro-choice vs no choice thing, basic social issues type of stuff.
But yeah the difference between modern Democrats and modern Republicans is usually negligible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lib and con is corporate marketing. (Definitions change depending on the agenda.
Liberal could mean PEOPLE liberty or CORPORATE economic liberty to screw everyone else.
Hence I don&#39;t use this false paradigm of lib vs con when both parties are extreme right and extreme authoritarian.)</p>

<p>Modern Dem and Repub are corporate brands.</p>

<p>Corporations control the government, my friend.
Some regulations are necessary for freedom
like not allowing big pharma to charge drug prices that give them 5000% profit margins at the expense of the poor and sick.
We&#39;re getting ripped off compared to say Canadian drug prices.</p>

<p>Obamacare is not a good example of government taking care/assisting you.
It&#39;s low value for our taxes.
It&#39;s crony capitalist. Corporate lobbyists bribe and maybe ghost write contracts 
that allow crony big pharma and insurance corporations a profitable system
where they can charge whatever the hell they like with no punishment.</p>

<p>Socialized single payer universal healthcare removes the insurance company middle men
costs (therefore healthcare is free at the point of use, and tax funded)
and ethics regulations against big pharma inflated price scams
as well as removing the incentive to treat the sick for money.
Governmental doctors get well paid secure job with no monetary conflict of interest.
Big pharma also would have no excuse to waste their budgets on
advertising (they spend WAAAAY too much on advertising, when they claim to need high profit margins
for drug development)
except for over the counter stuff.
So more budget is available for actual drug research.</p>

<p>The U.S. Dem/Repub healthcare systems are terrible (free market vs crony capitalist: both are extremely NEOliberal) compared to 1st world countries with single payer.
The UK for example had a very good system until
the pharma shills in government started privatizing
the single payer system (so it went from socialized single payer healthcare to partially privatized single payer)
which is inefficient but not as bad as the U.S. system.
But socialized single payer is better than both.</p>

<p>Even Trump admitted Australia&#39;s healthcare is better than the U.S.&#39;</p>

<p>Remember who the elites are, private extreme capitalist entities.
Corporations, wallstreet and elite central bankers.
These guys bribe their way into government.</p>

<p>But if we remove money from politics and actually
make the government more democratic,
we can ensure corporate bribery and cronyism dies
and then the government only has the people to answer to,
not greedy corrupt corporations.</p>

<p>Crony regulations vs no regulations is a scam of a choice
pushed by Dems, Repubs and Libertarian party shills.
The best option is fair regulation (only good protective regulations and none of the crony crap)
through a benevolent democratic government
held to account by the people, with no corporate conflicts of interest
controlling congress.
Right now, what congressmen do is stay on the phone for ages begging for corporate donations.
The FED should also be nationalized and the treasonous CIA dismantled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re a shill, please leave.
Otherwise, stop watching Fox News and other corporate media,
I believe Fox News invented &quot;90% TAX RATE!!&quot; bullshit against Bernie.</p>

<p>Bernie&#39;s tax plan which you could find on his website:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/grOU5BO.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/grOU5BO.jpg</a></p>

<p>The entire establishment and corporate media was shitting on Bernie. Please change your perspective.
Screw CNN, if you read my post,
you&#39;d realize I&#39;m against ALL CORPORATE MEDIA.
NO corporate media is moderate right, centrist or center left.
They&#39;re ALL extreme right, extreme authoritarian.
Hence wars for profit and other corporate propaganda.</p>

<p>Regulations are not automatically good or bad.
Crony regulations are bad, e.g. making
laws that help crony corporations at the expense of competing small/medium businesses for example.</p>

<p>But GOOD regulations include things like worker rights, min. wage, product quality and safety, worker safety, environmental protections, ethics, intellectual property, etc. etc.</p>

<p>See Hong Kong (slave wages, sweatshops, crap quality products) and Victorian England (no protections for children who went up chimneys to support their families, no weekend for workers, no minimum wage, etc.) examples of super deregulated near free market crap economics.</p>

<p>Fair market is not the same as free market.
Free market is a no rules corporate playground.
Fair market is a balance between good regulations helping to protect customers, workers and an even level playing field, protecting social programs, and economic freedom for small/medium businesses within ethical parameters.</p>

<p>Ron Paul wants super deregulation, he&#39;s an extremist who wants
to get rid of social programs. Hence I consider him a shill
in terms of his economic policies.</p>

<p>The graph was likely constructed back when Trump
was a wildcard but yes Trump is hella authoritarian like
most of the rest.
NSA state surveillance, death penalty (allowing your gov to execute you), warmonger foreign policy, threatening to remove healthcare, (I know Obamacare is crony capitalist shit but if you don&#39;t replace it with single payer, you&#39;re going to have a bad time)
the anti-net neutrality thing, etc. </p>

<p>The world is not black and white,
regulations/government is not automatically good or bad.
To think so, is pure ideological brainwashing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s not laughable.
Government can range from extremely authoritarian (e.g. Mussolini, Stalin, Hitler, Pinochet, etc.)
to extremely libertarian.</p>

<p>To believe corporations are the good guys is actually laughable.
Who controls the government?
Corporations to a high extent (bribed politicians).</p>

<p>Get money out of politics, nationalize the FED, end the CIA/deep state and we wouldn&#39;t have this problem.</p>

<p>To believe there has never been a decent government is ridiculous.
There likely hasn&#39;t been many paradises,
but obviously some governments are waaaaay more authoritarian than others and some are ok.</p>

<p>Victorian England: big business could do as they wished.
Children up chimneys to financially aid their families,
no weekend, no worker rights, no health and safety, etc.</p>

<p>Free market is corporate takeover.</p>

<p>State capitalism is state takeover (with the private beurocrats profiteering through the disguise of government officials).</p>

<p>The enemy has ALWAYS ALWAYS been
private psychopaths.
Normal people don&#39;t become psychopaths upon gaining
power in government (not automatically anyway).</p>

<p>CEOs as a group, has disproportionately more sociopaths than other careers. Do you want survival of the fittest, Darwinistic economics or do you want people to help each other by chipping in taxes to help pay for things everyone needs like healthcare and transport?</p>

<p>The puppet masters are corporations, wallstreet and elite central bankers. These psychopath scum infiltrate governments through bribery and blackmail.</p>

<p>If the corporations/mafia had 60% control of the government,
would you want to hand over FULL control of the market CONTROLLED by
the dominant mafia???
Of course you wouldn&#39;t.
100% mafia control vs 60% mafia control.
Both shit and backdoors.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want corrupt gov OR corrupt corporations in charge.
Hence BOTH free market and crony capitalist
systems are scams that help the elite at our expense.</p>

<p>We have to remove the corporate/mafia control
of the government.
That would then allow democratic LAW
to stop the psychopath mafia.</p>

<p>Government has many many types
as do regulations.
While huge powerful and corrupt corporations
dominate the markets. Remove all laws/rules/regulations
and you end up with a corporate takeover
like TPP.
There needs to a balanced set of regulations
and the removal of cronyism and conflicts of interest.
That would achieve the best of both worlds,
personal freedom and economic freedom,
while not resorting to stupid extremes
like extreme right economics or extreme authoritarianism for example.</p>

calling all left wingers &quot;SJWs&quot; is foolish, divisive and incorrect. :)
The more people know this stuff, the less brainwashed we will all be
and move towards a common goal.</p>

<p>Ideally we should campaign for getting money out of politics,
nationalizing the FED, ending the CIA, do something about corporate media propaganda,
replace crony capitalist Obamacare with socialized single payer universal healthcare.
Whatever order is most sensible.
Then when people realize legit single payer works better than Dem/Repub
healthcare, they can decide where to move from there.</p>
