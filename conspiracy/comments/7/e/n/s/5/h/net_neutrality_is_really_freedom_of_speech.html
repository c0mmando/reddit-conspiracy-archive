    <div class="md"><p>If you like net neutrality then you are misinformed or just plain wrong.</p>

<p>I used to install all the damn lines and fibers. This is really a turf war. There is no fucking priority genius. We all use the same fucking lines all the same goddamned time. You have no idea what the fuck you are talking about. The problem is the cheap fucks dont want to upgrade their old shitty lines from the 1900s but everyone uses more bandwidth. So you get slowdown. </p>

<p>Did you know that all cell towers everywhere are actually connected into the same exact grid as the internet. </p>

<p>With the explosion of cellphone use and streaming the infrastruture which is already old and outdated is failing. </p>

<p>You cannot flip a switch and give you tube or google more bandwidth. What YOU CAN DO is install a fiber optic line from their servers at their HQ into the existing grid and it will be faster by the way things work.</p>

<p>If they have money for that then great. Your service will still suck no matter what because we can only jam so much data down the 200 individual copper strands that feed your neighborhood from the &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;WEB&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;. </p>

<p>TLDR. You are wrong. You don&#39;t know how the internet actually works. AND Net Neutrality is very bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude it has nothing to do with the lines. They can throttle speeds from their end of things, I also used to pull cable, including fiber, and the fiber is just the medium the signal travels through. The speed is determined by the server. </p>

<p>I went into school to get into the digital side of network infrastructure, and the speed of your service depends on how fast they are letting people into their servers, NOT the actual speed of the signal in the wire. Right now, Net Neutrality keeps them from throttling anyone; they need to make sure that anyone who wants to access their servers can do so, at anytime, for more or less the same speeds. If neutrality goes, there won&#39;t be any rules about it at all. Someone like Comcast could do whatever they wanted to with the servers on their end. They could keep people out, slow down the rate at which people are allowed into the servers, and even control the rate at which those servers send data back to you by forcing you to use, or closing down different ports. </p>

<p>You&#39;re completely wrong dude </p>

    <div class="md"><p>your servers Central offices cant handle anymore bandwith.</p>

<p>The speed is directly determined by the path to the server. Every single node has an ip address. Every single bit of data is transmitted along miles and miles of old ass cable. It gets to the old ass comcast server and it goes where it goes from there. Comcast is just an endpoint server they dont really host content AKAMIA and companies like them host mirrors of data on the web to increase web speed by allowing you to access a mirror. Comcast just lets you in. Its open or closed. There is no throttling you are confused or misinformed.</p>

<p>And for the record, we just agreed. Comcast just lets you in. That&#39;s exactly what I said. They have no control over the speed in the wire, just how quickly the queue is allowed access. And getting rid of net neutrality gives them full power to choose who does or doesn&#39;t get in, rather than making it law that everyone needs equal access </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just curious because of your name.</p>

<p>Dude because it is. The signal in the wire is just an electric signal that needs to be translated by the server, or by your computer. The wire does nothing but transmit the signal to the server or computer. Then, the data selects a port to access the server through. I might be wrong, been a while, but for example the https: in front of your web address means you&#39;re currently using port 443, which is an encrypted port. There is programming in the servers to manage all of this date and make sure it goes to the right place, gets translated the right way, then gets set back. </p>

<p>You can, and these companies do want to, put instructions into a server. As one example, you can close down ports, maybe leave only like two open. This would slow speeds because it would cause a queue to form to get your data looked at by the server. </p>

<p>Net Neutrality is not the end of freedom. Basically all it says is that the companies have to translate that signal in a timely manner for everyone equally. Getting rid of it will allow them to choose their own way to do it. A company like Netflix is cutting into your cable profits? Slow them way the fuck down by doing what I described above, and then charge them to open up more. Wikipedia is being used by your customers to find out about Net Neutrality? Well looks like if people want to go there they have to pay for us to open that specific sight to them now. </p>

<p>That is the end of freedom. By definition, you lose choice in your internet. Thats the exact opposite of freedom </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no your servers need to close ports because of demand. Net Neutrality makes this okay. (Its not) . This way noone has to pay to put in new lines and if net neutrality passes they win. Do you work for comcast or Centurylink, just curious? </p>

<p>Net Neutrality also guts the free market and imposes impossible restrictions on startup companies by not allowing them to start up unless they can immediately cover a large geographical area which would make it impossible for them to compete with existing companies.</p>

Try fucking do that shit in this day and age. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry man. You&#39;re just not right. What&#39;s even more confusing to me is you seem to have all the data available to you.

<p>seven words you cant say on tv and radio plain and simple. FCC was created to regulate the electromagnetic spectrum which we use for radio because it is finite. There is only so much , so we have and agency that makes sure stations dont broadcast over each other or disrupt signals. Makes sense right. Then Tv came along and they got their dirty mitts on that too. Then it was cable tv. During the Obama admin it became the internet. The internet was free until NET NEUTRALITY. Allowing the FCC to regulate it allows censorship. Look at TPB and BITTORRENT and all the other sites that have been hijacked. Censored. You can still connect to them via proxy (at your own risk) from outside the U.S. censorship in action. Net Neutrality is about controlling the information and killing competition this is an information war</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All the arguements you are putting forth a false. They were created to gain support for this bill. Mccdonalds doesnt make you wait in line extra long for your cheeseburger. Comcast Doesnt want you to have slow internet. But they dont want to upgrade their shit. Plain and simple there are a few different axis to this act. Destroy Competition via legislation, centralize power via censorship, and misinform and control an ever enlightened populace that is starting to wake up to the bullshit. Nothing about Net Neutrality is good. I am actually surprised the FCC is dropping it.</p>

<p>You&#39;d have to pay that very high infrastructure cost, just to position yourself as a competitor.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why are you assuming that a new competitor can only receive half the profits of a given market? Is just Comcast that awesome?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, as a prospective competitor into a region where Comcast holds a monopoly, you have to be realistic about how much of the market share you expect to take from them. Some percentage of Comcast&#39;s subscribers are happy with their service, and some other percentage isn&#39;t happy but won&#39;t go to the trouble of changing providers. I don&#39;t know what those numbers are, nor do I know how much better our imaginary startup&#39;s customer service is going to be, or how much money we have to spend on advertising, or how our internet speeds compare, or our pricing model.</p>

<p>Even if you initially get a huge advantage, say 75% of the market, that&#39;ll only prompt Comcast to up their game (that&#39;s what competition&#39;s all about right!), and then you&#39;ll lose some ground back to them.</p>

<p>Given all that, yeah, I&#39;d say half is a reasonable expectation.</p>

<p>This could be a possibility in a city, but in suburban and rural areas the account of wire they&#39;d have to lay would be staggering. Google fiber is an option in someplaces, but the only options for the majority of Americans would be the big players or satellite/dial-up. </p>

<p>Even if someone with enough capital to finance such a massive project came along, we&#39;re talking years until we get to a point when the majority of Americans have an option in broadband service. Meanwhile the big providers will have free reign to introduce strick data caps, content plans, throttling of websites that compete with them or even just say things that the provider doesn&#39;t like. </p>

<p>I can understand not liking government regulation, but when it comes down to being regulated by elected officials or an unstoppable monopoly, I think it&#39;s an easy choice. If you want you can go physically meet your representative, but good luck getting into the Comcast offices for a meeting with the shareholders.</p>

Would they really make it that bad and ruin things for people, such that boatloads of people jump ship and simply refuse to be &quot;extorted&quot;?  </p>

<p>Also, big companies say it will make it hard for startups, but the same big companies that support net neutrality are already best buds with the ISPs.  And the messages are so mixed about the effects.  Is it about controlling what you want to see, or money?  I know it can be both,  but they seem to push the money angle with people.  Interesting, when basic &quot;freedom&quot; should be more important.  If things get bad people will realize that they have the choice to opt-out and maybe do things or even live differently.  </p>

There is only so much , so we have and agency that makes sure stations dont broadcast over each other or disrupt signals. Makes sense right. Then Tv came along and they got their dirty mitts on that too. Then it was cable tv. During the Obama admin it became the internet. The internet was free until NET NEUTRALITY. Allowing the FCC to regulate it allows censorship. Look at TPB and BITTORRENT and all the other sites that have been hijacked. Censored. You can still connect to them via proxy (at your own risk) from outside the U.S. censorship in action. Net Neutrality is about controlling the information and killing competition this is an information war.</p>
