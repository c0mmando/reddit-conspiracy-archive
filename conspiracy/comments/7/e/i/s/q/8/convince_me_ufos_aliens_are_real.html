       I don't know why that is the harder part to believe. 200 years ago we were still mucking about with sails and candles. Imagine what our tech will be like in 1000 years. Now imagine in the infinite universe what the tech is like for a civilization that is 1,000,000,000+ years old.

       You clearly haven't listened or read to much books on the subject!
      </p>
      <p>
       May I suggest a few?
      </p>
      <p>
       First and foremost, the day after Roswell which is written by Philip J Corso is a must read. Not only does he admit that it was a coverup, he goes into great detail on what current technology we have that benefitted from the Roswell crash. That being, lasers, fiber optics, Kevlar body armor, inter elasticity, and also, night vision, among other inventions that were filtered out into the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also goes into detail of why, how, and who covered up the crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's seriously a great book. I listened to it on audible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another great book is keepers of the garden by Dalores cannon. She past life regresses someone that ended up being an ET from another planet in a previous life. Great great listen I was mesmerized
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also posted a few links recently on the subject. Let me grab those for you real quick

       Exactly. It would be very pompus of us to think we're the only living thing in this galaxy/universe. Specially when we're finding new planets every few years that might support life.

       I have seen a low flying black cube UFO.
This event occurred in 2011 and has haunted me everyday since. I work in networking and all of ours are late. I usually get off around 2am and then I am up for a few hours before I go to bed. This evening I got off work and it was raining really bad on my way home. When I got home, by chance, the clouds broke and I stepped outside to have a quick smoke. One of my buddies called me and we were chatting about work. It was still not raining and there were low lying clouds. There are orange street lights in Allen and they were reflecting off the bottom of the clouds creating an artificial light. There was a pretty good breeze whipping around, but no rain. I was facing the west and I look to my right and I see a black cube moving out of the north and traveling south at about 60-80mph. It was moving with a corner forward. This thing was huge. I was astonished to the core of my soul. I sat speechless for a few seconds knowing that I was seeing something amazing. It was 80-100ft tall. It was a black cube in shape and looked like a rough stone surface. On the side of the cube was a border and within the border was a circular symbol, if that's what it even was. It looked like if you were to draw a circular maze. It was disturbing the air behind it and created a vaporous trail spinning behind it and then disappearing. There was absolutely no sound. None. If you know Dallas, it was traveling in the direction of southbound 75Central Expressway towards downtown. I told my buddy what I had seen and he lives a few miles south. I fumbled over my words telling him and asked him to go outside to see if he could see it. He went out to the middle of his street and looked in the direction that it was coming from. After about 5 minutes it started to rain again. He stood out in the rain for another 15 minutes but never saw it. Good friend..lol.. Anyways, no one can ever tell me that I didn't see what I saw that night. I have been ridiculed and laughed at, but I know what I saw. It is almost a relief at this point to know that they are really here. I have been a long time lurker and I had to get this off of my chest. I have been searching "black cube ufo" for years now, every single day. I cannot stop thinking about it. I have to see it again. Thanks for listening. edit:Allen, TX (near Dallas) It looked like the entire cube was carved from a single stone. It had a border along its edges and a circular pattern in the middle. Think of a view of a circular maze from above. Also of interesting note, no lights from the craft either. I was expecting a light show, but I will settle with what I got to witness any day.

       I think they are the Archons... P.S. The "Texas Black Cube" pics you see all over the internet are a proven hoax. It always bugs me that it gained so much traction.

       You talk in your thread about how much power it would need and it got me thinking. The only reason you'd build it like that and be able to move something that big and heavy (especially if it was made of STONE) is if zero energy had been perfected. Then all of a sudden aero dynamics and weight capacity no longer matter.  But is it the government or aliens? ...Or government aliens?

       I started watching ufo documentaries as a laugh a few years ago.   Now kind of a hobby watching more than I care to admit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is my $.02.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is no 100% proof of ufos or aliens.  As in an interview with ET where he talks about hyper drive tech while a scientist does dna test live showing him non human.  Then it shape shift, moves the table with its mind, and drops the mic.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are: a whole lot of interesting facts, supporting evidence, and witness account from credible people that point to both ufos and aliens.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No shortage (in the absence of facts) of theories.  Some pretty good.  Some just bat shit crazy.   It’s best if you get a documentary that can critically state known facts, acknowledge facts gaps.  State a theory, then try to prove/disprove it.  Much better than a bunch of shaking pictures of blurry distance lights.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       There is one on amazon prime call “ufo and nukes”.  (Something like that).  Might be on YouTube too.  A decent one to start.

       What probably got me into all this conspiracy stuff in the first place was when me and a friend i had at sleepover suddenly caught a triangular ufo hovering in the sky, and it went up and down and to the sides at suuuperfast speed. we watched it playing around in the air, just doing what seemed like random movemements for a good 15minutes untill it flew away in almost literally a blink of an eye. 13-14 years ago.  Local paper even wrote about it, but have never heard of it since. Its a famous cropcirlce 30minutes away from where i lived, too, on Bømlo, in Norway.

       I agree that demons could be aliens. It didn't matter either way.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are some sort of interdimensional beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me what that means is that they are at a different level of consciousness which could be lower or higher than ours  (like ghosts are lower and angels are higher).
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe all this technology is the "illusion" of progress, but slowly we are losing our consciousness or what makes us human.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps that is what aliens are - beings that are seemingly advanced but lack consciousness.

       It's practically a statistical impossibility that they don't exist, statistically. The odds that Earth alone has harbored life are just not likely enough to be credible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I feel that if you examine the ancient religions of the planet, it's pretty clear that their "gods" were actual beings of a sort, with incredibly in depth biographies and a much more checkered and "human" sense of morality and ethics than we'd ascribe to modern deities.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more,though, is we've got thousands of credible witnesses from all walks of life.  Learn about the stars and the sky. If you look each night upwards once you do, I promise that there will be nights when you will see them as well.

       If outer space is real then there should be countless civilizations similar to our own out there.
People who are human-like and living throughout all the various stages of development.
The beings capable of making contact with us though should be ASI (artificial super intelligence) or beings augmented by technology capable of making contact with us.
I highly doubt though that any of them would dick with us. 
Everything you read about in the media is just TPTB using their technology to deceive the public.
