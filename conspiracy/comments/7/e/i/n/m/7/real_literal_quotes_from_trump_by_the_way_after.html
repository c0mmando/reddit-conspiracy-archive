        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;In a 2005 appearance on Howard Stern&#39;s show, Trump bragged about doing exactly what the women describe. &quot;I&#39;ll go backstage before a show, and everyone&#39;s getting dressed and ready and everything else,&quot; he said.
His position as the pageant&#39;s owner entitled him to that kind of access, Trump explained, seemingly aware that what he was doing made the women uncomfortable. &quot;You know, no men are anywhere. And I&#39;m allowed to go in because I&#39;m the owner of the pageant. And therefore I&#39;m inspecting it... Is everyone OK? You know, they&#39;re standing there with no clothes. And you see these incredible-looking women. And so I sort of get away with things like that,&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-735086019/101g1">Its on tape if you want to hear it</a></p>

<ul>
<li>“I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump booms from a speakerphone. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”*</li>
</ul>

<p>Jeffrey the paedophile.</p>

<p>Terrific guy.</p>

<p>Roy Moore? Also a “Terrific Guy”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I moved on her like a bitch. But I couldn’t get there. And she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything. She’s totally changed her look. ... I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. ... Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As opposed to you? An account created 49 days ago and somehow can spend all day posting anti-trump. I didn&#39;t vote for honor really care about him. The idea that the president is so much greater than that of a figure head is really minimizing who really controls countries, gov&#39;t, and information. Maybe time to create another account for you? Or pick up a hobby that you seemed to stop doing 30 days ago.</p>

<p>And if you go on t_d it&#39;s the same shit as this account. Somehow people have time to post and comment non fucking stop. Doesn&#39;t make any sense or they&#39;re just adolescents with too much time before having to prioritize responsibilities. </p>

<p>You are obviously a partisan hack, and claiming that I&#39;m pushing a narrative is just rich. Further down the thread you make a complete 180 deflection to Biden. When women come out and accuse Joe get back to me, but for now it&#39;s obvious that you&#39;re shilling. What&#39;s incredible about this whole thing is that OPs post only belongs on conspiracy because a large portion of the US population thinks the POTUS own words are fake news. It&#39;s a fact that he said what OP had claimed. They came from Trump&#39;s own face-sphincter.</p>

<p>Those Joe Biden videos have been a part of the public record for a long time. How do you explain the outrage coming out now that he&#39;s gunning for the Orange on Cheif? Why have no police come to his home to arrest him? Why haven&#39;t the families, who clearly would have seeb him, made any accusations? Why haven&#39;t any accusations been made?</p>

<p>You are making this political. No need to bring up Biden in a Trump thread. But since you did I will quickly point out that Trump has 17 accusers, that is women that have accused him of behavior that his own words confirm he is guilty of. I haven&#39;t heard any of the little girls or their parents speak out against Joe Biden. When that happens and you also get a recording of Joe Biden confessing to be a creep we can then talk about this in the same breath.  </p>

&quot;&quot;You know, no men are anywhere. And I&#39;m allowed to go in because I&#39;m the owner of the pageant. And therefore I&#39;m inspecting it... Is everyone OK? You know, they&#39;re standing there with no clothes. And you see these incredible-looking women. And so I sort of get away with things like that,&quot; he said.&quot;</p>

<p>As for the Audio tapes, when I listen to it I see a shitty guy talking about how he hits on married women and how some groupies will let him get away with anything, even says you could grab them by the pussy, utilizing hyperbole to make his point,</p>

<p>I actually believe if the media had attacked him for objectifying in this manner it would have carried more weight with independents and moderates.  But they went the same route you did which is &quot;this is him admitting to sexual assault&quot; which just isn&#39;t true, so people dismissed it all together instead of focusing on how shitty he is</p>
