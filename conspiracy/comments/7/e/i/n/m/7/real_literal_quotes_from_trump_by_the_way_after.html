       "In a 2005 appearance on Howard Stern's show, Trump bragged about doing exactly what the women describe. "I'll go backstage before a show, and everyone's getting dressed and ready and everything else," he said.
His position as the pageant's owner entitled him to that kind of access, Trump explained, seemingly aware that what he was doing made the women uncomfortable. "You know, no men are anywhere. And I'm allowed to go in because I'm the owner of the pageant. And therefore I'm inspecting it... Is everyone OK? You know, they're standing there with no clothes. And you see these incredible-looking women. And so I sort of get away with things like that,"

       I'm on your side: he's a fucking twat and likely a pedophile with the rest. But if what your saying is Hillary or even Sanders would be better the answer is probably not, and that's coming from someone who was a Sanders supporter.

       As opposed to you? An account created 49 days ago and somehow can spend all day posting anti-trump. I didn't vote for honor really care about him. The idea that the president is so much greater than that of a figure head is really minimizing who really controls countries, gov't, and information. Maybe time to create another account for you? Or pick up a hobby that you seemed to stop doing 30 days ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you go on t_d it's the same shit as this account. Somehow people have time to post and comment non fucking stop. Doesn't make any sense or they're just adolescents with too much time before having to prioritize responsibilities.

       You left the point that i also mentioned t_d also has accounts that post all day pro trump - there is no other explanation except they're paid or are bots... but I guess being selective helps you with confirmation bias.... yes I'm butthurt that explains my extensive post history defending trump.

       Also you're just a hack - your comebacks are recycling my comments and making up my quotes... you must have gotten or still get picked on a lot of that's the most clever stuff you have. Can't stress this enough - walk away from the computer or phone (if you're allowed) and tryout real human interaction. You'll see people in real life aren't like you and just repeating others comments and RT'ing in an echo chamber.

       You are obviously a partisan hack, and claiming that I'm pushing a narrative is just rich. Further down the thread you make a complete 180 deflection to Biden. When women come out and accuse Joe get back to me, but for now it's obvious that you're shilling. What's incredible about this whole thing is that OPs post only belongs on conspiracy because a large portion of the US population thinks the POTUS own words are fake news. It's a fact that he said what OP had claimed. They came from Trump's own face-sphincter.

       Kisses women without consent. Also grabs them by the pussy. Both stated plainly by Donald J Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those Joe Biden videos have been a part of the public record for a long time. How do you explain the outrage coming out now that he's gunning for the Orange on Cheif? Why have no police come to his home to arrest him? Why haven't the families, who clearly would have seeb him, made any accusations? Why haven't any accusations been made?

       Wrong. Walking back into a woman's changing room is predatorial in nature especially since he admits to trying to catch a peek and women changing. Why do you like peeping toms so much? That's disgusting and illegal.

       I think the key difference is that he is talking about willing, consensual star-fuckers.

       He isn't talking about unwilling women.

       You don't even have to be famous. If you are just really good at music at a dive bar, you can still get the same reaction from a lot of women. Not all women. But plenty are... extra amorous in certain situations.

       To you it doesn't sound like a kiss on the cheek to me it does...but in the end it doesn't matter because saying he likes to kiss pretty women isn't an admission of sexual assault.

       You are making this political. No need to bring up Biden in a Trump thread. But since you did I will quickly point out that Trump has 17 accusers, that is women that have accused him of behavior that his own words confirm he is guilty of. I haven't heard any of the little girls or their parents speak out against Joe Biden. When that happens and you also get a recording of Joe Biden confessing to be a creep we can then talk about this in the same breath.

       Again you are making this about politics. You assume democrats don't believe Clintons accusers. This is a wrong assumption. But more importantly, you again are bringing up a different person to divert the attention from Trump.

       I think its pretty odd that you would say his words make him a tool, or a pig. But you cant take his words and take the accusations against him and add them together.

       There's Trump, Bill Clinton, Hillary allegedly shut down some investigations into pedophilia and prostitution, H.W. Bush is getting reported on by many women for groping and touching. H.W. also supposedly had some type of under age sex ring going. There's videos on Youtube about it. 
Many Senators and other public officials as well.
It's damn near a requirement to be President. It's crazy. Obama might be the only clean one, in this regard. As far as we know.

       That isn't assault, it's pervy but these women have men walking around back stage, the women are fine with it, it's part of modeling.  It's only an issue if they are forced to have this done and no one has ever come forward claiming he forced them to get naked where men could see them

       As for the Audio tapes, when I listen to it I see a shitty guy talking about how he hits on married women and how some groupies will let him get away with anything, even says you could grab them by the pussy, utilizing hyperbole to make his point,
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually believe if the media had attacked him for objectifying in this manner it would have carried more weight with independents and moderates.  But they went the same route you did which is "this is him admitting to sexual assault" which just isn't true, so people dismissed it all together instead of focusing on how shitty he is

       What did Bill ever say before getting elected to give us the idea he was a sexual predator? Nothing I can think of. He slipped past everyone. Trump however didn't hide his predatorial nature and the dim witted lowlife degenerates still voted for him, a rapist and pedophile.

       There is vastly more credible, verified evidence directly implicating Donald Trump as a sexual predator than there is for the existence of ancient pyramid-building aliens, and yet so many of us are somehow more confident that King Tut was a reptilian than that Donald Trump is a fucking creep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump basically SAYS, "I'm an aggressive pervert" and you're like, "Hmm...I'd better wait for the facts to come in."
      </p>
      <p>
       Some talented troll anonymously shitposts a "deep state tell-all" on 4chan and suddenly you're all, "Finally! Something credible for me to base my opinions on..."

       You cannot argue against the point, this angers you so you lash out at the messenger in order to feel better.
