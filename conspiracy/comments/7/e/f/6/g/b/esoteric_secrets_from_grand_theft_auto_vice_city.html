        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I was listening to the soundtrack of GTA:Vice City Stories on youtube. specifically the new wave channel. I took note of the DJ&#39;s name “Adam First” i&#39;m assuming a biblical reference. He seems to have right leaning politics and takes himself and art very seriously. Anyways I thought it was odd that his name would have a bible reference and when looking at the tracklist for the radio station I found a song called “Blue Monday” by a band named New Order (or new world order maybe??). After the completion of the song a female dj that accompanies Adam First comments that she loves the video..so being on youtube and I searched the music video. What I found is this. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/lPhl4uw.png">https://i.imgur.com/lPhl4uw.png</a> </p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/h6mGYbc.png">https://i.imgur.com/h6mGYbc.png</a></p>

<p>The drummer in the band is wearing a freemasonry t-shirt and the entire video is quick flashing subliminal imagery. I researched more into the band and it appears the singer of the group has somewhat recently released a memoir stating in his youth he used to practice hypnotism and had found success hypnotizing classmates in the past. I also want to note that this musical act once had another band member who was their singer. The band found moderate success with this singer as an indie band, then almost immediately after his untimely death (age 23) the group exploded in popularity, wealth, and fame. Was he the victim of a satanic ritual in exchange for success? No, probably not.</p>

<p>Radio from the GTA games during 2001-2005 might have some interesting info in it. I&#39;m going to continue listening. There are examples of radical feminists, religious cults, trust fund antifa type leftists, conspiracy types... the list continues. Many of the topics discussed are very relevant today. Perhaps more so than when they were first presented. Is this an example of predictive programming? A glimpse of the spiritual battle we are part of daily? Or is it just jokes and commentary? Stay tuned.</p>

(Funny contrast I know) They are all micromanaged for the most profit possible and the 80s New Wave scene was no different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>...? Exactly the reason she hasn&#39;t stated her political views. Do you think if she were part of the machine they would allow her to do so? Same reason she doesn&#39;t want her music on Spotify and writes her own music.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok first off taylor swift does NOT write her own music. She gets pre-produced tracks and then writes lyrics. She then has her lyrics proof-read and redone by actually experienced writers like Max Martin, Karl Schuster, and Liz Rose. I don’t think she has one album where she is credited for the majority of the songwriting. The reason she isn’t on spotify is because her producers want more plays on her youtube videos...</p>

<p>secondly, tech9 is hilarious. The dude played directly before Muse at a Wiz Khalifa festival and ended up standing directly behind me in the VIP section during muse. I started lighting up joints and he straight up GLARED ME DOWN. Literally the entire show he was staring angrily at me for smoking weed at a festival headlined by wiz khalifa. He has a phenomenal live voice though. He sounds kinda like frank ocean when hes live. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting about Swift - she is always portrayed as a songwriter. Regardless at least she has a voice in it. She pulled music from Spotify so she could sell more albums. Again, she has a voice in that. Interesting you bring up Max Martin - I always saw that guy as like a &quot;what magic formula does this guy have?&quot; type. Seems like he has some algorithm down that instantly appeals to the masses. Kind of like that Weezer song Pork and Beans &quot;Timberland knows the way to reach the top of the charts...maybe if I work with him, I can perfect the art.&quot; </p>

<p>Not sure what the Tech story has to do with anything, but the point I was getting at is there are such a thing as Independent artists out there who don&#39;t follow the label approach and try to do their own thing (I think Chance the Rapper does the same, ICP, etc). It doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t have Management, just that they play a more active role in the decision making process. For instance, Tech N9ne management is horrendous to work with but the original ideas come from Tech himself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah i dont have anything against tech. I just havent had a chance to share that story with anyone and wanted to. I found it genuinely hilarious how shocked he was that a white guy was smoking weed at a muse show. </p>

<p>I do have something against taylor swift though. She says music shouldn’t be free and doesnt want her albums on spotify but then her team pays insane amounts of money to make sure her songs get the most airtime on Sirius xm’s pop channels. </p>

<p>Like this girl from a rich family complains that she doesnt make enough money from spotify but then straight up pays to get these songs stuck in our heads? To me, thats not art. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I can see where you are coming from on that front with Swift. And I agree it&#39;s catchy pop nonsense. I just want to know the science behind that. I swear these music producers are just data miners and know what harmonic formulas work or something. Regardless, the world is now awakening and hopefully that will encourage more artistic competition throughout all mediums. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you’re interested you can check out a donald duck video on youtube called “Math Magic Land”. I think its from the early 60’s. Anyway, Donald gets sucked into a dream land filled with nothing but math and numbers and the narrator uses early pythagoreans(i think thats the name/spelling) as an example. They basically found that as long as you adhere to certain mathematical ratios that you wouldn’t stray from the musical scale and different ratio’s presented different scales and key signatures. </p>

<p>I could definitely see these techniques being used still today, drawing inspiration from those mathematical guarantees that certain ratios sound pleasant to the human ear. Im sure it can be done with poetry as well. </p>

<p>One of these seemingly mathematically perfect songs i’m thinking of is ‘99 problems’ written by rick ruben. Blows me away everytime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The original band was called Joy Division (which was apparently the name given to a group of jewish women in the concentration camps that the soldiers would rape) </p>

<p>There are 2 movies centered around Joy Division, one is called Control (taken from one of his song titles) and focuses on the lead singers suicide, he killed himself over a woman. </p>

<p>The other is called &#39;24 hour party people&#39; and focuses on their manager, its an excellent movie starring Steve Coogan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>New Order and Joy Division were a bunch of working class kids, not members of the Illuminati.</p>

<p>Adam First is just a satire on yuppies, as VC is a satire of the 80s.</p>

<p>He also turns up in San Andreas.  <a href="http://gta-myths.wikia.com/wiki/Adam_First">http://gta-myths.wikia.com/wiki/Adam_First</a></p>

<p>Rockstar always has outlandish characters.  It&#39;s why their games are so memorable.  Vice City had a bunch, since it mocked the 80s.</p>

<p>Ian Curtis definitely killed himself due to numerous personal problems. He was involved in an affairs, had severe depression, and had epileptic seizures.  He killed himself with an Iggy Pop lp on the turntable and a Herzog flick on the tv.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I can see where you are coming from on that front with Swift. And I agree it&#39;s catchy pop nonsense. I just want to know the science behind that. I swear these music producers are just data miners and know what harmonic formulas work or something. Regardless, the world is now awakening and hopefully that will encourage more artistic competition throughout all mediums. </p>
