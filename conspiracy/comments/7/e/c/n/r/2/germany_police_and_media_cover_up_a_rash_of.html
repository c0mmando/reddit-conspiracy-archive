       A search of German police blotters, however, indicates that 2017 is on track to become a record year for stabbings and knife crimes: Police reported more than 3,500 knife-related crimes between January and October 2017, compared to around 4,000 reported crimes during all of 2016 - and only 300 in 2007. Overall, during the past ten years, knife-related crimes in Germany have increased by more than 1,200%.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media in Germany do not report most knife-related violence. Crimes that are reported are often dismissed as "isolated incidents," unrelated to mass immigration. Moreover, many crime reports, including those in police blotters, omit any reference at all to the nationalities of the perpetrators and victims — ostensibly to avoid inflaming anti-immigration sentiments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many knife attacks appear to be random, indiscriminate assaults on innocent bystanders — especially at transport hubs and on public transportation:
      </p>
      <p>
       Munich, October 21. A 33-year-old man randomly stabbed eight people, including a 12-year-old boy, at the Rosenheimer Platz. Police said they "assume" that the stabber, a serial offender with a long rap sheet, was suffering from a "mental disorder."
      </p>
      <p>
       Mönchengladbach, October 16. An 18-year-old Algerian, in Germany illegally, randomly drew a knife on a 65-year-old man in a wheelchair at the central train station.
      </p>

       Hamburg, October 15. A 23-year-old man was stabbed in a restaurant after he made "accidental eye contact" with his attacker.

      </p>
      <p>

The man was charged with manslaughter rather than murder because, according to the court, the "honor killing" was done in the heat of passion: the man thought that his wife had been unfaithful.
      </p>

       Knife attacks also occurred against social workers and public servants:
      </p>

      </p>

      <p>
       Hamburg, July 28. A 26-year-old Palestinian, Ahmed A., stabbed to death one person and injured several others at a supermarket in the Barmbek district. Although he repeatedly shouted "Allahu Akbar" and said he was a jihadist who wanted to die as a martyr, the newspaper Die Welt wrote: "It is still unclear whether the Barmbek murder is the work of a convinced Islamist or the desperate act of a mentally troubled person. His approach seems downright schizophrenic — or is it indeed calculated?"
      </p>
