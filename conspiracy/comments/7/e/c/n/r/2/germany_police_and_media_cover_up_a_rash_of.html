<p>...</p>

<p>A search of German police blotters, however, indicates that 2017 is on track to become a record year for stabbings and knife crimes: Police reported more than 3,500 knife-related crimes between January and October 2017, compared to around 4,000 reported crimes during all of 2016 - and only 300 in 2007. Overall, during the past ten years, knife-related crimes in Germany have increased by more than 1,200%.</p>

<p>The media in Germany do not report most knife-related violence. Crimes that are reported are often dismissed as &quot;isolated incidents,&quot; unrelated to mass immigration. Moreover, many crime reports, including those in police blotters, omit any reference at all to the nationalities of the perpetrators and victims — ostensibly to avoid inflaming anti-immigration sentiments.</p>

<p>Many knife attacks appear to be random, indiscriminate assaults on innocent bystanders — especially at transport hubs and on public transportation:</p>

<p>Munich, October 21. A 33-year-old man randomly stabbed eight people, including a 12-year-old boy, at the Rosenheimer Platz. Police said they &quot;assume&quot; that the stabber, a serial offender with a long rap sheet, was suffering from a &quot;mental disorder.&quot;</p>

<p>Mönchengladbach, October 16. An 18-year-old Algerian, in Germany illegally, randomly drew a knife on a 65-year-old man in a wheelchair at the central train station.</p>

<p>Hamburg, October 15. A 23-year-old man was stabbed in a restaurant after he made &quot;accidental eye contact&quot; with his attacker.</p>

<p>Leipzig, July 27. A 46-year-old father at an amusement park with his family was stabbed and seriously injured when he was attacked by a group of Afghan youths.</p>

<p>Knife attacks increasingly involve teenagers and young children as well as women:</p>

<p>Hermannsburg, August 29. A man drew a knife on a 22-year-old woman because she was supposedly holding up traffic in a parking garage.</p>

<p>In mass brawls between groups of people from different nationalities and ethnic groups, knives appear to be weapons of choice:</p>

<p>Dortmund, September 3. A 34-year-old Bulgarian stabbed a 54-year-old Turk outside a restaurant.</p>

<p>Knives have also been used in &quot;honor&quot; violence and internecine disputes:</p>

<p>Bad Homburg, October 30. A 40-year-old man stabbed to death his 31-year-old wife and mother of their three children. Police said the man was angry that his wife was using social media.</p>

<p>Oldenburg, October 14. The trial began of a 37-year-old Iraqi accused of stabbing to death his wife, the mother of his five children, who were in the house at the time of the attack.

The woman had, in fact, been attending German language courses.</p>

<p>Herzberg, June 29. Mohammad Hussain Rashwani, a 38-year-old migrant from Syria tried to behead 64-year-old Ilona Fugmann at her beauty salon. Fugmann had offered Rashwani a job as a hair stylist and German media praised him as an exemplar of successful integration. Mohammad reportedly had found it difficult to subordinate himself to his female boss.</p>

<p>Cologne, June 14. A 33-year-old Syrian stabbed and seriously injured his ex-wife at a supermarket in Cologne. He also stabbed his 13-year-old son after the boy intervened to protect his mother.</p>

<p>Cottbus, June 9. A 32-year-old Chechen man was sentenced to 13 years in prison for slitting his wife&#39;s throat and throwing her out of the second-floor window of their apartment. The man was charged with manslaughter rather than murder because, according to the court, the &quot;honor killing&quot; was done in the heat of passion: the man thought that his wife had been unfaithful.</p>

<p>Knife attacks also occurred against social workers and public servants:</p>

<p>Pfaffenhofen, November 11. A 28-year-old Kazakh-German held a 31-year-old clerk at a youth welfare office hostage at knifepoint for more than five hours. He said he disagreed with the results of a custody battle, in which his one-year-old daughter would be sent to a foster home.</p>

<p>Göppingen, October 26. A &quot;dark-skinned&quot; man (dunklem Teint) drew a knife on a 54-year-old female train conductor when she asked him for his ticket.</p>

<p>Attackers are often repeat offenders known to police:</p>

<p>Gießen, November 15. A 29-year-old Kosovar and a 19-year-old Albanian drew a knife on an undercover detective who caught them shoplifting. Police said the Kosovar was wanted on an outstanding arrest warrant.</p>

<p>Arnschwang, June 4. Mostafa J., a 41-year-old asylum seeker from Afghanistan, stabbed to death a five-year-old Russian at a refugee shelter. It later emerged that the man had a criminal history in Germany and should have been deported in 2011 but was not.</p>

<p>Recent knife-jihad attacks include:</p>

<p>Hamburg, July 28. A 26-year-old Palestinian, Ahmed A., stabbed to death one person and injured several others at a supermarket in the Barmbek district. Although he repeatedly shouted &quot;Allahu Akbar&quot; and said he was a jihadist who wanted to die as a martyr, the newspaper Die Welt wrote: &quot;It is still unclear whether the Barmbek murder is the work of a convinced Islamist or the desperate act of a mentally troubled person. His approach seems downright schizophrenic — or is it indeed calculated?&quot;</p>
