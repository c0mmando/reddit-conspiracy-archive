    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m thinking of a drone (no, quadcopter, but most people would be familiar with the use of the word drone here) the size of two smart cars, or a compact car like a mini cooper. We could make it work. A helicopter simply wouldn&#39;t be agile enough for mass transit, while quadcopters with stabilizers are quite agile and are surprisingly well suited for automated navigation. They require far more fuel, and wouldn&#39;t be as safe should stabilizers fail or software issues arise, but you could realistically have flying cars in this way, which is what we are discussing.</p>

<p>You can call it what you want, but by the time your done I think you&#39;re back to looking kinda like a helicopter. Maybe you could put some additional copters on it, but they&#39;ve done that with helicopters as well. Look at somewhere like Sau Paulo where the upper crust of the city travels rooftop to rooftop already.  </p>

<p>To get to the topic of the post though, if there was a possibility for it, I don&#39;t think it would be using wind to defeat gravity.</p>

<p>This is probably as close as we have gotten to realizing &quot;flying cars&quot; as it were. It will navigate itself, so you can do whatever you want in the passenger cabin. Travels for about 23 minutes at sea level carrying up to 220lbs, at a max speed of 63 mph, and charging fully in as little as two hours. This is sufficient to satisfy the needs of most commuters. It sells for between $200-$300k. It does not have manual controls in the event that the navigation systems fail. It is controlled by a tablet. They are currently planning on a remote emergency control system whereby an operator would literally remotely save your life. Pretty scary.</p>

<p>Also pretty damn close to a flying car, but far more terrifying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fun fact: I had a dream of the same triangular squarish asteroid sonic booming right onto the planet earth, that shit was fucking real as hell. It has Neil Patrick Harris in it for some reason, and a buddhist like temple so that was also weirder. </p>

<p>I also talked to beings in my dream, which I did not know was possible, will start communicating with random aliens and will give you guys updates and what happens. It&#39;s actually kinda jokes, life went from &lt;&gt; to &lt;------------&gt; much more interesting in the past couple of months for me. </p>

<p>Also, you might want to reconsider the Bible, and the question if it was altered, modified, and parts removed for the sake of the &quot;make the prophecy you read and didn&#39;t want to come true, but did while you were trying to make it not happen&quot; scenario. I feel like their should be a movie about that. </p>

<p>I sound crazy, which might seem crazy, but the craziest part is I can write this on a reddit post and not care because people will think that I am crazy but I can only vouch for myself. weird huh? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, he&#39;s not. The USPTO rejects certain types of patents for violating the laws of thermodynamics, but it is most definitely not the case that they grant patents only on things that work and can be produced. They don&#39;t have labs and they don&#39;t do testing. It would be spectacularly inefficient to gatekeep at that stage. Questions of validity come up if and when litigation arises.  </p>

All the math &amp; physics are explained in detail. 
It basically says John St. Clair discovered this whole thing while walking on a road that’s oriented perpendicular to an airport runway. Apparently a twin turbo prop flying near or after jet engines created the physics possible to open a worm hole  or hyper dimensional doorways. Mmmmmkay.
Is this real life?</p>

<p>This got me thinking : there may indeed already be some technology that allows you to set the gravity you want (so, 9.81 m/s/s), although I don&#39;t see how this is even possible. Or Elon is making a bet on such technology to be available soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The antikythera mechanism was a computer for detecting astronomical phenomena, and I would point out that it was technically wrong (ancient data was not as good as modern data) and the mechanism had built into it flawed ancient mathematics.</p>

<p>That is not evidence of ancient superiority--it&#39;s evidence of basic astronomical knowledge that we already knew about long before discovering the mechanism. The only thing surprising about the mechanism was that it was atypical for the time period and stands out as a rare example of analog computation. There is no evidence at all that it was common to make them.</p>

<p>They have. One of the primary functions of archeologists is the reconstruction of historical building techniques, along with proofs of concept. These studies are then used to improve detection techniques that either confirm or refute the building techniques.</p>

<p>This is common knowledge.</p>

<p>And no--there is no evidence. I&#39;ve always found the idea of ancient civilizations and ancient aliens, etc., intriguing and fun, but I have never seen a credible piece of evidence that supports the hypothesis (and trust me, I&#39;ve looked, because I think it&#39;s a fun idea).</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to engage any evidence you think you have. Trust me--if you could change my mind on this issue, I would love you forever and I would die a happier and much less bitter academic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would have to use the tools myself. But based on my own experience working with similar tools and with similar materials, I can tell you that the use of iron tools on hard stones like that would not be a problem.</p>

<p>In fact, it can work in your favor. Things which are hard shatter, while things that are soft deform. But iron, which is &quot;softer&quot; than these rocks on paper, becomes harder when it is struck because of work hardening. An iron tool is going to be much harder than iron is on paper (and this is the mistake being made here I think).</p>

<p>The perfect example is granite. Granite has a Mohs hardness of 7, and Iron (at its best) has a hardness of 5. The Mohs scale is logarithmic, meaning that hardness 6 is 10 times as hard as hardness 5. That means that granite is 100 times harder than iron.</p>

<p>And I use iron tools to work granite all the time, and doing so does not harm my tools. </p>

<p>Also--I haven&#39;t looked, so this is me using my professional opinion, but the tools used to create that palace were likely steel, not iron. But still--iron tools would have been easily sufficient, and there are no stones or stonework in those photos that you could not do easily with iron tools (and without damaging those tools). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So we keep gathering proofs that point to a lack of understanding on our part and we increase our understanding as we learn more about what we don&#39;t know. These anomalies can give us a good idea where we might find more of this evidence.

    <div class="md"><p>Hollow columns really isn&#39;t a new thing though. It was a common technique that was used to keep costs down or lower the weight of columns (preventing them from crumbling). </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No, we don&#39;t start there. We end up there. We start with the evidence. The evidence indicates that technologically the ancients were inferior.</p>

<p>The problem with the superior ancients thesis is that we&#39;re not just looking at things and guessing how they were used or made. Often, we have books that explain how they were made and what their purpose was. </p>

<p>So, back to the topic. These column, whether solid or hollow, is not an anomoly. Both were common building techniques. So, again, I don&#39;t see why it matters one way or another.  What are we learning that we didn&#39;t know before by learning that these columns are hollow? Humanity has been using hollow columns for as long as there have been columns. I don&#39;t see what we learn. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most likely answer to those questions is that we don&#39;t know. Hollowing out granite is easy: you use a drill and a hammer. We&#39;d have to cut into one to know for sure what they did.</p>

<p>Academics are perfectly fine with saying &quot;we don&#39;t know.&quot; The truth is that we could answer all your questions, but we would have to destroy the columns to do it. So we then ask the question: is the knowledge we&#39;d gain from destroying the thing worth destroying it?</p>

<p>I think the answer in this case is obviously no. I could tell you what they used to patch holes if I had a sample. I can&#39;t tell you that without a sample. And you can&#39;t say anything without a sample either. </p>

<p>Something to keep in mind: usually when an academic is shooting down a theory like this, we&#39;re not saying &quot;you&#39;re wrong and I know you&#39;re wrong because I know something you don&#39;t and I&#39;m right.&quot; We&#39;re often saying &quot;I know you&#39;re wrong because I don&#39;t know the answer to this and I know for a fact that you can&#39;t know it either.&quot;</p>

<p>For example--if someone told me that there is a ham sandwich on the dark side of the moon, I would say they are full of shit. No, I haven&#39;t been to the other side of the moon--but I know you haven&#39;t either.</p>

<p>To answer your question: I have no idea is the answer to your questions. I know how you could put solid granite over a brick; that&#39;s not hard. I can&#39;t say how they did it for sure though, especially not without breaking the column. I can&#39;t answer any of your other questions at all. </p>

<p>But I know you can&#39;t either.</p>

<p>Further--I&#39;m still not convinced that the answer to any of those questions matters. The ability to put hollow columns filled with brick or sand cores is an old technology with examples spread throughout the middle east dating back to ~AD 500. Hollow columns were common throughout the middle ages.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/medieval-england/medieval-church-architecture/">http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/medieval-england/medieval-church-architecture/</a></p>

<p>That site has a short discussion of it.</p>

<p>So again, I would pose the so what question to you. Why do these details matter? They are details that 1) no one can know and 2) would change nothing if we did know them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so. I did you a favor. I normally refuse to watch videos because they are always garbage. But I did it. This guy is--and I can&#39;t be nice about it--full of shit.</p>

<p>E.g., that is not a bathroom. There is no plumbing to it, nor is there any evidence at all that it was used as a bathroom based on that photo. If it was used as a bathing are, then it would be disgusting, because there is no means to remove the water or let it run off. It would turn into a rancid pool. I don&#39;t know where that photo was taken, but there is likely evidence of how those people bathed based on texts and other material evidence. His thought process is &quot;it looks like a bathroom to me, so that&#39;s what it is.&quot; That doesn&#39;t cut it.</p>

<p>That drill core is granite. I work with granite all the time. &quot;I don&#39;t think it is&quot; again doesn&#39;t cut it. I promise that that rock has been studied in a lab by a geologist, and they probably know where that granite comes from. I say this because I&#39;ve never found a stone tool that wasn&#39;t tested and it&#39;s location of material origin identified, because this is necessary to study trade patterns.</p>

<p>As for why it&#39;s fatter at the bottom...that answer is simple. Ancient people didn&#39;t have gears. They used tapered shapes to gain the benefits we normally gain by using gears. He said give an example: every single drill that exists uses this principle, but we use gears because it&#39;s more efficient.</p>

<p>The next image is a rock with a hole and he starts talking about its purpose. How the hell does he know what it was used for? What? Also, that i not metamorphic rock. If it was, there would be very obvious phase changes in the rock, and there are none. </p>

<p>That long stone hole with the markings is an obvious example of a stone drill and rope wear. If you every drill a hole through stone using a stone drill, you will find afterward that there are tool markings depending on the methods used. What is very interesting is that the rope you use for guiding and controlling the drill will end up wearing smaller grooves into the stone. Yes. Rope will wear grooves in stone.</p>

<p>I sort of just stopped there. This entire video boils down to someone who doesn&#39;t know anything about geology making wild assumptions about stones. It&#39;s obvious they&#39;re not metamorphic because you can see metal flecking in the stone. Long story short, you can&#39;t have metal flecking in metamorphic rock because metals melt at lower temperatures than stone, and by the time you got the rock hot enough to transform, the metal would have dispersed into the rock.</p>

<p>All this fellow is doing is taking old things and asking &quot;what modern things do they resemble.&quot; That doesn&#39;t work. That&#39;s bad science. That&#39;s literally creating a thesis and seeking evidence, rather than finding evidence and letting it guide the thesis.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll check the other link now, but based on watching 1/2 of this video, nothing this guy says is credible. If he spent even one day working with stone tools he&#39;d know both how those holes were made, and why they look like they do. </p>

<p>So, you believe our ancestors were able to build spaceships 2000 years before we figured out basic geometry (pythagoras theorem). Right.</p>

<p>lol wtf, when I have I ever said anything like that. Save your patronizing rubbish...</p>

<p>Where is your evidence not your speculative reasoning? Your reasoning relies on a lot of unsupported assumptions both about the patent process and reasons why something is not public.</p>

<p>Do you realize that many patents don&#39;t actually work asintended? Just because John Quincy St. Clair applied for a patent on a  Magnetic Vortex Wormhole Generator does not prove that he actually has a working  Magnetic Vortex Wormhole Generator that works as intended. Are you aware of this fact?</p>

<p>And do you realize the fundamental problem in using <em>years</em> as your unit of measurement for technology advance? You assume technology always has and always will evolve exactly uniformly, which is already countered by Moore&#39;s Law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nature has a way of naturally conditioning and balancing itself in its distribution of resources based on the constant fractal network of information passed around by plants, animals, and fungi. The elites are trying to condition the masses artificially with more and more tech and creating a very robotic, cold, culture and I think this is in prep for smoother introduction and assimilation of global AI government and it&#39;s distribution of resources. It won&#39;t hold up. It&#39;s not natural. It may be able to predict human and livestock patterns for a time, but the systems get too complex when you address minute local fungal changes, or algae changes etc that have a butterfly effect on the larger scheme over greater amounts of time. It&#39;ll be like trying to close off one part of the system to the rest, and if that happens then neither will survive the long run. Humans, animals, plants and fungi... Our most sustainable order is when we&#39;re living in harmony with the rest of the planet. Not independent of it.<br/>
AI should not be used to govern unless the system is simple. The risk is too great otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is this rover imagery?</p>

<p>What&#39;s your take on the Devon Island conspiracy? I couldn&#39;t imagine it to be true at first, but it would appear that it&#39;s most likely the case that all the curiosity imagery and so on was really shot on a desolate island above the polar circle. There is clear evidence that the images from the Mars rover collection on the official Nasa website were recolored after the fact (by analyzing color markers that are attached to the rovers). There are also rocks that look like bits of human trash, animal bones or even one that looks like a particular rodent which is found on that Island in particular.</p>

<p>Nasa acknowledges that they&#39;re using the island, but supposedly only for training purposes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m by no means a FEer, or anything like that, but if this theory turns out to be true, I can&#39;t imagine what bigger Truth they&#39;re trying to conceal through this deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I look at those pics I see a geometrical structure precisely laid out in a 90 degree angle looking very much how an industrial building seen on Earth would look like.

    <div class="md"><p>It would take an aerial or orbital view to confirm the angle, though the right image processing software can extrapolate into 3D. Remember the placement of the camera and distance from the object affects the perceived angle in a 2d image, causing the angle to appear greater than 90 degrees. You can confirm this yourself by photographing a similar structure from the same angle here on Earth. Heck, taking a picture of a rectangular table top at the same angle would produce the same effect. I find it strange that this has to be explained to you, hence my presumption that you may have some sort of perceptual disability.</p>

<p>Even if the two branches of the structure don’t confirm to be an exact right angle, both sides exhibit two straight parallel lines. The structure on the left appears to have a trench running down the centre, the one on the right appears to be a road in the original NASA picture, but in the contrast adjusted pic shows up more like a building. At the very least, this is highly unlikely to be a natural formation due to the degree of geometric symmetry and therefore baffling as to why NASA would not take a closer, more detailed look - unless of course one assumes the narrative that NASA knows perfectly well that there are artificial structures on Mars and elsewhere in the solar system and is tasked with hiding this fact from the general public. I tend to assume that those who hang out at this subreddit are on board with this idea, unless they are flat earthers or disinfo shills or just new to this stuff in general.</p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p>50-100?  Try more.  A <em>lot</em> more.</p>

<p>Look into Marine Captain Randy Cramer.  Look into Andrew Basiago.  Tony Rodriguez, Laura Eisenhower (president Dwight D. Eisenhower&#39;s great granddaughter), and a slew of others.  They talk about technology that the secret space program has that will blow your socks off.  The secret space program is alive, real, has been fully operational for quite some time now, and has technology that is literally out of this world.</p>

<p>Any idea how I can get into the secret space program?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I know, everyone I’ve heard talk about it were used without any input from them.  They had no say in it.  It was decided before they were able to cognize a decision on the matter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would love to be Captain Kirk of the US Shhenterprise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the <em>reason</em> they’re not told anything about it and often taken before they can decide one way or the other is because many participants are made to do some <em>extremely</em> unsavory and unpleasant things.  Listen to Tony Rodriguez’s accounts.  You do NOT want to be part of that at all, sir.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dead serious though, would join the SSP in a heatbeat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think you would.  At all.  I don’t think you understand what a vast majority of it is about.  Do a lot of research first before you say that.</p>

<p>I’ve listened to a lot of Rodriguez’s talks, and his experiences were <em>not</em> about “exploring the universe!” at all.</p>

<p>Quite the opposite.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>what is the main purpose behind the SSP?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside from the expansion (for a very select few Earth humans, that is) of the knowledge of outer space and all the ins and outs that come with dealing with intelligent beings from many other planets, solar systems, and galaxies, Cramer and Rodriguez have stated on various occasions that pretty much <em>the</em> main goal of the SSP is one:  Trade.  Trade and the acquisition of goods and services of all different kinds that can help benefit, move forward, and technologically advance those select few Earth human groups that are involved and engaged in such activity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We fighting aliens off world to keep them off world?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, <em>part</em> of it is said to be about that.  Don’t to any extent just assume that all that’s done out there is “fight”, however.  Again, it’s said the main activity engaged in out there in outer space is trade - not war at all.  One has to protect and defend themselves, of course, and occasionally offensive strikes are said to take place as well - and for these reasons, the military apparatus of the SSP is said to be absolutely, INSANELY advanced and straight up science fiction level fantastic - but fighting aliens off world to keep them off world is not the main goal as far as I’ve been able to assess.</p>

<p>Additionally, don’t think for a moment that any extent to which TPTB <em>do</em> fight aliens off world to keep them off world is at all because they care about the 99% down here at all and want to “protect us”.  Nope.  We’re total cattle to them.  If they do protect us, they protect us like a farmer uses a guard dog to protect his heard of sheep that he plans to keep just so he can slaughter and fucking <em>eat</em> them.</p>

<p>That’s what we are to them:  Livestock that must be protected so that it can be used.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are we working with them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who is “we” and who is “them”?</p>

<p>There are said to be various different elite power groups - each of which have a different piece of the SSP pie and all of which are said to occasionally (if not frequently) argue with each other and not see eye to eye where it regards what exactly to do as far as the SSP is concerned.</p>

<p>And who is “them”?  If by “them” you mean “extraterrestrials”…well, you have to realize that there are an absolutely <em>innumerable</em> number of extraterrestrials in existence.  Some estimates claim that Earth humans have already been in contact with literally dozens of different species - and that’s just in this solar system alone.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMp9dZQdZA">There are <em>trillions</em> of solar systems in the known universe.</a></p>

<p>All this is to say that some Earth human factions work with some ETs, and some Earth human factions fight against some ETs.  It all depends really.  It’s pretty much all over the place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would love a Star Trek Space Program, that I&#39;d join in a heartbeat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a LOOOOT of factors involved before any Earth human has the slightest possibility of beginning to be considered for anything even remotely related to anything like that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to be clearer, I would love if we developed a space program that mimicked Star Treks in the sense that it&#39;s for exploration and not exploitation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very good edit, sir.  In that sense, I absolutely would as well.  Again, however, there would have to be a LOT of things that would have to happen on this planet before anything like that would take place.  There’s too much manipulation and deceit taking place amongst the Earth human species for that to happen as of the moment.  This is very unfortunate, but seems to be the case nonetheless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Parents are not evidence. Although patents probably hold us back from making advancements. If you think about it it&#39;s not really that far fetched an idea. Think about when we were developing the atom bomb we hid that super well. If you had the best weapons and the most money and could hide the best advancements in science and coninue your research unimpeded you would continue to advance at an accelerated rate. It wouldn&#39;t take long for your secret research to be leaps and bounds beyond what other people had come up with yet. Then when some out sided gets away with a huge breakthrough you just bring them up to your crew or suppress them outright.

<p>I don&#39;t know anything really about zero point energy except that a popular science writer was talking about it at a school presentation I was at over 15 years ago!

I truly do believe they have some sort of quantum computer (think of a computer from the 50&#39;s vs a high end rig today). Perhaps it&#39;s so advanced it can even function as some sort of artificial intelligence </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going to have some fun with this and go completely into fantasy land but hey, who knows? Maybe the world is truly stranger than fiction.</p>

<p>1) Human animal chimeras.
2) Electrogravitic propulsion
3) Augmented reality implants
4) Full Dive VRMMO
5) DNA editing allowing the creation of new organs to be grown that perform computer and networking processes. (you no longer need to buy a computer, you are a computer) This technology combines with 3 &amp; 4
6) Immortality, through the use of artificial organs that produce stem cells and modulate NAD+ levels as well as telomeres 
7) Artificial &#39;Magic&#39; through the use of programmable &quot;Photonic Field&quot; grids. Works with #5. Lost neural gland required with proper network protocols for photonic field access. Technology was developed 9,000,000,000,000,000+ (yes, quadrillion with a Q) years ago, the galaxy-wide photonic grid is a remnant of an advanced ancient civilization. Recently re-discovered photonic matrix currently being researched via an adapter with extremely limited capabilities.
8) AR computer interfaces that fit into a contact lens.
9) Long term hibernation technology for deep space travel.
10) Astrobiology &amp; Panspermia discoveries 
11) Electric Universe. (<a href="http://www.thunderbolts.info">http://www.thunderbolts.info</a>)
12) Astrobiological Evolutionary Metamorphosis. (Human evolution is not unique to Earth, but has occurred innumerable times over trillions of years all through out the universe by following pre-programmed genetic instructions in a process of genetically pre-programmed Directed Evolution begun by a ancient race of human Ancients as a means of Directed Panspermia)</p>

<p>I consider 1, 2, 8, and 9 to be the most probable as what might be kept secret. 10, 11, and 12 are out there but are ridiculed for conflicting with traditional religious beliefs. The problem with technology and science development is that releasing them to the US public is the same as releasing them to the world and one probably should consider The Prime Directive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmmmm.....idk about 50-100 years. Buuuuut I can speculate based on the Tesla cover up.</p>

<p>Not sure how long it took the government research programs to catch up to Tesla’s way of thinking, but consider this.</p>

<p>Tesla made a lot of claims that he was criticized for in his day but ended up being proven right somewhere down the road.</p>

<p>Tesla performed many demonstrations in front of multiple witnesses.</p>

<p>Tesla first designed an invention in his head, then refined the small detail through mathematics, and then worked on plans and actually building a working model. </p>

<p>Let’s just assume for a moment that Tesla was never wrong if he made a claim.</p>

<p>Go from that point forward and swallow the red pill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think probably the craziest speculative technology stuff I have read is related to ultra low frequency electromagnetic waves and the geoengineering projects they were supposedly doing with the magnetosphere and the radiation belts.  There is / was a lot of crazy research being done which supposedly had to do with finding reliable ways to communicate with our nuclear submarines while keeping them undetectable.</p>

<p>The geoengineering projects I am referring to and which I see rarely discussed in conspiracy circles are &quot;Operation Argus&quot; and &quot;Starfish Prime&quot;.  They were large scale nuclear detonations in the upper atmosphere.  They had massive effects on the ionosphere and radiation belts, (supposedly) permanent effects which were conducive to new technologies being developed in secret.</p>

The &quot;synthetic telepathy&quot; (talking with your throat, the microvibrations translated to speech, then sent to a bone conducting listening device, is in early stages but you can watch demos on YouTube. The weaponized part comes in two forms - sonic weaponry, like those used in the g20 in 2009 against protesters (very public information) and devices which can cause physical harm, or induce states of being, or even beam voices into people&#39;s heads. There&#39;s a ted talk I believe... So yes it&#39;s all weaponized, and relatively cheap technology that will be in the hands of all sizes of military soon (even Cuba)</p>
