       They are doing a whole feature on how "conspiracy theorists are crazy!" Even better, they link up the producers at the end. I sent my DM and called them out. Another garbage play from MSM, of course they don't discuss any of the proven conspiracies.

       Seriously. Just like we saw the coordinated MSM "fake news" onslaught when PG blew up, we've been seeing more and more hit pieces on "conspiracy theorists" lately, and it feels like something's brewing. Whatever it is, I hope it's vindicating.

       No way anyone can orchestrate a massive Internet outage without getting caught. It will always be traced back to the source, and it will always be revealed what the root cause is, regardless of what happens. Also, it is almost impossible.

       True. I wonder about that every time a cabinet member is fired. Are they establishment moles trying to disrupt real changes being routed out by Trump? Or are they trying to stop something nefarious being attempted by the administration? And it's looking more and more like the former IMO.

       The bad thing is, even if Trump's motives are nobel (and I do have my doubts), it sets precedence so that an actual tyrant can silence political enemies. Dangerous stuff.

       How about neither? Trump is throwing his weight around, it is quite literally his style. He has cemented the place of his dynasty in the American Empire. There will obviously be push back from the other power brokers in the establishment. His cabinet members are being fired because they're being ripped to pieces by a concentrated effort to oppose the injection of Trump's faction into the establishment. This could be a real conflict, or a farce to add a sense of legitimacy to Trump's "swamp draining" as it were. If it is real, you have to ask yourself why he is being met with such opposition. Of all of those possible answers to this question, Trump wanting to do good for the American people is at the bottom of my list. My top answer right now is because Trump's campaigning
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       the existing establishment is a direct attack on the public opinion of said establishment. If the POTUS campaigns on no longer accepting the status quo, the American people will rally behind upheaving whatever power structures are presented to them as "status quo" by those factions that claim to represent them. This gives Trump grounds for a legitimate domination of this state monopoly capitalism which defines contemporary American Empire.

       While I completely understand where you're coming from with that, based off of Trump's character traits and the long, well documented record he has of being a narcissistic asshole that cares purely for himself and his status, I very, very seriously doubt Trump is not just inserting his faction into the web of state monopoly capitalism that is The Western Empire like practically all of the administrations before him have done (at least within the last 50 years IMO). The biggest difference here is that Trump's slashing and burning is masked by a veil of populism. If nothing else, Trump's election has shown me that without a shadow of a doubt two things hold true about the human condition.

       I think the whole Satanism obsession is really just a reflection of the mentality of many of the Christian members of our community. Anything that is spiritual in nature that isn't Christianity is considered Satanic to them, particularly all things even remotely occult in nature.

       From her Wikipedia page.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Abramović worked with Jacob Samuel to produce a cookbook of "aphrodisiac recipes" called Spirit Cooking in 1996. These "recipes" were meant to be "evocative instructions for actions or for thoughts."[23] For example, one of the recipes calls for "13,000 grams of jealousy," while another says to "mix fresh breast milk with fresh sperm milk."[24] The work was inspired by the popular belief that ghosts feed off intangible things like light, sound, and emotions.[25]"

       She's an artist. There are real criminal occult groups, some the FBI has investigated extensively. This person is not that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole Satanic obsession blows the relevancy of Satanism in American culture, particularly elite cultural, way out of proportion.

       Right.  I'm tired of the mental gymnastics... but people have been able to get away with murder for 30+ years, and the one guy who might try to enforce the law will get labeled as a dictator.... and there will be the biggest psychological break in history among coastal elites, wine moms and gays.

       True. I wonder about that every time a cabinet member is fired. Are they establishment moles trying to disrupt real changes being routed out by Trump? Or are they trying to stop something nefarious being attempted by the administration? And it's looking more and more like the former IMO.

       While I completely understand where you're coming from with that, based off of Trump's character traits and the long, well documented record he has of being a narcissistic asshole that cares purely for himself and his status, I very, very seriously doubt Trump is not just inserting his faction into the web of state monopoly capitalism that is The Western Empire like practically all of the administrations before him have done (at least within the last 50 years IMO). The biggest difference here is that Trump's slashing and burning is masked by a veil of populism. If nothing else, Trump's election has shown me that without a shadow of a doubt two things hold true about the human condition.
