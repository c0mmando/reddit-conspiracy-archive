    <div class="md"><p>How about neither? Trump is throwing his weight around, it is quite literally his style. He has cemented the place of his dynasty in the American Empire. There will obviously be push back from the other power brokers in the establishment. His cabinet members are being fired because they&#39;re being ripped to pieces by a concentrated effort to oppose the injection of Trump&#39;s faction into the establishment. This could be a real conflict, or a farce to add a sense of legitimacy to Trump&#39;s &quot;swamp draining&quot; as it were. If it is real, you have to ask yourself why he is being met with such opposition. Of all of those possible answers to this question, Trump wanting to do good for the American people is at the bottom of my list. My top answer right now is because Trump&#39;s campaigning <em>against</em> the existing establishment is a direct attack on the public opinion of said establishment. If the POTUS campaigns on no longer accepting the status quo, the American people will rally behind upheaving whatever power structures are presented to them as &quot;status quo&quot; by those factions that claim to represent them. This gives Trump grounds for a legitimate domination of this state monopoly capitalism which defines contemporary American Empire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I completely understand where you&#39;re coming from with that, based off of Trump&#39;s character traits and the long, well documented record he has of being a narcissistic asshole that cares purely for himself and his status, I very, very seriously doubt Trump is not just inserting his faction into the web of state monopoly capitalism that is The Western Empire like practically all of the administrations before him have done (at least within the last 50 years IMO). The biggest difference here is that Trump&#39;s slashing and burning is masked by a veil of populism. If nothing else, Trump&#39;s election has shown me that without a shadow of a doubt two things hold true about the human condition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the whole Satanism obsession is really just a reflection of the mentality of many of the Christian members of our community.

    <div class="md"><p>From her Wikipedia page.</p>

<p>&quot;Abramović worked with Jacob Samuel to produce a cookbook of &quot;aphrodisiac recipes&quot; called Spirit Cooking in 1996. These &quot;recipes&quot; were meant to be &quot;evocative instructions for actions or for thoughts.&quot;[23] For example, one of the recipes calls for &quot;13,000 grams of jealousy,&quot; while another says to &quot;mix fresh breast milk with fresh sperm milk.&quot;[24] The work was inspired by the popular belief that ghosts feed off intangible things like light, sound, and emotions.[25]&quot;</p>

<p>She&#39;s an artist. There are real criminal occult groups, some the FBI has investigated extensively. This person is not that.</p>

<p>The whole Satanic obsession blows the relevancy of Satanism in American culture, particularly elite cultural, way out of proportion.</p>
