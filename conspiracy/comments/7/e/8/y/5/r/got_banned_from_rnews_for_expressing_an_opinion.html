        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is why I never get involved in politics or religious debates on reddit but I came across such an absurdly close minded comment on the holocaust and people upvoting it to hell that I just couldn&#39;t resist lol </p>

<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Still blows my mind that people genuinely think the Holocaust didn&#39;t happen </p>

<p><strong>My Reply:</strong> &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that people don&#39;t believe it happened. Most people believe it happened but just not to the ridiculous extend the official pro-zionist narrative claims. The official holocaust story is full of debunked propaganda and outrageous lies told before, during and after WW2 to get worldwide sympathy so Zionist European jews could utilize political leverage to justify theft of land that didn&#39;t belong to them via the creation of state of Israel. A state that from the day of its creation has become one of the most corrupt &amp; biggest human rights violators in modern times with it&#39;s sole mission being to ethnically cleanse Palestinians so they can expand Israeli held territory to fullfil some bullshit prophecy about an upcoming messiah LMAO. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what really blows my mind that these nutters not only think they are God&#39;s gift to the world but have been looting and killing innocent people for untold decades over some bullshit childlike fairy-tale about ruling the world as a jewish race when their favorite little messiah decides to get off his ass and show his face on Earth. All religions are silly and nonsensical but judaism is a true comedian when it comes to inventing bullshit. Also you may want to look into <strong>Red Cross&#39;s official report on the holocaust published after WW2 that officially states that according to their research and surveys only about 250,000 jews died in WW2 - most of which died from disease, poverty and starvation not because they were taking showers in mythical gas chambers</strong>. </p>

<p>Most people are left with no choice but to question the official holocaust narrative since unjust laws have been invented to silence and imprison people who dare question the official holocaust narrative. If holocaust really happened the way it&#39;s reported officially then why force people by law to believe your narrative? It makes no sense except these laws are there to protect the holocaust propaganda and the interests of Israel since if the truth was to come forth about the holocaust being a zionist political propaganda operation then the global backlash would probably spell the end of Israel.&quot;</p>

<p>I was being objective and only wrote what I felt was well documented already. But nope, within an instant of posting I got a barrage of downvotes and moderators of r/news calling me a nazi and banning me forever. Funny thing about this whole affair is...I&#39;M JEWISH! LMAO</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s better to keep those kind of discussions for places with like-minded people, instead of the no-minded people who go to subs like news and politics. </p>

<p>Your post is very informative and well delivered, and if someone read that without prior knowledge then it should encourage them to research the topic, but unfortunately it doesn&#39;t. In fact it simply scares them and they instantly pass it off as crazy and call you racist or a conspiracy theorist. And that&#39;s because they have been designed to do that, and I honestly think that for the majority of people, nothing can change their minds, until they are told by the news that it&#39;s true.</p>

<p>And the saddest part is the next time someone brings up a theory that they don&#39;t like, the process repeats. They cannot be convinced and they won&#39;t think for themselves. Anyway rant over.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You are referring to  <strong>beurkundete Sterbefälle</strong>, which are registrations made (mainly) ** by relatives** to registry offices in Germany after the war in order to <strong>to certify a death</strong> of a relative who died in a concentration camp. So it needed an active approach to get this certificate.</p>

<p>The Red Cross did not publish an <em>official report</em> by their own research, but in fact published these official numbers provided by German registry office. </p>

<p>Never was is it however claimed that these number would be the total death toll during the holocaust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please keep in mind that the Beurkundete SterbefälleRed statistics that were published were not only about jewish deaths in concentration camps from 1939 - 1945 but were in fact stats about all Germans, not just jewish folks, who died in the camps. Which means the actual jewish deaths in the camps were far less than 250,000. Red Cross did publish reports, in fact many reports, they have to compile such reports on events if for nothing else than for sake of their own proof to show the world where their resources and money were being spent and their role in the war etc. </p>

<p>The point I was trying to make is that the official holocaust narrative is a propaganda material that stretches facts and falsifies statistics to deliver a more dramatic emotional effect on people whose opinions it is trying to mold. </p>

<p>6 million jews dead is a myth and that is why no proof of it has been found yet and never will. 6 million wiped out by a comic book type villain who is hungry for world domination is more powerful as a selling point than say 300,000 jews dead due to disease, hunger, malnutrition and poverty.  </p>

<p>This is a pretty good articles on how the 6 million dead jews agenda was being pushed into newspapers and magazines as far back as the start of the 1899 to justify the creation of a zionist state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In fact, tt really does not matter if among those &quot;Beurkundete Sterbefälle&quot; are jews at all. You were using it as an argument to support your claim, that the number may be greatly exaggerated. </p>

<p>But all the Red Cross provided are the numbers which were certified by german registry offices. 
e.g. : If the Red Cross, went to a Concentration camp directly after the war and counted 10 dead bodies but registry offices would provide 0 beurkundete Sterbefälle, be it as no one claimed the body or no matching record of the body were found at the concentration camp. Those dead bodies would not be included in that statistic for beurkundete Sterbefälle. </p>

<p>If there are other <em>researches</em> being done by the Red Cross, please don&#39;t hesitate to provide a link. I am always open to any new investigations. </p>

<p>That excuse or &quot;best friends a Jew&quot; excuse card is always conveniently placed on the table by Israel-phobes. You say you are Jewish but you speak like an Arab Supremacist or a Proleptic Dhimmi White guy who pines for ridiculous Arab victimization. This situation of fake Jew commenter who is israel phobic is seemingly a daily occurrence as I am witnessing. Trolls be abound. If you were Jewish, you wouldn&#39;t bother being anonymous and would project your anti-Israel tendencies towards Jewish Voice For Peace volunteer work. This JVP work would actually be more convincing albeit entirely misguided given that Palestinians are only one and half generations old and are descendants of colonialists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if I question an historical event or question the senseless killing of non-jews at the hands of Israel I cannot be a Jew according to you?! It just shows how brainwashed you are with zionist propaganda. No true Jew who believes in Torah can support a murderer like Israel.

<p>Then you dont have faith in the Torah and aren&#39;t Jewish. The Torah says that Israel is the land of the Jews. 
Those stories in Torah are in Judea and Samaria (West bank). Those stories were at the Temple Mount. Jews dont want to be in submission to the rules of Islam by non-Muslims before one is actually living under a Muslim ruler like you think they should. What would happen if Judea, Samaria and the Temple Mount were given up? The Jews would be expelled as the PA has stated. You are supporting forced expulsion. You hate Israel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>murderer ... Israel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Israel has had less bloodshed now then it had in the 1980&#39;s when it ran Judea and Samaria without Palestinian police intervention. Meanwhile The rest of the middle East is falling apart. Benjamin Netanyahu has offered to let Abbas come and speak to the Israeli Parliament and forge peace. When is Abbas coming? Can you call him?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The BDS Anti-Zionists like you use comments just like the White nationalists antisemites who use tiki torches to light up Charlottesville march. Of course its anti-semitic and you are not remotely Jewish.</p>

<p>Under SA apartheid or &quot;Jim Crow&quot; laws: there were separate facilities for whites and blacks: separate public washrooms, separate parks, separate drinking fountains, separate restaurants, etc.</p>

<p>All these do not exist in Israel.</p>

<p>Under SA apartheid or Jim Crow: blacks had no voice in government or in the courts; they couldn&#39;t be part of mainstream society in politics, professions, the army or police.</p>

<p>In Israel: Arabs vote, work in any profession anywhere, including the army or the police, as lawyers and judges; non-Jewish judges were in the courts that sent a former president of Israel and a former prime minister to prison in Israel! Arabs serve in the Israeli parliament, the Knesset. Arabs can visit any park, beach or public facility. They can buy property almost anywhere if they chose to do so. Visit Israeli hospitals and you&#39;ll see Arab and Jewish doctors and nurses working side by side, on Arab and Jewish patients in the same wards and rooms.</p>

<p>The official language of Israel is Hebrew… and Arabic. All the street signs are in Hebrew, Arabic and English.</p>

<p>Where does the ethnic cleansing by being &quot;second class citizen&quot; myth come from? From the same source that the medieval blood libel against Jews came from: ignorance, prejudice, jealousy, pre-conceived stereotypical racist stigma, and from political or religious indoctrination that give an excuse to hate Jews.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Talmudo-na(zi)onist propaganda</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is why your ideas will never defeat Israel since you do not understand the Jewish mind. Its all with proof in the Talmud, right? No, its the Torah.</p>

<p>Alternative reality. 4x Palestinian increase in population since 1947.</p>

<p>Jews are not associated with such crimes of ethnic cleansing or genocide, in fact, the UN said last month that Shia Assad gassed Sunni Arabs 24x and the western world did nothing! Israel attacked the ethnic cleansing gas factories within a few hours of the confirmation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re lying about the red cross&#39;s report, which may be why you were banned.  I&#39;m not sure what the rules are on those sub-reddits.  But since even a cursory amount of research will reveal that the dispute over the red cross report is literally nothing more than a fabrication, its possible they assumed you were purposefully lying.  There&#39;s even a wikipedia section which compiles many sources discussing the fabrication, so even a person with no familiarity with the subject could have discovered your lie in about 5 seconds:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Holocaust_denial#International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Holocaust_denial#International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m sure this will be down-voted without comment or you&#39;ll say something like wikipedia isn&#39;t a source, even though that section has tons of citations which you could look at.  Were you lying or did you actually just never even bother checking on the lie you are parroting?  </p>

It just shows how brainwashed you are with zionist propaganda. No true Jew who believes in Torah can support a murderer like Israel.
