    <div class="md"><p>It is likely all related. JP was helping to keep the galactics fed. The galactics figured out cloning of O-neg tissue and no longer need babies, JP and the Clinton Foundation are part of a global clusterfuck of a glut of children they were moving and can&#39;t dispose of because they were cut off.</p>

<p>This is why JP knows about UFOs, because he <em>does know</em>. He&#39;s complicit in keeping them fed. He likely had breaks in his decades of working for these folks when he sought truth and tried to be the better person.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think they have to manufacture any theories for criminals. I am also sure that announcing UFO information or a promise to, was an attempt to get the people out of their moms basement and vote who want UFOs to be real. I’d be more incline to want to know about ET than UFOs, UFOs are just unidentified, whether it be alien interstellar space travelers or some idea of a new aircraft technology we built or attempted to perfect. Sounds like bs to me, show us the elements, show us the precious alien technology and I’ll be happy. All the secrecy is just screwy and there isn’t a need for any of it in 2017. More people don’t trust the government now than ever. I don’t know why we got to this position in life, but I don’t believe anyone about anything. I know most Americans are pretty dumb to the ideas of anything because we are mostly worried about putting food on the table and keeping up with gas prices. We for sure have zero free time to even look around and take in the environment. Small percentage do. Majority just scrap by in life and want to just enjoy life. Free of harassment from the police and government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So my perspective is simple.. we as Americans utilize these forums and social medias to get the things that are bothering us off of our chests. Mostly in an attempt to stay sane. To be honest I sit and become stir crazy just thinking about life and where we are as a nation. I feel like I’m in prison. With that being said we bash politicians and leaders we’ve elected as officials let’s say for something as small as treasurer or city mayor. But we really have no clue what these people are doing. How can anyone who don’t know the price of milk, or how much gas is run our country? How long has it been since even our current president cleaned his own home, raised kids alone, worked two jobs barely surviving or pumped his own gas, i wouldn’t be surprised they (elite personnel) wipe their own ass..  Nothing against our president I’m just saying these people aren’t proper representation of the people. But we complain rather than actually doing something about it. I dislike groups like antifa and the kkk, BLM, and others just to name a few prominent ones.. but they have organized and said what they want and are willing to fight for it. Most Americans walk around trying to get by and not piss off people or look like an asshole to most for having an opinion. I’m completely desensitized to all the bs and just sit wondering what happens next. This is my only outlet, I exclude myself from all other social media platforms. Sorry for the rant.. getting away from what was written previously. But yes.. we all get together and talk but it seems it only gets us by for that hour or that minute until we get empty again. I would love for (insert politician here) to get caught up in criminal activity and me myself as the American voter and backbone of the nation be able to go remove him/her myself from office because I put them there. Power needs to be given back to the people not hypothetically in a political way, but sincerely, physically and mentally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I almost feel like you should get a conversation going about this. I mostly agree with you aboiut thw majority scraping by and using things like this to get the stress of their chest. The occupy movement was once our biggest hope to finally try to address it, but it got a media blackout and shut down. But even worse, the conversation never happened. Just randoms on the internet dropping the &quot;its the rich vs the poor&quot;. We need that discussion to really happen. Not just for people to look at the proof but really understand. That is the biggest conversation to have for people to really care about the Panama Papers, transfer of wealth, the banking system, insider trading, resource deals in the CFR, black market control versus overt market. Theres so much that stems off of this one foundational topic.</p>
