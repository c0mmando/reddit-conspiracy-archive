        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Skipping all the divisive junk about Holocaust revision or outright Neo Nazi praise, I want to point something out.</p>

<p>Why, whenever Hitler is discussed at all, does everything have to focus on Jews and the Holocaust?  Hitler did a ton of other evil shit, he had detailed ideas about Marxism and economic policy.  He had ideas about social policy and surveillance and propaganda too.</p>

<p>The <em>truth</em> is because killing Jews <em>is the only thing Hitler did that the allies did not immediately adopt and implement</em> after defeating him.</p>

<p>He was the first NeoCon.  He understood an impossible enemy and he need for constant war.  He understood mass propaganda and surveillance for societal control.  He understood dependence on the state.</p>

<p>The west adopted everything.  Except for killing Jews.   That is why this is the only thing about Hitler anyone is supposed to know.</p>

<p>Edit:  And does it really make much difference that the Nazis did human experiments on Jews but the USA did it on black people (among others) instead!?  Really changes the evil, right?</p>

<p>Oh, and “spreading democracy” lol, if the Nazis has referred to the Holocaust as “helping Jews” would that make it the truth!?</p>

<p>Like I said, I&#39;m not interested in defending neo-conservatism, which I disagree with vehemently, but the goal of neoconservatives, ill-fated or not, is to spread Democracy. The goal of the Third Reich was lebensraum for a race of people. They couldn&#39;t be more different.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not downplaying murder.  I am saying that there is <em>more</em> to look at than murder.</p>

<p>Are you even aware of Hitler’s grand plans for the world?  Probably not because you view it in the context of Nazis and what is publicly told even though the truth is not secret or hidden but by societal norms.</p>

<p>Hitler didn’t really have any plans that would allow the Reich to extent beyond his life right?  He was a madman and obsessed with murder and all his generals were infighting, right?  If the Nazis had won, the regime would have fallen into shambles quickly, right?</p>

<p>That is what we are told.</p>

<p>But, Operation paperclip is well known.  Werner Von Braun isn’t a secret.  The Nazi doctors and psychologists (the most evil of <em>all</em> these are the ones who experimented on humans) were a bit more hidden but it isn’t conspiracy how much of the research was studied and aided modern medicine.</p>

<p>But, put it all together...</p>

<p>The Third Reich was not poised to fail or be falsely propped up with a bubble economy and the proof is everywhere around you.</p>

<p>The <em>great majority</em> of US scientific and medical breakthroughs from 1946 onward, as well as in “advertising” and media <em>came from the Nazis.</em>. We are <em>living in the world they were designing</em> except for the genocide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, that’s just it - the people who funded what became the Nazi war machine effectively dictated the outcome. We can’t ignore their contributions and pretend as though it has little to no bearing on the result. Investors don’t make investments without expecting a return. So, I’ll pose another question; could the breakthrough have been achieved without the funding that allowed it to happen? </p>

<p>I think we have to look at who and what created Nazi Germany to have any sort of real understanding of what the 20th century actually was, because clearly, Hitler couldn’t have had the success he was to achieve in such a short period of time without help. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But again, I was not the first to use a &quot;name&quot; (labels). You attempt to change said names. So, what you are suggesting is that Hitler is a Neo-Con by definition, yet it does not fit and the policies were and remain completely different.</p>

<p>Reality is one is socialist, the other... not so much. It&#39;s two completely different groups, different ideologies no matter if you wish to play the name (labels) game or not.</p>

<p>The dispute that brought Hitler to power was communist against socialist.</p>

<p>Names do matter, otherwise, there would be no significant difference between Obama and Trump! Each has their own definition making them different, as are their policies and methodology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I will try this one last time, if you don’t agree that is fine.</p>

<p>The methods that the Neo-Cons have used during their domination are all based on the methods that Hitler’s regime used.  There are others that did as well, but the parallels here are clear and the fact that we took all of the Nazi’s top thinkers after the war is evidence that it wasn’t any coincidence.</p>

<p>The entire Cold War and all of our proxy wars “against communism” were based on Hitler’s plans to suppress Communism (of course he based it on being a system the Jews were using to take over).  Read Hitler’s writings about Bolshevism and how it must be eradicated and then read US (such as Kissinger) writings about policy towards the spread of Communism.</p>

<p>Compare domestic agendas and propaganda, especially during the Cold War.  Compare Goebbel’s writings on propaganda and the sudden post war boom in the advertising/marketing industry in America.</p>

<p>Read Nazi writings about the need for constant war even if engineered and compare to NeoCon policies about Geopolitics and he Military Industrial Complex.</p>

<p>Read about how we adapted so much of Nazi science, NASA wouldn’t exist if not for them, and about how happy pharma companies and medical researchers were about Nazi human experiments....</p>

<p>We are living in the world that Hitler and his top thinkers envisioned and laid the groundwork for.</p>

<p>And also be glad that when the Nazis fell, America was smart and fast enough to take more of the spoils than USSR did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read and studied everything you&#39;ve posted, but these same tactics are used by both sides, not just neo-cons.</p>

<p>Yes, NASA was the brainchild of these German scientist and as you said.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I agree, but if memory serves me well, the liberal makeup of congress joined in and supported said game with their votes. You had dissent on both sides by the few, but the majority under both parties use the same. It took the majority for such crimes to come to fruition.</p>

<p>From this we see that they are all in on the same game.</p>

<p>Obama has used the same methodologies during his administration, just a bit more covert and even overthrew more sovereign countries in the middle east.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and about how happy pharma companies and medical researchers were about Nazi human experiments....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Funny, eugenics was the brain child of the liberals of the US and Hitler even praised and looked to implementing it in not only Germany, but the world. He thought it was great. Guess who is still pushing eugenics? The entire argument of a woman&#39;s right to choose (abortion) is nothing more than a form of sterilization after the fact. Eugenics as stated by Margret Sanger.</p>

<p>Margret Sanger had the same ideology as Hitler and the NAZI&#39;s. Eliminate the &quot;unwanted&quot; or less worthy and was/remains racist. Where are most abortion clinics? Black neighborhoods! Maybe a master race agenda? Now, you want to talk NAZI propaganda, look to the left concerning this topic. It reeks of Hitler.</p>

<p>As far as pharma, I totally agree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are living in the world that Hitler and his top thinkers envisioned and laid the groundwork for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again I agree in part, but just covered the rest of the story. Let&#39;s revisit Margret Sanger and a handful of quotes.</p>

<p>*1 She proposed allowing Congress to solve “population problems” by appointing a “Parliament of Population.”</p>

<p>*2 Sanger called the various methods of population control, including abortion, “defending the unborn against their own disabilities.” —“A Plan for Peace,” Birth Control Review, April 1932, pages 107-108</p>

<p>*3  Sanger advocated “a stern and rigid policy of sterilization and segregation to that grade of population whose progeny is already tainted, or whose inheritance is such that objectionable traits may be transmitted to offspring.” —“A Plan for Peace,” Birth Control Review, April 1932, pages 107-108</p>

<p>I could literally do this for hours on this topic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And where I was talking about names and labels, neocons “spread democracy and fight communism”. The Nazis didn’t say they were building an evil empire, Hitler claimed to be “liberating the aryan race and fighting the scourge of Jewish Bolshevism.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds like Margret Sanger... right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Labels are irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not according to what I&#39;ve posted here, and unless you want to dismiss reality. You are the one who first used labels or names for groups of people, not me, but reality is labels are a way for us to identify groups that take to and embrace certain positions. </p>

<p>So, let me elaborate.</p>

<p>I strongly disagree with neo-cons, leftist, liberals and Mainstream GOP in general. They are all full of these damaging ideologies, and we are seeing the result of them today as out country declines.</p>

<p>Here is a quote that you may be interested in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The argument that the two parties should represent opposed ideals and policies, one, perhaps, of the Right and the other of the Left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to doctrinaire and academic thinkers. Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American people can ‘throw the rascals out’ at any election without leading to any profound or extensive shifts in policy </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Georgetown University Professor Carroll Quigley, Tragedy and Hope, 1966.)</p>

<p>I do believe this is more telling of the truth than any one sided argument. </p>

<p>Thank you for a civil conversation even if we don&#39;t agree on everything. It&#39;s much appreciated.</p>
