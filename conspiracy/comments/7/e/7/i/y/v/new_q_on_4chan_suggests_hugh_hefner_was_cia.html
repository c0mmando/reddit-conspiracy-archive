<blockquote>
<p>Who really controls the MSM?</p>

<p>Why are we made to believe the MSM are the only credible news sources?</p>

<p>Why is this relevant?</p>

<p>Why are non MSM platforms cast as conspiracy and/or non-credible?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>MSM equals mainstream media. A lot of people just define MSM as corporate owned and that&#39;s fine... but I came up with a different angle.</p>

<p>To me, the key difference is structural. All MSM information sources work the same way. Info is collected (or generated) by a small number of people, then disseminated (in a one way direction) to a very large number of people.</p>

<p>Non MSM basically equals the internet. The difference is that information is gathered by a much larger number of people. It is then transmitted much more directly to large numbers of people. Communication is also direct and the flow of information is in multiple directions. Info providers often get feedback from the reader, readers talk to other readers, readers comments/tips may get feedback from the original provider.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s consider what that means. MSM = outlet for a few news agencies and their BS. Sometimes a story comes from an irregular source and it&#39;s allowed coverage if it&#39;s good for ratings. MSM is dual-purpose structured so that information can be controlled as well as released.</p>

<p>The internet is structured and used in a way that makes it almost impossible to control the flow or keep something secret.</p>

<p>This is the real reason why are we made to believe the MSM is the only credible news sources. As soon as you realize what&#39;s going on, the MSM becomes obsolete. The internet has an unrestricted menu of information available to anybody 24/7. It also lets you contribute and communicate directly with other people who share your interest or are making their own contributions. Why would anyone choose the MSM over that?</p>

<p>This is why we&#39;re getting the &quot;fake news&quot; narrative. This is why they&#39;re working so hard to eliminate net neutrality. They don&#39;t want competing narratives and competing sources of information. They don&#39;t want people talking to each other, sharing observations and comparing notes.</p>

<p>They lost a bit of control and they want it back.</p>

<p>This Q person might not have all the answers, but is definitely asking some good questions.</p>

<p>To be fair, it&#39;s really easy to publish a story that everyone wants to be true and then it circulates like wildfire.  Media requires a strong reputation to release important stories or it becomes too simple to dismiss these as fake news because it&#39;s not a credible outlet.</p>

<p>MSM has gone on to abuse their reputation to push their own fake news.  MSM is full of fake news.  Independent media is full of fake news.  Getting good information is practically impossible in this day and age.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bc people need to find out for themselves. The people chosen and trusted to GIVE us answers have been found to have been bought off, coerced, blackmailed, or have found to be ethically devoid. </p>

<p>The answers, when given, are summed up too simply, this is too vast a network,  for people to only be given one flat out quick easy answer. Even if Q were to suddenly start spewing his guts, everyone should then be researching WHAT he was informing us to. And WHY. Him TELLING you the answers takes your own reasoning ability, your responsibility for the information, out of the equation. You are, intentionally or not, asking for someone to make an easily digestable, not too emotional synapsis of current events, where if YOU were to research the questions, YOU would have no choice but to invest MORE time in researching, your conscience would not only demand it, your brain, heart, and spirit would all unanimously agree. </p>

<p>To sum things up, research is learning for yourself, finding truth... Trusting others to overlook their own bias, their own agendas, their own stance, to give YOU the truth, is lazy and unethical. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tony Podesta is powerful and well-connected enough that I&#39;d imagine he&#39;d know whether an indictment is looming <em>well</em> before Q Anon (or any of us) would. </p>

<p>My problem is less with &quot;Q Anon&quot; and more with <em>this forum&#39;s obsession</em> with Q Anon. We critically, vigilantly question every single media source that gets posted here, whether it be the <em>New York Times</em> and the BBC, or Infowars and YourNewsWire. And yet, somehow, &quot;Q Anon&quot; is completely immune to this skepticism, and faces absolutely no critical questioning whatsoever.</p>

<p>In fact, people here continue to lap up 4chan poster&#39;s word as gospel, despite him having 1.) never provided us any proof of his identity 2.) never provided us with any new information, and 3.) never given us any unknown insight into unfolding world events.</p>

<p>And any time I point this out, one of three things happen:</p>

<p>1.) I&#39;m told that Q Anon is an amazing source of information, despite all the evidence/facts to the contrary.</p>

<p>2.) I&#39;m told &quot;So what if he&#39;s a LARP? He&#39;s getting people talking!&quot; despite the fact that his posts aren&#39;t being shared or discussed as if they&#39;re a fun LARP; they&#39;re constantly treated as though they&#39;re fact. (Not to mention you can &quot;get people talking&quot; without spreading posts making unverified-at-best, totally-false-at-worst claims)</p>

<p>3.) All his false statements are either qualified or ignored, and vague statements about major news stories are treated like premonitions. I&#39;m told &quot;What if Podesta <em>was</em> indicted, and they killed the story before it leaked to the press on 11/4?&quot;; his vague questions on SA somehow gets retconned into him predicting the jailing of the princes; his terribly inaccurate history of the Democratic party/voter patterns gets totally ignored; etc.</p>

<p>Until Q Anon either provides verification, or provides information that turns out to be irrefutably true (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PanamaPapers/comments/77n6ix/do_not_give_up_more_is_coming/?st=J9NQQT8E&amp;amp;sh=92b7cb62">the way this anonymous journalist</a> provided information about the Paradise Papers weeks before they published), I refuse to view him as anything more than a 4chan shitposter who cold-reads <em>juuuuust</em> well enough to con an audience eager to eat up as much pro-Trump fan fiction as they possibly can.</p>

<p>Yes, but out of nowhere he&#39;d see lots of people cheering, waiting and prophesying that he&#39;s gonna get indicted. He would have to <em>ask</em> someone whether he is or isn&#39;t, which would mean he&#39;s scared/concerned.

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry if I went on a bit of a tangent. However, your observation (which I know is &quot;tinfoil hat&quot;/not particularly serious) requires taking Q Anon seriously, which I just cannot do, for all the reasons I stated above.</p>

<p>As for your follow-up: I don&#39;t think anyone in Tony Podesta&#39;s circle is going to be approaching him saying &quot;Hey, I read on YourNewsWire that a guy on 4chan says you&#39;re gonna be indicted,&quot; nor do I think such reports &quot;scare&quot; him. If anonymous internet trolls scared powerful people, the Clintons would be too terrified to leave the house.</p>

<p>Besides, to go back to my earlier point: these types of people (far more wealthy and powerful than we can fathom) already have access to the most inside of inside information. This sort of nonsense probably doesn&#39;t even filter up to them, and if it does, it gets screened out as noise. Trust me, people like the Podestas already have as much information as they possibly can have; and they&#39;re powerful enough that they won&#39;t face sleepless nights over a 4chan shitposter predicting an imminent indictment.</p>
