        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As many of you may know, the FCC is voting to overturn Net Neutrality this Wednesday. You may be thinking &quot;weird, I usually see this all over reddit and social media whenever a vote like this comes up.&quot; That&#39;s very true, but why haven&#39;t we seen it all over this time? Social media is being bogged down by the Hollywood sex scandals.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my own personal theory that some very high-up officials in either the FCC or one of the large Telecom companies (or multiple) used their influence and money to begin blowing up this scandal. Harvey Weinstein was an easy target and thus the first to be hit. The FCC/Telecoms knew it would be a slippery slope once their first few sources began the accusations - and they were right. </p>

<p>Now media is being drowned by these scandals and the FCC is voting to overturn Net Neutrality.</p>

<p>Anyways, who knows if it&#39;s true, and I don&#39;t have any evidence, but it&#39;s just what I believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the government perpetrated 9/11 to protect one old guy from a murder investigation that was eventually thrown out of court (which it would have been, anyway, regardless of events).</p>

<p>This is not a comment on whether or not Kissinger had anything to do with the murder of Rene Schneider, but I wanted to call you out on the sheer ludicrousness of this statement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s why the date was set for the 10th, is my suspicion. I know judges are corrupt.  I’m also considering that managing PR / scandals are factors too. Kissinger is the most egregious living war criminal on record and that was being publicized in the summer of 2001 by Hitchens</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, there’s no Illuminati meeting about “What we are getting Reddit to talk about today.” All the things on here about false flags and “deep government” people trying to make us talk about one thing while another goes on is all BS and frankly every time I see a thread about it I get a little embarrassed. Go explain net neutrality and how it’s being taken away to your average person. They’ll say “Of course, that’s how America works. It was set up to be that way.” And work harder to pay the big tele-com bills. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about the specific ties to Net Neutrality, but I&#39;ve also considered that the tidal wave of accusations about established Hollywood figures seems like some kind of campaign to undermine Hollywood&#39;s credibility.</p>

<p>I&#39;d certainly not dismiss out of hand any of the allegations or justify what went on, but sex as a transactional element in Hollywood is about as old as Hollywood, which makes me wonder why it would be challenged now.  It&#39;s also not like yucky behavior by men towards women is anything new or different.</p>

<p>If anything, I would have expected a campaign against sex abuse in Hollywood to have been a long-term kind of movement, started years ago and only reaching this kind of mass-expose point after years of small victories.</p>

<p>My best guess is that it&#39;s got some kind of powerful political force(s) behind it, the kind that want to neuter Hollywood&#39;s traditional liberal political advocacy.  A major scandal disrupts Hollywood&#39;s internal power structure as well as generally undermining their sense of credibility and moral authority.  Working against such a theory, though, is the fact that Congressional midterm elections are a year away and the public has a short memory.  It&#39;s possible that the reactions against the individuals are swift and permanent enough that, with new, anti-abuse leaders in positions of power that Hollywood regains its sense of moral authority.  And it seems unlikely that the people untouched by this scandal or openly critical of Hollywood who would obtain positions of power are really any less liberal than their predecessors -- in fact, they may be more likely to be crusading, activist-type figures.</p>
