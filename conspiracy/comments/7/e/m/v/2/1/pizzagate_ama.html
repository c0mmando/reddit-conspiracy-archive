       Dude, I'll be honest with you.  I was there on 4chan when the whole theory broke.  I was excited whenever something new came out.  I think there's a lot of weird stuff.  But, weird stuff isn't evidence.  And to be quite frank, we need more real solid evidence before we have a case.  Right now, we have nothing but bad-taste artwork.  Who knows, maybe someone will speak up soon.  I'm hoping so.  And the way sexual allegations are popping up right now, I'm even hopeful.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for now, as much as I hate it, she's right.  We got nothing.

       No, I didn't save any of the photos.  (Obviously.)  And even if I had, would you believe me if I said they were found on cometpingpong.com ?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's kinda what makes "proving" any of this very difficult.  No one in their right mind is going to "save" child porn.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to look at the meta data... i.e., the legal photos that surround the accusations, and ask yourself... is this reasonable behavior of a "family pizzashop owner" -- who just happens to be "the top 50 most influential people in DC":

       (aka #pedogate) is the new 9/11 rabbit hole -- i.e., yes, it's all (mostly) true -- and yes, difficult to swallow.  But yes...  it's very real -- i.e., there are real children who are being trafficked, raped and murdered right now through these channels., right now.

      <p>
       I was there from the beginning, there weren't any pictures. There was a part of the site with encrypted files, a user claimed to have cracked the code and found CP, this was never backed up and no evidence it was reported to LEO was ever shown.

       (aka #pedogate) is the new 9/11 rabbit hole -- i.e., yes, it's all (mostly) true -- and yes, difficult to swallow.  But yes...  it's very real -- i.e., there are real children who are being trafficked, raped and murdered right now through these channels. (really... right now.)

       And it needs to be stopped.

       If you were there when it broke, then you would've seen the instructions posted to access the login page at Comet Ping Pong's site and you wouldn't be making this silly post.
      </p>
      <p>
       FEC paperwork and the network of money laundering nodes is obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Combine that with the blatant occultism and obvious pedophile references, and you have Pizzagate, where people like Hastert, Kloman, Epstein, etc are in this social circle and nobody is asking where these pedophiles are getting their victims?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, you've got Kamala and Maya Harris neck deep in Alefantis' business, where we are now learning this social circle is taking money from Ruben Vardanyan fronts... aka Russian collusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, the Saudi element, where Alefantis got his property, is also tied to the covert politics that the news won't talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Foreign powers are paying to have more say in American politics than Americans and James Alefantis is a part of that puzzle. He has Russian rubles and Saudi rivals and advertises stacks of foreign currency on his instagram with babies and pills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Protected political pedophilia is real and Alefantis is involved.

       And how does any of that prove that PG is real?   Let's say all those things you've said are true.  How does that PROVE PG?  You can't prove any of those things, let alone connect them to PG.  Even if those things are true, it's all circumstantial evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, I get it.  I think PG is real.  But we have to look at this pragmatically.  We got nothing.  Until someone on the inside speaks up?  We'll have nothing.  Get over it.

       No. And you're suggesting brigading which "should" get you banned.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is - pizzagate isn't going away. They can Streisand it all they want, but it's just leading to more Streisand'ing. There's no need for us to interfere at this point.

       (aka #pedogate) is the new 9/11 rabbit hole -- i.e., yes, it's all (mostly) true -- and yes, difficult to swallow.  But yes...  it's very real -- i.e., there are real children who are being trafficked, raped and murdered right now through these channels. (really... right now.)

       And it needs to be stopped.
