    <div class="md"><p>Many subs ban us on sight if we&#39;ve <em>ever</em> posted on T_D. I&#39;ve also learned long ago that even the subs who do technically allow me to post there will typically heavily downvote and attack me if they find out I&#39;ve ever posted on T_D. r/politics used to be like that (I think they&#39;re getting better, though). For that reason, I even go so far as use different VPN providers when logging into my non-T_D accounts, so that even the admins would have a hard time ever linking my T_D accounts (like this one) to my non-T_D accounts.</p>

<p>r/conspiracy is rare in terms of being open to contributors from all sides, as long as they have open minds and a shared interest. For all the problems we&#39;ve had with mods this year, I nonetheless think they are doing a great job on being sure to welcome participation from all corners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I applaud you for at least looking at both sides of an argument. There should be more people who think critically about both sides, I don&#39;t think people should do it to sway their own opinions necessarily, but it&#39;s never a bad thing to try and gather as much information as possible before deciding where they stand on a topic.</p>

<p>That being said T_D isn&#39;t always the best place to go for that kind of thing, as I probably share the same views as most on that subreddit, it is an echo chamber for the right as much as Reddit in general is an echo chamber for the left. There aren&#39;t many places you can go though to find a good amount of moderation from both sides sadly.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been going through the /new queue for a bit now to see what OP was on about, and it&#39;s a combination of all NN posts being squashed and suppression in the opposite direction OP claims. Apparently the mods have taken the stance that pretty much all NN posts should go away while we&#39;re being brigaded, but in the comments anything anti-NN is getting downvoted immediately. Looks like a major brigade at the moment. I don&#39;t actually know what the president&#39;s stance is on NN, I can&#39;t remember seeing anything he&#39;s said about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In a nutshell. </p>

<p>Net Neutrality has been standard operating procedure for the internet since it&#39;s inception. </p>

<p>In 2015, Obama&#39;s FCC classified the internet in a way that basically made Net Neutrality permanent unless someone changed the FCC classification. </p>

<p>Now that Trump is in office, the GOP has control over the FCC and that means they&#39;re trying to change that classification. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s why it&#39;s a concern, if no one planned to abuse it, then there&#39;s no reason to change anything. If we leave things as they are now, ISPs continue to make money charging for internet access, but I&#39;d they change the classification, they can either go back to 2015 like you said OR they could take advantage of their newly aquired power and make some more money. It probably won&#39;t be instant, but they&#39;ll creep in each year with new &quot;services&quot; until you&#39;re paying more. </p>

<p>And anyone who thinks ATT and Verizon will just, out of the goodness of their hearts not abuse the privilege, hasn&#39;t been paying attention. </p>

<p>No, it literally doesn’t. It makes it so that the ISP can’t pick and choose winners. </p>

<p>It makes the internet an even playing field where a site like Reddit or Netflix can actually be created. </p>

<p>Imagine if Time Warner throttled Netflix to force people to use their own streaming service. That’s what NN stops. </p>

<p>Before 2002 the idea of Net Neutrality didn&#39;t exist. Everything was neutral, i.e all traffic was treated the same. Between 2002 and 2015 there were numerous challenges to NN. Many actors were trying to prioritize their content/bandwidth over others. For instance, VOIP traffic used a lot more bandwidth and they wanted to be prioritized.</p>

<p>This kept happening and kept getting shut down until 2015 when Tom Wheeler codified into a regulation that all broadband providers be classified as &quot;common carriers&quot;, i.e. they should be working like a gas/electric company moving any other resource through their infrastructure. This would once and for all put an end to the prioritization of web traffic.</p>

<p>Now, in 2017, we have the FCC <em>undoing</em> that regulation (designation) with the intent to finally NOT treat traffic as equal. This is not net neutrality, this is an end to net neutrality. It&#39;s now partitioning traffic into different classes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>NN is bad.. it allows facebook.. netflix.... and other big corporations to control the internet highway and for free</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You said NN is bad, but it&#39;s not bad. NN is treating all traffic as equal. It doesn&#39;t allow Facebook or Google to control the internet any more than it allows Walmart to control commerce.</p>
