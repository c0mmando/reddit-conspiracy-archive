        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p><strong>This sub has really gone to shit. Here&#39;s a link to a post from 2015 where someone asked a similar question. Just look at the difference between the replies then and the ones on this post:<br/>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/32wsc6/what_conspiracy_theories_ended_up_being_true/">https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/32wsc6/what_conspiracy_theories_ended_up_being_true/</a></strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to prove to someone that real stuff gets discussed in conspiracy circles, and that they end up being correct sometimes. However, I can&#39;t seem to find any discussion or post or anything about a conspiracy theory that turned out to be true.</p>

<p>For example, if someone was talking about Hillary screwing Bernie out of the primaries, before it was proven that she screwed him out of the primaries, this would be evidence that someone was correct in their theory. If I could link to an old reddit post from during the primaries or something, and then to another from recently where it was proven that she screwed him, this would be evidence.</p>

<p>Is there anything like that for any conspiracy theory? Has any conspiracy theorist ever &quot;gotten it right&quot; or been &quot;ahead of the times&quot;? Has any theory ever been &quot;vindicated&quot; or &quot;proven to be accurate&quot; by evidence which later surfaced?</p>

<p>I may have worded my previous post poorly (maybe this one too, idk), but in the off chance someone reading this has an example, I&#39;d love to see a post or comment discussion here on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> where someone called out some conspiracy or put forward their theory before the facts were out in the open, and then later posts or comments linking to evidence proving that the theory was correct and/or that the conspiracy was real.</p>

<p>Has <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> ever gotten it right? Have they ever called it correctly?</p>

<p>Or if not <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, has any conspiracy community ever gotten it right or called it correctly?</p>

<p><em>edit</em></p>

<p><strong>Jesus, it&#39;s incredibly difficult to get a straight answer here. Here&#39;s what I&#39;m looking for:</strong></p>

<p><em>(link to old discussion of conspiracy theory when it was still unproven)</em></p>

<p><em>(link to proof of the conspiracy which shows that the theory was correct)</em></p>

<p>You could even leave out the second one.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p><strong>If anyone else is curious about this topic, here&#39;s a link to a google search of pages on reddit including the word conspiracy from the year 2015:  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com+conspiracy&amp;amp;source=lnt&amp;amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F2015%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F2015&amp;amp;tbm=">https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com+conspiracy&amp;amp;source=lnt&amp;amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F2015%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F2015&amp;amp;tbm=</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>I&#39;m currently looking through them to see if any of them have since been proven to be true. No luck yet...</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s when it became public knowledge. Was anyone discussing it before then? Either here or on another conspiracy community?</p>

<p>Honestly this is a pretty bad example, because surely there were many people discussing illlegal surveillance of US citizens, but it doesn&#39;t seem like anyone had a clue about Room 641A before Snowden told everyone about it?</p>

<p>I can assure you we were, and outside of this sub I was called a paranoid conspiracy nut for even suggesting our every move was monitored and recorded to the extent of their ability. The only difference was in those days people were specifically targeted due to data storage limitations, not so much any more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll let you know if I find anything! It&#39;s not as specific as I would have liked. For example, it&#39;s nowhere near as specific as many of the theories currently being discussed on the front page (or the Trump theories being discussed on controversial), but it&#39;s something.</p>

<p>Luckily in this case I can look through the actual information released by Snowden to see if anything was previously discussed here, so that should help.</p>

<p>But to be clear, there are very specific theories being discussed here at the present time, and there are very specific explanations of why these theories are correct and exactly how they are correct.  And when you ask any of the posters or comments about them, you&#39;d be called an idiot for questioning these theories, so people seem to be pretty certain about these theories.</p>

<p>And if that&#39;s the case now, then presumably that was the case a year or two or three ago, and presumably I could look for posts from a couple years ago on this subreddit, and find one that is now known to be true. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do, to prove <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was right. No one wants to help me, but that&#39;s understandable. I would have thought someone from back then would still be active here though, in which case it would be easy to link their old post. Alas, no luck yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not the one claiming to be correct about all this crap that&#39;s being discussed here right now. If anyone here has EVER been right, how hard can it possibly be to post evidence? The replies to this post make it sound like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is always spot on or not far off, so surely there are hundreds if not thousands of examples of when this community has been right?</p>

<p>Most of the comments here seem to imply that there are tons of examples of exactly what I&#39;m looking for, but not a single person has posted a link to the theory alongside a link to the proof. If it&#39;s such a common thing and this is such a dumb post, why is that the case?</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll ask you too, what the hell is up with the tendency of users here to make people want to &quot;work&quot; for the proof? You guys appear to spend so much time &quot;working&quot; on connecting the dots and putting the evidence together, but when someone asks you to prove something then suddenly it&#39;s on them?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a ridiculous attempt at deflection.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that your goal, to share the knowledge with more people? Or is this some kind of gatekeeping thing, like you only get to see the proof once we are sufficiently convinced that you would believe us without seeing proof anyways?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been active here longer than you&#39;ve been on reddit dude. I believe there&#39;s a good chance that many of these theories are correct.</p>

<p>And so when someone is &quot;ready for it&quot; to a sufficient extent to satisfy your gatekeeping, how do you show them? With speculation, or evidence?</p>

<p>If any conspiracy has ever been true, it should be easy to find proof that it is true and that it was a conspiracy before it was proven to be true, <strong>and that&#39;s easy to find, because there are hundreds of such conspiracies and proof is all over the internet and old newspapers and magazines</strong>.</p>

<p>So why is it that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> can&#39;t seem to provide a single example of when <strong>they</strong> were the ones discussing the conspiracy before it was proven? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7en089/recently_confirmed_conspiracies/">Or for that matter, why can&#39;t they provide even a single recently proven conspiracy so I can hunt down the old /r/conspiracy discussions from before it was proven to be true?</a></p>

<p>As far as I can see, it&#39;s because real conspiracies aren&#39;t actually discussed here, and this sub has at this point become little more than a place to circlejerk about already proven conspiracies and political news. Posters here like to pretend they&#39;re these great detectives uncovering amazing conspiracies, but there is nothing of the sort being discussed here, and as far as I can see there never has been.</p>

<p>I am more than ready, and I have been aware of conspiracies for many years, I&#39;m just skeptical about <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> being anything more than a bunch of speculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re most likely not going to find anything like that. Theories evolve as the evidence changes.

<p>The evidence is there, but we don&#39;t have access to it. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a theory. We can see all the dots, just not the lines connecting them. As they become clearer, we get closer and finally it&#39;s not a theory, it&#39;s an indictment.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not gonna go dig through old reddit posts to prove or disprove the conspiracies, but I do know I&#39;ve read ones here that did indeed prove to be true.  For example, the primaries in 2008 being rigged against Ron Paul, the 2016 Democratic primaries being rigged against Bernie Sanders, posts talking about conspiracies from the past (CIA drug running, for example).</p>

<p>I do believe, OP, that it&#39;s not up to the community to prove or disprove conspiracies for you in a tidy, hand picked list.  That&#39;s where your own research needs to occur.  With this post it seems you are demanding proof for something we are not required to provide.  That may not be how you mean it, but it is how the post is coming across.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not exactly a random request. This is a conspiracy community, you&#39;d think a list such as this would be in the sidebar along with the overall list of confirmed conspiracies. No such page or list exists, and in fact even asking about one elicits hostility.</p>

<p>I guess this sub never claimed to have &quot;the scoop&quot; on conspiracies though, so maybe that explains the apparent hostility?</p>

Late night binges that comes with it then it&#39;s really annoying and disrespectful.  And it&#39;s unrealistic.  Ppl here aren&#39;t prophets, they look for patterns are criticize events happening day to day.</p>

<p>I can assure you we were, and outside of this sub I was called a paranoid conspiracy nut for even suggesting our every move was monitored and recorded to the extent of their ability. The only difference was in those days people were specifically targeted due to data storage limitations, not so much any more.</p>
