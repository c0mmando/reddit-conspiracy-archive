       Sure, you’re right. Nothing has become of if. But the person with the redaction pen didn’t know that would be the case.

       The document makes them look bad. You’d think they would follow a policy of ‘better safe than sorry’.

       I'm sure they know more than we can imagine about how the masses will respond to documents. Maybe they put out a redacted one first and no one cared, so they put out the real thing.

       It is so when they get caught for 911 they can say "we told you and y'all did nothing." Its like snowden telling us we are being spied on and the government can turn your kids camera on and see them naked. You didn't cover your cams so you're ok with us doing it.

       The story of Operation Northwoods is told here

       . I wonder if the documents are true due to the use of the word "holiday"—that's British English, with Yanqui being "vacation"—when talking about the staging of the shooting down of a U.S. aircraft by Cuban forces. Pentagon documents undergo repeated review which ponders the significance of every last comma. Half a dozen pairs of eyeballs, including the JCS chairman and every JCS member, would have reviewed the document.
