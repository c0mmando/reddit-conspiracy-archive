       Traumatizing, abusing and grooming kids is what this is all about. This is, clearly, organized and orchestrated. Joe Rogan tweeted two brilliant articles about this entire thing.

       Thankfully  Joe Finally looked into it. and i assume it has to do with his kid coming up to him and saying  do you want to see the movie i made on my ipad?  he said how did you do that. she said i just figured it out.

       This is a guess but if you have a long term goal of destabilizing a society, one way to go about it would be to corrupt the minds of the youth.

       Sure, that's one way to look at it. Whether that is the end goal or not, I don't know, but it is most certainly a consequence of having millions of kids exposed to these videos.

       I guess because this has gone so mainstream, it's reached the ears of people who don't realize that the destabilization of society is absolutely on the agenda of the global elite. They don't understand how willfully malevolent the powers that control the world are.

       Like others have said, it's getting a lot of coverage, the youtubers have reported on it too and they have huge fan bases. Add in that it is legitimately a weird, oddly sinister thing on youtube, lots of less conspiracy informed people are getting involved.

       Yeah, it's really blowing up. Shills are late this time, but they're catching up quickly and abusing the reddit hive mind. I just made an edit to my OP, this is at the top of
       <a href="/r/elsagate">

       I think my daughter nailed it- it's a way to make people feel complicit. It's sort of like the new version of feeling paranoid about your "permanent record"- the average parent likely has this smut on their phone and allowed their kid to access it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't blame parents very much- it has not been an easy row to keep my kids "unplugged". It is a lot of work and I get why folks hand their kids their phone to keep them occupied. And kids are so easily addicted to this short-attention theater!! I took a video of my youngest making microwave popcorn and she replayed that thing until my phone battery died.

       Yeah, that's one of the common shill arguments "why do parents let their kids watch YT". Sure, kids shouldn't watch too much YouTube, but that doesn't change the fact that these videos exist. Another retarded argument that many seem to fall for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the second part of your post: this is why these Elsagate videos are so highly effective. Kids are hyper-stimulated, with a lot of color, movement and sound and this can keep them occupied for hours on end.

       I promise, I'm not a shill. I'm honestly trying to figure out how this phenomenon still exists. Why do YouTube and Disney allow it??
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I'm old, lol. I have kids from 28 to 5 years old. My older kids didn't even get to see a Disney movie while growing up and my younger children are even more restricted when it comes to programming. They are only allowed an hour a day of screen time, and that is fully monitored by me.

       My daughter is the oddest duck sometimes, but I love how her mind works. I had actually called her way back summer before last to warn her about this elsagate deal. She, of course, thought I was nuts. A few days later, she caught my grandson watching Elsa vids- she told me (and I posted it here,) that what caught her attention was a change in "tone", that the sound quality of what my grandson was watching changed. She went to check what he was watching and sure enough, elsagate. When she checked her history, she had hours of it.

       Instantly when the topic got big i saw two things repeated over and over. "it's just a money making scheme" and "the government Definitely isn't involved." So guess what two things are absolutely not true. God they suck so bad at this.

       It doesn't even really matter whether the people making it are pedos or just doing it for money, the point is that pedos are watching it, pedos are using it to groom kids and get kids thinking certain activities are acceptable, and that should be obvious to whoever is making money off it. So it just doesn't make a difference, it's like saying 'But I only killed that guy for money, it's not like I enjoyed it!' It's a pointless meaningless excuse. It's so obvious that these videos are creepy and wrong that no one can even attempt to argue otherwise, so they're coming up with this dumb 'it's just for money' excuse, as though that makes it better somehow. Totally clueless!

       Why do you instantly assume it's shills?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's very possible people do just have the opinion that it's a money grab. As you said yourself 'when the topic got big' these opinions started showing up. In my mind that's because it's being seen by a an audience that's less acquainted with the conspiratorial angle. It could just be this subs second favourite boogeyman: the sheeple who can't see the forest for the trees.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not trying to be combative, I just see this shill argument thrown around so much here but I've rarely seen any evidence. Certainly nothing that would imply this behaviour is as ubiquitous as often reported here.

       Actually, I read the post, and it makes a lot of sense. The issue I have with the people looking into it, is that the focus isn't on the comments, or I should say the criminals in the comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people wanted to make a difference, they should report the accounts of any of the pervs hanging out in those videos, even if it's to Interpol, since we don't know their country of origin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The videos are weird, but that person made a pretty high effort attempt to explain it. If there is a ring, I think it's in the comments. Either way, those people for sure need to be investigated, and I think it's weird people only focus on the videos themselves.

       Basically, there's no easy fix, I've read that more than 100 hours of content is uploaded per minute, or a year's worth of content per day. Do they pay thousands of people to basically watch videos? Do they remove anything that gets reported?

       See, people here love to scream censorship, but then don't admit the issues with trying to actually go through so much content to censor.

       I would argue there's far less videos that are getting reported for that, and YouTube's ability to recognize language means it can automatically be detected and dealt with.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very fact most of these videos don't talk, and only make noises and strange sounds makes it that much harder to deal with. And they're long, and there's a shit ton of them.. what makes you think there's an easy solution?
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, they have to decide what needs to be censored, anything with a syringe? I mean, they have to have a reason they can justify removing it, they can't just say "syringe+kids=bad" and expect the content creator to swallow that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why, do you have some idea what they are supposed to do besides hire tons of people to go through the videos, or just remove shit tons of content without reviewing it, while more and more gets uploaded?

       Who said you had to hire tons? Content for Kids should be very strict.  Not to mention they have received TON's of complaints about the videos and its categorization.

      <p>
       If I posted a video of someone getting beheaded (no sound or text) or someone showing their some nudity in the background - I'm pretty sure it gets censored immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no excuse for this shit.  They thought through the scenario before making it.  They have a story and you buy it.  Well I don't because I could take the same approach and do a variety of different videos that are kid friendly.

       It won't be hard to turn the tide on this one. Anybody who sees those videos will see they're fucked up. Make points about how they're trying to undermine America's children, it's child abuse, it's sexual conditioning, etc.

       No. There are pedo ones. Ive seen some that normalize children eating candy, gettong tummy aches then falling asleep and hallicinating. Its like saying its ok to get drugged and if it happens, its normal.

       the thing that looks the most malicious is the common theme of showing children DEPATTERNING and fucking with their comprehension of reward and punishment. for the learn colors videos, colors are often switched or associated with horror for correctly identifying them. this is the psychological bizarre shit that the failed philosophy of occams razor does not account for or adequately explain.

       A copy of a comment I made earlier on the subject:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This elsagate thing has been around for over a year and it is absolutely real. One of the producers did an AMA recently at r/elsagate, actually.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The videos are creepy and disturbing. What is really mysterious is that Disney will issue you a takedown notice if you put a video of your Elsa-themed wedding etc, but allows these disgusting knockoffs to be fed, unsolicited, to children everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? I don't get it, honestly. My eldest child suggested that it is a way to make everyone complicit in perversion involving children- I mean, even the best parent that lets their kid watch YouTube likely has this shit in their browsing history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The solution? Don't let your kids browse YouTube. Get them a coloring book or Legos or something. Even without the threat of them being fed disturbing fetish content, all that screen time is an unhealthy way to entertain children.

       It seems like this guy doesn't make the kind of videos people are upset about. He talks about unboxing and toy videos, when people are concerned about the cosplay, needle, and scat videos. The whole AMA seems like a scam.

       I'll offer that elsegate is likely just one on a list of subs that has been caught in their onslaught of the past 2-3 weeks. You're also seeing subs like wikileaks, uncensored_news and pedogate under attack from the same campaign.

       I'm not sure if the intent is to leave it at this volume for the ongoing future based upon generous funding or if this is the last, best effort and they aren't launching all the fireworks they have.

      <p>
       They go up and down so quickly. Really weird. Like, a post can have 120 upvotes, refresh the page 10 seconds later and it's 95 upvotes. This usually happens when a post is about to reach the front page of the sub. Maybe I'm looking into this too much idk.

       Contracting companies and individuals to promote felonies or obfuscate investigations can be pursued by AG’s or victims and victim’s families. Institutional pedo crime sued in civil court will remove a layer of wealth and stature from anyone on the wrong side of these crimes.

       Does that change the fact that there are actual kids being abused in the videos, like 3-year old twin girls being forced to feed each other brown "chocolate" directly from the toilet as they cry as a father(??) orders them around behind the camera etc? That was apparently one of the videos in a few articles I've read and I even saw clips of it from other Youtube channels.

       I think it's multipurposed and many layered. These Elsa videos, I mean. Its very calculated.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think pretty much everything mentioned with them is correct. Child abuse, pedo shit, money from the ads, normalizing bad things to our kids, the list goes on and on. Just because one aspect is true, doesn't mean another isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think it's here to divide us further, into arguing what it's about, and to make America introduce reactionary rules. I see Elsa vids as an attack on the western world and western culture as a whole.  They know how to attack us now, it's not just about the action of what these videos do to our kids or culture, but how we over react to it and break ourselves in country and mind, in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did not call -gate because I feel that makes it sound like a crackpot conspiracy to normal people, and we should start picking our words very carefully, if to be taken seriously.

       This is just my personal bias but I wish we could stop relating it to Elsa altogether... that was my mother's name and I planned on naming my daughter after her. It's been ruined by these disgusting videos and perpetuated by people referring to the whole scandal as "Elsagate" Why not reference Spiderman instead? Or Hulk, or the Joker? These are all prominant characters being used and I don't think we'll be ruining anyone's memory by referring to the scandal under one of those names.
