       Hi all. I wrote this post about 8 months ago on r/conspiracy, and it was well received. Based on where we're at today in terms of the collectively understood 'fallen' state of reality, I figured I'd leave you all with what I believe is the most phenomenal conspiracy of them all: the conspiracy of true love.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: After going down the governmental rabbit hole, I’ve recognized how impactful the negative energy behind all these horrific realizations can be. I am hoping to alleviate the suffering, or the attachment to what we learn here. Because I firmly believe that, in order to combat this horror-drama time span in the universe’s narrative for humanity, we must remember true love. I know this sounds corny, but it’s more real than I think we initially assume. I apologize for the length — I tend to get personal so as to most effectively/honestly relate my thoughts to the reader. I’d also like to thank anyone who takes the time to read my personal thoughts. I promise that these are always written from an honest and passionate heart.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Hey, guys. I pop in here every so often to read what is going on in the world — or at least that which we are slowly exposed to despite it having gone on for a long, long time. And in recognizing how impactful some of this horrible news can be as you wake up to the truth behind the society in which we participate, I want to do whatever I can to alleviate the suffering that can come as a result of the learning we do here. Because the only way, I think, we’re going to overcome all of these traumatic realizations is that we come together with Love. Not the false love we’ve been introduced to for centuries — false love being the kind of "love" in which you love someone or something so that you can, in turn, receive love back — but the true love in which you love genuinely and selflessly. You love for nothing in return. You forget yourself and your own illusory ‘me’ world. Bear with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       A year ago, I was depressed. I had no reason to be, other than my thoughts were telling me to be. I couldn’t take it anymore. It was suicide or stare my fears in the face. Fortunately, I chose to stare my fears in my face. In that moment, I recognized that my fears were illusory. They were attachments to some ‘thing’ in life, whether it was attaining an object and fearing not getting it or becoming a certain person and fearing not becoming it, or even fearing death through an attachment to this life of mine. These pressures needn’t exist because they fundamentally don’t exist. We create them. This ‘them’ is the ego. It is the illusion for which we think, a false center in consciousness, also called ‘me’.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally speaking, most individuals exist in very personal worlds that are separate from all else. We have our own problems, our own realities, our own individual chaotic maelstroms of desires and concerns. And because we’ve believed in the illusion of existing in a consciousness that is fundamentally separate from the world outside of us for so long, we’ve forgotten the most powerful and useful aspect of all of nature: everything is One, everything is related, and everything is Love. Instead of embodying love, we’ve elected to participate in the game of separation. We literally feel separate from the universe, when the universe is the mother out of which we become.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, the universe is the mother out of which we become, yet we feel 'other than' the universe. Really seeing this truth can lead one to quite a hefty laugh, because it truly is a beautiful cosmic joke. People really believe that each of us comes into this world, when in truth, each of us comes
       <em>
        out of
       </em>
       the world. I always suggest that people read that last sentence slowly, so as to truly absorb its meaning, because that simple truth, itself, speaks volumes of the reasoning behind the chaotic reality which we currently have in front of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fundamentally, we’ve forgotten love. Love has been substituted with artificial constructs (gadgets of technology, falsely loving someone in order to love yourself rather than loving someone selflessly, getting a better job, a better car, winning a war, finding a religion, and so on). I know this sounds hippy. I played college football and was raised in an all-American household. Hippy, flower-loving talk did not exist; it was foreign and rightfully so, I believed. But screw that. We can act like this isn’t true or we can stare it in the face, acknowledge that we’ve drifted from true love, forgive ourselves, and allow the magical process of self-healing to rubber band back to its origin of authentic love.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s my concern. A year ago, I recognized the truth about how the world, which includes myself, had forgotten love. For a span of a few months, I experienced a sort of ineffable bliss in which I finally remembered true love and felt it for all things outside of my own self. Let me tell you something.. experiencing true love at all times of the day, which we can all do, is a hefty reminder as to why this whole ‘existing’ thing happens. The best way I can creatively describe that bliss is in this way: I am a musician and I love music more than anything. I uncontrollably cry when I hear a piano key being played at the most perfect time in unison with a violin. The magic I feel from music is ineffable. And when i rediscovered true love, everything I saw was being seen through the paradigm of that feeling I get from music. Everything was the same one song. It was all one verse, a UniVerse.
      </p>
      <p>
       But once I’d become aware of politicians engaging in the
       <em>
        negative aspect
       </em>
       of spirituality (rather than positive; and for those of you who don't know, negative spirituality is the practice of focusing all intent on service to self rather than service to other), world-leaders being fake beauty queens with personal agendas, economies collapsing, climate change accelerating and showing signs of becoming even more relentless over the years to come, talk of extra-terrestrial life that’s been hidden from the public…I mean, so many mind-boggling happenings are being introduced to our minds. It’s overwhelming — at least it was to me. I admit that the negativity that has surfaced has brought me to the depths of hell. Myself, along with few others I’ve talked with, have unfortunately internalized the disgust so as to try and understand it. Well, I’m not sure it can be understood by any loving soul. It’s so, so foreign. So gross, so dirty, so sickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you’re on this forum, you likely care about humanity. I’d assume most of us are more sensitive people than others we might find elsewhere. Sensitive people feel compassion. And to be compassionate — to have an aware heart — and to know what’s really happening in the world while there are people walking around blind to the truth…that can have a massive impact. I, personally, have just wanted to cry and cry for months on end now. The emotional weight of this 180 degree turn that my understanding of reality has taken was, at one point, unbearable. But this is why I wrote to you all today.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I’ve learned throughout the past year in solitude is that life seems to suck right now for the collective, but it needn’t be that way and it will not forever. That’s why change is happening now and the universe is going through a shedding of its skin, bringing to light unfathomable evil in the process. But the unfathomable evil, which we’ve been veiled from knowing for so long, can instill in any sensitive person some pretty massive confusion, disgust, and suffering. This is what we need to be aware of.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more we suffer, the more ‘they’ win. Be aware of that and make a point of it. Each loving act you do has an impact. Every moment you take to genuinely love anyone, a family member, a coworker, a stranger…it makes a difference in this Matrix. And as all this information is exposed, we can either respond as awake people and culminate massive love as a response. Or we can fall victim to the unveiling horrors and helplessly fall down an even darker path before the universe sympathetically takes a U-turn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about this: when you do something good for someone else and have no expectation of what you’ll receive in return, how god damn awesome does it feel when you see that person’s face light up after you’ve been kind? When you expect absolutely nothing in return, you can’t be let down. And when you can’t be let down and are living with authentic and real love — not that fake love crap we’ve been raised to believe is real — but the real stuff, selfless love…that’s when magic happens. That’s when you remember who you really are and what life is all about. That’s when you look your loved ones in the eyes again and remember that magnetic pull you feel from their heart to yours. You love again. You live again. The darkness has no ability to penetrate that authentic love. It’s the most powerful emotional manifestation of the universe that we can experience. And in order to be invincible and overcome this revealing period of turmoil, we must remember true love and tap into that deep, deep sense of oneness which we can all experience perpetually so long as we remain selfless and put our own agendas aside. Such a thing is hard to fathom in modern society when we’ve been raised to ‘be the best’ but we’re remembering who and what we are and that we’ve drifted from the truth. Thus, I believe our personal agendas are either going to fall apart and crumble as the universe has a plan to reintroduce humanity to what’s meaningful and worth giving our attention to, particularly right now, or we can make the choice to remember true love on our own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loving is the easiest thing to do once you forget your own agenda. I love you guys. I know that each of you is simply a ‘different’ manifestation of what I really am, and vice versa. Now, let’s all start living that way. Let’s live as One. For those of you who tend to misread my message and PM me to get out of here with my NWO preaching, I’m not speaking in the sense of One government, but in the sense of universal lovingness. A world in which we realize that everything is related and is made of the same stuff. Where no one is judged and everyone is celebrated. Where everyone’s intention is for the benefit of others and not for the benefit of self. Where, when we let go of our passionate attachment to our own individual beliefs and open up to a beautiful state of selfless openness, we finally witness that a human being's most fundamentally natural state of being is one in which no fear can exist, because there is nothing to lose when you are literally a conscious manifestation of the entire game of life.
       <em>
        That
       </em>
       is where we will win.

       You can, if you read it.  You know that inner voice that narrates stuff to yourself while reading a book or anything else really. Or it could just be that not everyone does that and I'm a kook.

       Fuck you you fucking peasant. I've decided to use all that I've learned about the true nature of reality to join the ranks of the powerful and grind you pathetic slaves into dust, to murder you and enslave your children and enjoy the true freedom of a future beyond the limitations of good and evil. You only elevate feeble emotional experiences because you are poor and powerless and weak. My family has money and political connections and now we are lined up to be among the few laughing on the sidelines as the masochistic "moral majority" is systematically murdered and tortured in a series of orchestrated global conflicts, your legacy reduced to biomechanical hybrid slaves grown in vats with your DNA. It brings me great joy to imagine the sufferings of your future offspring. It is not so much the usefulness of an enslaved goyim, it is more the pure and wonderful joy of witnesses your suffering purely for entertainment's sake. You people are simply incapable of imagining the kind of genius currently ushering in your extinction and utter enslavement because you are limited by childish ideas of "good and evil." You deserve everything coming to you because you cling to your stupidity and refuse to accept this world as it is. ISREAL FOREVER. YOU WILL NEVER DEFEAT THE ETERNAL JEW!

       Refuse to accept the world as it is? Did you read the post? This post is essentially about discovering that the true nature of reality can only be seen by allowing everything to fundamentally be as it is. So, even your claim of humans' stupidity is based in a misunderstanding. You've been masterfully deceived.

       It would amuse me to hear you vomit nonsense like this while I torture you to death. I would be laughing and cutting off pieces of your body and getting right in your face as I chew and swallow your meat. Your screams would arouse me. I'm not the one who doesn't understand hate, it's you. You are not the same species as me. All goyim are like dogs, when you stand on your hind legs and bark at us we have no choice but to put you down. Sometimes it is fun to torture you as well. You will never stop us because you cannot understand this fundamental truth about our consciousness. Instead of developing a robotic workforce and genociding the goyim the decision was made a long time ago to breed your offspring and keep them as slaves SIMPLY FOR THE JOY OF IT. What you call "hatred" is simply the pure expression of power as Yehovah intended. If I find you your entire family will be taken to Israel and tortured in one of of our many dungeons for many years unto their deaths. Our citizens will pay a small fee to visit and take part in their suffering. These sorts of arrangements are one of many Jewish open-secrets. Come here to Israel and as much will be openly admitted with a twinkle of the eye. You will be kept alive and supported by the government so that our people can witness your cowardice and open betrayal of your family to preserve your own life. This is your true nature. You will see. Such things are commonplace in our world, we are THE ETERNAL JEW, AND WE ARE YOUR GOD.

       It's amusing to me that you think a woman is capable of violence in the same way as a man. The matriarchal lineage was designated by the rabbis to protect our racial purity. Beyond that our women are simply women. Jewish men are as vicious and virile and dominant as any other, especially in Israel. You think of our rabbis like priests when they are really more like military officers. Our entire existence is a war, always has been. The propaganda efforts over the years have portrayed us otherwise to help disarm the goyim. You think of Woody Allen instead of Liev Shreiber! And it is all by design! Wonderful, so wonderful!

       We do not know most of history, at least according to modern textbook and mainstream archeology. For example, we are unsure of the cultures that led to the ancient megalithic architectural wonders, such as the pyramids.

       I don’t think it’s about true love, to be honest. I think it’s about finding happiness, and the ingredients for each individual’s happiness casserole or life is a little different, with true love being one of the possible additions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone is going to find true love (depending on how you wish to define it), while for some, true love can actually be a destructive force.

       People do stupid things for love. They stay in abusive relationships. They can enable bad habits for those whom they love. They can cheat or have an affair, which can destroy the family unit. People commit suicide over love. Love doesn't always have a positive outcome.

       Right, but none of that is true love. That is false love. Ego love. Fulfilling the inner void by being with another human being, sucking energy from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       True love destroys nothing, other than illusion. What's wild is that most people, today, do not even know what true love is. Most people are so caught up in the game of thinking and seeking and lying that they've overlooked the simplicity of true love.
      </p>
      <p>
       True love only exists when 'you' are not there to do the loving. It just is. It's happening. It is purely selfless.

       I fully disagree. The problem with "true love" is it really can't be quantified, which means nobody really knows whether or not they are in TRUE LOVE or not. Some people can probably make the claim (after 40+ years of happy marriage), but I think the majority of us are in a love gray area which ranges from "True" to "Not In Love At All". It's not black and white.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other problem with true love is our frame of reference. Some people fully believe they are experiencing true love until an event occurs and they realize it wasn't true love at all. However, does that mean that what they were feeling and experiencing wasn't ACTUALLY true love to them from their perspective?
      </p>
      <p>
       My next problem is the ODDS of finding what most would define as true love. What percentage of people polled would believe they have found true love? And how many of those people are ACTUALLY, OBJECTIVELY in true love?
      </p>
      <p>
       From the human experience perspective, how is believing you're in true love and actually being in true love any different?

       I agree that nothing in the world is black and white. Let's be clear about that. Anything is possible. Yet, some things happen more frequently than others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me ask, then, what is it
      </p>
      <p>
       An enlightened guru, using the most extreme example of a self-mastered individual, holds fundamentally no attachment to the person he loves. I can use Adyashanti as an example. I recently listened to one of his satsangs in which he was guiding a crying woman, who was realizing that in order to be her true self she would have to let go of attachment to her own husband, to her true state of being. Adyashanti said, "My wife, Mukti, was nearing a transformation of consciousness, and the days leading up to her pivotal moment, she began to notice that, once she let go of her attachment to herself for good, she would no longer need me. So, I told her, 'I know, honey. Isn't it great?'"
      </p>
      <p>
       True love is unattached. Thus, it is less inclined to lead to a breaking apart. I'd imagine that the environment would have to be that which leads true love to falling apart. Or maybe the guru would have to fall in love with a manipulative, lying narcissist who was not at all who he'd originally thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to find true love, you have to be yourself first. And that's the most challenging thing to attain in life. Anyone can find true love, but they must find themselves first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, today, most people have no clue that life is the pursuit of discovering who/what you truly are, so most people are not directing awareness
       <em>
        within
       </em>
       in order to work on themselves and to let go of illusion. Consequently, true love has become so rare that we don't even know how to conceptualize it.
      </p>
      <p>
       True love does not believe it is in true love. True love is true love because it does not question itself. There is nothing to prove. There is no 'me' there to take credit for the loving or to question 'is this the one? is this real?'
      </p>
      <p>
       You state that your problem is considering the odds of finding true love. This points me to seeing that, because you are 'bothered', you do not know who you are, yet. Once you know who you truly are, you will not crave love as you do now. You will be fulfilled with yourself, as yourself. A relationship will not be what keeps your motor going.
       <em>
        You
       </em>
       will be your motor for life, and you will simply enjoy your loved one for who they are.
       <em>
        That
       </em>
       is when we should, then, begin relationships, I'd suggest.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's significantly easier to find true love, I think, when you let go of all your internal bullshit and all your ideas of who you think you are or what you think the world is or what you think you need or what you think you need to avoid. Let go of all of it, including attachment to your very self. Become invincible, in that way, and true love will find its way into your life.

       I reject this "no attachments" philosophy. Attachments to other human beings are what make life worth living, and are how true love is expressed. To seek to sever these attachments is destructive and is ultimately about seeking a state of non-being, and ultimately, death

       Personally, I've already begun telling loved ones to please not get me a gift. Because I do not plan to get them one. And because the part of me that craves more 'things' to make me 'feel better' has seemed to fall away. Family members, then, have questioned me about what it is I mean. From there, I explain what I see as truth :)

       Question, have you ever used psychedelics before? This is exactly how I feel after using them a few times. I was in a depressed state, and ever since using LSD I've become much more empathetic and loving, and that feeling of "one" is now very obvious and strong. I understand this post completely, and if everyone truly felt this way we'd be way better off.

       It's funny, I'd always view people who used psychs as being weird or crazy. Always talking about love, but obviously not the love that I grew up to know. Now that I understand what that love is, life doesn't seem to scare me anymore.

       Agape is a bit more precise than "true love", in case anybody needs clarity or is confusing your idea with Wesley + Buttercup love.

       OP, there is a 75 years long study by Harvard (spanning several generations of researchers), which tracked the lives of 724 men. I think you can give credit to such a study. And it essentially says the same thing you're saying here. Some of the men they studied became very successful, some didn't, some lived long, some didn't, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       The takeaway from the study is : hard work and wealth do not matter. Good relationships keep us healthier and happier. Loneliness kills. Second takeaway is : it's not about the number of relationships that you have, but about the quality of those. You only need a couple people you love and feel you can count on.

        Here is the link to the TED talk from one of the researchers involved in this study
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yeah, if you want to live a successful life, don't seek accumulating material wealth, seek true love.

       Thank you so much for this post, it read as a very familiar story to me. I too dove head first in the deapths of the conspiracies and it drove me into the deepest depression i had ecxperienced ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       While sinking deeper into the darkness i suddenly got a not so subtile kick in the butt from our "reality" and i was luckely forced to reconsider my view on me and our "reality". After many rabbitholes i came across the spiritual world and slowly "reality" started to make sence for me. It was and still is a slow and painfull proces, but when true Love slowly started to light up my path i began to see the "game" and it's rules more clear by the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today i am whole hearly agreeing with you, True Love is the positive natural force in this 3D "reality" and fear has a negative impact our experience here. This does not mean fear and negativety have no place here, no they are just tools to enable us to learn and experience something. Sadly serve to self has taken the overhand becouse some have taken advantage of the (somehow built in) human instinct feeling of fear for not getting enough. This fear has it's roots in the basic survivel mode of all humans, but even this fear can be obsolete once you realise the reality of our "reality".
      </p>
      <p>
       Should we just forigive and forget the "evil" here and just love everybody? Would that be enough to evolve as species and save the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes and no, like you wrote, first we need to realise we are all one, after that we also should see that some "evil" was actually not "evil" and all good was not always "good". We now need to take advantage of the unveiling and bring the "evil" into the light of Love. Once all is reveiled we might be able to judge, but untill then we only can be thrue to ourselves and don't judge anybody, including ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       This "war" can't be solved by trying to heal the "outside" alone, we all need to start working on healing ourselves first. Nobody can do this for you, some can teach you how to travel or assist you otherwise, but nobody can travel aside you into the deep rabbithole that lies inside everybody. If you are being absolutely honest to yourself while on this, sometimes, very hard, painfull, difficult dark and lonely journey you will start to see the light of Love and you will become arware of you your and our "reality". This journey will lead you to a "reality" with more positive possibileties for your life if you act on the knowledge gained while travveling. And once you are healing yourself while living out of Love you also will heal our common "reality" and make it a better one for us all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honesty shows us the ways out of this maze we call life, Love will light the path so you don't need to stuble too much, trust can help us to make our journey more comfortable and fear will distord everything to prevent us from solving this maze. But on the next "levels" all is one, so in the end our personal journey impacts us all and it is upto ourself what kind of impact you want make and the honest reasons behind your choise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks again for posting this, it is nice to read such encouraging, honest and Loving words that are so usefull for many in this time of "chaos".

       People do stupid things for love. They stay in abusive relationships. They can enable bad habits for those whom they love. They can cheat or have an affair, which can destroy the family unit. People commit suicide over love. Love doesn't always have a positive outcome.

       We do not know most of history, at least according to modern textbook and mainstream archeology. For example, we are unsure of the cultures that led to the ancient megalithic architectural wonders, such as the pyramids.

       Regardless of past, to justify endless war today by saying "we have always been at war, must be the best we humans can do" is shit.

       I reject this "no attachments" philosophy. Attachments to other human beings are what make life worth living, and are how true love is expressed. To seek to sever these attachments is destructive and is ultimately about seeking a state of non-being, and ultimately, death
