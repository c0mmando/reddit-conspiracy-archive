    <div class="md"><p>Because there is a massive difference in tangible evidence between pgate and Moore:</p>

<pre><code>     For example, look at the Allred controversy happening with Moore. He accused her of faking the handwriting and now she refuses to submit the yearbook to a handwriting expert. While that doesn&#39;t mean other victims aren&#39;t lying, it certainly challenges the credibility of the accusers as a whole. And moreover if the handwriting is in fact false, Allred has committed an offense worthy of Bar license revocation. And you had the docs coming out about Allred being a left political operative (Wikileaks I believe). Viewed in tandem, there is significant mounting evidence that (at least some) of the allegations are a hit job. Until we know who&#39;s lying you can&#39;t burn the guy at the stake. 

      Pizzagate: while those who are accused seem to ardently deny, they rarely, if ever, challenge the tangible evidence of a conspiracy. Instead it&#39;s mostly &quot;cookoo clocks on the right thing we are pedophiles, what IDIOTS.&quot; This creates the Streisand effect and causes the community to look more closely each time. 
</code></pre>

<p>As a final point, how come the left is enraged by Moore, but totally behind Al Franken? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have completely put false words to my keyboard, which is unsurprising from a brainwashed lemming. </p>

<p>I said the fact that Allred, arguably the noted women&#39;s rights attorney in the US, was named a PO for the dems in a leaked doc, is spearheading the accusations, and has so-called proof that she refuses to submit to ANY scrutiny,  is absurd and certainly casts light on the whole thing. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a little tidbit about evidence:</p>

<pre><code>Your evidence has to be certified to PRIOR to its submission to the court. So Gloria has to do this if she plans to sue. 

 A lawyer speaking about unverified evidence, and submitting it to the media is a breach of a number of model rules of professional responsibility. That Allred would go to those lengths to push an unconfirmed narrative is HIGHLY suspicious. Even more so when it&#39;s coming from a prominent and partisan attorney.

<p>The multiple allegations, from multiple accusers, have been subjected to intense scrutiny. A handwriting analysis would add nothing--Moore&#39;s partisans wouldn&#39;t accept a positive result, and his opponents wouldn&#39;t accept a negative one. And they shouldn&#39;t, as handwriting analysis is not reliable. </p>

<p>And as a lawyer, it&#39;s absolutely false that it&#39;s a breach of any professional responsibilities to speak publicly about the evidence here. If you disagree, please cite the rule you think she&#39;s breaking.</p>

<p>Nope that was you Clarence Darrow. You are an embarrassment to your profession trying to be a Reddit lawyer. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoy talking about rules like this and don&#39;t care about your insults, so the bad news is that you can&#39;t troll me. The good news is that I&#39;m happy to talk about the rule as long as you like, if you like.</p>

<p>First, you have to read the <em>whole</em> rule, not just the keywords you like. The rule is titled &quot;Trial Publicity,&quot; putting the entire rule in the context of trials. (Don&#39;t stop there, keep reading--there&#39;s <em>lots</em> more to show that the rule only applies in the context of a judicial action.) There&#39;s a penumbra in that public comments made prior to a trial can affect that trial, but there&#39;s no indication in the rule that it applies to any and all statements outside of any formal legal action whatsoever. And in fact we know that it can&#39;t so apply, as that would be a gross violation of the First Amendment. </p>

<p>The comments to the rule explicitly show how its coverage is gradated depending on how far away from a trial the comments are, and in fact even what kind of trial it is. Comment 6:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another relevant factor in determining prejudice is the nature of the proceeding involved. Criminal jury trials will be most sensitive to extrajudicial speech. Civil trials may be less sensitive. Non-jury hearings and arbitration proceedings may be even less affected. The Rule will still place limitations on prejudicial comments in these cases, but the likelihood of prejudice may be different depending on the type of proceeding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, no criminal trial is possible, as the SoL has expired. If there were a civil trial the scope of the coverage would be less, and even less for pre-trial hearings and other matters. In this case, we aren&#39;t even in the &quot;non-jury hearings and arbitrations&quot; context--there&#39;s no judicial proceeding whatsoever.</p>

<p>Timing also affects the coverage of the rule. The <a href="https://apps.americanbar.org/litigation/committees/ethics/email/summer2012/summer2012-0712-ethical-rules-litigating-court-public-opinion.html">ABA</a> points out that disclosures &quot;at the start of a case, long before a jury will be empaneled, will be less likely to result in discipline than the public release of significant information on the eve of or during trial.&quot; And here, again, we aren&#39;t even at &quot;the start of a case.&quot; There isn&#39;t a case at all. </p>

<p>The ABA&#39;s comment also points out quite clearly that &quot;Model Rule 3.6(a) focuses only on a lawyer’s extrajudicial communications <em>about and during the pendency of</em> an adjudicative proceeding,&quot; citing a case in which the comments were apparently post-proceeding. Here, again, there is no proceeding, so the comments cannot violate 3.6(a). </p>

<p>Since the coverage of the rule depends on the nature and stage of the proceedings, and there are <em>no</em> proceedings in this case, there&#39;s no basis for concluding that the rule applies. </p>

<p>So even if the entire rule was 3.6(a), it would not apply--in fact, I cannot find any example anywhere of a lawyer being disciplined for communications prior to the initiation of a judicial action. But what if it did apply, or Allred&#39;s statements had taken place after the initiation of a case?</p>

<p>In that event, she&#39;d still be covered because the rule doesn&#39;t stop with paragraph (a). In paragraph (b), it sets out specific comments a lawyer may make despite the first part of the rule. At least two of these would protect Allred. Paragraph (b)(1) permits her to comment on &quot;the claim, offense or defense involved.&quot; There&#39;s (once again) no case here, but if there was one it would have to be Moore&#39;s action against the accuser given the lapse of the limitations periods for her claims or any state action. And if Moore were to sue her for defamation, the yearbook would be part of her defense, and thus statements about it covered by (b)(1).</p>

<p>Paragraph (b)(2) covers &quot;information contained in a public record.&quot; I think that once the yearbook is disclosed, its existence is part of the public record. This probably wouldn&#39;t cover the initial disclosure of the yearbook, but it doesn&#39;t need to--both because the rule doesn&#39;t apply prior to the initiation of an action, and because (b)(1) covers it. </p>

<p>(I also think there could be an amusing but not strong case that (b)(6) applies: &quot;a warning of danger concerning the behavior of a person involved, when there is reason to believe that there exists the likelihood of substantial harm to an individual or to the public interest.&quot;)</p>

<p>I realize that it&#39;s fun to posture like an internet tough guy. It doesn&#39;t work when your argument is so silly, though. Read the rule--the <em>whole rule,</em> from title to comments--before deciding to rely on one sentence out of context. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>really I&#39;m upset</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know. But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s my fault. You made a silly argument to defend a pedophile, and that probably doesn&#39;t feel good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m an actual lawyer, and you&#39;re just a 2L </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know what you are. I&#39;m a former litigator myself; I was in a biglaw commercial lit group before I left to start a business. I can&#39;t tell you how wearying it is to see the &quot;I&#39;m so smart, look at my edgy clever digs!&quot; preening attitude from the outside.</p>

<p>Read more, read better, then get the attitude. When the attitude comes first, you just look bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In your (wildly over-indulgent) analysis you proved my point a number of times: </p>

<p>Allred has certainly run afoul of the rule in 3.6 in speaking publicly about unconfirmed evidence and investigations that have a highly prejudicial impact on ANY subsequent legal proceedings. </p>

<p>As for your claim that I am incorrect because I did not read &quot;the whole rule:&quot; </p>

<p>Section (a) of rule 3.6 states the general premise: &quot;a lawyer is not to speak extrajudicially about litigation/investigation that they are or have been involved in.&quot;</p>

<p>Section (b) lists the exceptions to section (a). You talking about &quot;the whole rule&quot; as if part (b) provides an alternate reading of part (a) is patently absurd, and a total misrepresentation as to the state of the rule.  </p>

<p>Finally, you&#39;ll note from your original comment that we were not &quot;discussing&quot; the rules as you so diplomatically heel turn now, but I was entirely incorrect in asserting 3.6 applied to public statements made by an attorney prior to trial.  You stated, and I quote verbatim: </p>

<pre><code>         &quot;The rule explicitly applies to publicity around a trial.&quot; 
</code></pre>

<p>That is a far cry from your current position, articulated above, and undoubtedly more convoluted and wishy washy than where you started.  You are attempting to change, as you go along, the definition of the rule, in addition to the substance of your argument. The sign of a lazy litigator is the inability to stick to the issue and support their argument. The only issue here is whether Allred is subject to rule 3.6 for the yearbook statements, and I have proven that she is, through simply reading the express language of the rule. </p>

<p>First, you started with  &quot;3.6 deals ONLY with trials,&quot; now its &quot;3.6 doesn&#39;t only deal with trials but there are prejudice considerations that inform the rule.&quot; </p>

<p>Next, you&#39;ll  tell me what Martian lawyers can say in their pressers, and argue that&#39;s the correct application on earth. </p>

<p>I would have respected you more if you stuck to the blunderbuss of an argument you presented initially, as incorrect and mystifying as it was coming from a &quot;litigator.&quot; </p>

<p>Now, it seems as though your strategy has shifted to the employ of &quot;mental gymnastics&quot; to avoid being wrong, and I  see no further reason to engage in discourse with someone who would conduct themselves so dishonestly. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Allred has certainly run afoul of the rule in 3.6 in speaking publicly about unconfirmed evidence and investigations that have a highly prejudicial impact on ANY subsequent legal proceedings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rule doesn&#39;t refer to comments that could potentially prejudice any theoretical following proceedings. It refers explicitly and repeatedly to contemporaneous proceedings, and to a restriction that tapers off the further those proceedings get from the statements at issue. </p>

<p>There is no example, anywhere I can find, of any instance of the 3.6 language being applied to statements outside of an existing judicial matter; there are examples, as cited, of statements being excluded from 3.6 because there was no contemporaneous matter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Section (a) of rule 3.6 states the general premise: &quot;a lawyer is not to speak extrajudicially about litigation/investigation that they are or have been involved in.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no litigation. And the rule cannot mean that a lawyer cannot speak extrajudicially about <em>any</em> investigation in which she is involved, because that would grossly violate the First Amendment. Which is why it&#39;s not applied that way, or written that way--that sentence is in a context that repeatedly, explicitly refers to contemporaneous judicial actions. </p>

<p>From the title of the rule to its comments, it is completely full of contextual information about how it applies: only to contemporaneous proceedings. See, i.e., comments 1 and 3. </p>

<p>The core test is whether an extrajudicial comment &quot;will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding.&quot; See <em>Gentile,</em> the case which created the standard on which the rule is based. When there is no proceeding, no statement is likely to prejudice a proceeding. </p>

<p>Your theory seems to be that her statement prejudices whatever case might one day be filed. Since we know protections gradate down from &quot;imminent jury trial&quot; at the most protective to &quot;non-jury hearing&quot; down at the bottom, &quot;no hearing and no complaint and no court but maybe one day there will be some process&quot; hardly registers on the scale at all--particularly when balanced against the First Amendment, which <em>Gentile</em> and the comments make clear is the pressure that forces the rule to recede the further away one gets from an actual trial (especially a criminal trial).</p>

<p>As for your comments on paragraph (b), I honestly don&#39;t know how to respond other than to try and explain what a safe harbor is. They create explicit exceptions to the rule established in (a), such that even if that rule applied comments falling under one of the provisions in (b) would be exempt from it. </p>

<p>The rule includes paragraphs a, b, and c. Reading just one part in isolation is extremely bad practice; if you just read the rule and not the exceptions, you can&#39;t figure out whether any particular comment is subject to the rule. (Well, in this case you actually could, because (a) doesn&#39;t apply--but reading the comments would help you see that, too.)</p>

<p>Do you really practice law this way, reading just one paragraph of a rule or statute and insisting that the rest doesn&#39;t matter? Or trying to tell a court that the context of a sentence is irrelevant, if you don&#39;t like it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is your third about-face as it relates to the applicable legal standard. However, myself and the remainder of this thread continue to wait with bated breath for your first correct statement of it. </p>

<p>......Now we are talking about &quot;safe harbors&quot; for the rule! Any lawyer knows arguing the safe harbor is the equivalent of waiving a white flag. </p>

<p>Your strategy so far:  </p>

<p>1) &quot;the express language of the rule says 3.6 applies only to public comments during trial&quot;</p>

<pre><code>       Response: 3.6 is very clear that it has application     outside of litigation
</code></pre>

<p>2) &quot;well even if 3.6 applies outside of litigation, a prejudice standard prevents its application here!&quot;</p>

<pre><code>        Response: what Allred did is highly prejudicial because she engaged the court of public opinion to up her odds of success/poison her jury pool
</code></pre>

<p>3) &quot;bbbbbbutttttt the safe harbor!&quot;</p>

<pre><code>        Response: myself and 15 other associates spending the last half of the day attempting to guess which state has a low enough MPRE score cutoff for you to have actually been barred. We settled on the most likely scenario: you are a lawyer in Puerto Rico.

<p>I&#39;d be surprised but pleased if anyone else was still reading this exchange.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any lawyer knows arguing the safe harbor is the equivalent of waiving a white flag. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not, I think, a lawyer who has ever argued a case.</p>

<p>Nor do we need to argue safe harbors if you don&#39;t want to. Paragraph (a) doesn&#39;t apply. As the rule and its commentaries (both integral and practice guides) make clear, the coverage of paragraph (a) recedes as the comment gets further away from a trial. No judicial proceedings at all, no coverage. That&#39;s made clear in the case the ABA cited, where comments were explicitly out of the rule&#39;s coverage when there was no proceeding they could influence. </p>

<p>And in <em>Gentile</em> and other cases, where courts point out that the only justification for abridging a lawyer&#39;s First Amendment rights is the threat of impacting judicial proceedings--the less the threat, the less the justification. There can be no threat of impacting nonexistent proceedings. (&quot;But there may be proceedings one day&quot; doesn&#39;t save the argument; there could <em>always</em> be hypothetical future proceedings for any comment, anywhere, at any time. If that were the rule, then no lawyer could ever talk about any investigation she ever participated in, which is clearly impossible.)</p>

<p>But since the safe harbors exist, and they apply, you&#39;re doubly wrong. Even if there were active litigation, Allred would be entirely free to publicly discuss the evidence for her client&#39;s claims or defenses, as well as the public record.</p>

<p>As for arguing both (a) and (b), you seem surprisingly unclear on how legal arguments work; do you actually practice? In what capacity? It&#39;s not just common, but ubiquitous, to argue in the alternative: (a) doesn&#39;t apply, but if it does, (b) exempts these specific statements. Do you think it makes your argument stronger to spit insults at me for having a two-pronged argument, instead of addressing both prongs? </p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to make a serious argument, look for any cases in which any version of 3.6 has ever been applied in analogous circumstances (i.e., where there is no judicial proceeding). It&#39;s telling that in the most analogous case I could find, the fact that there was no ongoing judicial proceeding was dispositive to the applicability of 3.6(a). (See the ABA cite above.)</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find any precedent supporting your very strange reading of one sentence in the rule, especially given that your reading requires ignoring the rest of the rule, the commentary, and the underlying caselaw (particularly <em>Gentile).</em> I think that instead of acknowledging the lack of such precedent, or the significance of that lack, you&#39;ll boast about yourself and/or insult me. Feel free! Litigation taught me that argument matters more than braggadocio. And that some people never learn that.</p>

<p>That&#39;s your opinion. If you live there you can and should vote for or against him based on that, not on unproven allegations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All that matters is that he triggers liberals.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That might be what some people think, and I admit, I hate identity politics, race baiting, and the victim mentality that embodies the left; it&#39;s what made me vote for Trump after being a lifelong democrat, I&#39;ll never vote democrat again, but that isn&#39;t why Trump and so called MAGA candidates are doing well. I voted for Obama for Change<sup><sup><sup><sup><sup>TM,</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> it turns out he was one of the worst, least transparent presidents we&#39;ve ever had but for some reason liberals gloss over all his deportations, drone killings, killing Americans without due process, going after whistleblowers, anemic economy and so called &quot;recovery&quot;, doubling the national debt etc etc even though they wrongly accuse Trump of those same things. </p>

<p>Then I liked Bernie; if anyone could bring change it would be him! He&#39;s been in politics for decades and never flip flopped his positions, he has integrity and can&#39;t be bought... and then he got screwed over by Clinton, gave her his money he raised from people that hated her, endorsed her; not to mention a lot of his policies when you actually look at them are just stupid. So, another candidate that would really shake things up, but it turned out that no, not really, he&#39;s just another political stooge.</p>

<p>Then we have Trump: a real outsider, never held political office (being a politician isn&#39;t a requirement to become a politician, our country was founded by businessmen without political experience), not beholden to special interests, against divisive identity politics, puts America and Americans first, as he should being the American president... for the first time in decades we have someone that wasn&#39;t shaped and formed in the political system, an actual candidate for change. The only problem is <em>everyone</em> is against him, democrats and republicans, the media etc, and to me that&#39;s a good sign. The next step is to get rid of the entrenched politicians who have become multi millionaires by &quot;serving&quot; the public, the Pelosis, McConnels, McCains, Schumers etc.</p>

<p>So no, all that matters is not that they trigger liberals, but it also is, because what matters is that they support President Trump&#39;s policies, and that will trigger liberals on it&#39;s own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said he was incorruptible, but so far there&#39;s no evidence of him being corrupt while there&#39;s plenty for the other side. Sure there&#39;s tons of accusations, as soon as one is played out and goes nowhere they come up with another one. But, just like my reasoning for not being against Moore at this time, accusations are not evidence of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>He absolutely is against identity politics, which is pretty much the exclusive domain of the left; the white nationalists that have been on the news, while not as pervasive as they make it seem, are a direct reaction to leftist identity politics which seek to elevate any sort of minority, whether it be blacks, mexicans, gays, even women who are in fact a larger segment of the population than men, and say that all their problems are because of white people, white people are oppressors blah blah blah. The right is for meritocracy.</p>

<p>Does anyone put anyone or anything above themselves? That&#39;s human nature. What I mean by putting America and Americans first is that he isn&#39;t going to put us in something like the Paris Climate Accord which would cost us thousands of jobs, trillions of dollars, and artificially hobble our economy so that it&#39;s &quot;more fair&quot; for other countries to compete with us, all while having a negligible effect on the environment and not even being a binding agreement so everyone can keep doing what they want anyways. He&#39;s not going to go on a worldwide America bashing apology tour a la Obama. He&#39;s not going to continue to let NAFTA hurt the American worker. If the policies he makes help him personally I&#39;m fine with that, because it would be pretty much impossible to make policies that <em>only</em> affect him, if they&#39;re helping him they&#39;re helping everyone.</p>

<p>And yes, there is the glee in upsetting the other side. But it&#39;s not partisanship gone mad, it&#39;s the left that&#39;s gone mad. Like I said, I was a lifelong democrat, the party today is <em>nothing</em> like it was even 5 years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously? Are you falling for the idea that pizzagate was political and some &#39;right wing conspiracy&#39;? I, for one, completely care about Roy Moore. I don&#39;t get where you are getting it from that the &#39;pizzagate crowd&#39; doesn&#39;t care about it? </p>

<p>To me Roy Moore seems more like some dirty disgusting guy preying on teens and I guess while that&#39;s horrific it&#39;s still less horrific than trafficking children, raping torturing and murdering them, so maybe that&#39;s why there&#39;s less about him. People are keen on exposing the pedophiles who go after and systematically abuse infants and young children. Maybe that&#39;s where you&#39;re getting this idea from? But to a) act as though all pizzagate investigators think the same abotu everything or all have the same politics and b) think that people don&#39;t care about someone abusing others no matter what their politics, is completely wrong and disingenuous. I&#39;m left wing, always have been, yet I know pizzagate is real and has nothing to do with politics other than the fact that many politicians (on both sides) are involved in it. </p>

<p>I think the people who try to pretend pedophilia or any kind of abuse is a partisan issue are terrible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Moore is just being accused. Everything hinges on accusations. Pizzagate is a situation that shed light on the personal lives of those connected to it. For example: James Alefantis and his Instagram, Podesta art collection and spirit cooking. If Moore had similar things going on in his life, I&#39;m certain people would be more inclined to believe the accusations. All people have to go on right now is what the MSM is pushing. People do not trust the MSM. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, I&#39;ll explain it. Death metal (and heavy metal generally) has long been a witchypoo halloween themed genre of entertainment used by adolescents to scare their parents. Sometimes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Memphis_Three">witch hunts</a> have emerged and from this scenario. </p>

<p>So the joke is: A guy (you) who is <em>apparently</em> a fan of the genre of music called &#39;death metal&#39; has gotten all squeamish about another person&#39;s taste in art, to the point that he&#39;s willing to draw all kinds of conclusions.

    <div class="md"><p>It paints a picture of their character. Like a character witness in a court case. The accusation is just that, an accusation. It might call for an investigation, but it doesn&#39;t make him guilty. Having incriminating material on your Instagram or collecting pedo art and attending spirit cookings are not accusations. Those are things these people actually do. They are not accusations. Look how the MSM handled them differently. We don&#39;t trust the MSM here. If you claim that the Podesta&#39;s and the group are innocent because there is no solid evidence then you would have to treat Moore the same way. They don&#39;t and we see that.

    <div class="md"><p>In your (wildly over-indulgent) analysis you proved my point a number of times: </p>

<p>Allred has certainly run afoul of the rule in 3.6 in speaking publicly about unconfirmed evidence and investigations that have a highly prejudicial impact on ANY subsequent legal proceedings. </p>

<p>As for your claim that I am incorrect because I did not read &quot;the whole rule:&quot; </p>

<p>Section (a) of rule 3.6 states the general premise: &quot;a lawyer is not to speak extrajudicially about litigation/investigation that they are or have been involved in.&quot;</p>

<p>Section (b) lists the exceptions to section (a). You talking about &quot;the whole rule&quot; as if part (b) provides an alternate reading of part (a) is patently absurd, and a total misrepresentation as to the state of the rule.  </p>

<p>Finally, you&#39;ll note from your original comment that we were not &quot;discussing&quot; the rules as you so diplomatically heel turn now, but I was entirely incorrect in asserting 3.6 applied to public statements made by an attorney prior to trial.  You stated, and I quote verbatim: </p>

<pre><code>         &quot;The rule explicitly applies to publicity around a trial.&quot; 
</code></pre>

<p>That is a far cry from your current position, articulated above, and undoubtedly more convoluted and wishy washy than where you started.  You are attempting to change, as you go along, the definition of the rule, in addition to the substance of your argument. The sign of a lazy litigator is the inability to stick to the issue and support their argument. The only issue here is whether Allred is subject to rule 3.6 for the yearbook statements, and I have proven that she is, through simply reading the express language of the rule. </p>

<p>First, you started with  &quot;3.6 deals ONLY with trials,&quot; now its &quot;3.6 doesn&#39;t only deal with trials but there are prejudice considerations that inform the rule.&quot; </p>

<p>Next, you&#39;ll  tell me what Martian lawyers can say in their pressers, and argue that&#39;s the correct application on earth. </p>

<p>I would have respected you more if you stuck to the blunderbuss of an argument you presented initially, as incorrect and mystifying as it was coming from a &quot;litigator.&quot; </p>

<p>Now, it seems as though your strategy has shifted to the employ of &quot;mental gymnastics&quot; to avoid being wrong, and I  see no further reason to engage in discourse with someone who would conduct themselves so dishonestly. </p>
