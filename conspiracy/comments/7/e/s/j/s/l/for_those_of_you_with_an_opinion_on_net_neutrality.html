<p>I&#39;m going to do some assuming here and say no. I tried. Pulled it up and couldn&#39;t do it. It&#39;s written in persuasive legal context. It&#39;s 75 pages and I didn&#39;t have the time to put into it to gain a real perspective. No one does, at least those of us in the general population. Given enough time I could, I can learn. So can you. But we don&#39;t.</p>

<p>The thought police are here, and operating in you and me. That&#39;s a real conspiracy. They have told us how to live, indoctrinated our education, and they tell us what to buy. And we let them do it, because we don&#39;t know any better. What if we formed a groups, and each group tackled a section of this proposal? And then we talked about it, not politically, to gain understanding. Not to be right, but just so we each can make our own informed decision. Instead, we spend some time with this source or that, letting them interpret it and taking that interpretation as our own. No research, no time invested, just passionate platforming to prove ourselves right so that we can pat ourselves on the back because we are so smart. The thought police own us, does anyone think it&#39;s time to take our minds back?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would think it&#39;s safe to say 99 percent of people currently arguing either in favor of or against it have absolutely no idea what it&#39;s actually about. There&#39;s an infowar going on right now. </p>

<p>Im trying to sift through all the opinions on it to try to figure it out. It seems like those who would be affected by the loss of it most (if the throttling and censorship rumors are true) seem to be against it, with big corporations for it. Which I find highly suspicious. </p>

<p>In terms of genuine users, Comcast subscribers are consistently in support of it. Explaining that is as simple as understanding that Comcast sucks, but has no real competition in most regions.</p>

<p>In terms of &quot;big corporations,&quot; they split both ways. ISPs (and likely any company which delivers physical infrastructure) are against it. Content providers (and by extension social media sites) are for it.</p>

<p>NN regulations were passed in 2015. Is the internet more &quot;free and open&quot; today than it was in 2014? Think about it. It&#39;s done absolutely nothing to make the internet free and open, and has done everything to give the government a foot in the door. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still amazed at all the people who scream that Trump&#39;s team are fascist, but are now screaming that Trump&#39;s &quot;fascist&quot; team is trying to take their foot out of the door. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because that&#39;s the core tenet behind the concept of net neutrality. Think of your internet access, as you have it now, like your power bill, or your water bill. You pay for what you use, not how you use it.</p>

<p>The legislations that have been continually pushed forward over the past half-decade (SOPA, PIPA, etc.) have been designed to allow ISPs to charge people for HOW you use your internet by throttling domains or straight up disallowing domain access without paying for it first. That&#39;s why you hear that term so often, because the internet in its current iteration IS free and open, and it should stay that way.</p>

<p>Stop doing this. The internet is not the same thing as power or water. Stop conflating things needed for survival and something you use for entertainment. It purposefully muddies the water. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You pay for what you use, not how you use it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s also incorrect. You can&#39;t pay for what you use with the internet service because it&#39;s not a consumable product like electricity and water. I can fill a lane, sure, but I cannot use a lane up (i.e: so it no longer exists, as happens when you drink water). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>because the internet in its current iteration IS free and open</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, no it&#39;s not. It&#39;s anything but. </p>

<p>Also, NN has been on the books since 2015. How&#39;s your internet bill looking? It&#39;s gotten cheaper since then, right? It hasn&#39;t gotten increasingly more expensive? These companies haven&#39;t found a way to make their money, regardless of NN, right? </p>

<p>Net Neutrality has been super effective. The internet is more censorious, service prices are skyrocketing, and people are begging the government to keep the status quo.</p>

<p>Someone&#39;s wet dream.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was not an argument to conflate internet access with being of the same importance as power and water, but as to how the consumer is charged for them.</p>

<p>With power and water you&#39;re charged for what you use, but it doesn&#39;t matter how you use it. With internet, you&#39;re paying for access and currently the way you use your internet access has no bearing on what your monthly bill is.</p>

<p>Under all of this FCC-backed legislation that is purported to change, and that&#39;s been an underlying theme ever since the issue has been talked about, starting years ago. Which is why the internet gets its collective panties in a twist every time these bills rear their heads up.</p>

<p>Comparing internet access to other utilities was purely to point out that these legislative bills would be akin to allowing electricity providers to charge consumers differently in accordance to which appliances they use their power on.</p>

<p>And anecdotally, my internet access has gotten cheaper, with better speeds, since 2015.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My internet has nearly doubled and I&#39;m now paying over $200 a month thanks to new data cap overages. My speeds relative to what I pay for have also gotten worse. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t think the internet should be regulated at all. I also don&#39;t think they necessarily need to be billed the same way water and power is billed. </p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;d rather a cheaper packaged service to what I have now. Over $200 a month is insanity. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, it appears people forget what the internet was before 2015. It was much more open then it is now. The FCC is proposing we undo the Tier 2 regulations (IIRC, working from memory in the car), which would send us back to 2014. </p>

<p>Was then internet so much worse in 2014? Was it the wild wild west? No. As I&#39;ve said, I think those were better times of internet openness. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sucks. I take it you&#39;ve shopped around?</p>

<p>I agree in that the internet shouldn&#39;t be regulated, and I&#39;m not a fan of the pro-corporate T2 regulations that were instated in 2015. However, I voice my dislike of those regulations by abstaining from paying for the services of the companies whom received industry leverage thanks to said regulations.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be surprised if I find that the FCC is actually attempting 
 to repeal regulations, and that this isn&#39;t just another SOPA bill in disguise. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t really have the time or energy to read further into it until the weekend. Until then I&#39;m assuming this is just another pseudonymous SOPA.</p>

<p>The internet, to me, is much the same as it was pre-2015. I suppose it depends on how you use it. I know I sure as hell don&#39;t want to be paying for packages and having to forego access to specific domains lest I cough up for it, though.</p>

<p>I support the repeal because I hope there&#39;s another move. I know there&#39;s probably not, but I still prefer pre-2015 internet to one which continues with the FCC&#39;s foot in the door. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I &quot;admitted&quot; to no such thing.  Work on your reading comprehension.  ISPs have been trying to pick away at net neutrality for decades.  This is not a new issue.  The reason net neutrality has been preserved all these years is because of activism and consumer pressure.  Just because you only recently started paying attention to this issue doesn&#39;t mean that it hasn&#39;t been raging for decades.  Net neutrality is still under threat from the very telecom companies that you are defending.</p>

<p>If protecting net neutrality fixes a &quot;non-existent problem&quot; then why are big telecom lobbyists working tooth-and-nail to overturn those protections?  Give me a break.  I will bet <em>your</em> next paycheck that as soon as those rules are overturned, ISPs are going to go back to throttling Netflix traffic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Section 3 of the Act defines an “information service” as “the offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or &gt;making available information via telecommunications, and includes electronic publishing, but does not include any use of any such capability for the management, &gt;control, or operation of a telecommunications system or the management of a telecommunications service.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks....this issue fully illustrates how we don&#39;t use our mind, and how it is manipulated by those using theirs. And many people have valid views, but you and I are allowed to feel differently. I feel that if we all look at a viewpoint, then the opposing viewpoint, then gather all the facts we can and take that information and think, we could arrive at our own conclusions. Instead of spouting the first headline from google that proves a point, we need to say &quot;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;d like more information&quot; and think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That sucks. I take it you&#39;ve shopped around?</p>

<p>I agree in that the internet shouldn&#39;t be regulated, and I&#39;m not a fan of the pro-corporate T2 regulations that were instated in 2015. However, I voice my dislike of those regulations by abstaining from paying for the services of the companies whom received industry leverage thanks to said regulations.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be surprised if I find that the FCC is actually attempting 
 to repeal regulations, and that this isn&#39;t just another SOPA bill in disguise. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t really have the time or energy to read further into it until the weekend. Until then I&#39;m assuming this is just another pseudonymous SOPA.</p>

<p>The internet, to me, is much the same as it was pre-2015. I suppose it depends on how you use it. I know I sure as hell don&#39;t want to be paying for packages and having to forego access to specific domains lest I cough up for it, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you are using a ridiculous semantic argument, hopefully this will help:</p>

<p>The internet was free and &quot;neutral&quot; (which is vague but whatever) before the FCC reclassified ISPs as common carriers. A decision which would likely be struck down by SCOTUS anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yeah, now that you mention it, I suppose I&#39;m just biased from being a network administrator</p>

<p>Its pretty clear to me that my legal experience, especially in administrative law and having kept up with the FCC during and after their reclassification, gives me a far better understanding of this topic than does your being a network administrator.</p>
