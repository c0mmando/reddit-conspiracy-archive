    <div class="md"><p>The credibility of sources is based on past reputation.</p>

<p>For instance, WaPo has plenty of accusations of being biased but you never see an article that was wrong. It&#39;s the fluff and opinion pieces that are biased. Hence WaPo is credible for factual information but not credible for it&#39;s opinions and telling you how to see the information. Thier annomynous sources are solid and have a good track record.</p>

<p>If a WaPo article claimed through sources that a CIA raid happened I would consider it credible and a high probability.</p>

<p>So yes MSM can be credible, but not all MSM is credible(looking at you CNN and Fox). Using the term MSM is counterproductive as it aims to translate negatives from one source to another. It is much more prudent to accertain the merits of each source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>PARTS of MSM are truthful. It&#39;s just what they&#39;re saying with it. They can easily use the bits of truth and mix in jibber-jibber that sounds like a relevant variable to an average person to say something totally different, e.g. this infamous example: 
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/second-presidential-debate-live-fact-checking-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-st-louis-washington-university/">&quot;Trump is correct that Clinton used a computer program called “BleachBit” to delete thousands of her emails. But the program can be downloaded online for free and it does not use chemicals. A footnote on an FBI investigation document noted that BleachBit is “open source software that allows users to ‘shred’ files, clear Internet history, delete system and temporary files and wipe free space on a hard drive.” &quot;</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>UPDATE 9:17 PM EST -- <a href="http://halturnerradioshow.com">http://halturnerradioshow.com</a>
Despite actually having a personal life, and despite today being Sunday, which is family time, I have done a LOT of digging on this story.  I have reached out to contacts in both the Pentagon and in several Intel Agencies and here is what I can confirm:</p>

<p>This story has gone viral and sadly, a number of people who copied the story, added some of their own speculation or assumptions.  Some of the copies offer absolutely wild variations on the basic report above.</p>

<p>Nowhere on this web site did I even make mention of any &quot;coup&quot; against the President.  Those rumors came from others acting on their own.  </p>

<p>Nowhere on this web site did I claim there were 2200 Marines sent to the CIA.  I reported the typical size of an MEU as being typically 2200 and some readers  assumed that all 2200 went to CIA. </p>

<p>Now, about the troops.  I have been told that &quot; a very significant number&quot; of troops WERE sent to CIA and arrived via aircraft on Saturday, November 18.  I was not told a precise number.  I was not told WHY they were sent.  I was not told what time they were sent.</p>

<p>My article above reports that a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is comprised of about 2200 Marines.  That&#39;s factually accurate. </p>

<p>But the Ground Combat Element of an MEU is 1100 troops.</p>

<p>The Aviation Element consists of 12 MV-22s (Osprey) and 4 Sikorsky CH-53 &quot;Super Stallion&quot; helicopters.</p>

<p>Each MV-22 carries 24 troops standard, and 32 if they cram them in.</p>

<p>Each CH-53 carries 37 troops standard, and if the extra seats are installed 55 troops.</p>

<p>So going with the absolute max per aircraft, the Osprey element can carry 384 troops, and the CH-53 element 220.</p>

<p>That means 604 troops in a single lift. So if they were using all 1100 troops of the ground combat element that would be two trips for each aircraft. </p>

<p>The CIA Headquarters building is located at 1000 Colonial Farm Road in McLean, Virginia, and can be reached via George Washington Memorial Parkway.</p>

<p>However, due to a need for secrecy, the complex may only be accessed by those with authorization (e.g., appropriate credentials) or by appointment; only authorized vehicles may access the private road leading to the complex from George Washington Memorial Parkway.</p>

<p>You cannot &quot;clearly see&quot; the grounds of the installation from anywhere because the front gate is down a long, two-lane road and there&#39;s trees and man-made hills all around the perimeter of it to protect from Sniper fire coming from nearby roads.  </p>

<p>This means that the public couldn&#39;t just wander by and start snapping pictures by the side of the road. In fact, people aren&#39;t even allowed on the private roads nearby the installation. </p>

<p>Both the MV-22 Osprey and Sikorsky CH-53 Super Stallion are loud when they&#39;re flying; there would be no sneaking them in.</p>

<p>And it is this component that I followed-up on:  Did nearby residents in McLean suddenly notice a large number of loud helicopters overhead, moving toward or from the area of the CIA.   The repeated answer to that question has been &quot;Yes.&quot; </p>

<p>Many (very many) residents of McLean, VA have confirmed they found themselves hearing large numbers of loud aircraft overhead on Saturday, and that the sounds lasted more then 30 minutes!</p>

<p>As far as a definitive statement from any of my former colleagues . . . . NONE of them would reveal any details about whatever is going on down there.  But they did confirm to me today  &quot;something is going on.&quot;</p>

<p>I expect to have several additional contacts overnight and will again update this story if I am able to offer something more concise and verifiable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like he updated again:  </p>

<p>UPDATE 2:23 PM EST -- MONDAY, NOV. 20  </p>

<p>I have now spoken to almost ALL of my former colleagues in the Intelligence Community and here&#39;s what took place:  </p>

<p>Yes, a group of military aircraft approached and circled the CIA Headquarters in Virginia for upwards of 30 minutes on Saturday.  They did NOT land and did NOT enter CIA HQ forcibly - or otherwise.  </p>

<p>There is apparently an ongoing and gigantic problem between the Military and the CIA insofar as the Military is engaged in implementing President Trump&#39;s policies, while elements within the CIA are still INTENTIONALLY carrying out the failed policies of the Obama regime.   </p>

<p>Specifically, these failed Obama-era policies include supplying weapons and logistical support to so-called &quot;freedom fighters&quot; inside Syria , many of whom are actually Al-Nusra, Al-Qaida and ISIS terrorists.  </p>

<p>The support being provided by elements in the CIA is being used against certain units of the US Military who are also inside Syria.  </p>

<p>The Military has repeatedly and strenuously told the CIA the old Obama policies must stop.  The CIA failed to stop.  </p>

<p>So someone in the Pentagon/Military . . . . no one will say who . . . made a direct show of force to the CIA on Saturday.  It was, for lack of a better description, the sending of a message from the military to the CIA: knock it off.   </p>

<p>It was done over a weekend apparently because most of the bigshots in the Pentagon are at home, and by the time they heard something was going on, it was pretty much over . . . . the aircraft returned to wherever they came from.  </p>

<p>This is utterly unprecedented.  To have one agency of the US Government make a show of force to another entity of that same government is unheard of. It smacks of a sort of internal civil war heating up inside our own government!  </p>

<p>Apparently, things are quickly &quot;coming to a head&quot; between competing policies and the military is tired of its people being injured or killed by the unintended consequences of the old policies and the CIA&#39; stubborn refusal to stop backing the so-called &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot; in Syria.  </p>

<p>No one will tell me who gave the order to &quot;buzz&quot; CIA HQ.  No one will tell me who inside CIA is causing the trouble.  But there is  trouble . . . and given the activities over the weekend, one can only hope this thing goes away very quickly and quietly.  </p>

<p>In the meantime, as far as the public is concerned: &quot;Nothing took place. Everything is fine.  Nothing to worry about.&quot;</p>
