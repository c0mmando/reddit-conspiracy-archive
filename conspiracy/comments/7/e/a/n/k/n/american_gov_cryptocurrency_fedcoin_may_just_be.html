<p>Its all trending towards cryptocurrencies, China&#39;s on board, so is Russia. Shit is moving so fest, wall street and CME futures markets are starting to buy in. </p>

<p>Many academics are predicting once crypto becomes normal and adopted by majority, eventually there will be a shift into a 1 world currency:</p>

<p>How can we buy Fedcoin?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>its still up in the air. However if you want to get rich quick, a few things. Keep an eye on this and be the first to get on it. Second, keep watching China, Japan, Russia, and all other top tech countries and what crypto they are using the most with the highest buy volumes, and jump in ASAP because these have the biggest potential to become integrated into those countries official country-coin, why? Because those top techies will get pulled into to the Gov&#39;s to help create the official Gov coins.</p>

<p>Regardless, shit is going SOOOOOOO fucking fast, everything is turning crypto these days and cash/fiat days are numbered.</p>

<p>We are still very early in the collective consciousness still not catching up to all this, just as this sub is usually first to entertain a lot of possibilities, many of which end up being true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The federal reserve already invested into ethereum. Ethereum is Fedcoin.</p>

<p>&quot;The Federal Reserve already is the primary investor of basically every cryptocurrency and blockchain project in existence. While in a previous article I dug into their investment arm the Digital Currency Group and how they heavily funded operations like Coinbase, Coindesk, Kraken, Ripple, I’ve since discovered the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp. (DTCC): an open member of the Federal Reserve. They are responsible for the remaining spectrum of the blockchain, including Ethereum.&quot;</p>

<p>that&#39;s the point, those in power freaking the fuck out, governments, imf, central bankers, !% wtc, if they dont have control now, they were force it in a way via regulations and/or making &quot;their&quot; coin the only legal form</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take a look at the recent fork. It did not pass because the consensus among miners wasn’t reached. what you are seeing with bitcoin is that there is an increasing consolidation of consensus authority in the hands of a few large miners. It’s nice to believe that it is decentralized and can’t be controlled but the truth could not be farther from that. If miners want to control the direction the currency and technology takes they can easily do so, and have done so in order to benefit their own interests. Don’t be so quick to fall for fancy words like decentralized. In theory yes everyone can mine and do the “validation” part of crypto on their iPhone or home computer but mostly people do not. It’s kind of a free rider problem. People just want to be able to use it like cash, not support the whole currency by participating. In real life it’s easier. You support the system by going to work and trusting that you’ll be paid in scrip from your employer. Scrip that is accepted everywhere for every kind of good and service. It will never be that way with crypto currencies unless governments, with the support and trust of their people, take it on themselves to maintain a working and transparent system. People fear the central banks because they don’t understand how they work. In fact most people on earth don’t understand how money works and why, but that’s okay because it doesn’t prevent them from using it. Only prevents them from using it wisely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Multiple people verify the USD by continuing to use it and trust in it. Central banks don’t randomly decide to do anything, and they don’t just “produce a bunch of dollars” (a gross oversimplification). An important attribute of a commodity is its fixed and scarce nature. An important attribute of currency (fiat) is the ability to appreciate and depreciate in directions and vectors that contribute to greater velocity of money and therefore increased economic activity. There is no incentive to spend bitcoin as long as it is expected to increase in value. On the contrary a good currency has enough built in inflation to encourage people to spend their money or seek returns on it by investing it. Bitcoin has thus far failed and will continue to fail as a currency. It’s better to consider it a crypto-commodity. At least ethereum underpins a platform. Bitcoin underpins nothing but speculation. This is why something like FedCoin or whatever they decide to call it will be far superior as a currency, because the minds behind it understand the purpose and function of money in a society. </p>
