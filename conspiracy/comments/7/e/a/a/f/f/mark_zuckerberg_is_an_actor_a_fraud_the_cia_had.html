These links seem to show Facebook was live in 2003. Started by what&#39;s likely a CIA type front company AboutFace in Boston, and that it already had fortune 500 clients. This Facebook of 2003 even has a similar origin story to Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s. It seems they just swapped him out with Mark.<br/>
Compare the &#39;company history&#39; in the first link below to Zuckerberg&#39;s facemash.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not talking about a similar social media company that might have stolen a name from the other.
This other facebook in Boston had <a href="http://www.facebook.com">www.facebook.com</a> according to an archive made in 1999.
(First link)<br/>
There were even cases of people being on the Facebook of Mark Zuckerberg and getting rerouted to AboutFace.com. (Yahoo Answers link below)  </p>

<p>Official Facebook origin story is that Mark made Facemash in 2003 and Facebook in 2004</p>

<p>This is very strange stuff. For instance:<br/>
AboutFace Corporation was founded in 1993 and is located in Boston, Massachusetts.<br/>
In 1994, with the release of the Electronic Facebook™, we invented the software category now known as &quot;social networking&quot;.<br/>
AboutFace Directory Server makes it easy for your firm to manage and publish information about its most important asset -- your people.   </p>

<p>And more:<br/>
The idea behind AboutFace evolved while Grossman was still in college. He developed, printed and sold a facebook his freshman year that included students’ photographs, home addresses, and birthdays. By using information already available in the Williams College database, he eliminated hours of typesetting and reduced production costs.<br/>
Grossman’s entrepreneurial spirit has paid off. Today Atlantic Media counts among its clients half of Boston’s largest law firms, including Goodwin, Procter &amp; Hoar; Choate, Hall &amp; Stewart; and Brown, Rudnick, Freed &amp; Gesmer, as well several other law firms around the country and institutions such as Harvard College and Northeastern University.  </p>

<p>Zed Shaw is a software developer<br/>
He wrote a blog post once where he described people always trying to get him to build a social media site to take on Facebook and he would tell them Facebook can&#39;t be beaten because it had CIA backing.<br/>
&quot; If you tell me that your social network will take on facebook because it includes baby pictures then I’m going to laugh in your face. They are an established player with CIA backing.&quot;<br/>

<p>Why Mark? Why the twins and betrayal of his business partners? Why make up the Facemash and &quot;they gave me their info, stupid f****rs&quot;? Because a conspirator who embarrasses himself makes you react to them emotionally and makes you less likely to question that they would have created a fake story IN WHICH they publicly embarrassed themselves.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also seen the evidence that Einstein was a total fraud and put out there as some type of inspiration. Makes you wonder about certain people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah wait til you see the lives some of us have had to live. Pretty insane once you see how they control people what you can realize/find out about your surroundings and why they are the way they are. For example I have double power lines in front of my house. Power lines are one thing they can use to affect human beings. They had 2 power lines double the strength on my house hold.</p>

<p>Some people are watched every day of their lives literally and tormented every day too. You do not want to see the punishment I&#39;m fully in favor of laying down on these people. Eternal life comes first and once we make sure people can live forever we can lay out real life sentences. Life sentences as in we&#39;re all living 5000 + years and since I have millions of people on hundreds of counts of murder I could see 5000 year sentences for many people. Doctors, politicians, secret society rulers. It&#39;s why they&#39;re purposely dying because they know I&#39;m coming. As Tupac raps &quot;Motherfuckers know I&#39;m coming so they&#39;re running to their graves watch&quot;</p>

<p>All of them are ready to die they&#39;d blow their brains out before they&#39;d let me get to them. That&#39;s why this week anyone in any position of power should be on suicide watch. Don&#39;t let them kill themselves, many will try. </p>

<p>Hilarious</p>

<p>good thing in my opinion, so long as you avoid hitler and anti-semitism</p>

<blockquote>

<p>OMG he didn&#39;t end the fed immediately?  I can&#39;t believe how he&#39;s betrayed me!!!</p>

<p>He dismantled the NSC and he pledged to the CIA that he would build them a new room, &quot;one without pillars.&quot;</p>

<p>Would the fact that I&#39;ve worked in corporations mean I&#39;m compromised, necessarily?  Couldn&#39;t it be just as true that my experience with the system would mean I would understand some of the requirements for replacing the system?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that the &quot;too big to fail&quot; meme is real.  What would happen to the global economy if corporate law was stricken out?  What would happen if  fractional reserve fiat were overturned?</p>

<p>In my opinion, this is what needs to happen.  A return to sound money, return of the magna carta rules on usory...  The hope is that Trump is working on a way to transition towards these goals without causing a world-wide economic collapse...  Such a thing may take a generation or more.  I mean, heck, the World Bank and later the IMF transitioned us into our current system over a period of 200+ years and involved countless wars and economic collapses, so, a Greenback-esque plan might be extremely long-term.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No shit!</p>

<p>I believe he was good and genuine but was compromised quickly...  Not sure if that really counts for optimism. If you go back and watch the coverage surrounding Trump&#39;s first meeting with Obama...  I remember thinking, damn, president-elect Trump looks like he just saw a ghost.  That&#39;s when I think they showed him his file...</p>

<p>I think the hidden hand wanted Hillary, because she&#39;s a complicit actor...  But I never believed &quot;they couldn&#39;t stop Trump.&quot;</p>

<p>I think they let him happen because they knew they could control him with blackmail.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m only disagreeing slightly, it had more control but at the expense of being inundated with the sound, fury, and bad taste of MANY.</p>

<p>By letting users use canned and self made html, passed around scripts, and them having too much control of changing the UI led to sparkling flashing gifs, color scheme and fonts clashing to the point of unreadability while tinny background music blared. </p>

<p>I think the boring UI appealed to users, contributing the the switchover to Facebook. (That, and at the time, many learning institutions had Students use it, ,building up a generational wave of users)</p>

<p>As far as facebook, google, wikipedia..... my theory is that they start out innocent, then they are taken over by the some &quot;TPTB&quot; group after they&#39;re off the ground. I used to wonder if they would create these companies for control and information gathering and narrative control, but why would they do that when they can just secretly take over anything in the name of &quot;national security&quot; and then make use of it without even having to do any of the work? Then they will destroy any competitor, blocking or killing any facebook etc alternative. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what I think too.  I think that the government and the media got together and agreed that Facebook and Twitter would be the &quot;official&quot; social media sites so that they could be monitored and controlled more easily.  But it&#39;s also clear that all successful Silicon Valley companies were either started with government money or had a big investment from the government early on that helped them grow and become successful.</p>

It seems the work was stolen and compiled for him and became a kind of mascot of Jewish supremacy.
The work he stole isn&#39;t that hard to compare. Not much of the work requires heavy brain power even though we&#39;ve all been told Einstein was so smart he&#39;s incomprehensible. </p>

<p>&quot;Facebook&quot; was a term coined in the &#39;80s. AboutFace apparently developed a technology using the name years before Zuckerberg did the same. Membership on Facebook was originally only open to college students.</p>

<p>The theory that Zuckerberg is a CIA plant or asset is compelling, but I don&#39;t think the existence of AboutFace or the obvious uses of the term <em>facebook</em> in similar technologies lend any credence to it.</p>

<p>They had a service utilizing a trademarked technology called <em>Electronic Facebook™</em>. The word &quot;facebook&quot; itself goes back to the &#39;80s. It doesn&#39;t matter whether or not AboutFace was using the technology for college students; it was almost certainly derived from the previous usage.</p>

What&#39;s funny is this story of how this person&#39;s 90s and early 00s Facebook, (Also in Boston), has almost the same founding story as Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s Facebook. He puts all his fellow students into a directory. Remember Facemash?

<p>There is no &quot;about&quot; link on the captured website from 1999. I also can&#39;t find a link to <a href="http://www.facebook.com">www.facebook.com</a>. Can you refer me to the specific page on which you found it?</p>

<p>Still, if they had a technology literally called <em>Electronic Facebook</em>, it&#39;s no surprise that they might have also for a while owned the obvious domain, and many domains have changed hands over the years as they are either abandoned or resold.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not inconceivable that Zuckerberg essentially appropriated the name and idea. The fact that he was a Harvard student makes that <em>more likely</em> rather than coincidental.</p>

<p>I think this is a case of evolutionary branching with a mixture of homage and maybe some outright theft. I don&#39;t think the preexistence of AboutFace strengthens the Facebook/CIA connection unless a CIA connection to AboutFace can also be found.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right it&#39;s the company history link I erroneously called the &#39;about&#39; link. But I&#39;ve posted this link and told you it was captured in 1999 and shows he had <a href="http://www.facebook.com">www.facebook.com</a> then.</p>

<p>Look at my links. Most of the replies have been me telling you to look at the fucking links and I have to keep posting them over and over.  </p>

<p>There are many more similarities. The links say AboutFace &quot;created&quot; the branch of software called &#39;social networking&#39;.<br/>
How do you explain the parallel version of Facemash this twin creator of Facebook made?<br/>
You think Tom from Myspace, Twitter, or Friendster founders broke rules and ripped their college classmate&#39;s info and put it on a website?<br/>
Just a run of the mill thing social media rite of passage. Put all your classmates on a website while in college.  </p>

<p>You don&#39;t think this strengthens the Facebook/CIA connection? You work for the government or Facebook PR?<br/>
We all know Facebook is connected to the CIA.<br/>
AboutFace isn&#39;t interesting because it&#39;s a company full of CIA agents. The fact that it exists doesn&#39;t prove Mark is a plant and an actor but for intents and purposes it does with Occam&#39;s razor.</p>

<p>The fact AboutFace was never covered by the MSM or was even known on the internet also wreaks of an intelligence operation.</p>
