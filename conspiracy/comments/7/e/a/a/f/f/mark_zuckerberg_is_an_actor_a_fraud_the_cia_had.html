       We knew about InQTel but I think the assumption was that some three letter agency funded Mark after the platform got off the ground.
       <br/>
       These links seem to show Facebook was live in 2003. Started by what's likely a CIA type front company AboutFace in Boston, and that it already had fortune 500 clients. This Facebook of 2003 even has a similar origin story to Mark Zuckerberg's. It seems they just swapped him out with Mark.
       <br/>
       Compare the 'company history' in the first link below to Zuckerberg's facemash.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not talking about a similar social media company that might have stolen a name from the other.
This other facebook in Boston had
       <a href="http://www.facebook.com">
        www.facebook.com
       </a>
       according to an archive made in 1999.
(First link)
       <br/>
       There were even cases of people being on the Facebook of Mark Zuckerberg and getting rerouted to AboutFace.com. (Yahoo Answers link below)

      <p>
       Official Facebook origin story is that Mark made Facemash in 2003 and Facebook in 2004
      </p>
      <p>
       This is very strange stuff. For instance:
       <br/>
       AboutFace Corporation was founded in 1993 and is located in Boston, Massachusetts.
       <br/>
       In 1994, with the release of the Electronic Facebook™, we invented the software category now known as "social networking".
       <br/>
       AboutFace Directory Server makes it easy for your firm to manage and publish information about its most important asset -- your people.
      </p>
      <p>
       And more:
       <br/>
       The idea behind AboutFace evolved while Grossman was still in college. He developed, printed and sold a facebook his freshman year that included students’ photographs, home addresses, and birthdays. By using information already available in the Williams College database, he eliminated hours of typesetting and reduced production costs.
       <br/>
       Grossman’s entrepreneurial spirit has paid off. Today Atlantic Media counts among its clients half of Boston’s largest law firms, including Goodwin, Procter &amp; Hoar; Choate, Hall &amp; Stewart; and Brown, Rudnick, Freed &amp; Gesmer, as well several other law firms around the country and institutions such as Harvard College and Northeastern University.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zed Shaw is a software developer
       <br/>
       He wrote a blog post once where he described people always trying to get him to build a social media site to take on Facebook and he would tell them Facebook can't be beaten because it had CIA backing.
       <br/>
       " If you tell me that your social network will take on facebook because it includes baby pictures then I’m going to laugh in your face. They are an established player with CIA backing."
       <br/>

      </p>
      <p>
       Why Mark? Why the twins and betrayal of his business partners? Why make up the Facemash and "they gave me their info, stupid f****rs"? Because a conspirator who embarrasses himself makes you react to them emotionally and makes you less likely to question that they would have created a fake story IN WHICH they publicly embarrassed themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also seen the evidence that Einstein was a total fraud and put out there as some type of inspiration. Makes you wonder about certain people.

Step 1: just get a privileged white kid going to university

       Step 2: Mark his assignments really bad with the threat of failing him

       But seriously, I talk about 'why Mark' near the end of the OP.
       <br/>
       I would speculate that Mark's parent must be very high up in some shadowy, powerful organization running these things.
       <br/>
       I mean you can't just choose a College kid at random. He would ideally be a family member of someone you trusted.

       yeah wait til you see the lives some of us have had to live. Pretty insane once you see how they control people what you can realize/find out about your surroundings and why they are the way they are. For example I have double power lines in front of my house. Power lines are one thing they can use to affect human beings. They had 2 power lines double the strength on my house hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people are watched every day of their lives literally and tormented every day too. You do not want to see the punishment I'm fully in favor of laying down on these people. Eternal life comes first and once we make sure people can live forever we can lay out real life sentences. Life sentences as in we're all living 5000 + years and since I have millions of people on hundreds of counts of murder I could see 5000 year sentences for many people. Doctors, politicians, secret society rulers. It's why they're purposely dying because they know I'm coming. As Tupac raps "Motherfuckers know I'm coming so they're running to their graves watch"
      </p>
      <p>
       All of them are ready to die they'd blow their brains out before they'd let me get to them. That's why this week anyone in any position of power should be on suicide watch. Don't let them kill themselves, many will try.

       Have you seen that meme where they show that Mark Zuckerberg is actually called Jacob greenberg and his two other brothers are also in charge of tech cos? Think it might have been PayPal or something. I'll try find it. Thought it was ridiculous at the time but thus Facebook shit makes me think twice.

       I've seen a conspiracy that he's an illegitimate grandson to one of the Rothschild patriarchs.  That would explain why he would be chosen for such a position.  But that particular theory has never had much credible evidence to back it up that I've seen.

       There's a story of another Facebook founder that sounds just like Zucc's.
       <br/>
       He owned facebook dot com before Zucc. You can look on the internet wayback machine at the page. There's a story that this first facebook owner also put his classmates in a directory.
       <br/>
       They guy's social media platform sucked though. Although it was installed in Fortune 500 businesses, and was also started in Boston.

       It makes you wonder how the internet is being corralled and pruned. FB, TWTR, and YT start blocking and censoring certain ideas. Then you get /pol/ and Gab. Which makes me wonder if they are not spying and psyop hubs for certain types of people.
       <br/>
       When you get the undesirables in these fringes you can look at who's in them, determine what they do and do not see, create memes for them to keep them in your control.
       <br/>
       I'm mostly thinking out loud about this but the Soyboy recently created on /pol/ seems like something animal ag or tobacco PR used to do.

       The people behind "It's okay to be white" have been doing a lot of soft memes lately.  The Kekistani movement, etc...  /pol/ realized their power when they memed donaldu trumpu into office and now there's a contingency that's bent on continuing to affect the normiespheres, which means memes that don't include shit, piss, anti-semitism, the word "faggot," etc.

       How is he in line with the establishment? Every news article, politician, actor, anchor, broadcast, about him is negative.

       They couldn't possible be anymore against him. It's literally impossible short of open assassination attempt without repercussion. And I'd be willing to bet if he hangs on much longer they'll heart attack him.

       I have a high paying corporate job...  I have a long career in corporations, I've attained positions of power within corporations.  However, I'm ideologically opposed to corporations.  I think that the government should not have the power to create corporations.

       There are lots of people involved in corporate reform who weren’t part of the corporations themselves.  Goldman Sachs doesn’t need to be reformed by former employees and they’re more likely to be compromised than reform crusaders.

       My point is that the "too big to fail" meme is real.  What would happen to the global economy if corporate law was stricken out?  What would happen if  fractional reserve fiat were overturned?
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, this is what needs to happen.  A return to sound money, return of the magna carta rules on usory...  The hope is that Trump is working on a way to transition towards these goals without causing a world-wide economic collapse...  Such a thing may take a generation or more.  I mean, heck, the World Bank and later the IMF transitioned us into our current system over a period of 200+ years and involved countless wars and economic collapses, so, a Greenback-esque plan might be extremely long-term.

       What gives you any indication Trump wants that?  His fortune is built on fiat money.  Paul I believed.  He said as much.  I’ve heard nothing from Trump aside from cutting taxes, mostly for the elites.  I don’t see him doing anything but empowering our oligarchs further.

       You're asking me for a really lengthy discussion that I don't really have time for...  There's clues, there's implications within the nationalist/globalist platform (third position).  There's a hope, however waning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether or not I can convince you to be hopeful of Trump actually being a 3rd position guy who wants to take down the 5th pillar, he was our only hope in the presidency.  Our other option was a Clinton...

       As he follows the deep state false flag script and bombs Syria.  I wishI could have your optimism.  I see another puppet of the oligarchs.  Even if he really thought he wasn’t.

If you go back and watch the coverage surrounding Trump's first meeting with Obama...  I remember thinking, damn, president-elect Trump looks like he just saw a ghost.  That's when I think they showed him his file...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the hidden hand wanted Hillary, because she's a complicit actor...  But I never believed "they couldn't stop Trump."
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they let him happen because they knew they could control him with blackmail.

       Hmm, I had heard that the movie actually made him look a lot better than in real life. In real life he was much more of an asshole. The one detail that I've heard the movie screws up is that they make him seem like he's trying to pick up chicks the whole time, but in reality, he's been with the same girl since college.

       In the 'real life' Zuckerberg story he also started a site that ranked people by looks and he wrote "They gave me all their personal data. Stupid fuckers."

       He came across as a bit of a dick in the movie. And It was Sean parker that was sleeping about all the time. I love the film, great story ( writing ) but I take everything with a pinch of salt. That's all it was to me, a story based on some truth. He's definitely a shady fucker.

       I remember thinking it was kind of strange to be getting a deep cutting biopic about somebody the public didn't really know.
       <br/>
       Like I said in the OP. Looking back on it, I believed the story in the movie because the story was so embarrassing for Mark. It's not a normal reaction to accuse someone publicly embarrassing themselves of putting on a hoax.

       It's always been weird that movie.  It was just a dumb website that got popular and there was some very ordinary soap opera stuff behind the scenes, like you have in lots of situations with money at stake. Seems like undue attention put onto that story, which would be to insulate the real story from any scrutiny.

       I think there's expected to be overlap with military tech and silicon valley tech. I don't know why those sites sucked and Facebook took off. Good question how they were developed and what would happen if a non CIA sanctioned social media site took off.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's so outrageous is this makes it look like Zuckerberg is a total plant and his public showings are part of some psyop to coax us into trusting facebook.

       They didn't suck, for a long time. Friendster was the social media platform of choice for years. It started getting bloated and old people joined and everyone moved to MySpace. Then the same happened with Facebook. It will happen again.

       Honestly, Myspace was just so much better. It had much more functionality at the time. Then facebook came out with a horrible, boring UI and it became 10x more popular overnight? Now how did that possibly happen.

       I'm only disagreeing slightly, it had more control but at the expense of being inundated with the sound, fury, and bad taste of MANY.
      </p>
      <p>
       By letting users use canned and self made html, passed around scripts, and them having too much control of changing the UI led to sparkling flashing gifs, color scheme and fonts clashing to the point of unreadability while tinny background music blared.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the boring UI appealed to users, contributing the the switchover to Facebook. (That, and at the time, many learning institutions had Students use it, ,building up a generational wave of users)

       the allegation isn't that everyone who works at facebook is CIA, it's that facebook is allegedly CIA-founded and backed.  There is no evidence here provided of that, just strange circumstances of a company called aboutface and its similarities to facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dig into aboutface and Grossman and see what you find would be the best course to uncover if there is anything here.

       Well, I still remember in the early days of facebook there were countless similar social media sites. It was a battle for users, I remember getting 10+ emails everyday from all sorts of social media start ups. Anyone of them could have gained traction and became the Facebook of today. Many of them probably had similar founder stories too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my point is, Aboutface wasn't the only social networking company back then.

       Weird. because the post has been up all day.
       <br/>
       What's really weird is that not journalist that I know of has ever found this or considered it to be a story.

       I liked the last part where you totally, reverse psychology-wise, undermine your whole argument by completely gratuitously trying to take down Einstein as well, makes me think there's some poisoning the well going on by someone who actually really doesn't want the truth of Zuckerberg's servile ties to the CIA to be known or seriously regarded.

       As far as facebook, google, wikipedia..... my theory is that they start out innocent, then they are taken over by the some "TPTB" group after they're off the ground. I used to wonder if they would create these companies for control and information gathering and narrative control, but why would they do that when they can just secretly take over anything in the name of "national security" and then make use of it without even having to do any of the work? Then they will destroy any competitor, blocking or killing any facebook etc alternative.

       That's what I think too.  I think that the government and the media got together and agreed that Facebook and Twitter would be the "official" social media sites so that they could be monitored and controlled more easily.  But it's also clear that all successful Silicon Valley companies were either started with government money or had a big investment from the government early on that helped them grow and become successful.

       Einstein is definitely a fraud but I will need some references for Newton and Copernicus. I understand that Newton didn't invent Calculus or develop his work in a vacuum but I will need context. Are you implying he wasn't the author of his works or what exactly?

       Einstein was a plagiarist.
       <br/>
       But even the word plagiarist is giving him too much credit.
       <br/>
       It seems the work was stolen and compiled for him and became a kind of mascot of Jewish supremacy.
The work he stole isn't that hard to compare. Not much of the work requires heavy brain power even though we've all been told Einstein was so smart he's incomprehensible.

       "Facebook" was a term coined in the '80s. AboutFace apparently developed a technology using the name years before Zuckerberg did the same. Membership on Facebook was originally only open to college students.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory that Zuckerberg is a CIA plant or asset is compelling, but I don't think the existence of AboutFace or the obvious uses of the term
       <em>
        facebook
       </em>
       in similar technologies lend any credence to it.

       They had a service utilizing a trademarked technology called

       What's funny is this story of how this person's 90s and early 00s Facebook, (Also in Boston), has almost the same founding story as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook. He puts all his fellow students into a directory. Remember Facemash?

      <p>
       There is no "about" link on the captured website from 1999. I also can't find a link to
       <a href="http://www.facebook.com">
        www.facebook.com
       </a>
       . Can you refer me to the specific page on which you found it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, if they had a technology literally called
       <em>
        Electronic Facebook
       </em>
       , it's no surprise that they might have also for a while owned the obvious domain, and many domains have changed hands over the years as they are either abandoned or resold.

       It's not inconceivable that Zuckerberg essentially appropriated the name and idea. The fact that he was a Harvard student makes that
       <em>
        more likely
       </em>
       rather than coincidental.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this is a case of evolutionary branching with a mixture of homage and maybe some outright theft. I don't think the preexistence of AboutFace strengthens the Facebook/CIA connection unless a CIA connection to AboutFace can also be found.

       You're right it's the company history link I erroneously called the 'about' link. But I've posted this link and told you it was captured in 1999 and shows he had
       <a href="http://www.facebook.com">
        www.facebook.com
       </a>
       then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at my links. Most of the replies have been me telling you to look at the fucking links and I have to keep posting them over and over.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many more similarities. The links say AboutFace "created" the branch of software called 'social networking'.
       <br/>
       How do you explain the parallel version of Facemash this twin creator of Facebook made?
       <br/>
       You think Tom from Myspace, Twitter, or Friendster founders broke rules and ripped their college classmate's info and put it on a website?
       <br/>
       Just a run of the mill thing social media rite of passage. Put all your classmates on a website while in college.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't think this strengthens the Facebook/CIA connection? You work for the government or Facebook PR?
       <br/>
       We all know Facebook is connected to the CIA.
       <br/>
       AboutFace isn't interesting because it's a company full of CIA agents. The fact that it exists doesn't prove Mark is a plant and an actor but for intents and purposes it does with Occam's razor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact AboutFace was never covered by the MSM or was even known on the internet also wreaks of an intelligence operation.

       I also have this vague recollection for the term being used for the books/catalogs put out by modeling agencies. Maybe something I read in Michael Gross's book "MODEL: the Ugly Business of Beautiful Women"? I don't have the book anymore, so I can't check.
