       I'm not seeing any actual explanation. Just a bunch of comments about how we're all being manipulated and brainwashed. I figured since this is one of the main places the Donald people
       <del>
        invaded and corrupted
       </del>
       post,
       <del>
        spam

       , and comment,
       <del>
        and use their bots to manipulate posts
       </del>
       , maybe I could get an answer here.
      </p>
      <p>
       My main question is about the hypocrisy of it all. These folks are crying censorship at every turn, and always talking about how the media is controlled by the liberal elite. Well wouldn't the liberal elite censor them first? Wouldn't they be the first to be charged extra to access their alternative facts?

       Because t_d is heavily astroturfed imo. If you check the comments on the anti NN posts a lot are pro NN and highly upvoted.

       The mods are trying to push a anti NN narrative by stickying anti NN posts and removing the sticky when the comments turn against them.

       I got banned for concern trolling for simply asking the other sides stance on the issue. I am no way pro-liberal, I was just looking for another point of view so I could make an informed decision on it, but I guess that was even too much for the T_D mods.

       I can give at least some perspective! I don't use TD but I'm critical of NN.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regulation put us in this mess, and I think it's insane to use more regulation to address it. Government involvement in ISPs is precisely why we have these monopolies.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we addressed the influence these companies have and stop giving them tax payer money then some.day we can have a truly free internet market. People are saying "well you'd have to pay more for HD TITTIES!" but neglect to use examples like T-Mobile providing their "binge on" service.
      </p>
      <p>
       They allow you to stream music and video on cellular data without hurting your data cap. If you have only 2GB for the month, you can watch 50GB of video without even touching your usual 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were an ISP this would not be allowed under NN. This is a service that is good for consumers and encourages competition between T-Mobile and other phone plan providers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without NN, old people would be allowed to buy a cheaper package that gives them access to their email and Facebook rather than paying 100 per month for the same service that a hardcore gamer uses.
      </p>
      <p>
       No NN
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be a good thing if we address other issues. I personally think we should let ISPs run wild and put themselves to bed one day.

       Yes, that’s precisely it.  No more will 15mbps of bandwidth mean that you can download data from any site at a rate of 15mbps.  Instead, you will be charged based on which sites and services you’re accessing.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is in complete misalignment with the internet’s infrastructure, and how networking in general works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if your car performed based on the destination of your travel. If you paid for the Disney package, you could drive down the public streets at 100% of the speed limit, but not to Sea World. For destinations not in the Disney pack, your car is limited artificially to 10% of the posted speed limit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s what they want to do to you - sell you 100mbit service to your house, and reduce the performance to e.g. 10mbit for anything not on their list of approved destinations.   In the back-end, no internet infrastructure is plumbed this way. This is an artificial mechanism entirely about billing you more.

       Verizon owns yahoo and aol. What if they wanted you to use yahoo as your news aggregator. They might throttle reddit, or huffpost, or drudge to get you to turn to yahoo.

       No, it’s stuff that has already happened on a small scale... these already massively companies stand to gain from this change and regulation. This is why they want to get this passed... so they can favor their own properties.

       Also, if a car is going to go off the cliff, then worrying about a fiery death is not scaremongering it’s prudence. These companies act in their own jntrests, not consumer interests and given how important internet is to modern life, it’s best to be cautious...

       I agree our government is what got us into this mess.  Other nations don't have this issue.  We are where we are though.  If our government made it so only one factory dealing with mercury was allowed in the nation we can't just say "well we can't add more regulations onto them that won't fix anything" when they start dumping their waste products in a local river.  We still have to regulate when it makes sense.

       That's fine, but there's no mercury, no waste, and no river.

       It'd be easy to shut NN off, because the next time we get a democrat president or congress, it will be right back again within a few days.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, REMOVING a regulation from our government is something that must be jumped on every time it comes up, because government entities that want to reduce their own power are unicorns.
      </p>
      <p>
       tldr; it won't hurt anything to try removing NN.  And it might help.  And if it does go haywire (it won't), no government employee will mind saying "let's seize some more power, bring it back."

       T-Mobile's binge on service is exactly what T-Mobile wants you to think of as a positive example of net neutrality. Never mind negatives, like this:
      </p>
      <pre><code>There's nothing hypothetical about what ISPs will do when net neutrality is eliminated. I'm going to steal a comment previously posted by /u/Skrattybones and repost here:

2005 - Madison River Communications was blocking VOIP services. The FCC put a stop to it.

2005 - Comcast was denying access to p2p services without notifying customers.

2007-2009 - AT&amp;amp;T was having Skype and other VOIPs blocked because they didn't like there was competition for their cellphones.
2011 - MetroPCS tried to block all streaming except youtube. (edit: they actually sued the FCC over this)

2011-2013, AT&amp;amp;T, Sprint, and Verizon were blocking access to Google Wallet because it competed with their bullshit. edit: this one happened literally months after the trio were busted collaborating with Google to block apps from the android marketplace

2012, Verizon was demanding google block tethering apps on android because it let owners avoid their $20 tethering fee. This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn't do that as part of a winning bid on an airwaves auction. (edit: they were fined $1.25million over this)

2012, AT&amp;amp;T - tried to block access to FaceTime unless customers paid more money.

2013, Verizon literally stated that the only thing stopping them from favoring some content providers over other providers were the net neutrality rules in place.

The foundation of Reason's argument is that Net Neutrality is unnecessary because we've never had issues without it. I think this timeline shows just how crucial it really is to a free and open internet.

       So I'm confused, this seems to point out the FCC was stopping violations, which is what they want to go back to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering regulatory capture is almost a sure thing, wouldn't keeping regulations allow for Comcast/TW/etc to lobby to create/change the regulations in their favor, keeping out smaller competition?

        This is a service that is good for consumers and encourages competition between T-Mobile and other phone plan providers.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's only a short term benefit for consumers. Allowing certain services to not count against your monthly data limit allows major companies to choose winners and losers and control the ways you take in information. Competitor services that pop up against the ones that are already zero-rated now have institutional barriers set up that mean that potential customers are punished for using their services.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowing something like Netflix to be zero rated is great and all in the moment, but when it means that there are barriers to entry stopping any potential competitor from being able to compete on an even ground, then in the long run, it's really screwing us over.

        Without NN, old people would be allowed to buy a cheaper package that gives them access to their email and Facebook rather than paying 100 per month for the same service that a hardcore gamer uses. (Provided that this service is offered by the ISP).

      <p>
       ISP's are already allowed to provide differing plans based off of speed and amount of data used. There's just absolutely no reason to allow discrimination based off of the destination or origin of your packets. Gaming bits are no different than e-mail bits.

       I understand how people feel like the government shouldn't interfere with stuff, and im with them most of the time. But corporations do not care about the public. they only care about profit. they will do anything just to screw you out of an extra dollar.

       You're absolutely right. They care about profit and want money. I don't think they're in it for anyone but themselves and it would be foolish to believe otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I also think is that their desire to make a profit is directly dependent on people willing to give them money. If you have no regulations and a company (Provided we break up the monopolies) acts shitty, people just shop somewhere else.

       People hated expensive phone companies who got rid of unlimited data and then we got players like Cricket and T-Mobile who really shook things up.
      </p>
      <p>
       People hate Verizon and Comcast. Right now it's really hard for others to get involved. Do we pass laws that make it so only Verizon and Comcast can provide not-completely-shitty service, or is it better to ease the process of entry into the market and let the companies battle it out for consumers? What's worked best in the past?

       Consolidation of power doesn't care what the system is called or how it works on paper. Get enough money and you can leverage it for more. Regulatory capture and crushing upstart competition is the name of the game. Capitalism doesn't distribute goods or labor as efficiently or morally as is claimed. That's partly because of  all the guns and bombs we taxpayers have to buy so Exxon and the CIA  can install a dictator when desired.

       We probably have plenty of common ground. I want what's best for ordinary people. I don't trust big companies to do the right thing when their primary mandate is profit and market share. It's not clear when a company has grown too powerful and is abusing its position. This is a complex subject, I don't wanna go back and forth forever actually, lol. Anyways happy turkey day.

       I want shitty companies to act as shitty as they want to. If they act shitty enough and start losing money and one of them (or a new player) decides to go the same route as T-Mobile then they either adapt or die.

       It's why we have a large selection of phone plans at a variety of prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop relying on the government to force shitty companies to be nice and let them destroy themselves.

       I wanted a response from the average userbase, not a scripted response from the groupthink zealots that back 100% of everything Trump does. But yes, I do understand T_D isn't for debating, I just wanted the down and dirty from the average users point of view, before I dug deeper.

       Trump could burn down orphanages and some would find a way to defend and rationalize that decision.

       I'm slowly realizing that on Reddit, or anywhere for that matter, that you need to be on one extreme or the other to be accepted, any dissent gets you immediately banned. I fall somewhere a little on the right side of the middle, but I get shit on in r/politics and now banned from T_D.

       Basically, "Net Neutrality" was not a real net neutrality and we get screwed worse with this type.  There were several different aspects of this that ended up having the reverse effect and favoring companies like Google (which is why you see them and other companies supporting it)   Originally I was like "duh we need to support NN" but after looking at it, it's clear it needs to be done in a different form.

       He can't because it's a talking point that he doesn't understand. We've never know anything other than an open Internet. Little attacks that Comcast and Verizon have tried in the past have been met with lawsuits. And by 2014, we were protected by law. If the FCC has it's way, we will lose all of our protections, can't even sue.

       Yes it definitely did. I wanted T_D to be the community that exposed the liberal hypocrisy, which it occasionally did. I could mind the shitposting, some of it was funny, but if you even have a question on something that you were on the fence about, you get banned, like I was. A lot of Reddit shits on them, but then again I don't agree with most of the liberal hive mind here, so I can understand their userbase's gripe with the site as a whole, but they're no different than the other sides extreme.

       yeah and its really sad. last night in one of the threads that the mods sickie there was a good post talking about it from a pure right wing perspective on why to be pro NN, and how NN isn't a government take over and how the government actually did something good for a change, and it got deleted when i was writing a response back to it to add more because I agreed with the user.

       and he wasn't even a "concerned troll." he was a real trump supporter with a long history of pro-trump posts.

       i hate it when left-leaning people right off actual valid, good points of view from right-leaning people simply because it came from a "right-wringer." and i

       u/ImJustAPatsy, how does it feel knowing that you're shilling for a president that doesn't give a shit about you and only cares about his elitist friends? A president who ran on a platform of 'making American Great Again' but actively bends over for the Israelis and Saudis.

       That what they did since day one, but now it is a topic you are against. They cannibalized their own for months. Every once in a while there is a topic not everybody agrees on and some people get purged or they reform after getting a narrative update.

       are you really that willing to be brainwashed? the most visible outcome of this is how they're treating NN because it should be such a populist issue that trump and republicans clearly don't give a fuck about .. the easiest way to see that veil of populism dropping.

       I agree but competition is neither present (most of the time) nor an easy to do thing. There's a reason a giant like Google failed to establish itself as ISP. The deck is stacked in favor for ISPs. So NN is the next best thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Establish competition first, then repeal NN. Not repeal NN and hope for the best.

       So how come they and yourself are too foolish to see Trump is just a hand puppet of the deep state?? 
How do you seperate the spokesman from his employers?  how do rationalize Trump being on your side? You guys remind of the Obama worship cult of 2008! wonder what happened to them? Did 8 years of Obama raping their rights and the country knock sense into them?

       <p>
        On January 14, 2014, the DC Circuit Court determined in the case of Verizon Communications Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission[56][57] that the FCC had no authority to enforce network neutrality rules as long as service providers were not identified as "common carriers".[58]
       </p>

      <p>
       The FCC then responded by classifying ISP's as common carriers which is exactly what Pai wants to undo now.
      </p>

       If Pai succeeds in repealing the rules implemented in 2015 the internet will

       And who are the biggest attackers of Net Neutrality? Comcast, Charter, Verizon. These are companies that have a near monopoly of ISP services. Without Net Neutrality it will be a lot harder for a start up site to dethrone a site like Facebook or Reddit because the big sites can pay the few ISPs that are left to block out or slow down their competitors.

       The current situation will become worst if Net Neutrality is removed, this is not an option, these are the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Net Neutrality is removed then Google/YouTube will feel less pressure to change their policies because the size of Google will guarantee that their sites be placed in preferred ISP packages.

       Net Neutrality has no effect on that. So back to the original question, if you are starting up a networking or video site today, is there any regulation that prevents you from starting up your business?

       yes it does, the reason the Googles, Facebook, Youtube are the biggest promoters of this "net neutrality" is because they dont wanna be charged for overloading the net with their content, they should pay. They should pay because they are too big and too powerful, they are de facto shutting down free speech on the internet. I say lets break them down like the telephone companies in the 80s. Out with them.

       Im not avoiding anything Im very sharp as hell as why Im against net neutrality , who benefits from this situation and what should happen. I explained my opinion with arguments, explained why the big Googles and so are so scared to lose the net neutrality and why it will not be the end of the world. Your hypothetical question about a new business is not relevant for my explanation, Im worried about the current players

       You were concerned that Net Neutrality would stall competition. I'm trying to demonstrate that that is not true.

       Google is not afraid of Net Neutrality anymore since they are rolling out their own ISP via Google Fiber and Google Loom. Google actually stands to gain from the removal of Net Neutrality this time which is why they are not fighting back as hard as they did in

       So if Mr. Alierta has a subpar network so then he should invest in improving his infrastructure. He even said that he tried to have his network subsidized by the EU but that did not work out. I don't see how he is subsidizing the US sites.

       He admitted that his network struggles to handle all the requests received and is looking to expand it, he just doesn't want to use his own money to do so. He tries to get the EU and major sites to pay for it instead.

       If the electric company is struggling to keep people with usage demand then there will be blackouts until the infrastructure is improved. But the electric company does not charge the Best Buy for selling more electric devices in its area.

       you hadnt the slightest idea about the struggle of the non american operators, you didnt even know Telefonica, and you opted for a despective sentence.

       I don't know Telefónica but I am aware of Movistar, which are the same company. So I am aware of how shitty their network is. That still doesn't excuse that the fact that Telefónica doesn't want to pay for is upgrades.

       /pol/ is against NN because liberals like it.

       NN supporters skew younger, and therefore more liberal (on average), and a good chunk of the alt right is about liberal tears above all else, even though Reddit's a lot more likely to survive an un-neutral net than 4chan is.

       The only problem with that is T_D calls themselves "defenders of free speech" and peddles themselves as a place to learn "the truth" when they are even more controlled than

       See, but T_D both implicitly and explicitly states that it's a sub for support of the Donald. If you go to a pro-Donald sub, you know full well what you're getting.

      <p>
       Compare this to Politics which definitely has a left / anti-Donald bias (not necessarily bad in itself) yet it presents itself as simply a sub for politics in general while not really representing both sides of opinon.

       Nah politics is just accurate with what is going on. Don’t be ridiculous. The fact that an election was stolen by means of treason and the conspiracy sub isn’t even talking about it is what is baffling to me. The biggest actual conspiracy, with money laundering and backroom talks is going down and it’s not even mentioned here.

       Trump is exactly what you would see in tinpot oligarchies, including the nepotism of hiring family to run the country. He's a true piece of shit, and has a true piece of shit army to defend him. Everyone sees it. The only battle they are still winning is the one on conspiracy sites, which have all gone straight down the shitter and lost millions of page views.

       Yeah I agree completely. And politics isn’t just full of Hillary voters, there are plenty of people who lament voting for trump after seeing the policy he is enacting. I find it particularly hilarious that Alex Jones and infowars have also been shoveling Russian propaganda. Over 1000 fucking stories from RT? Are you fucking kidding me?

       It's so obvious that russians (and alt-righters) took pretty much every conspiracy site, and parts of 4chan and reddit. The change started back in 2008 with the birther bullshit. Whether Trump knew about this conspiring or not, he's the target of their cultish praise, and will ultimately meet his fate as president because of that.

       As for
       <a href="/r/politics">

       , it's just another talking point which isn't far off from "both sides are the same" ... Yeah, I used to believe that too, but now that we have one side who blatantly wants to divide the nation and sell it out from under us, while the other side continues to fight against that... Well, not sure that shit stands up anymore.

       Yes I agree, but I really started to notice a difference in conspiracy talk around 2013-now. It’s escalated but before even infowars seemed anti globalist where as now it is basically alt right.
Both parties are not the same... it’s definitely worse now but you can listen to  an account by a general from the bush era where he was told we just need this war with Iraq. The GOP since Reagan has only been concerned with making the rich richer. I would only say Bush senior was any different. He knew the trickle down economic policy was absolute bullshit.

       Even if this were true, if you actually compare the two, one is by ever measure way goddamn shittier than the other. I don't much care that /t/T_D is 'logically' consistent with itself when it's a cesspool of completely idiocy and insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       By this logic Scientology never claiming to be a place for free and open thought is better than something that does and fails in any respect. In practice this is just not true. It's a fast-track to cult behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also ridiculous to call "The Donald" simply a fanpage. It's not. People are sincerely affecting their opinions about the larger world of politics and culture based on it. To steal the example (in the other direction) of a lower comment- If the users of Sandra Bullock's "fanpage" were making serious decisions and attempting to cause political and cultural changed based on fascistic cult-thinking, it would be no less creepy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also frankly not really true about
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , for the most part. It allows open discussion- Hell even Breitbart is whitelisted. It leans left by virtue of its userbase. It claims to be "politics"- not completely and utterly neutral.

       /politics and /T_D are both bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's why:
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was a news channel called
"PropagandaTV", it doesn't matter if the name is honest,
the content can still be dishonest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, "The_Donald" doesn't really clarify truthfully
what it is.
There's a big difference between 
a sub that believes Trump is playing 4D chess
but questions everything VS a cult sub which bans
THE SLIGHTEST of dissent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when people go to T_D
they don't really remember they're entering an echo chamber
with bots, shills, brainwashed people, zionist warmonger mods, etc.
(divide and conquer propaganda is also common there, like the manipulative thread tag "violent left"
as I've seen).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not something that enters the consciousness.
And that's only the smarter ones.
The dumber ones think it's 100% legit
and think in stupid liberal vs conservative lenses (corporate false paradigm).
When both parties are corrupt, there's no left, center or moderate right.
It's just corporate extremism.
      </p>
      <p>
       /T_D and /politics are both dangerous. 
Dissent gets you downvoted or banned.
I get that a 24/7 rally for Trump fans sounds good
and I sympathize, but it can really brainwash people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my view. I don't actually have a solution,
I'm just saying T_D can't be defended as it's anti-free speech
and infested with shills and bots.
I don't see one as better than the other.
Both of those shill subs are toxic.

       It's the banning against dissent, zionist/warmonger shill mods
and divide and conquer tags like "violent left" I've seen on at least one thread,
that disturbs me.

       Well I was trying to put it as neutral as I possibly could. However I do think the levels of fandom of an elected politician should not be this high and I don't think it's very healthy for the people that go there. You make a correct point about politics, but people are not banned there for dissent, they are downvoted into oblivion. There's a big difference between those two. Reddit's demographic just happens to be overwelmingly liberal and therefore anti-Trump.

       This is true. Jowever the levels of absolute hate for a politician should also not be high

       Its unhealthy because it blinds people

       The fact that this will be downvoted and the replies will be "what good that he does? Hes aweful!"  Are all the evidence

       You’re implying that having the “incorrect” political opinion will get you banned from r/politics, and that’s just false. Being an asshole will, and that applies to both sides of the political spectrum. The worst fate you’ll suffer is mass downvotes.

       too many downvotes and a low enough karma level drastically interferes with how active one can be though.  having to wait 10 mins between replies while being questioned/attacked by dozens of users that dont agree with your political views is not much different than being banned.  you're still essentially being silenced

       They have a no disagreeing with fox news/ Republican party official positions. And god forbid someone fiscally conservative raise a concern about Republican partnership with evangelicals. Or raise libertarian concerns about how civil liberties are being eroded in an era of " national security" trumps all mentality. Or if someone might question the fiscal responsibity of 700 Billion in defense spending.

       But do you understand why someone would be annoyed with what Trump did.  Its not about getting those kids about, that was great of him.  What annoys people is he ran to twitter to congratulate himself, and then when the Levar did not gravel or his feet, he screams about keeping the basketball players in prison.  Just get the kids out of jail and shut the fuck up.

       If I have choices in my ISP's, I'm sure they could come up with vastly better solutions to coming up with competitive pricing than I ever could. If there were competition, companies would be actively trying to lower prices rather than figure out the easiest way to screw you.

       So you're saying we should have regulated the mergers and buyouts of ISPs to have prevented this. AT&amp;T is only as big as they are because a small ass company can't resist a huge buyout. Once you have money, you make money. Anything AT&amp;T spent on buyouts is just an easy investment for them.

       It can if it is capitalized by someone with lots of money, or several people/corporations with lots of money. If there is money to be made, people will do it. The problem is that the monopolies and oligopolies are contractually protected by local governments. That's what needs to change.

       Yes, the ISP's and companies that own the cables all have to have deals with each other. Ocean cables are not protected by government monopolies as far as I know, so anyone that wants in on that action is more than free to take that risk. If there's only one company that's taking the risk, then they can and should charge you whatever they want. They aren't laying and maintaining cable out of the goodness of their hearts. And no, internet is not a human right.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem comes in in situations where other companies aren't even allowed to engage, like in local markets.

       Which they aren't. That's the part you refuse to understand. There's no magical free market fairy that's going to make it profitable for some new company to spend trillions solving a puzzle that's already solved.

       We had the internet for two decades without net neutrality and it got cheaper, and faster for most users.

       Net neutrality is about protecting Netflix google and amazon from being charged more for the fact they use almost all of the internet bandwidth.

       That argument only works if internet bandwidth is some kind of scare commodity which it most certainly is not.  Bandwidth is so cheap to deliver that it's not uncommon for over 90% profit margin on consumer plans

       Google, Netflix and Amazon all pay their own hosting costs and consumers pay their ISPs to access these services.  Who else needs to be paid?

       The monopolies are a RESULT of the 'free market.' At the beginning of the world wide web there were tons of ISPs. Over time they either went out of business or were bought out by bigger companies and now the barrier to enter the industry is so high its impossible for smaller companies to compete. That is the nature 'free market' and capitalism.

       The monopolies exist because the government regulated them into existence. Not sure how that's free market, state/city governments legislate the small guys out or won't even let them start. That's antithical to free market.

       What the hell does this even mean. 'The government regulated them into existence.' Doesn't make sense, the monopolies were created through the system of winners and losers known as the 'free market.' Implying the government creates monopolies through regulations is retarded, regulations exist and they're a cost of doing business. If companies can't afford the regulations and infrastructure to enter the industry then they won't exist.

       I see that you have absolutely no idea how ISPs maintain their control over local markets. If you wanna research that a bit, we can continue this. Hint: regulations favor the big guys and disallow local ISPs to form.

       Local ISPs CAN'T form because they can't enter the fucking market. You're talking like the government is actively banning smaller ISPs from starting up, NO. That is demonstrably WRONG and you're intentionally misusing the term 'regulation'. Regulations exist, deal with it. It's a cost of doing business. So is building telecom towers and laying down cables, which is considerably more expensive than the regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're just a conspiracy tard trying to build up the government as some sort of communist machine. The word regulation triggers you so you just want to blame the big bad government for everything as if both the government and the ISPs are working together. I'm sure Soros is in there's somewhere.

       (btw the change Obama said he'd make there didn't accomplish anything). But keep telling me there's no such thing as state governments directly causing ISP monopolies.

       Anyways, this is all besides the point that you blame the free market while saying "regulations are a thing, deal with it." Regulations are not free market, that's a definition only you seem to use. But keep being hostile and calling me a conspiritard or whatever, I'd love to see your sources that there are no regulations hindering or banning ISP competition.

       Because the people pushing Net Neutrality are the most censorious people on the internet, and on top of that, this campaign is receiving funding from Soros. I support the principle of Net Neutrality, but how can anyone trust Reddit or Google or any of these people who are absolutely proven and obsessed with censoring people? If Reddit wanted truly believed in this issue or wanted any credibility, they wouldn't have acted the way they have recently. It makes people think twice.

       The mods of that sub delete and hide any responses that aren't following whatever they see as "Trump's position". They remove posts in favor of NN and they also remove posts attacking and questioning Sessions for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean every subscriber feels that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, NN was never law. It was a non binding agreement essentially. This is the fault of Congress, not Trump or even Obama.

       Congress needs to do outs fucking job and pass laws rather than allowing executives to rule by decree.

       Anyone subscribing to the red vs blue narrative does not really understand the current state of our country at all. Its pointless trying to reason with them. You mine as well try and reason with SJW about offensive but free speech. Their both extremes who have already made up their minds. No amount of logic or facts can sway them.

       From what I have read, the issue is that Obama's solution was to put Title 2 in place, which is actually a more draconian method of "ensuring" neutrality that was designed to prevent monopolies from screwing everyone over because they could. FCC guy saying that Title 2 was not the solution but keeping it the way it was before Title 2 would be better for business and competition.

       I read this as: Little Johnny has some anger problems, so we are going to lock him up in the basement indefinitely to control him. We over-fixed the initial problem, and now we may have caused bigger problems down the road for Johnny as we broke him in worse ways while trying to fix him.

       I take a nuanced stance that Net Neutrality has both pros and cons. It is not a 100% bad nor is it 100% good.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pros of Net Neutrality: network throttling is banned as all traffic on the internet must be treated equally. By extension these rules prevents the creation of a tiered internet with fast lanes and slow lanes and allows small time competitors to compete with the big boys. The Wikileaks page will load as fast as CNN or Fox news.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Cons of Net Neutrality is that certain large corporations like Netflix and Amazon are taking advantage of the situation as their business models rely on other users subsidizing their bandwidth usage. Even if you don't subscribe to Netflix and Amazon you are forced to pay for it regardless through your ISP. You pay the same rate for "unlimited" internet as someone who is streaming Terabytes worth of HD movies every month. It was predicted that this would stifle "the great buildout" (investment in telecomm infrastructure) because why invest in a fish that gets eaten by other fish? Investment flowed to the top-level predator (Amazon) who got the benefit of the buildout but shared no expense in it's creation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing to consider is George Soros is supporting net neutrality and it is very rare that Soros is ever on the right side of history. Jeff Bezos is also pure evil as his corporation Amazon has killed millions of jobs and is responsible for the
       <strong>
        Dead Mall phenomenon
       </strong>
       spreading across America. Amazon has cheated billions in state and local taxes by not charging sales tax on their products. Your local taxes then have to increase to make up the difference in lost revenue to continue to pay for schools and other government services. Amazon is a parasite organization through and through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion: I have recently swung my opinion from the pro column to the anti column as recently as just the last few hours. This debate over net neutrality feels like gaslighting as the body public has been convinced to support a greater evil. The removal of net Neutrality will not silence the truth as potential blocked websites can still be reached via VPNs. The idea of massively censored internet is groundless fear mongering. The truth will still get out to be discussed here and on other websites.

       ISPs already throttle our internet. They gives us different packages for different speeds. You stream more, you pay more. Dismantling net neutrality just gives them even more control in terms of specific, pre-determined websites that you visit. People are acting like this is purely about dollars and cents. It's more than that. It's about control. Once it's gone it's never coming back.

       ISPs only throttle to the extent of what you pay for. If you pay for 10Mbs or 50Mbs then they that is what they have to deliver. They are not allowed to create slow lanes under current law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any potential blocked website can still be accessed with a VPN and they are never doing to block a major website like Reddit or Twitter so stop the fear mongering. This is about cutting down Amazon and Netflix from getting a free ride on the backs of other paying internet users.

       Net  neutrality was pushed by tech giants like google, netflix, facebook etc. Isp were regulated like public utilitites, so they could be forced to do their bidding without absorbing costs, allowing them to grow like crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is  no current clauses about any fast lanes in net neutrality laws. Zero. Its all bullshit. Tech firms now pushing for nn so they dont want to pay extra to isps for excess bandwidth they consume.

       Sounds like you haven't gotten a fucking clue what you're talking about. With net neutrality there is a healthy involvement of government with ISP still having control over their product. Without net neutrality the ISPs have absolute control. There is no other options, either government has full control, ISPs have full control, or we have net neutrality. Consumers will NEVER have control of this industry, the internet will never be a virtual utopia ever again.

       Why is it just assumed that everyone would be for Net Neutrality, a regulation that actually includes censorship clause? You probably didn't know that, though, because you probably never actually read the regulation.

       Pro-Business stance might have something to do with it. Maybe some people reap benefit from NN and would like it to be in place to limit their opposition from educating themselves and fight against it. I don't understand either, its as if they think the government is worse that corporations, yet they are both mixed together at this point. Better to make it a pain for the corporations rather than handing it to them. As if they care about the consumers, more about raking cash.

       There is a difference between regulating the process vs. regulating the content.  Most of the T_D mouth breathers have been told repeatedly that Net Neutrality=Fairness Doctrine that used to exist for TV which told broadcasters that they had give equal time to opposing political views. 
The network providers have an unfair advantage of being the gatekeeper between the content provider and the content consumer. Granting them more power would not benefit the consumer.

       This is my understanding of the Net Neutrality situation (and why T_D is against Net Neutrality)...NN primarily benefits large media companies.
       <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/20/14960154/netflix-net-neutrality-stances-timeline">
        Netflix for example.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These media companies are using the internet infrastructure for strictly commercial (profit-making) purposes as opposed to others who use the internet for mixed communication and sharing (universities, personal email, gaming, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically, while most of us are using the internet for work and fun, Big Media is kind of piggybacking, using the internet as a "free" distribution network. Think about it. Netflix doesn't PAY ANYTHING to get that content to you. You're paying Netflix for the content, and AT&amp;T for the hardware to get it to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Net Neutrality is doing is preventing ISP's from charging Big Media more for their commercial traffic. This results in
       <em>
        all of us
       </em>
       having to pay more to the ISP's. With Net Neutrality, Big Media is basically shifting their distribution costs onto everyone else.

       The problem with this argument is that it implicitly requires that it somehow costs more to deliver YouTube traffic than something else. It does not. Bandwidth is not being maxed out. That is a lie. Comcast wants to charge YouTube more because they have the capacity as a monopoly to essentially strongarm media companies into doing their bidding. They control the means of communication. Without net neutrality they'll be turned loose to do as they please.

       Yeah, I can also follow the argument that all data incurs the same cost regardless of intent. It's just that I can also see how if some data is being used for money-making purposes, a company might want to charge more to assist in delivery.

       Totally understandable, but in this situation today there's no need to give better or worse deals. You simply transmit the information. I think that's what everyone hopes the internet remains, a neutral pipe providing what you requested.

       Again, sure. That's a valid hope. But I'd rather keep paying what I am today and have unfettered access to the information I want. Without Net Neutrality the ISPs can pick and choose what news or information I can access.

       Check it out people... net neutrality was a cover for the "Fairness Doctrine" to be implemented... to silence people looking for truth and reporting it. Hidden under a name and a cover story to make in  it sound like it was something for the common man. Don't fall the false narratives. Research what the controversy about it was before it was rammed down our throats. Look who is pushing you to protest the repeal. Follow the money, the massive reports of bots trying to get you to fight for the ultimate suppression of your free speech. Why is a certain wealthy person throwing money at this. Do you really believe this person has your best interests at heart?

       This thread is filled with noise and information bubbles.

      <p>
       Most everyone has the same position on NN.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, T_D, is also censored. Twitter and Facebook are heavily anti-trump. Every day is a smear campaign on Twitter's front page. All I see T_D doing is point out how censored they are and their opinion (it's an opinion is not a fan-page) and going on to make the point of... Well, we don't like what happened to our community (T_D), but your opposed to NN which is just as much about censorship and media manipulation as it is MONEY.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only place I can get information on THE GOOD Donald Trump is doing with his Presidency is T_D,
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       has spin,
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       has spin, all the mods are heavily left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often time's posts from news get x-posted to T_D for how much the comments in a normal sub are beginning to align with the 'alt-right' perspective of T_D.
      </p>
      <p>
       The end of net neutrality will be the end of internet freedom as we know it. Share information on 9/11, Sandy Hook, Las Vegas shooting. All of these things will be easier to clamp down on when this goes full force.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want all of us to win. I want T_D posts to show up on reddit front page again though too, so other visitors to this website can get another perspective that what the mainstream media projects.

       Alright- I'll bite: Net Neutrality is horse shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Telecom industry has lobbied themselves into monopolies. How do you break up a monopoly? Allow competition. Why isn't the issue of local municipalities getting sued out of providing their own network getting more attention? Why are pole rights fought so hard for by the telecom giants, despite our tax dollars putting up those poles? They don't want competition, and getting the people to fight over this frivolous, do-nothing Net Neutrality takes all of the attention away from the real issue-- the lack of competition for ISPs. They win whether or not NN gets enforced, as long as people are talking about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of deregulating the industry and allowing others to provide their own services (yay, free market!), we pass this pair of plastic handcuffs onto this monster that's been getting fed regulatory steroids for decades. Oh, and the best part--- everyone's been fooled into believing this giant ruse is really the answer to our network woes. The idea of allowing real competition in the marketplace just got shelved for another 5-10 years.

       A bandaid doesn't do anything to prevent a broken bone from healing, but it doesn't help any either- and that's my point. NN is a diversion to prevent any real change from taking place by the telecom giants-- and it's worked perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has every technocrat on the internet convinced this is THE battle to save the internet, because apparently today's technocrats don't know god-damn fuck-all about legislation or principles of freedom, or common practices of industry manipulation (myself included there for a while)- when it's really just one toothless regulation that's been intentionally hyped by the masses. You want real change? Let the ISPs compete for you business, instead of being assigned to your area. Throttling would never appear in a free market.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my fucking problem. Net neutrality is seen as a take-all battle between the honest will of the people VS evil capitalism (gfd) when it's really Netflix vs Comcast. It's a diversion. It will solve nothing. Your internet freedoms and liberties will continue to be stripped with or without NN.

       Self ownership is such slavery /s. I didn't say it'd be easier-- I'm merely taking the stance that it'd be worth it. The nanny state has everyone convinced that the hardships of life would be insurmountable without them, when the reality is we have the opportunity to live in a post-scarcity environment without the government creating conflict to justify their own existence.

       Yeah, the US (and the world) needs to change. Look at the time period between the end of the civil war up to the beginning of WWI--- we had the tiniest government in world history accompanied by the single biggest boom in human standard of living in recorded human history.

       So excuse me if I've taken historical lessons and I'm no longer satisfied with the crumbs that fall off daddy's plate. "good" internet in America is a laughing fucking joke to the rest of the world, and NN will ensure that it only ever stays "good" without any chance of being better.

       The sub is full of complete idiots and if "liberals" like something it must be because all it amounts to is government overreach. They voted against their own interests last election and will continue to push for things that are against their own interest.

       This might get downvoted, but since you asked...  Think about it from a conservative perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       For years, 'progressive' technophiles have told us all that if we don't have net neutrality, internet freedom will be destroyed.  But freedom of conservative speech is already under daily a assault by the likes of Twitter, Youtube, Google, etc
       <em>
        with
       </em>
       net neutrality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course pro net neutrality fear tactics aren't going to work on conservatives when they're
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       being targeted and censored under the
       <em>
        current regime
       </em>
       that progressives are championing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why shouldn't they be skeptical?

       The supposed censorship of conservative speech is mostly cases where individual sites ban/block/delete/whatever your content. You can create your own site to combat that, and the ISP isn't allowed to favor the liberal site over the conservative site. This changes that. This is why net neutrality should ESPECIALLY matter to conservatives who cry about the liberal media elites.

       That's fine and all - I'm just telling you why the "MUH INTERNET FREEDOM" argument mostly coming from 'progressive' outlets isn't going to work on conservatives.  Really can't blame them for thinking "If this is what you mean by freedom then fuck that." given the war on conservative speech going on.

       Think back to using the Internet in the 90's &amp; early 2000's... "Net neutrality," as it exists today, was not a thing. The
       <strong>
        potential
       </strong>
       for throttling and restricted access was there, but it did not happen. Net neutrality came in recently as a government control to fix a
       <strong>
        potential
       </strong>
       problem, that doesn't yet exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, I like the Internet better 15-20 years ago when it was more "wild west-ish" ... I'd be interested in standing with the FCC for that reason. If the scenario presented itself where ISP's abused this as everyone is afraid of, then the rules can be put back in place. I don't understand why everyone is treating this like it's the end of the world, for good, and the worst case scenario is definitely happening.... seems a little pessimistic.

       That was also before ISPs and cable companies began merging with entertainment companies. Now Comcast not only provides the internet (Xfinity) but also creates it's own content (nbc). Now tell me, as a business if they're allowed to, why wouldn't they disrupt a competitors streaming service (Netflix) to persuade you to use their own?

       Don't worry, once the ISP's get all their "internet packages" together they will be purging /pol/ and other conservatives from the internet. Reddit will be made to ban the T_D subreddit in order to continue operating or ISP's will refuse to do business.
      </p>

       Every ISP has opposed Trump (they donated to Hillary), but they supported his pick for FCC. Trump supporters were just useful tools, now that they've got what they want they will dispose of them.

       The whole of Reddit is not gamed. But some topics are.

       It's the same reason why we see the same exact post about Nestle and water in Michigan on this sub get 1,000 upvotes.

       Topics are gamed. The average T_D is most likely against it, just like anyone here doesn't give a shit that there is a water pump in Michigan.

       yeah and its really sad. last night in one of the threads that the mods sickie there was a good post talking about it from a pure right wing perspective on why to be pro NN, and how NN isn't a government take over and how the government actually did something good for a change, and it got deleted when i was writing a response back to it to add more because I agreed with the user.

       I've been on the Trump Train for a while here, but this behavior by the t_d mods is awful.

       Just now?  This is literally all the evidence you need that t_D is a Russian psyop.  As if that wasn't already obvious.

       Unadulterated BULLSHIT. What stops a few players from cornering a market and gauging customers, in a free market? What stops them from suing and eating up any small competitor as they pop up?

       Free Market cultists are a fucking joke.

       You are the one under the delusion that a free market COULD EVER exist. Finding a politician that will push your anti-competitive regulation is merely a function of supply and demand.

       Your speaking of some pie in the sky ideal that could never exist in any form in the US as it is currently. Your pouting and saying that because we can't have "perfect" internet, we shouldn't have "good" internet. Sure the bandage might not fix the broken bone, but at least it prevents the wound from becoming infected.
