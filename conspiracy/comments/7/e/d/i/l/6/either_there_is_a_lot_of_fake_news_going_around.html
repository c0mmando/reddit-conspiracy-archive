       I'll be honest: I don't trust sources like Breitbart, DailyMial, TheSun, and others like them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus far all I've found are:
      </p>
      <p>
       "A String of Bomb Blasts in Sweden Is Prompting Questions and Alt-Right Conspiracy Theories"
       <a href="http://time.com/4990765/sweden-bombs/">
        http://time.com/4990765/sweden-bombs/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I swear I saw something on Reuters but now I can't find it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so fucking difficult to verify shit now. But I also know Sweden is good at trying to conceal the outward appearance of a socialist utopia when it appears things are going sideways real fast internally. They're probably trying to keep a lid on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to bring this up to see if you guys know of anything or have some verifiable sources on this.

       1 of every 2 children in the US is raped by a Conservative daily. I think it's really cringey that Americans are still pretending like nothing is wrong. Why so concerned with Sweden when there's a child rape pandemic sweeping the United States? Some polls say it's 1 in 1.5 kids that are raped each day. So it's likely getting worse.

       take a hard guess as to why I made this post, perhaps by re-reading it and my comments here thus far. Maybe figure a few things about me... perhaps one of which is I don't like bullshit. and saying that 1 of every 2 children in this country is
       <em>
        raped by a Conservative daily
       </em>
       sounds like some malicious hyper-Left bullshit coming from the mind of a fargone zealot who's lived inside of an echo chamber for far too long and thinks they are really goddamn clever because all of those Conservatives are too stupid to know otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       What, is there some tab kept on rapists as to their political leanings? I highly doubt it.

       either that or you're one of the people who slipped in here to fuck with us crazy conspiracy theorists and you're giggling the whole way, thinking we're all hard-Right rural Trump supporters in trailer parks with internet connections.

       People from Sweden say it’s not refugees. Read the comments in the link I posted, because you certainly aren’t posting a single news story talking about refugees throwing grenades at one another as well as the Swedish population at large.

       From Wikipedia: "A loaded question or complex question fallacy is a question that contains a controversial or unjustified assumption (e.g., a presumption of guilt).[1]"
      </p>
      <p>
       You asked:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Who's been more violent thus far Muslims or the right wingers?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There are so many problems and complications in your question that I don't know where to begin. You also didn't clarify what "violence" means, didn't clarify the scale (are we talking in the US or worldwide?), didn't define a time scale (what does "so far" mean?), didn't define what "right winger" means, and didn't address the considerable overlap of the Muslim population with conservative ideologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that's not a loaded question, then I don't know if I've ever heard one.

       Ok so what controversial or unjustified assumption am I making? My question literally doesn't fit the definition of a loaded question. I didn't make any assumptions at all.

       Again, if you don't know what I mean by right winger then I cannot help you, it is very obvious what meant by that. Do you not know what a conservative is?

      <p>
       That Muslims and right wingers are groups that cause violence. The assumption places guilt for the violence on the groups and not on the individuals. That's an assumption.

      <p>
       Is yelling at someone violence? Is gesticulating at someone violence? Is destroying someone's property violence? There is no strict definition of "violence" so maybe use a more clear term. Do you only care about murders? maybe assaults? If so, use that term instead of a more vague one like "violence".

      <p>
       So you think all conservatives are right-wingers? What about the fact that the majority of muslim regimes in the middle east are conservative? Are they also right-wingers to you? Since you mentioned that the scope is world-wide, then you should know that conservativism is different depending on where you are in the world and that a right-winger in a place like Sweden may look like a left-winger in a place like Iran
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Also what overlap? Conservatives and Muslims actually have a lot of fundamental disagreements about the treatment of women and gays
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Oh? Such as? Again, since you refuse to define what you mean by "right-winger" then I don't actually know what these disagreements may be.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Muslims have been the most violent group of people in the last 20 years and it's not even close.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Based on what statistics? Do you have a source for this claim?
