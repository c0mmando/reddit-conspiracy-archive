<p>&quot;A String of Bomb Blasts in Sweden Is Prompting Questions and Alt-Right Conspiracy Theories&quot;
<a href="http://time.com/4990765/sweden-bombs/">http://time.com/4990765/sweden-bombs/</a></p>

<p>I swear I saw something on Reuters but now I can&#39;t find it. </p>

<p>It&#39;s so fucking difficult to verify shit now. But I also know Sweden is good at trying to conceal the outward appearance of a socialist utopia when it appears things are going sideways real fast internally. They&#39;re probably trying to keep a lid on it.</p>

<p>I wanted to bring this up to see if you guys know of anything or have some verifiable sources on this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>take a hard guess as to why I made this post, perhaps by re-reading it and my comments here thus far. Maybe figure a few things about me... perhaps one of which is I don&#39;t like bullshit. and saying that 1 of every 2 children in this country is <em>raped by a Conservative daily</em> sounds like some malicious hyper-Left bullshit coming from the mind of a fargone zealot who&#39;s lived inside of an echo chamber for far too long and thinks they are really goddamn clever because all of those Conservatives are too stupid to know otherwise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From Wikipedia: &quot;A loaded question or complex question fallacy is a question that contains a controversial or unjustified assumption (e.g., a presumption of guilt).[1]&quot; </p>

<p>You asked:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who&#39;s been more violent thus far Muslims or the right wingers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are so many problems and complications in your question that I don&#39;t know where to begin. You also didn&#39;t clarify what &quot;violence&quot; means, didn&#39;t clarify the scale (are we talking in the US or worldwide?), didn&#39;t define a time scale (what does &quot;so far&quot; mean?), didn&#39;t define what &quot;right winger&quot; means, and didn&#39;t address the considerable overlap of the Muslim population with conservative ideologies.</p>

<p>If that&#39;s not a loaded question, then I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever heard one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so what controversial or unjustified assumption am I making? My question literally doesn&#39;t fit the definition of a loaded question. I didn&#39;t make any assumptions at all.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t clarify what violence means? If you don&#39;t know what violence is then that&#39;s your problem. </p>

<p>Worldwide.</p>

<p>Since 2001.</p>

<p>Again, if you don&#39;t know what I mean by right winger then I cannot help you, it is very obvious what meant by that. Do you not know what a conservative is?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That Muslims and right wingers are groups that cause violence. The assumption places guilt for the violence on the groups and not on the individuals. That&#39;s an assumption.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&#39;t clarify what violence means? If you don&#39;t know what violence is then that&#39;s your problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is yelling at someone violence? Is gesticulating at someone violence? Is destroying someone&#39;s property violence? There is no strict definition of &quot;violence&quot; so maybe use a more clear term. Do you only care about murders? maybe assaults? If so, use that term instead of a more vague one like &quot;violence&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, good. Glad we cleared that one up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since 2001.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That seems arbitrary, but okay</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, if you don&#39;t know what I mean by right winger then I cannot help you, it is very obvious what meant by that. Do you not know what a conservative is?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you think all conservatives are right-wingers? What about the fact that the majority of muslim regimes in the middle east are conservative? Are they also right-wingers to you? Since you mentioned that the scope is world-wide, then you should know that conservativism is different depending on where you are in the world and that a right-winger in a place like Sweden may look like a left-winger in a place like Iran  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also what overlap? Conservatives and Muslims actually have a lot of fundamental disagreements about the treatment of women and gays </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh? Such as? Again, since you refuse to define what you mean by &quot;right-winger&quot; then I don&#39;t actually know what these disagreements may be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Muslims have been the most violent group of people in the last 20 years and it&#39;s not even close.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on what statistics? Do you have a source for this claim?</p>
