       It was really great. They talked about AboutFaceTM, Corporate FacebookTM, and how the company was started in 1994. They have a new name that starts with an A (I can't remember at the moment), and there was a story about a college kid who made electronic facebooks and then started the company, almost the exact same story as Mark Zuckerberg.

       AboutFace (a software marketing company that creates employee directories) was using the address facebook.com. Facebook bought the facebook.com address from them.

       thats funny cause i was going to comment on that thread and i rarely do comment. I found it fishy when The Network movie came out. Something about that movie seemed to be really profound... when youre as high as fuck as i was. From the time i saw the trailer and the music used to the movie itself... it was done well IMO. It stuck in my mind. But why wouldnt they want it to? If facebook has a hidden history, why not show the public your version of the "official" history of the company. And film it in a way that stands out.  Kind of like how that movie based on the capture of Osama Bin Laden became top movie in the country when it was released... zero dark thirty.

       So the post was clearly [removed] when I checked yesterday, but it seems like I can view it again...

        We knew about InQTel but I think the assumption was that some three letter agency funded Mark after the platform got off the ground.
These links seem to show Facebook was live in 2003. Started by what's likely a CIA type front company AboutFace in Boston, and that it already had fortune 500 clients. This Facebook of 2003 even has a similar origin story to Mark Zuckerberg's. It seems they just swapped him out with Mark.
Compare the 'company history' in the first link below to Zuckerberg's facemash.
We're not talking about a similar social media company that might have stolen a name from the other. This other facebook in Boston had
        <a href="http://www.facebook.com">
         www.facebook.com
        </a>
        according to an archive made in 1999. (First link)
There were even cases of people being on the Facebook of Mark Zuckerberg and getting rerouted to AboutFace.com. (Yahoo Answers link below)

        Official Facebook origin story is that Mark made Facemash in 2003 and Facebook in 2004
This is very strange stuff. For instance:
AboutFace Corporation was founded in 1993 and is located in Boston, Massachusetts.
In 1994, with the release of the Electronic Facebook™, we invented the software category now known as "social networking".
AboutFace Directory Server makes it easy for your firm to manage and publish information about its most important asset -- your people.
And more:
The idea behind AboutFace evolved while Grossman was still in college. He developed, printed and sold a facebook his freshman year that included students’ photographs, home addresses, and birthdays. By using information already available in the Williams College database, he eliminated hours of typesetting and reduced production costs.
Grossman’s entrepreneurial spirit has paid off. Today Atlantic Media counts among its clients half of Boston’s largest law firms, including Goodwin, Procter &amp; Hoar; Choate, Hall &amp; Stewart; and Brown, Rudnick, Freed &amp; Gesmer, as well several other law firms around the country and institutions such as Harvard College and Northeastern University.
Zed Shaw is a software developer
He wrote a blog post once where he described people always trying to get him to build a social media site to take on Facebook and he would tell them Facebook can't be beaten because it had CIA backing.
" If you tell me that your social network will take on facebook because it includes baby pictures then I’m going to laugh in your face. They are an established player with CIA backing."

        Why Mark? Why the twins and betrayal of his business partners? Why make up the Facemash and "they gave me their info, stupid f****rs"? Because a conspirator who embarrasses himself makes you react to them emotionally and makes you less likely to question that they would have created a fake story IN WHICH they publicly embarrassed themselves.
I've also seen the evidence that Einstein was a total fraud and put out there as some type of inspiration. Makes you wonder about certain people.
