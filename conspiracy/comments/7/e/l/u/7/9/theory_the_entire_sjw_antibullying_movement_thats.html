       Bullies are not nice, but the fact of the matter is neither are the majority of other people in the real world. If you present yourself in a vulnerable way, people will treat you like absolute shit. I'm not saying I agree with it but it's a fact of life. If we try to erase any form of adolescent bullying/ offensive behaviors, how are these people going to handle the real world once they become adults and have to face real world bullies like the government, their co-workers/boss, that dude that's trying to fuck your wife, etc.?  If you crumble under the pressure of high school bullying, I don't think you'll be very happy in life afterwords.  Bullies are necessary because if you never learn how to defend yourself from forces that are oppressing you and general negativity, then you are bound to have no acquired defense mechanism to fight off real world oppression which is 100x more severe.

       You can see the deleterious effects of this already.  Week long college campus cry-ins, with hot cocoa and coloring books for fucking COLLEGE adults because their candidate lost an election?   We have successfully raised an entire generation of weak, pathetic, crying overgrown children.

       Seems like he was going down a "I was told I was born in the greatest country but could see I was being lied to as it was just a bunch of propganda". Maybe OP is like "sure seems like we are getting feminized and weak because MSMs reporting of safe spaces." Maybe that is propaganda too. Just cuz MSM focuses on it doesn't mean it applies to the whole, even though they try to make you think it does.

       Yes, precisely this. We don't benefit from a culture of pampered and sheltered perma-children. People are being softened so they are more malleable to the point some just give up and withdraw from society entirely.

       I mean playing devil's advocate here: children do not need to be bullied in order to become stronger or more capable in the real world.

       I think treating people better all around is a good thing.

       standing up to people being shitty, like a bully in op's example, is a good thing.

       I agree. I don't mean to imply people
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       to be bullied, but that they shouldn't be denied the learning process of dealing with life's inevitable bullying.
      </p>
      <p>
       An example being most public schools "zero tolerance" policy, in which even if you have done nothing wrong and try to turn the other cheek or ignore a bully as they've been taught, all involved parties are punished. This encourages kids to either tolerate escalating abuse as the bully becomes emboldened, or trying to cover the situation up and ignore the problem. This pattern of learned helplessness continues into adulthood; that you bully to get ahead, and be docile and obedient if bullied, lest you get in "trouble".
      </p>
      <p>
       We should encourage people to treat each other better, yes. But we should also encourage people to defend themselves to become fully functioning well-adjusted autonomous adults.

       This is always a weird point to me. Most people in the "real world" aren't assholes. I interact with a handful of assholes on a relatively infrequent basis. Do people really believe that the majority of people around them are jerks?

       The human existence is struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often we struggle against entropy (disorder.) We seek to maintain order. We build houses, wash clothes, create art. You would think that applying order to social interactions would make us happy. But it doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are only happy about the order that they can perceive in contrast to a reference. The importance they apply to the order in their lives is proportional to the investment they have in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were given a house, you wouldn't be as prideful of it as if you paid for it yourself. If someone fixed your car, you wouldn't brag about paying them the way you would doing it yourself. If someone fixes bullying in your life, you won't appreciate the struggle and won't derive happiness from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literature is full of heros overcoming evil. No great story was written about a life with no struggle because that's an oxymoron. Life is struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
       To take away someone's struggle is to take away their life.

       I feel like you really have to live in a bubble of constant media to believe this.
      </p>

       Almost everyone I encounter on a daily basis is either a) nice or b) indifferent. Very few people are actively mean, manipulative, or cruel. Do those people exist? Of course, but most people rarely, if ever, run into them in their daily lives.

       It's hard to really know.  SJW and migrants could be new way to start a war :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        quoted "Naturally the common people don't want war: Neither in Russia, nor in England, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, IT IS THE LEADERS of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is TELL THEM THEY ARE BEING ATTACKED, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. IT WORKS THE SAME IN ANY COUNTRY."

       So you think it's okay for kids to treat each other like shit? I've been bullied severely in middle school/high school and It did not make me become a stronger person, just worse. It made me have anxiety, what a stupid conspiracy.

       I'm never said being bullied makes you "stronger." I'm saying if you put blinders on people's eyes and pretend bullies don't exist, you won't learn how to stand up to or avoid them from a young age and shitty people definitely exist in this world and that ain't changing any time soon, I guarantee you.

       So are we not saying the same exact thing here? The only difference in what I'm saying is you might be less likely to let an asshole coworker get to your head if you've had some tolerance for bullying and hasn't pretended the world was all sunshine and rainbows.

       Dude, have you ever been bullied before? People, even little kids, know that there are not nice people in this world. That's not what they're saying when they say anti bullying. People in the real world don't physically kick you, pull your hair(I had long hair as a kid), break your glasses, laugh behind your back every where you go etc. You don't build tolerance from getting treated like shit from a young age trust me.
      </p>

       Nope, in fact that person is going to get stuck in your head all day at work and you're going to be focused on avoiding them or thinking about what you're going to say to them. Every single day you're going to focus on your actions and words to not make fool over yourself.

       If a guy is trying to fuck my wife I would trust her not to fuck him. I'm not going to fight a guy if I catch him sleeping with her, I would just walk away.  If my coworkers or boss are being dicks to me, I would transfer to another place or quit and find a new job. Not everything has to lead to a confrontation

       A) You don't need to be a macho man to not be oblivious to the way human beings are and take less shit from people. Not taking people's shit does not require physical altercations in 99% of cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) The use of word invincible is a bit melodramatic on your part. All I said was that if you are never exposed to the real world, you will be a less viable person in life and easier to manipulate.

       I think you're correct about the "wussification" of young people, though I'm not sure it's intentional.  It's ironic that the ones who push "anti-bullying" campaigns are among the biggest bullies.
