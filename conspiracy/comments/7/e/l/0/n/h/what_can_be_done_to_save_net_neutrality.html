       I know everyone's up in arms right now, and upvoting Net Neutrality to the front page like crazy, and saying call their senators, call their representatives, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's be honest: what has calling your senator or representative ever done? The answer is: absolutely nothing. At best, we might get some sort of bulk form letter mailed back to us, explaining how they don't give a shit about net neutrality, and they think it's for the best.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, the FCC is GOING to kill Net Neutrality, either this month or next month, and there is NOTHING that any of us can do about it. Our country is ruled by the rich, and by corporations, and they are running the show. We are all just their subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings us to the main point: if Net Neutrality cannot be saved, and it WILL die, then what can we do to bring it back, and how soon can we do it?

       If these bastards actually fuck us over like that, we have no choice but to barge into their DC headquarters and take over that black hat stronghold and convert it into a white hat strong hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the head of the FCC locks the doors, we can just pick him up like a battering ram and knock the door down.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this would have to be livestreamed to the public who will create a viral campaign for us so all can see how the "stupid goy" is mopping the floor with the cabal's head and thus get motivated to assist us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we would create a full blown transparent system where people can literally inspect all the happenings of the FCC from their home computers or they can do walk-ins at any time they please. The FCC is a government agency and belongs to the people so we have a right to inspect our own house. This will start a domino chain effect where other agencies will also follow the FCCs example and create transparency until we eventually get a totally transparent government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, we can give the head of the FCC a fair trial.

       TBQH, the internet will not die. But it will give the green light for two major things:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) ISPs will create a tiered internet, to milk as much money out of us (citizens, and businesses) as possible. (ie, charge individuals for access to certain websites, and charge businesses additionally arbitrarily, such as netflix)
      </p>
      <p>
       2) It will allow ISPs to shape political speech on the internet. Things they disagree with will slow down or just become inaccessable. Politicians and ISPs will develop some sort of quid-pro-quo, and feed off each other and their needs.

       The other 3-4 times they've tried to kill Net Neutrality, either through FEC regulations or legislation, the idea
       <em>
        has
       </em>
       been shot down, and it wasn't carried out. So, clearly the "responsiveness" is there, and possible, given the right administration and people at the FEC.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between then and now, of course, is that Donald Trump is the president and he is completely against net neutrality, as shown by who he appointed to the FEC. It wasn't really a mystery before the election, either, Trump voters voted to get rid of net neutrality along with all the rest. It's their fault, and we live with the consequences of their actions on this.

       If you're interested in the topic, and want to learn more, here is the seminal paper on the topic:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V2I1/JTHTLv2i1_Wu.PDF">
        http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V2I1/JTHTLv2i1_Wu.PDF
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This paper gave the name "net neutrality" to the pre-existing unbiased treatment of content by ISPs, and laid out the reasons -- for the internet as a whole, for consumers, and even for ISPs themselves -- why it should be official policy that ISPs should remain unbiased in terms of the speed they deliver this or that content.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So where did this Net Neutrality, that didn't exist in law or paper prior to 2015, come from?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's the natural state of the internet. It's only undone when ISPs go out of their way to reduce speeds for content providers and other websites who won't pay the ISP extra charges.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        How did it manifest itself?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Through an internet where every site and all content was treated the same by the ISP, in terms of the speed at which the consumer could access the content via the ISP.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Who enforced it?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No one, because ISPs were not, until recently, attempting to institute a tiered pay-for-speed system.

       So basically what you're telling me, is Net Neutrality existed
       <strong>
        naturally
       </strong>
       prior to net neutrality being codified into regulation. Awesome. So what I originally said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        oh noes.....if they undo what they did 3 years ago the internet is going to return to....wait for it....exactly the same way it was from the beginning of the internet to 2015. OOOOOOO fucking terrifying!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       is exactly what you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only you're adding the fearmongering portion of ISPs are gonna charge you more. And to that, I say, big fucking deal. It's their product and service, they should be allowed to charge whatever fucking price they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I made teeny tiny jars of amazing jelly and charged $1000/oz, do you think I should be regulated? Or should consumers simply have the choice to go buy a jar smuckers for $3.49, get 10 oz of jelly, and make the purchase happily because they think it's a better value than my product?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I know. Jelly and internet have nothing to do with each other. But my point is this. Companies have a vested interest in giving consumers what they want. If my internet provider starts providing me shitty service that doesn't meet the price I'm paying, I will go to one of the other 8 providers in my area. Consumers will choose which one wins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you remember years ago when Verizon had unlimited data plans? Then they got rid of them and everyone was pissed because then no provider had unlimited data plans? Then all the sudden t-mobile starts offering unlimited plans? Then Verizon recently started offering unlimited data plans again? Do you remember all that? Yeah...that's the market demanding something and companies doing everything they can to meet those demands. They have a vested interest to do so.

       So, you admit it won't be "exactly the same" as it was from the beginning of the internet.

      <p>
       Thank you for at least, here, admitting that you actually DO understand net neutrality, and you DO understand that it's been around forever -- it just didn't need outright policy protection until recently -- you just hate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your examples are inane, and not applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many ISPs operate in a monopolistic environment far different from jelly or cell phone service. Your argument does not work for ISPs, at this point in time, because they're availability is FAR more akin to a public utility than a free market service able to benefit from competition.

       If my argument does not work for ISPs please, fucking please, explain to me how the fuck I have 9 internet providers in my area? THAT is nowhere near being a utility, or "operating in a monopolistic environment".
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what is a utility in my area? Electricity. There's
       <strong>
        one
       </strong>
       fucking electric company. You know what else? Land line telephone service. There's
       <strong>
        one
       </strong>
       phone company. It makes sense that those are regulated as utilities because there is no competition for those in this market.

      <p>
       <strong>
        I have 9 ISPs in my area

       . That's not a utility, or a service that would in anyway qualify as even being defined as "a utility." So I ask you, how is that operating within a monopolistic environment?

      <p>
       There may be more. I don't know. And I guess it sucks for some people in America that don't have 9 ISPs?? But okay, the answer to that is for local governments to regulate and control these regions of monopolistic environments. Much like every municipality does with energy/water. A general, far reaching, regulation by the federal government is not necessary, and quite frankly it's dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fort Collins, which is 45 minutes south of me, just voted to create a
       <a href="https://www.fcgov.com/broadband/">
        public broadband service.
       </a>
       And the best thing? It's a win win for everyone. Companies can do whatever the fuck they want, and if they do shitty things to their customers they'll suffer the wrath of the free market - AND - those that want a government controlled internet can have that too. I think this is a nice compromise to total federal control.

       To end on a point of mutual agreement, though, I am 100% for local/state monopoly-busting where necessary in this area. That is really a separate issue than the federal rule on net neutrality, although it's connected in its interplay with the end-user effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yes, more local and locally-attuned laws/regulation to increase consumer choice in the broadband ISP market are fine by me, and I'm glad we at least agree on that.

       I will just say this one last thing. The aspect of Net Neutrality that often goes overlooked is the impact it will have on small ISPs. If we have regulation in place that dictates all internet traffic must be treated equally, it is the small ISPs with smaller infrastructures that are going to suffer the most to meet that requirement. The end result, is the smaller ISPs will have no choice but to close their doors. That's the opposite of overcoming monopolistic environments.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my area, if Millhouse charged more for video content, yes that sucks for the customer, but at least they can charge for delivering content that would otherwise put a burden on their infrastructure and have an overall negative impact to all their customers by consuming copious amounts of bandwidth. If the customers don't like that, they have 8 other options.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll see this sentiment reflected by who supports and who opposes Net Neutrality. Most of the big guys support it, while the small guys oppose it. And it's that way because the small guys realize they don't have the resources or capital to survive the marathon. Only the big guys will win this race.

       I think the issue of Net Neutrality is actually part of a much larger issue the whole world is going to be facing. I think it also ties into data mining, monetization, privacy, and over all reliability and security of the network infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "Net" as it exists today has a built in flaw. It can be controlled by companies and governments. When it can't be manipulated, it can be shut off. As long as this is a factor in it's design we will always be battling legislation trying to take advantage of these built in designs.
      </p>
      <p>
       What has to happen is that the "Net" has to be rebuilt from the ground up with tools designed to protect the free flow of information while focusing on decentralizing how we connect to the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are at a point technologically where we can directly connect to the internet without a middle man to route our traffic for us. Creating a system of private hubs in homes and at businesses that's completely anonymous and encrypted is the answer to all these problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your personal information and behavioral data should be protected by default. The information that companies receive from your behavior should be paid directly to YOU and should be managed by YOU. You give away precious and valuable information throughout your day while on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       With your own personal network hub you can manage who has access to what type of data without an internet provider or data marketing company making 300% profit for hardly any work.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the internet was decentralized no one would be able to take the internet down without attacking all hubs. There would be no main traffic lines that could be attacked, turned off, or re-routed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just rambling here I guess. I've thought a lot about what's currently wrong with the internet model and what needs to happen in order to fix it. And honestly, the only real solution I see is that the whole concept needs a rework from the bottom up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet was built with commerce in mind. It wasn't built so we can be entertained, educated, or informed. Mechanisms were slowly put in place over time that guaranteed certain players control over information. That fact is a threat to everything we believe the internet was created for.
