       We know many of us here on r/conspiracy believe in a Satanic Cabal that rules the world, but no one ever talks about the White Occult. I cannot claim to be an expert/Master, but some great topics to research are Sirat Shabd yoga, the Sound Current, Sant Mat, Sugmad.

       Jesus is the Son of God. He is not an idea. He came to humanity
       <em>
        to die
       </em>
       for the sins of ppl bec we could not help ourselves. He is the author of salvation to all who believe what He testified about the Father and Himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       As Jesus said to Peter, when he uttered words of error, “Get behind me, Satan!”
      </p>
      <p>
       That is not hate.  It is truth —to turn you from error and delusion.

       He showed us the path of salvation, he didn't pay for it. He taught us that by learning his message, we can be like him and even do greater works than him. His message was that we are all children of God, and when we understand exactly what that means, he'll do wonders for us. Because we come to the realization that there is no separation between us and him. The father and I are one. You and I are one. The Lord and Jesus live in our hearts. He didn't pay our debt. Debt to who? Why would debt require a blood sacrifice? That type of Christianity doesn't encourage growth, compassion, or challenge in my opinion. Once you realize that God is all there ever has and ever will be, and that you are an inseperable part of him, then yes Jesus was a person that lived, but he is also an eternal soul that will always be there for you. But he is no more a son of God than you and I. Come to realize this, you'll be worthy of not just salvation, but a closer walk with our Lord. This was the point I was trying to make, but I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on it.

       In the beginning was the Word, 
and the Word was with God, 
and the Word was God. 
2He was with God in the beginning. 
3Through him all things were made; 
without him nothing was made that has been made. 
4In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. 
5The light shines in the darkness, 
and the darkness has not overcome it.
      </p>
      <p>
       10He was in the world, 
and though the world was made through him, 
the world did not recognize him. 
11He came to that which was his own, 
but his own did not receive him. 
12Yet to
       <em>
        all who did receive him, 
to those who believed in his name,
       </em>
       he gave the right to become children of God— 
13children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       14The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the
       <em>
        one and only Son,
       </em>
       who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.

       Wow I was just looking into White Occultism, or more of good magic in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm working on creating "holy magic" spells, none of that death magic shit. Spells should incorporate beauty, passion, vigor, depth, peace, insight, and creativity, and shred those dedicated to evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the problem with Christian magic, it bolsters evil and gives them power. But we can bend it, like water-bending. It's hard to explain but if you channel joy into an evil remark, you can warp it.

       Thoughts are things. They carry a vibration. That's why its important to be of a loving vibration at all times. We exist physically in a third dimensional consciousness, above us is the astral plane, above that the causal plane, above that the mental plane, and above that the etheric plane. These are the "negative" planes. Think negative like the pole of a battery.  Above the mental plane you are in the realms of pure Spirit, beginning with the Soul plane. Again I am not a Master, but I have studied a lot.

       I would advise anyone interested to play around and experiment. Be like a scientist about it. Before going out into the world, ask that the Light of the Holy Spirit surround you and be with you for the Highest Good of All Concerned. Ask for the protection of the Christ, and see what happens.

       Do not share your love with those who do evil towards you. Focus on yourself, and loving yourself, and when you understand yourself, you will understand others.
       <br/>
       And when you understand others, you will not fear them.
       <br/>
       And when you do not fear them, you have overcome them.

       when asked "How many times should I forgive me brother" Jesus replied, "Seventy times seven." He also said, "What you have done to the least of these, you have done to Me." And "Turn the other cheek" and "you reap what you sow." Jesus taught Karma. How you treat others and what you feel toward others will come back to you, because we are all aspects of one divine consciousness.

       Hatred corrupts the vessel that carries it. Those who do evil to you are to be forgiven, as that's the only way to destroy the evil. To condemn them for it is to take that evil into your own heart. I agree, love and understand yourself and you'll understand others. But love others as you love yourself, and you'll learn more about yourself as well as those around you. Pure love knows sees no difference between yourself and others- to love others is to love yourself.

       Is it not right to attack to defend yourself? You are Christian so you believe man was made in the image of God. Therefore you must agree that the body creates anti-bodies to destroy what tries to destroy the body. It is not wrong to kill what attacks you.

       In the beginning was the Word, 
and the Word was with God, 
and the Word was God. 
2He was with God in the beginning. 
3Through him all things were made; 
without him nothing was made that has been made. 
4In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. 
5The light shines in the darkness, 
and the darkness has not overcome it.
      </p>
      <p>
       10He was in the world, 
and though the world was made through him, 
the world did not recognize him. 
11He came to that which was his own, 
but his own did not receive him. 
12Yet to
       <em>
        all who did receive him, 
to those who believed in his name,
       </em>
       he gave the right to become children of God— 
13children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       14The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the
       <em>
        one and only Son,
       </em>
       who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.
