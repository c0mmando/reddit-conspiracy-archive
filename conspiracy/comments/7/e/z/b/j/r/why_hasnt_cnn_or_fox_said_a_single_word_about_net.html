       You still believe these "stage" players are seperate or divided? They are not! CNN is playing their role, so is Trump! Their masters are one and the same. This political saga reality you see before is staged. Just for you.

       You're being played like a fiddle! Trump has nothing to lose. He is master at manipulating the public; a "tell them what they need to hear" tactical guy. He'll pretend like he cares but when the Bill gets through the House and Senate, he will not veto it!- of course he will spin in it all in the name of not abusing the executive position. Trump's team are master manipulators at using the peoples wishes against them.

       It boils my blood when people starting saying stuff like "it's the GOP" or other political nonsense. We really need to wake up and realize their two party system is fake. This is the elite vs. the common man. They control the media outlets/corporations/governments and will soon control another huge chunk of our reality if NN is repealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to stop fighting amongst ourselves and realize the reality they are feeding us through THEIR media outlets is a false narative designed to divide us. Pretty soon that's the only narritive we'll be able to see if NN is repealed.

       O' yes the red team vs the blue team! Totally different these people don't flip flop on their votes constantly, have dinner with each other, take money from the same sources, kiss the same peoples asses, and the sure as hell don't vote the way they're told to when they're told to. They are all strong, proud, independent thinkers looking out for the interest of their constituents. You just need to call or e-mail them and they will totally stop serving the special interest that keep them in power.

       Exactly what I was thinking.... the conservative and liberal news channels are both on the same side, they are just playing it up to excite emotions and get people to pick a side. Its like Mayweather v McGregor, both hyping it up just for more money.... but on a larger scale with media and politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't trust TV in general one bit.... funny how Russia's RT really is one of the least bias news out there lol. I watch it mainly for Abby, but still atleast they cover wide variety of stuff and don't hold back .

       Whether CNN is covering it or not is beside the pioint for us here. As you can see in my comment and those below are pointing out the sheer futility of expecting the Wolves at the Media, WhiteHouse and FCC to save the interest of the people. They all belong to one Wolf pack. We aren't in their interest at all.

       Has anyone thought about what net neutrality is going to do to "citizen journalism"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the main side effect they are going for is control over the news cycle through limiting and restricting sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       People will now "lock in" to their "preferred" source since having multiple sources will require more money.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be easy to create an artificial internal internet just through price restrictions. You will eventually be served the same type of model as China except it's enforced through capitalism.

       Free speech is a natural right, but that does not mean that others MUST provide a platform for that speech. Freedom of speech isn't the right to have such speech heard by everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the Constitution prevents the government from infringing on that right, I don't think it's a good idea to have the government enact laws that make companies give a platform to everyone. That would quickly spiral out of control.
      </p>

       Just because Google doesn't allow certain stuff to come up in searches doesn't mean that we should get the government involved.

       But it's nothing that will change with Net Neutrality's status. They're two different issues that require two different solutions.

       Right, because an idea like Net Neutrality wasn't spearheaded by Comcast using Sandvine to block/slow bit-torrent traffic during the fucking Bush years.  Or how about the time they stacked the courtroom by paying homeless people to show up and "represent supporting Comcast" so by the time
       <em>
        actual people actually wanting to be involved in the process showed up
       </em>
       the entire courtroom was full of people who didn't give a shit about what was going on but had just been handed $50 to get out of the cold for a few hours.

       Sure, it was just an Obama power grab.  Obama must have fucking loved The Pirate Bay, considering they were one of the spawning grounds for the idea of Net Neutrality, with how often they were being throttled and blocked.

       How the fuck old are you?  Were you over 10 years old when Bush Junior was President?  If you are older than that, you don't exactly have a fucking excuse for this bullshit historical revisionism which ignores all the

       who spearheaded this idea and had endless issues with ISP's for decades.

       Obama is probably in his skull-shaped island fortress right now, surrounded by monitors full of web browsers, cackling maniacally because he is running websites at the speed the network allows instead of being artificially throttled ... all part of his devilish master plan that finally paid off.

       When mass adoption occurs, the services which once were subject to simple market forces now have the properties of infrastructure. They are very much related issues.  Facebook shouldn't be able to mess with user communications any more than AT&amp;T could with the phone lines in the 90s, or comcast could until today. Couching it in confusing terms like data/information privacy misses the bigger picture entirely.

       Great. That still has nothing to do with Net Neutrality. They're separate issues.

       It's just that keeping NN doesn't ensure an open internet.  It's not open now!  Online censorship is at an all time high.

       This isn't about online censorship. That's a different thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Net Neutrality is about keeping the lanes free for everyone to use. So a company can't see your small business as a threat and throttle your bandwidth until you pay them. They aren't going to censor you, they're gonna squeeze you the fuck out. And getting rid of NN lets them.

       I have had some luck with the roads and stores analogy. NN is protecting the roads and making sure that they go to every store as soon as the store opens. If I don’t like what the big box [google] store is selling (or hiding), I can go to the local [content provider] store without any issues for the local store or myself. If I don’t like what the big box store is selling, that fight is a different fight than the NN fight. Still an important fight, but different from the NN one.

       bbasara007 you're right. Honestly, we've only had official Net Neutrality for like a year and half. Letting companies do what they have done for years (and probably still do today, but hide it a little better) isn't going to change much. Sure, if you have AT&amp;T they might block Comcast sites and vice-versa, but what this really does is encourage competition.

       That's true, those things did still happen before there was any sort of enforcement, although with improving technology and ever larger ISP monopolies it's just going to become more prevalent.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here's a brief history on what the internet companies were doing that triggered Net Neutrality to be put in place:
      </p>
      <p>
       MADISON RIVER: In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.
      </p>
      <p>
       COMCAST: In 2005, the nation’s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       TELUS: In 2005, Canada’s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.
      </p>
      <p>
       AT&amp;T: From 2007–2009, AT&amp;T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such “over-the-top” voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&amp;T when it came on the scene in 2009.
      </p>
      <p>
       WINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream’s own search portal and results.
      </p>
      <p>
       MetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon’s court challenge against the FCC’s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency’s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.
PAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person’s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service’s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites.
AT&amp;T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011–2013, AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.
      </p>
      <p>
       EUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace.

       VERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon’s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.

      <p>
       AT&amp;T: In 2012, AT&amp;T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers’ iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&amp;T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&amp;T’s own products.
VERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency’s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: “I’m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.” Walker’s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.

       I'll hand it to you, you're quite capable of moving goalposts. According to you no such violations happened, but when proven otherwise you just claim they were all fixed anyways. Do you supply any proof of that though? Of course not.

       Clearly, you have no idea what you're talking about. I'll explain why those things could be fixed before net neutrality, but can't be fixed by the FCC if net neutrality laws are removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Up until 2014 the FCC could stop the ISPs from doing this stuff. In 2014 the DC Circuit court ruled that the FCC had no authority over internet providers as ISPs were not "common carriers"
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2015 the FCC classified ISPs as common carriers which subjects them to Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 and allows the FCC to enforce net neutrality. If that classification goes away then it falls back to the ruling of the Court and the FCC will have no power to stop this sort of stuff like they could before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you get it now? Do you understand why the anti net neutrality propaganda you're spreading is completely baseless? Can you see how your argument completely falls apart when faced with any evidence at all? Even when you move the goalposts?

       I don't think that they will do that because it's a terrible business model. It's really that simple. Who would continue to pay if their ISP suddenly changed the rules and started charging more for access to certain sites and services?

       I only have one choice of ISP where I live and if they did that I would call them, tell them to go fuck themselves, and cancel my contract. Then I would go get a mobile hotspot from a company that promises unlimited access and use that.

      <p>
       Either that or I would just use my VPN to circumvent my ISPs restrictions.

       You're going to constantly have to change your VPN. This is what happens in places like China. That's assuming VPNs will even work. Mobile hotspots are already prone to being throttled to hell unless you pay for the largest package. Even then there's no guarantee that they wouldn't do the same thing other ISPs plan on doing.

       If my mobile hotspot started imposing restrictions, I would cancel their service and get one from another company that advertised no restrictions. That's how the free market works. If something sucks, you don't buy it and then those companies either learn from their mistakes or go bankrupt. The companies that provide services people want grow and make profit.

       Hell no. Where I live (NH), the only choices here are Comcast, DirectTV, Dish, and Verizon FiOS. Except for three things:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Very few homes are able to have a sattelite set up (either due to space, bad coverage, or landlords not allowing it.
       </li>
       <li>
        Fewer homes have fiber optics, so they need a different option
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Most people are then either stuck with Comcast, or use an IP that will most likely become part of Comcast since Comcast has a HUGE monopoly here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, there is no competition or free market at all. You either get screwed by one monopoly, or screwed by another, and getting rid of Net Neutrality will just let them screw us bad enough to make Weinstein look like a saint.

       There's no competition when the market is mostly a monopoly. And the cost to entry in this industry is so astronomically high that even Google has all but given up. If Google can't afford to get into the market, no one can.

       No. First the only monopolies are government created by your municipality.

       Second, Google thought they could throw their weight around and circumvent legislated pole pricing and failed then got sticker shock at how much it cost to rent space which broke their business model.

       There is no free market. Explaining how it works is pointless. You have very limited options here. When all of those options are doing the same thing, then good luck. Even if VPNs do work, it's likely ISPs will just throttle anything that might look like a VPN.

       That video is terrible, but I can understand the argument that Net Neutrality violates the 1st amendment. ISPs even tried to go that route but were shot down because it isn't a 1st amendment issue. I find it absurd to think Net Neutrality is the foot in the door for censorship when it is fighting against that.

       Do you not read the news? The rampant greed and corruption? Larger ISP will try to block newer ISP from installing broadband cables or using poles and stuff. Google fiber keeps getting pushback from setting up in various counties.
      </p>
      <p>
       This idealistic "free market capitalism will take care of itself" stuff is bullshit. Maybe if everyone was honest and not greedy, plus no corporations.... but that isn't our reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what if you have a family and need reliable internet for work or kids school stuff? You can't really jump thru these hoops like VPN or hotspot...... nor should you have to. These corporations say "no government restrictions" but then lobby to restrict other companies from competing... they are all hypocrits.

       There is no where on Earth that Comcast is the only Internet provider.

       There are satellite options but they are expensive and provide moderate quality service in comparison to broadband.
       <br/>
       DSL is often available if you are willing to chip-in for for the last-mile run and/or can convince the municipality to do it if you live in a rural area. This can cost $10k but so does drilling a new well.

       If you live in a suburb or city and Comcast is your only option that is because your municipality sold them franchise rights and it is a government fabricated monopoly.

       This was kinda my thought as well. I would rather be censored by some corporation than the government. It's like twitter and their new censorship rules. If you don't like it find a different platform. Can't do that with govenment censorship.

       That's just the newest fear mongering people are using to scare up support for FCC regulated internet. It would be bad for business and is not even a proposed thing. NN only started in 2015. If they were going to do that they could have done it before 2015.

      <p>
       The cable television industry is an entirely distinct industry that operates under different conditions. Bundles are required for small channels to even exist. I'd think if you searched 'why are television channels bundled' you could find a compelling write-up, and you'd also see how that dynamic has no practical application to websites.

       That's a wholly inaccurate statement to it's core and it represents complete non-understanding of the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Netflix, 1 single entity out of the millions that utilize Comcast infrastructure, was consuming 40% of the available bandwidth on the entire service. This is harmful to Netflix, to Comcast, to the other entities on the network, and to end consumers. You can't have a single service grow to dominance on limited pipelines, so-to-speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comcast and Netflix sat down at the business table, and hammered out a deal that was favorable to both of them. Netflix pays it's fair share of the service it's utilizing, and Comcast gets a monetary solution to it's congested network. Now they can expand, increase bandwidth, and not resort to having to logically throttle anyone be it Netflix or the other services on the network.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is called a business deal.  It's how all private business functions.

       I personally think it's hilarious the amount of vitriol thrown at Comcast since people don't understand that they function as a collective bargaining agent between content creators and content providers and cord cutters are the ones ushering in the a la cart model because now you have to buy subscriptions to each content provider you want (and obviously at $5 to $20/mn a pop it will be vastly more expensive to aggregate anything close to the bundles Comcast sells.)

       It all depends on what options you have in terms of access to the internet. If only one company supplies your area then your only option is pay them or go without.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your area is serviced by multiple ISPs then you will be fine. I live in a country where I have like 14+ options that service my house. I also live in a country that doesn't have NN. I am not affected in anyway by that because no ISP dares pull any crap because they would be dropped in a heart beat.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I have friends that currently live in the US. Their whole suburb/area has only one provider because of some deal made with the city. NN aids people like that.

       Not really. Just big business. I’m sure most Republican’s and Democrats individually support NN — but the Republicans in power are bought and paid for enough
       <em>
        by large corporations
       </em>
       to let it slide under the radar.

       Before Obama in 2015, Net Neutrality was like the accepted law of the land. No one abused it because it was still new and developing. There was some abuse, like ATT blocking Google's "Android Pay" app on their phones to promote their own "ISIS Wallet" app (I shot you not on that name)
      </p>
      <p>
       That was ATT closing the "pipes" to Google's similar service.

       Changing the designation in 2015 made that kind of thing illegal. That's what the telecoms want to change, and if they get it, we just have to trust that they won't use it to defeat upstart rival companies and products to continue delivering their shitty half-assed product.

       The thing is for most of the time up to 2015, HD streaming wasn't a thing and now it is, and it's crippling the internet while companies/sites making money off it are not paying for it, and instead passing on the costs to you via your ISP.

       In NYC, one of the largest cities in the country, many neighborhoods only have access to Time Warner. Don't like it? Too bad. You don't get another choice unless your landlord approves FiOS, or you face in the right direction for satellite AND your landlord approves installation of a dish.

       I'm not the one living in an area with too many regulations asking for more - I have quality choices where I live because the market is more free, not less. So I don't need to start a business, there is already lively competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, you're advocating that heavy internet users be subsidized by light internet users. You're advocating for regulations that pave the way for a government takeover ensuring mass future censorship.

       If you're in an area where it's expensive to get bandwidth, then guess what - your bandwidth should be expensive. Netflix is not a right. If you have a problem then one again, stop being a bitch and be a competitor.

       I can read about it on my own, I don't need to enter your disinformation chamber to have some cultist tell me how I should think about this.  Simply put, leaving the internet the way it is now will not put anything at risk.  Your approach to this, to just remove the FFC's teeth, and HOPE AND PRAY that the same doesn't happen to the FTC is a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they can lobby hard enough to change it at the FCC level, then the FTC won't save your internet either.  The FTC is already allowing ATT to grow bigger than when it was initially broken up years ago, why would they help now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your basically claiming that the FCC is evil and tried to take over the internet but the FTC knows best and they will do the honorable thing.  I'm dying with laugher, so don't worry, I'm ded.

       sort of, but the reason NN was implemented was because shit was starting to go downhill. For example Netflix was just starting to be throttled by (i think) Comcast. NN came along just in time to stop those things before they got out of control. The then director of the FCC actually started out as a NN-opponent and came around to the necessity of it once abuses started to pop up.

       I mean, you can say things like that, but you're ignoring the actual voting data. Republicans support repealing NN, Democrats do not. Republicans voted to overturn the consumer-friendly CFPB rule; Democrats voted against it. Etc.

       What are you some kind of bot that brings the conversation back to the two party system they're mind fucking us with? Politicians play their roles when it suits them - the same agenda keeps pushing forward full steam - they got us all squabbling about policies and issues that, for the most part, don't impact people much - just different flavors of life. On the REAL issues - the major agenda items they are united and ramming it down our throats regardless of what we want - like with net neutrality.

       It's all a show to make you think there's one team vs another. Sure some people may get caught up in the drama of it all and truly believe in the theatrics... people like you maybe? You're just playing the part of the pawns.

       C'mon, with net neutrality is almost a binary difference between the parties, and those posting around you told you this with facts
      </p>
      <p>
       With health care one party expands government health insurance (D) while the other seeks to terminate it (R).
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats tend to favor more education spending. Republicans tend to favor reducing it and also allowing it to be used for private (religious) schools.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Republicans tend to favor military spending increases. The democrats do as well at times, but they appear to want to limit or reduce it at times too. When have Republicans done that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama was more diplomatic than Trump, but I have to agree with you here. It seems the deep state plays this fiddle for the most part. Our war behavior remains largely the same between presidencies, but remember that presidents have to rely on the corrupted (covertly by big economic interests) intelligence agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both parties will fail to change the status quo of the debt-based fiat money scam. That's understandable, as most people are too emotionally weak to independently examine that issue while experts and the media dazzle them with jargon and misleading bullshit. However, Democrats put some more customer protection into the system as of late, which the Republicans have shown clearly their intent to dismantle.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, while we have a huge problem with big economic players corrupting financial regulations and foreign policies to serve themselves at others' expense, we do have some very real differences between the parties on many important issues. Of course money and military issues are close to the core of survival for us. We really need to get the worms out of our state. They answer to the biggest economic players. If we tap any phones or Internet connections, it should be theirs. Throughout history, they have been the most willing and able to subvert the will of the people.

       It is not non-partisan, it is in fact a "small govt"/liberal split issue generally speaking.  The fallacy is that Net Neutrality is inherently in the public's interest.

       It's funny because it appears that op thought he could rage against msm making a statement that he hoped would rile people up in anger against the msm without ever checking to see if op was correct. Sad part is that a lot of people just had a knee jerk reaction and responded in agreement. People

       Why do you want the government to be able to set prices in the isp market? Should they be able to make fed ex charge the same amount as the post office. Fed ex offers "priority" deliveries to customers that pay extra, isn't that "predatory" to the people that can't afford to send their packages overnight? Shouldn't everyone have to use ground transportation and all pay the same price?

       Even in a relatively competitive market companies need regulation to protect consumers from poor quality service. In the near monopolistic world of telecoms it’s a much bigger issue. Comcast would literally be able to control the flow of information and ideas by slowing down and speeding up access to content. That you can be on a conspiracy site and not see the issue with that is mind boggling.

       Okay, well first off your analogy is fucked because there is no "US Postal Service" of the internet. You can't choose the public option OR a private service when choosing internet providers.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can only choose private or no internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the government isn't setting any prices, they're just regulating how ISPs are allowed to charge. They can charge a billion dollars an hour to use their service if they want, or charge nothing. Government don't care about that, that's free market decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       What they're saying is that ISPs can't choose the speed at which certain data is allowed to flow through their infrastructure. So they can't decide to allow CNN priority access to your computer while slowing down Reddit because Reddit won't pay the ISP for access. And they can't charge you extra if you want Reddit at the same speed as CNN.

       I know she's not everyone's favorite around here, but I'm gonna speak highly of Rachel Maddow from MSNBC regarding this. On Tuesday's show, she opened up a segment by saying that her employer, MSNBC is owned by Comcast, and that Comcast was in favor of this bill. And then launched into the litany of reasons why this is crazy, with her guest Xeni Jardin, activist and editor of Boing Boing. An entire segment dedicated to shining a light on this travesty. I haven't seen this elsewhere in the MSM.

       It's the same as Netflix. I believe when this all started they came out and plainly said "This is bad for most consumers and companies, not so much for us. Forgive us for being mostly silent on this issue." While I'd love for the big names to be more up in arms, they're not gonna fight something that would end up beneficial to them.

       CNN, by way of its parent company Time Warner, is trying to sell itself to AT&amp;T right now. A number of huge assets that are part of the FOX empire are engaging in early discussions to sell themselves off to Verizon and Disney. None of those companies (
       <em>
        Verizon, AT&amp;T or Disney
       </em>
       ) are interested in anything resembling net neturality.

       Where i live, there is no wireless networking available for less than $100, none that provides more than a few gb for that data at that price, and none that provides sufficient bandwidth for more than two simultaneous devices.

       I have one wired provider to select from, and while their service is acceptable, i pay their price or forego service. Currently $70/month, rising about $4/yr over the last decade.

       What if this was the "long term plan" of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Phase 1 - Create an "open network" for citizens, businesses, news outlet to use for sharing ideas, music, media etc; in order to build users trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Phase 2 - Once trust established introduce social networks to get people's private data and create psychological dependence on said social networks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Phase 3 - Once step 2 in place, enforce total control on the "open network" in order to gain total control of what is shared by citizens, businesses, news outlet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically we all have a giant two ways screen we created ourselves, in our houses.

       Because Net Neutrality is an issue that is undebatable.  Literally, it's an issue of whether your are left or right.  Whether you are Socialist or Capitalist.  It's one of those issues that is a fricken full on headache for those who have businesses but yet defend free speech.

       Because they would benefit from a world without net neutrality. Honestly if they could throttle there competition in the crib with crippling internet speeds or outright not allow there subscribers to view the competition (censorship), Why would they not?

      <p>
       Decency? Heck no! This is big business here and they don't care about you much, mean what are you gonna watch besides them since they throttled any new competition that has arisen?

       Not really. They could just charge extra for VPN access or give special priority to specific VPNs that they partner with.

       Hell no. Where I live (NH), the only choices here are Comcast, DirectTV, Dish, and Verizon FiOS. Except for three things:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Very few homes are able to have a sattelite set up (either due to space, bad coverage, or landlords not allowing it.
       </li>
       <li>
        Fewer homes have fiber optics, so they need a different option
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Most people are then either stuck with Comcast, or use an IP that will most likely become part of Comcast since Comcast has a HUGE monopoly here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, there is no competition or free market at all. You either get screwed by one monopoly, or screwed by another, and getting rid of Net Neutrality will just let them screw us bad enough to make Weinstein look like a saint.

       I'm not the one living in an area with too many regulations asking for more - I have quality choices where I live because the market is more free, not less. So I don't need to start a business, there is already lively competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, you're advocating that heavy internet users be subsidized by light internet users. You're advocating for regulations that pave the way for a government takeover ensuring mass future censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're in an area where it's expensive to get bandwidth, then guess what - your bandwidth should be expensive. Netflix is not a right. If you have a problem then one again, stop being a bitch and be a competitor.
