        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Like seriously, why not <a href="/r/everythingantitrump">/r/everythingantitrump</a> ? Does the average Reddit user even see through this obvious funding? I hate Trump, he’s blaming Assad, passed that internet history selling bill, sold the Saudi’s 110 billion worth of arms, hating on Iran. It’s too obvious how he’s controlled by the cabal and pushing Israel’s foreign policies. he’s highly likely also a pedophile and people still think he’s playing 4D chess. No, but that’s not the point I’m making. <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is disgusting and it’s laughable how anyone could read that sub and take it seriously anymore. Who cares if they attack Trump on foreign policy? That’s a good thing! But the personal attacks towards Trump are so fucking retarded. They will literally attack him on anything he says or does, and in the process will make shit up, edit, and twist everything. Imagine them talking about Obama like that. Attacking every single thing he does like it makes any sense. <strong>The MSM attacks Trump on anything except his foreign policy, which is by far the most disturbing about him</strong>, what does that tell you? People are not waking up and the dumbing down of society is in full force, and people saying people are waking up, it’s not true. The average human doesn’t care what happens to innocent people being killed in the middle east. They don’t care if the US drops bombs on millions of innocent Korean people just to flex US arms. They will listen to Ellen degenerate of Megyn Kelly or Katy Perry and base their thoughts off of that. Fuck the system.</p>

<p>Anyone remember politics before Bernie lost from Hillary? 100% different. It’s too blatant how it’s a completely bought out sub now. Disgusting world we live in. </p>

<p>Notice there are also Christian zionists.  Atheist Zionist.  Secular Zionist. Not just Jews. In fact, from what I have seen, almost all Orthodox Jews living outside Israel vehemently oppose the zion movement for going against scripture.  Supposedly the state of Israel isn&#39;t prophesied to exist until the messiah comes.   Perhaps Rothschild believes that he is the messiah?</p>

<p>As for their alleged agenda: tikkun olam!  Repairing the world!  Repairing it by creating their own manifest destiny against the ME.  By taking all the oil from underneath surrounding countries.  To carry sway in foreign governments and cultures.   To be the PC police for the world, while hypocritically being ran by a supremacist regime behind Netanyahu.</p>

<p>They are a nationalistic aggressive supremacist state who has used the tragedy of the holocaust along with select Zionist families manipulating markets and currency as leverage to essentially do anything they want.  </p>

<p>They have the means, they control the money.  If you criticize Israel, or someone who is Jewish on the world-power stage, you are labeled an antisemite.</p>

<p>It happens pretty much everywhere, including here. When the entire area of conspiracy winds up heavily loaded with Republican partisan information to promote or protect Donald Trump, there is a backlash by Democrats against conspiracies. As long as too many of us are lead by James O&#39;Keefe, Sean Hannity and other partisan hacks, Democrats will continue to reflexively discard real nonpartisan conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see a lot of people talk about Obama&#39;s &quot;drone kill count&quot; would you care to talk about that? The way it was explained to me was that Obama authorized a significant amount of drone strikes during his presidency, more so than any other president. But at the same time, he reduced boots on the ground and reduced the amount of American troop casualties.</p>

<p>Additionally, drone technology rapidly increased in the last 10 years. An example of this is the MQ-9 Reaper, the infamous &quot;Predator Drone&quot; that was a huge asset to the U.S. Military. The U.S. developed the drone in 2007, during the Bush administration. Bush did not have more than a year to implement the technology in to the military, so it is possible he did not use it to its fullest potential. Obama had about 8 years where the technology was common and saw the use of minimizing the risk of Americans troops in combat, so it makes sense that he would have a significant amount of drones during his time as Commander in Chief of the U.S. Military. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not saying artillery or air bombing is any different. They are all forms of fucked up murder. The difference with planes/artillery though is that they usually(not always the case obviously) have to be relatively close by and thus actually be at war. With drones, they can just fly them over into a zone, anywhere, that they have no business being in, and bomb people with no way of &#39;losing&#39; because there isn&#39;t even a pilot to be shot down.</p>

<p>And because of this, the information and &#39;authorization&#39; is often a bit better with artillery or air strikes. With drones.. who the fuck knows?</p>

<p>And besides, its all sick. &#39;Boots on the ground&#39; isn&#39;t a bad thing. By not putting &#39;boots on the ground&#39;, you aren&#39;t verifying what you are destroying or killing. So the end result is that people who didn&#39;t sign up to die, get killed, and the people that <em>did</em> sign up to die, don&#39;t see any combat at all.</p>

<p>If there were more &#39;boots on the ground&#39;, then there would be less collateral damage. Most of that damage comes from bombings, explosives etc.. not the bullet coming out of infantry rifles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Development of malware is a good analogy to the efforts to disrupt communication. Time and effort will be allocated primarily to the most common operating systems, to maximize reach. Hence the marketing campaign from Apple that their computers did not get malware (this was a reflection of their much smaller marketshare, and malware written for it increased as market share went up).</p>

<p>Relating to communication platforms -- the development time is primarily spent targeting largest platform. Why build out tools to monitor and slide conversation to a platform with only 1000 people on it when there&#39;s a platform that serves millions?</p>

<p>Practice decentralized communication. Use the small platforms and cross-share information learned elsewhere to those communities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Community A figures something out but people at Community B are supposed to trust someone from A retelling their version of it to come tell them?  Seems like that&#39;d be great for the LARPs and disinformation.  Anyone active on multiple platforms would be called a government agent.  Also small groups don&#39;t tend to question what they are being told, there needs to be one revolutionary to start questioning and small groups means small chance of that happening and limited effect when it does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I put &quot;neutral&quot; within quotation in my original post, since obviously a political site won&#39;t be neutral in the strictest sense.</p>

<p>However, if one were to go to /Politics without any prior knowledge of the sub, I think it would be reasonable for the individual to expect a fairly proportional distribution of political leanings, mostly dominated by Republicans and Democrats.  As it stands, /Politics is more akin to /Democrats, and it appears that all of the Republicans and those within that spectrum have been pushed to /The_Donald.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t recall ever seeing a pro-Trump, Republican, etc., post within /Politics, which is strange for a sub that is presumably a catch-all, <em>neutral</em>, political site.</p>

You&#39;re either in one praising our God Emperor Trump, or you&#39;re in an alt-left libtard chamber. Not much in between. I wasn&#39;t outright banned from posting there, but I got brigaded by enough people to realize it&#39;s a waste of time.

The only time over my career when things went downhill was during Obama&#39;s years. Worse jobs, worse benefits, worse perks, a few lay offs, you name it. During the election I&#39;m working at a crappy company, not content with my career but no other options, THEN Trump gets elected. Immediately, people at my crappy company start getting great jobs and are leaving left and right. I decided to search around and end up getting a dream job that simply wouldn&#39;t exist in Obama/Hillary&#39;s USA. IMO, people who DON&#39;T support Trump are either dumb or brainwashed by media. It&#39;s not about Trump&#39;s personality, it&#39;s about the issues. You don&#39;t hear much about those these days, but I dig into it.  </p>

That shit doesn&#39;t go away immediately.  I see people leaving where I work for better jobs too, you know why?

<p>I think it&#39;s a case of the devil you know. Middle class center-left people have led comfortable lives under the IC, corporate media, etc. Why would they give that up? And more importantly, why <em>should</em> they be expected to?</p>

<p>It&#39;s been custom in this country to vote based on your own prosperity. We&#39;re expected to vote greedily, and no one bats an eye when a blue collar middle American votes for the person who promises him a job above all else.</p>

<p>In this case, many people have been promised a comfortable life by the stability of the deep state, and they will fight for the status quo because it is in their best interest, and to be honest, I can&#39;t fault them for it any more that I can fault the people voting to bring back their coal jobs.</p>

<p>That would be my take on it. Stagnant wages, shitty health care, disappearance of overtime and penchants, mining of personal data by corporations, government surveillance, endless warfare (with endless coffers for it), the lack of things like universal health care or publicly-funded college tuition (which nearly all other major industrialzied countries have), the total ownership of media by six large corporations...I could go on.</p>

<p>Middle class center-left people generally agree that most (if not nearly all) the issues I listed are genuine problems; however, they seem to believe the illusion that the Democratic party is somehow fighting for them, and that mainstream media has their best interest at heart.</p>

<li>It is simply a matter of historical fact that the dominant intellectual culture of any particular society reflects the interest of the dominant group in that society. In a slave owning society the beliefs about human beings and human rights and so on will reflect the needs of the slave owners. In the society, which... is based on the power of certain people to control and profit from the lives and work of millions of others, the dominant intellectual culture will reflect the needs of the dominant group. So, if you look across the board, the ideas that pervade psychology, sociology, history, political economy and political science fundamentally reflect certain elite interests.

<p>Excellent post my friend. Nail on head. People just dismiss history despite everything that follows it, the context and the key to greater understanding. That subreddit has long been compromised by a moderation team and an army of bots to control narratives that suit their particular political agenda, all the while painting a picture of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> as a neutral beacon of political discourse, when it is farther from the truth, as it is it&#39;s own echochamber. This isn&#39;t exclusive to r/politics, it happens all over reddit. It is a sad indictment of Reddit and the internet that power hungry individuals, groups and organizations feel the need to subvert individuals and shut down areas of balanced discussion in order to create echo-chambers of their idealism.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, yeah, that is actually the exact strategy employed by shill organizations: user fatigue. They break the rules and run networks of alternates posting low-effort shit that takes effort to combat. They hardly expect to change the minds of the people they are debating with, they just want to keep wearing them down until they eventually get too tired of it and move on. Then they bring in more shills, and more shills, until it gets to the point that newcomers have no idea that it&#39;s mostly just shills left spreading talking points. The talking points don&#39;t even have to be very good. They play a numbers game and it is sadly very effective.  </p>

<p>In my opinion, David Brock and all of his shills should be arrested and charged with seditious conspiracy to overthrow the government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I️ mean, it seems pretty obvious to me that something very inorganic happened to that sub during the election. It has always leaned heavily left, but there were occasionally articles that made it to the top that were unfavorable for Democrats or favorable to Republicans or libertarians. You also used to be able to go there and actually debate rather than just get mobbed and downvoted into oblivion instantaneously. Now anything remotely unfavorable is deleted and not allowed to fend for itself in the wild, often auto downvoted as well. Posts that break the rules in favor of the Democrat narrative are allowed to stay up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No as in Hillary did not win the popular vote? And this is because voter fraud? I really haven&#39;t read anything that strongly supports that, could you link an article or two? </p>

<p>Trump won the electoral college without winning the popular vote. This is not a unique event, this has happened before: George W. Bush, John Q. Adams, and a couple others. This happens, the U.S. government is structured in a way where the popular vote does not guarantee the election of a candidate, the electoral college does. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how losing the popular election necessarily means voter fraud. Could you explain?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think people just don’t pay attention to history, even recent history. A candidate winning the electoral college and losing be popular vote has happened before, multiple times. This happened at the beginning of the country’s history and even recently with Gore v Bush. In those examples no one claimed fraud or conspiracy. </p>

<p>I don’t believe Americans are becoming dumber, I believe they are just ignorant. Ignorance is not stupidity. It’s the lack of knowledge.  It’s okay to be ignorant because you really can’t know any better. Willful ignorance is another thing however. </p>

<p>Two people, Pat and Loren, have crash landed their airplane in a remote location. No one is injured, and both are physically and mentally fit. They decide to vote between two of their best options. </p>

<p>Option A: Stay at the location of the crash and wait for rescue</p>

<p>Option B: Attempt a self-rescue by hiking out</p>

<p>Pat votes to leave, Loren votes to stay.</p>

<p>Who is the majority in this scenario?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My bad for my apparent mental illness, but I don’t quite understand your analogy. Are you saying oversimplifying things leads no where? I don’t quite understand how over simplifying a situation leads you to believe I’m mentally insane, it seems more of an unprovoked attack. I don’t think I said anything to deliberately attack you. </p>

<p>Additionally you are simplifying it to a 50% to 50% vote, but that is not the case in the popular election. Even in a 51%/49% split, the 51% is the majority, that is how math works. Millions of people voted for their desired candidate and a majority of people voted for more for another. </p>

<p>To my understanding Clinton won the popular vote with 48% and Trump only got 46% of the popular votes. That is a bit of a margin and here is source to back it up. <a href="https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2016/2016presgeresults.pdf">https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2016/2016presgeresults.pdf</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really depends on which state you live in, but as a whole popular votes don’t determine the election. We have some what of an idea because the government publishes the voter data from each state. Although it is possible that states lied when they submitted their data, what would that bring to the country? The electoral college determines the winner, so even if one party won a significant amount of votes it wouldn’t lead anywhere. Nothing happened in 2000 in The Bush election and nothing came from the 2016 election. There is no apparent benefit to having a candidate win the popular vote if nothing would come out of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, right, that&#39;s exactly my point. The popular vote is irrelevant for two reasons: it doesn&#39;t determine the winner and it is not even accurately measured (because it doesn&#39;t determine the winner). The states only count every vote if it&#39;s really close within the state. Otherwise, they stop when a winner is guaranteed based on the number of uncounted votes. Why waste money going through the process when it means nothing? </p>

<p>Oh no I agree with you there. The a democratic primary was rigged to have Clinton win, which is a deplorable act and a huge stain on our democracy and the Democratic Party. I believe courts found it completely legal to rig the system in that way, and as horrible as it is she was not caught with anything. Does she deserve to be locked up? That’s debatable, but there is a slim chance  her ever holding office again. However she is not in office and I believe there are bigger fish to fry other than a former presidential candidate   </p>

<p>You are right about the corruption part, it’s so engraved in our lives we feel as if we can do nothing about it. The real problem with the corruption is that a majority of it is legal. Bribery? No it’s called lobbying and donations. Changing voting lines to keep you in power? Gerrymandering. Both completely legal. This leads to the powerlessness that many Americans feel. These are real issues that the media does not cover. I’d rather not grasp at ideas that are possible, I like to discuss problems that tangible and part of our society that no one addresses. That leads to the big question: What can we do about it? </p>

<p>In 2017 &quot;facts&quot; / truths are hard to come by. You can always question sources, and most often encounter skewed interpretations formed from accessing filtered media, since you and me, we are not there in person as some kind of omnipotent force witnessing what goes on - and neither is anyone else. So how can we be so sure of things? </p>

<p>I agree with everything you said. You make the fine point - this corruption is entrenched within the bureaucracy, the examples you give show how corruption is legitimized, normalized, so nothing can be done about it, flying in the face of honesty and morality. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That leads to the big question: What can we do about it? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thats too much for me to begin to answer. I am somewhat pessimistic. I think the system we inhabit enables a particular kind of human to flourish - sociopaths and psychopaths - who naturally tend to assume, crave and become addicted to positions of power, to climb the ladder, engaging in machiavellian strategy to sustain themselves, to play the game and try to win. <a href="http://www.pathocracy.net/">Pathocracy</a> is an interesting source giving you a little insight into the psyche of our rulers through their own words. All we can do is become more aware, to change the world around us by shining our light, by choosing love over fear. </p>

<p>57.6 million people voted in the 2016 primaries.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the country didn&#39;t vote for ANYONE, let alone Trump. How is it delusional to point that out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>thats correct. however thats not the statement that you&#39;re calling &quot;delusional&quot;.</p>

<p>your saying it&#39;s delusional that half of america didn&#39;t vote for trump.</p>

<p>58 million. (presumably you think 10 million of those were illegal? 48 million voters then)</p>

<p>so you&#39;re saying its delusional to believe that that 48 million is less that half of the american voting age populace.</p>

<p>and then you wonder why no one takes you seriously outside your safe spaces and echo chambers.</p>

<p>not once is clinton mentioned in your post where you copy-paste the word &quot;delusional&quot; half a dozen times.. which was refreshing, tbh, given how shes your main talking point these days, and given that most of you can&#39;t make it more than a sentence and a half without screaming &quot;buttery males reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee seth rich&quot; etc</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>no see, you&#39;re missing the relevant syntax completely.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>my equivalent statement &quot;the sky is blue&quot; in this case correlates with &quot; the sky is blue&quot;, not &quot;the sky is transparent&quot;. </p>

<p>YOU&#39;RE the one taking the position that the statement is false (this is delusional), not me.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>my syntax goes: </p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>the sky is blue</em> </p>

<p>thats correct!</p>

<p><em>the sky IS blue.</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p>or, in this case:</p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>the majority of americans didn&#39;t vote for donald trump</em> </p>

<p>thats correct! </p>

<p><em>the majority of americans DIDN&#39;T vote for donald trump</em>.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>on the other hand, you&#39;re the one taking the position that:</p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>the majority of americans didn&#39;t vote for donald trump</em>... </p>

<p>&quot;this is delusional&quot; (your words). </p>

<p>...?</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>now i&#39;m not going to write in here that you think the majority of americans DID vote for donald trump...</p>

<p>..because i don&#39;t think you really believe that. not really. mostly because its a fucking ludicrous statement that you gently masturbate into night after night until one day you see in in the cold light of morning covered in semen. a moldy, rotting, malodorous mass that you shove under your bed in embarrassment... </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>... so we&#39;ll just write here: </p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>the sky is transparent</em> </p>

<p>as a place holder.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>anyway, glad i could help! peace out my dude :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is undeniable that bots are heavily at work within <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. (the_donald as well) You can easily determine this by going to that subreddit after any major issue breaks that makes the left look bad and sort by new. The amount of repeated spam posts that try to climb to the top to flood out a story is honestly very interesting to watch happen live. </p>

<p>I can say that as most of my non-specific browsing is done on /all/ I have noticed a large decrease in low-sub count subs getting front page hits from synthetic bot volume. So Reddit&#39;s new anti-bot measures must be working in some areas. </p>

<p>You can also determine this by using a big-data aggregate like sweettails to compare the average poster in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> with other subs. It is almost exclusively liberal progressive people posting there. The only way to survive with any sort of counter thought is when a topic reaches an audience that facilitates enough common ground to allow reason to float to the top.</p>

<p>That is very rare. But I still browse it as I believe it is important to see what propaganda is being pushed, regardless of the truth. To try and rationalize it like you have is very disingenuous. Is it a conspiracy? No. Can it be explained logically? Yes. Does your point address that logic? Not really.</p>

<p>Trump is a direct threat to our Republic.  He&#39;s been violating the Constitution from day 1.  We also keep finding out his campaign and cabinet had a bunch of meetings with Russian officials prior to the election and lied under oath or failed to disclose those meetings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That happens when you look in the mirror.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our President has curtailed the 1st amendment for press organizations covering the white house.</p>

<p>He&#39;s violated the 4th, 10th and 14th amendment in his immigration raids and through threats to withhold federal money if states dont subject themselves to the will of the federal government.  He&#39;s conducting many of these raids without warrants and denying the detainees access to lawyers in violation of the 14th amendment or making the names of detainees public.</p>

<p>He threatens nuclear war over Twitter.  His EPA administrator now only accepts scientific papers written by the companies he&#39;s supposed to regulate.  He gave China carte blanche in the South China Sea, he turned a blind eye to extrajudicial murder and human rights violations by Duterte.  He&#39;s attacked the credibility of both NATO and the UN, the two primary organizations that help the US project power across the world.  He&#39;s tried to make an end run around sanctions on Russia, because he and his cabinet have business interests with Russia, including our Secretary of State who was the former CEO of Exxon that signed a $500B deal with Gazprom back in 2012.  Cabinet members like Betsy DeVos are selected not for their qualifications, but for the size of their donations to the RNC.</p>

<p>Up and down this administration is by far the most corrupt ever seen.  And now we have direct evidence they lied and committed perjury under oath about their dealings with a foreign enemy.</p>

<p>The MSM attacks Trump on anything except his foreign policy, which is by far the most disturbing about him</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The BBC here in the UK has shows on its news channel - such as Outside Source and Beyond 100 Days - that make fun of Trump&#39;s foreign policy every evening. In fact, Beyond 100 Days (which was originally called 100 Days and followed Trump&#39;s first 100 days in office) laughed at his assumption that he should get a handwritten thank you letter from basketball stars, rather than focusing on important topics such as foreign policy.</p>

<p>Anyway, it&#39;s weird but then not too different to a lot of conspiracy boards over the years making up BS about Obama because for some reason, most theorists were Republican-supporting, Obama-hating, backwards-thinking people who hated the idea of having affordable healthcare and constantly assumed Obama was &quot;trying to take our guns&quot; every time someone went on a killing spre due to America&#39;s gun laws being wacky.</p>

<p>in fact, everyones paycheck should be in drugs, and that should be our new currency. coke, heroin, marijunana etc will each be assigned value per weight, and used in the place of currency for all sales and taxes.</p>

<p>this way, everyone can always be effectively enslaved. as long as guvment provides the fix they keep sucking its dick. everyone is happy who doesnt want drugs and slavery, and they outnumber everyone else.</p>

<p>soon we can erect statues in the guv&#39;ment crackhouses of our glorious political leaders and pray to them every day for our drug rations -- which by this point the children in the schools will be addicted and need them to function too -- and everyone will praise satan and call him god.</p>

<p>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong but Hillary won the popular vote and Trump won the electoral college right? So it wouldn&#39;t be that hard of a stretch to say that a majority of the country did not vote for Trump even if it is 51% Clinton, 49% Trump?</p>

<p>Same with the majority disapproving. Take one look at his abysmal approval ratings.</p>

<p>In addition, you only consider it circlejerking because it&#39;s not being done on your &quot;side.&quot; The main Trump sub on this site is a literal all-day circlejerk safe space.</p>

<p>OPs point was that <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is paid propaganda because it is very liberal. <a href="/u/SlimLovin">/u/SlimLovin</a> &#39;s point was that it is very liberal because Reddit consists of mostly liberal users. The fact that you believe they have no life experience does not in any way detract from that point.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Also, why is it delusional that the majority of the country disapproves of Trump? Even the most right-leaning polls have him at -15 to -20. Are you saying FOX news fakes polls to make it seem like Trump is doing worse than he is?</p>

A candidate winning the electoral college and losing be popular vote has happened before, multiple times. This happened at the beginning of the country’s history and even recently with Gore v Bush.

<p>I don’t believe Americans are becoming dumber, I believe they are just ignorant. Ignorance is not stupidity. It’s the lack of knowledge.  It’s okay to be ignorant because you really can’t know any better. Willful ignorance is another thing however. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Zionism has little to do with Judaism.  Many Israelis are &quot;secular Jews&quot;.  Wtf does that even mean?  You want the benefits of being in the club but you don&#39;t want to follow the rules?</p>

<p>Notice there are also Christian zionists.  Atheist Zionist.  Secular Zionist. Not just Jews. In fact, from what I have seen, almost all Orthodox Jews living outside Israel vehemently oppose the zion movement for going against scripture.  Supposedly the state of Israel isn&#39;t prophesied to exist until the messiah comes.   Perhaps Rothschild believes that he is the messiah?</p>

<p>As for their alleged agenda: tikkun olam!  Repairing the world!  Repairing it by creating their own manifest destiny against the ME.  By taking all the oil from underneath surrounding countries.  To carry sway in foreign governments and cultures.   To be the PC police for the world, while hypocritically being ran by a supremacist regime behind Netanyahu.</p>

<p>They are a nationalistic aggressive supremacist state who has used the tragedy of the holocaust along with select Zionist families manipulating markets and currency as leverage to essentially do anything they want.  </p>

<p>They have the means, they control the money.  If you criticize Israel, or someone who is Jewish on the world-power stage, you are labeled an antisemite.</p>
