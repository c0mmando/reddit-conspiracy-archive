       No one has gotten /pol spinning the hamster wheel in a while quite like Mister Q.
      </p>
      <p>
       For those of you who don't know...Q means Q level security clearance. Near-Presidential level. Meaning, Q level clearance could have access to the nuclear codes, that's how high up it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few possibilities...
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Everything is a PSYOP? CIA runs NK?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump was chosen? Election wasn't real? Is that really surprising. Q seems Pro-Trump which only points to alt-right trolling via larping.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We're living in the matrix controlled by some celestially connected beings in an alternative universe? VOTL stuff
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         UFO's/aliens happen to be real?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Time travel? Where's McFly these days...keep in mind...Biff was based off Trump.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Q seems to go big on the science fiction, as this will always drum up the conspiracy crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is a PsyoP?

       Something about the missing submarine off the coast of Argentina has given Q a tiny bit of credibility, since "Hunt for Red October" was in the crumbs, as Q called it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this year AMC will be playing the Godfather movies on the 23rd &amp; 24th. "Godfather III" is another crumb.

       Oh just stop.  That's bullshit.  All of these larpers are vague so that when something remotely mentioned happens, it can seem like they knew in advance.  Use some fucking logic for a second.

       And inevitably when something does happen (probably related to Mueller's investigation), watch how fast the "Q was right all along!" posts flood the sub. Even though they claim something big literally every week.

       I can see how you're disappointed because the information you posted isn't close to anything Q posted aside from "podesta indictment" (which might have already happened, most are still sealed) and HUMA being name dropped, but that might have been a reference to the Harvard group and Obama.

       How do you know their arrests haven't already happen?  Do you actually believe powerful people like that would get arrested and sit in jail for hours or days? People of that elite status would just have their lawyers discretely arrange their self-surrender in a manner of which would be kept tightly sealed and off the media's radar and barely set foot in a police department if at all. They live above the law and receive police privileges not known to us normies.  The mainstream media also works for them, not against them, so they would likely do everything to keep it covered up while distracting the masses with more of their BS fake news distractions.

       Let's examine this list first:
      </p>
      <pre><code>&gt;Everything is a PSYOP? CIA runs NK?
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Negative. North Korea 'NK' is a 'rouge state' by nature of its economics, and not so much its politics. It is not run by 'Kim', so much as it is operated by a cabal of military generals who knew Kim's father, and the financing access they have to China and Russia. the money flows from China and Russia, for black-ops and illicit finance.
      </p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He was certainly not 'chosen'. He was sworn in by merit of electoral college structure. This was not a populist win, which would be a 'media' driven information program leading to popular-vote.

       What? NO.

      <p>
       The holographic universe theory is in relation to information storage and low-energy elicitation, and not the structural nature of the universe. This is not the matrix, unless the way you think is the matrix, because our understanding of 'physics' is fundamentally narrow-minded.

       Time travel is not possible. Yet, Seeing through time is possible. This is due to the nature of photon-states and residual forms of radiation imprinting upon an aspect of metrical 'space-time'.

       It shows how wantonly foolish some people are, and how determined and willing others are to play with codes for fun. I was drinking on a long-night when I played. I also watched the news and reply to see how easily people were ping and primed - myself included in the degree of complexity of some of these puzzles - in that we all want to know the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       WE are constantly promised truth. When we see it, then we will know. Until then, the implications are, "we are constantly offered truth for our faith".

       Every Great leader {some 'super-man'}, is the 'mellenialistic-philosophy' creation of someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       This does not mean he is not in league with people. Yet, it does also not mean he is part of a grand-conspiracy to overthrow a system that is already being shown as a grand-conspiracy to propagandize the nation into voting one way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact Hillary wrote a book showing her faults in electoral strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump use technology not regulated by the MSM to reach people who statistically now get their media from social outlets [friends] and have always psychologically trusted [peers] over news in all studies related to the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact trump also promised everything to everyone, geographically, affected the perception of everyone in some unique way, to corner their particular 'buying-strategy'. Their 'hot-button' issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, your context: Imagine having all the information available to examine 'how' something can happen, but assuming its some other applicable genius pulling your strings.  .  . Occam's Razor is how conspiracy theories gain validity and through deduction and evidence, proof.

       In this regard, your conclusion is not correct, in matter of determining truth probability. Yet, this does not mean your assessment is not theoretically necessary to assume.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that assumption, you have an attitude - some philosophy - yet no more mathematically produced processes in models, you actually have no answers to the material structure of the relative universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yes, our understanding is 'so flawed', as we continually expect the possibility of traveling at/beyond light speed, without consideration to the physiology and capacity of mechanical environment to protect [that life form] from destruction - ASPECTS of science and models we do have a greater understanding of, as we have greater access to observation and experimentation to know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The means to travel worlds is not in speeds. The only aspect that will come of great-engines is in point-defense and interceptors. Everything else is inefficient in tran-system travel [where interacting with greater causes interrupts primitive colonization at every case].

       Q clearance is essentially the same as a TS (both considered a T5). The difference being is that Q's are processed via DOE, whereas TS is processed through DSS.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Q clearance in general has greater access that
       <em>
        may
       </em>
       include SNM, etc. But if you are looking to have "codes" then they would be under a TS/SCI or SAP (DoD), not a Department of Energy clearance.
