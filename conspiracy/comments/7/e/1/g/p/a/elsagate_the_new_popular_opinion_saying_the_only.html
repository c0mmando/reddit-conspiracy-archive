       Anyone noticing this line being trotted out and mass upvoted? Is this the consensus opinion now, or are there shills &amp; bots trying to slide this explanation, which in effect allows either normalization of such content or allowing the perpetrators to escape from punishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       To come out and say outright there is no conspiracy to harm children, no nefarious purpose to somehow condition kids or cause trauma, is very suspicious to me, and as I say, I am seeing this become popular opinion here

       It could easily be true that the point is to make money. The point of most things is to make money.  However, it doesn't mean that it must be normalized or that people "escape punishment" if they're doing something illegal.

       Yes, they like making money, but it is unlikely that the sole purpose is to make money. Why does there have to be only one motive? If that is the case, then you can make money without that particular type of content - like anal injections, drinking out of toilets, decapitations with the sound of babies crying etc. etc. Kids don't go seeking this shit out. Many kids who are being traumatized by this shit aren't even old enough to read or write, they are given the iPad or phone as a way to keep them quiet and they just watch and click through. These videos are keyworded and tagged to appear alongside innocent content, then they are autoplayed alongside that innocent content.
      </p>

       But of course, this kind of explanation is saying "There is no conspiracy", in effect this is disregarding the trauma and conditioning that result from watching these videos. This is a grey area for legality and cases such as this will spark net-neutrality discussions. What is needed, is common sense to say these videos should not be allowed on Youtube Kids and they must be better moderated, if it cannot provide this safeguard then Youtube Kids must cease its operation.

       Why is this being downvoted? I've definitely seen people arguing this recently. The line is that the videos don't have any intention behind them other than to make money. These videos are just filled with what kids seem to click on and continue watching, so the makers get loads of money from youtube advertising on their videos. Others have argued that algorithms are behind it, and these algorithms create videos from whatever bits seem to get lots of attention on YouTube, but they accidentally draw scenes from spoof and parody videos that aren't meant for kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry but that idea is patently bullshit. Most of the videos are clearly not mish mashes of different videos, and why the fuck would kids be particularly drawn to people urinating on each other, or child abuse? Also, how could an algorithm be that smart? It would have to recognise when scenes begin and end, costumes, and styles to create videos anything like the ones that actually exist. It's always amazing when people will invent the most absurd shit in order to maintain their image of themselves being rational.

       Funny because your reply applies more to OPs idea of the intent behind these videos. There's no evidence that they are "farming for children" and thats a much more far fetched idea than a money motive.

       Most invocations of Occam's Razor on this website don't amount to much more than 'This is the simplest explanation because I think it is'. Tom Cruise would call such people 'glib', I am sure of it.

       I noticed it too...which is why I posted this awhile back:
       <br/>
       I don't understand how people can say its "just for views" or an "algorithm exploit" to get more ad revenue. It's obviously not about that or the subjects wouldn't be so dark. If it was about loading up on money through ads/views they wouldn't have to make the videos about needles, being kidnapped, cutting heads open, etc...these videos are made to brainwash kids unknowingly but also for fucked up parents to enforce upon their kids. Just like "finger family" which is most likely used by parents to teach their kids "how to be abused". Its sick.

         All I'm doing is countering all the people who think this is some kind of deep conspiracy involving the illuminati, the NFL and the saucer people. There is a lot of people going way off the deep and when this shit is quite simple to explain. It's just dudes trying to make a buck off kids watching youtube videos. (well, ...make that buck using rather sophisticated computer algorithms and a ton fraudulent activity).
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        The one thing here though, maybe this shit isn't as simple as you think it is. You understand the mechanics in the way they have been able to profit from this. But in order to profit they would have to make it more popular. So through clever use of SEO/keywords/bots and a host of other black hat techniques they gamed the algorithims to get them popular. But as a consequence of this, these videos are placed alongside more innocent content autoplayed/recommended.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, the wider point I want to make is that these videos didn't have to be so disturbing in nature.. they could game the system with more innocent content if they wanted to, since the content doesn't matter so much when your gaming the system. You said it yourself "Kids--they'll binge watch anything you put in front of them." That is where you have to begin questioning the motives of those who make the content, in order to desensitize, traumatize and disturb children. I cannot accept an argument that stipulates "they did it because they weren't thinking about it", no, I think there was real malice involved. I don't want to repeat the disturbing imagery that is contained within these videos, you already know most of it, and thought has been put into making those videos.

       I think the "they're only in it for the money" stuff also comes from people who instinctively shy away from sinister conspiracies.

       Of course these videos are not seen exclusively by people in the USA but to me it is not out of the question that some rivals to the USA might be interested in doing damage to American society. I think it is difficult for any person to see how much effect the modern internet can have on society.

       Just to further enhance yoour point, theres a really common song thats reused for views because kids love it called "daddy finger or family fingers" which is really innocent and is usually accompanied by cute relative to holiday or kids theme cartoons or puppets. Ive seen a massive amount of them due to my niece being obsessed with song. There are tons of innicent friendly content like that. Elsagate is not this at all. The videos are just outright creepy with no innocent parts at all.

       It's more frightening if it isn't purposeful. If it's all just generated by algorithmic routines, then these videos, in my mind, are even more disturbing, and does not bode well for future for all of us. The idea that there is no intent at all, due to computers being computers, is hugely dystopian.

       They're ignoring the MKUltra symbolism and themes. They're ignoring entirely the basic principles of trauma, ritual abuse, and mind control, as those are the true dangers and motives. Money is just a cover.

       They're STILL calling it "Elsagate" even after countless threads and comments have specifically said to STOP doing that. It devalues the entire topic to normies.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALSO, they are fallaciously associating (lumping together), the weird children's videos/animations with the homemade "webcam video from" videos all over youtube - which have far worse rammifications. They are NOT the same.

       One guy tried to say the constant references to butt injections were based on a toddlers sense of humor and fear.

       I'm confident that anyone who watches the videos will be perturbed. The recurring and often violent themes are straight spooky as well as the allusions to prostitution and such.

       Could anyone explain the significance of the symbolism in these elsagate videos? Like, why are the bright primary colors used so heavily? Everyone screams "mind control!", but I haven't seen an explanation behind the needles/scat/ color coding.

       Some people made connections between the characters and colors from the Elsagate videos to the MKULTRA videos found earlier. I think that's it, but if you ask me, those MKULTRA videos seem like a LARP (youtube tags, easily decoded, very straightforward, unlisted videos discovered by 4chan).

       If you type random letters into a thai keyboard, then post that thai letters into google translate, it will make words and phrases that sometimes seem to make sense. There are a bunch of bot accounts that view and comment on certain videos to inflate the views and create ad revenue. They write unique comments to try to disguise the fact they are bots somehow from youtube's counter-measures, so there are comments with random strings of letters. If you process these through thai keyboard and google translate sometimes there are some creepy results, so people think it is a code.

       Has it been proven that the messages are in fact coded messages that can be decoded? It seems more likely that they're bots just posting gibberish for the sake of the algorithm. I'm not sure how the algorithm works but maybe having activity in the comments helps with it.

       If you go over to r/elsagate you'll see what OP means. The sub is filled with idiots who use the word conspiracy only in a negative context and think that you're a tinfoil nutcase if you dont ageee with their insane "child mashing" comment theory or that the videos are just a computer algorithim gone wrong.

       I didn't even write about YT comments, its more of a discussion on the intentions of those who are creating this content. I have messaged the mods to ask why it has been hidden, I wouldn't want to necessarily jump and say that the mod team is compromised, but it does seem strange.

       That word "conspiracy" is used to shut down critical thinkers. We're not allowed to question anything, just accept things as they are. I hate to see people come to the Conspiracy subreddit who try to get us to shut up by using tinfoil hat etc. or convince us something is normal when obviously it's not.

       Intentional or otherwise (I would argue it would be hard to dismiss this as unintentional) this content is being marketed to young children and features deeply inappropriate content that I would argue is desensitizing our children, and YouTube just allows it despite militantly revoking monitization and even content from numerous sources that simply deviate from their agenda. It is a conspiracy, no way around it.

       Yes, the deal is that even if we forget about "intent" for a second, it is clear that some kids are being traumatized, conditioned in a bad way, desensitized etc, as a result of watching this content. I think it is healthy to question the nefarious intentions of i) particular groups or individuals who have created this content in the first place and ii) the role of Youtube in failing to safeguard children from this content. Think about the thousands upon thousands of reports that these videos receive, think of all the comments on these videos that talk about how fucked up it is - now why are these videos still up? Why does Youtube take no action? Why are they still monetized? It either indictates gross negligence, or perhaps something more sinister. I don't believe a company as rich a Youtube/Google who issue DCMA notices at will and take down copyrighted content within minutes are having issues with moderating this stuff!

       I only subbed here recently but I’m starting to wonder what the age demographic of this sub is...  you guys need to apply more critical thinking to this.  I’ve been using YouTube since it started and trends always sparked copycats.  It happened when the only incentive was views and once money started to get involved it became way more common.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Having multiple channels increases your revenue.  This is no secret, and every YouTuber knows this. 
If your audience is kids you can easily get away reposting the same concept over and over.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If you have ever used an animation software you’d know that it would be easier to slightly alter the same project file to create multiple animations rather than starting a new project for every animation.  This would explain why so many of them are so similar.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As for the live action content it’s really the same deal.  What’s the point of spending more money on costumes and props when the ones you’re already using gets you more than enough revenue.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As for the MK ultra learn colours thing...  that shit is weird but are you seriously going to believe everything a 4chan post tells you? Fucking 4chan?  Those unlisted videos are heavily edited and seem deliberately ominous.  And then the coded videos can be deciphered with a simple website.  Like come on people use your head.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       I think the people that make this content are fucking weird and it doesn’t belong on the kids app but do you honestly believe former YouTube pranksters are involved in some huge conspiracy?  They are sluts for ad revenue and these people know how to manipulate YouTube to get lots of it.
       <br/>
       So before you call me a shill maybe try to realize how easily you bought into this conspiracy and try to see the irony in you using that statement.

       Whether or not their intentions are to make money, harm children or both, in the end there is no doubt this money making scheme plays a role in a conspiracy against children. They definitely know their role in child exploitation, to what lengths (MK ultra seem far fetch and isn't a popular topic) are they aware of is what we should  be concerned about. It not

       So your suggestion is that violence, needles, screaming, and gore are all more appealing story techniques to children than your average 'fluffy and harmless' kids television show?

       These vids are not purely for revenue. There would be no good reason to use the content they do. This person questions our age but I would question has he got kids? I was horrified the first time my daughter found one of these videos. They are horrific.

       Fluffy and harmless bored the hell out of he as a kid. Young teenagers and preteens like 'edgy' content such as this. Subverting the 'fully and harmless' characters they grew up with could be seen a rite of passages.

       I have seen some fragments of them in news reports, but I don't particularly want to watch a whole video. My point was, however, that I could clearly remember my own period as a preteen; some of the conversations I had with my friends would make me blush if I had them today. Kids on the precibus of puberty will seek out sexually subversive content. It's part of growing up imo.

        If you have ever used an animation software you’d know that it would be easier to slightly alter the same project file to create multiple animations rather than starting a new project for every animation. This would explain why so many of them are so similar.

       You are failing to realize there are more fucked up kid video's out there besides the small sub-category of frozen elsa + random character.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the foreign language video's are extremely sexualized. Prime example in the "Needle in the butt" video. A normal person see's it as parents giving their daughter insulin in the buttocks muscle or gluteus maximus. Of course a "playful struggle" was necessary before this medical procedure. He needed to rip the covers away from her.
      </p>
      <p>
       A pervert see's a rape fantasy though. A struggle to pull the girl from under the covers, she then ends up with her bare back shown to the camera over the dad's knee. It is blurred but just barely.
      </p>
      <p>
       She is screaming her lungs out and he administers the shot. A pervert sees a young girl who struggled is screaming with her pants down and a very forceful stab of a syringe... you get the psychology.
      </p>
      <p>
       The color codes are in too many videos across too many different genres to just be a coincidence. Toy channels and "bad kid channels", young pre-teen girl vlogs. The whole superhero, disney, famous cartoon character videos, and then there's the whole fucked up weird video's with hypnotizing frequencies that have a woman's voice going "Blue, The color blue. Your trigger is Elsa" "Red, your trigger is spiderman." etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be easy enough if things like suicide, abortion, syringes plus drugs, rape, torture, bondage or restraining people against their will. Also there's a fixation of pooping, peeing, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Incoming rant:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Pedophiles are simple creatures. Almost drawn around the world by their desires in their pants. Barely intelligent enough to socialize because of how backwards and intense their feelings of perversion are. Like a no fap challenge times 1000. You could probably throw a diaper into a group of them and watch them tear each other apart to sniff it and wear it on their face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the ultra-smart psychotic ones. Usually at the top of the food chain opertional wise, or protected heavily as they are probably a procurer of children and supply the much coveted victim. Their life is dedicated to their degeneracy. Every waking moment working towards normalizing pedophilia and working towards protecting those of like minds.. Other humans mean nothing to them, a true sociopath in every way.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the types of people trying to downplay the significance of how close some of these sick twisted legitimate CP videos are from the money making scheme videos. Yes there is profit incentive, but we aren't really revolted and sickened to the core by those. It's the ones with brainwashing techniques mixed in with children being coached to be in provocative sexual positions in skimpy revealing clothes, or sometimes it is a pool or beach "vlog" where they are naked! DISGUSTING!

       And parents depend on YouTube to filter the content their kids see. Parents don't monitor YouTube because they assume that the content is filtered to meet the appropriate standards. I would be interested to see how many of these videos are viewed on tablets and such that kids regularly use or even under parental filters. Even if parents did check the history nothing would look fishy. Parents just need to be more aware of the content their children come across.

       Why would the subject matter need to be dark and sexual in nature to fucking make money? The characters would make money if you had them baking cookies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's obvious fucking child grooming/conditioning and sending filth into the subconscious of children literally by the millions. I'm sick of witnessing the mental fucking gymnastics of idiots telling me a zebra is actually a horse in a referee shit

       I think MOST of the videos are about making money abusing the tendency of children to repeatedly view the same videos. I also believe that most of the "disturbing" stuff in these videos is probably a way for the bored asian sweatshop workers making them to keep themselves amused.

       There is genuinely weird shit in some of the elsagate videos, though

       But as someone said earlier, why does the subject have to be dark and sexual in nature to make money? The characters would make money if you had them baking cookies. Infact, these aren't the most popular kids videos at all, there is a larger amount of more popular innocent content out there, but these disturbing videos are buried amongst them and through clever use of SEO. They use keywords and tags that are popular, they have gained in popularity as they have gamed the Youtube algorithim system to put them alongside innocent content, and onto the 'autoplay'/recommended system. What isn't made clear, is why a monolith with the riches of Youtube/Google can not adequately moderate this content, why these videos are still online despite the thousands of reports from concerned people, the thousands of comments stating "wtf is this horrific shit". Don't say "they are overwhelmed", given the thousands of reports, the thousands of comments, the news articles and the people raising awareness of this.. given that Youtube routinely deletes other copyrighted, or violent, or politically incorrect content within minutes, sometimes days, sometimes weeks, when it suits them. This has been going much longer than a few weeks. It is simply being allowed to continue.

       If the videos were just about making money from children clicking on "Elsa and Spiderman" they could do that just fine without all the weird perverted shit.  There's definitely something very strange afoot.

       If the child harm was unintentional, why have the creepy, psychologically distressing themes? If you were just trying to make money off of optimizing videos for the YouTube algorithm, wouldn't it make more sense to keep videos within harmless and inconspicuous bounds? I can't imagine the horrible crap in these videos adds an extra layer of optimization for monetization of the videos.

       The thing that indicates to me that there is some kind of conspiarcy afoot here is that the IP holders of characters like Elsa and Spiderman etc are not shutting it down, when they will shut down people for using their characters for relatively benign things. yet they are letting people make millions of dollars from using their characters in disturbing videos involving child abuse, kids drinking, Elsa in sexual positions, scat fetish stuff etc? It makes no sense, unless they are in on it or making money from it themselves. There's a reason these videos have not yet been shut down, and it's not just 'oops' or 'our algorithms didn't work' or 'we didn't know.'

       They already were able to brainwash and hyper sexualise children through tv, they now do the same on YouTube to reach more kids. I remember being brainwashed by Disney and Nickelodeon shows, I had a lot to unlearn and I got in very dangerous situations as a direct result. Feminism brainwashed the concious brain, tv and now certain YouTube videos brainwash the sun conscious.

       It is all about layers of intent and plausible deniability.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was thinking last night about how he idea of it being for ad money is stupid since it is clear that it is 90% bots.  Considering these would be pulling in millions, someone is going to stop paying along the chain since they are being exploited.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        however
       </strong>
       it is an ideal way to launder money.  The bots and ad revenue is all just washing dirty money.
       <em>
        Way
       </em>
       smarter than gambling or old school bullshit, and Bitcoin is unpredictable enough to make many wary of using it.  But click ad revenues from bots!?  Perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it came about in court, this is a large enough and believable enough crime that it could stop
       <em>
        right there
       </em>
       and some people be thrown under the bus for it and that would satisfy the public.  This lets the deeper crime be covered by it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is the child abuse side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it intentionally related?  I must at least entertain the idea that pedos who troll kid videos to try and exploit them would naturally come to these.  Maybe they saw all the bots making wierd comments and thought “Wow!  Perfect cover!”  Maybe this is all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe it is
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       related, and purposeful.
      </p>

       What about the possibility of copy cats who are affiliated with pedos? Isn't that a possibility? Seeing as there's already a mass network of these channels producing similar content (layers of child exploitative type videos ranging from cartoons to real life), the comment section itself being under investigated as a communication device. It censorship to dismiss questions regarding the concerns of our children and the consequences they may face when they grow up. The peddling of deeper conspiracies such as a psy op may be too much for a newcomer.

       What exactly are you referring to? If it's the Elsa and Spider-Man videos, then my only experience with them was that H3H3 video that was on the front page recently. That guy was a YouTuber  who switched formats to Elsa videos, leaving behind a less profitable group of fans.
      </p>
      <p>
       That suggests to me that it's primarily a profit motive that happens to harm children. Not that intent really matters.

       YouTube has become flooded with kids videos featuring Elsa and Spiderman (and various other characters). They're directed specifically at kids (toddlers or babies).
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of these appear to be generated autonomously by some sort of computer script. The characters are in weird, random, and sometimes nightmare-inducing scenarios. For example baby spiderman and baby elsa get drunk while happy kids music and baby giggling plays in the background, then spiderman falls down and smashes the beer bottle on his head and blood spurts out everywhere and children screaming plays in the background. And that's fairly tame compared to some of them. And then this gets copied and pasted across different characters (same exact scenario with Mickey and Minnie, Paw Patrol, etc.). And these videos have millions of views, likely because kids are watching YouTube on auto-play.

       I work in multimedia and the idea that these often times very sophisticated and intricately animated 3D videos, sometimes lasting longer than 20 minutes and having not only a coherent "plot line" but also post-production, SFX, score editing and voiceovers... the idea these are being generated automatically is one of the stupidest fucking things I've ever heard and is either a straight up knowing lie, or the thoughts of someone who knows absolutely nothing about technology or media production.

       Great post. I keep hearing this argument too. I'm very interested to know how these videos are made by bots, if that is the case. What methods are used, what software, how does this software create animated content via keywords? Where can we see evidence of these videos being made in this way? I might start a new post to ask How?

       Neither of those are even close to anything like auto-generating original, 10+ minute long 3D animations with original animation assets, coherent character interactions, plotlines, cinematography, post production like matched FX, synced, edited scoring, and

       I’m certainly not saying it’s 100% synthetic content. I think it’s very plausible the 8M dataset and ML techniques could be manipulating “reccomended” videos based on extracted features of another. The absurd number of views would also be consistent with model training. Key frame image features seem to have continuity to some extent. The curators behind this content are certainly deplorable.I don’t know  truth. I don’t want to. Whatever it is it’s bad. I’m only making a connection based on experience with machine learning.

       Like What? Joker bashing lightning McQueen with a mallet looks like joker bashing spider man over the head with a mallet? Ok? Integrating said animations into a coherent form is not something that can be done via machine learning. That's not even mentioning all the other stuff I pointed out that basically guarantees there is a crew putting man hours into these.

       Yes. For example features are extracted from video’s visual, audio, tag and title data. A new feature appears in association with previously learned features with high correlation. The new feature is eventually learned after many iterations and occurrences.

       No. At least not ‘basic’ in any sense. I’m talking about audio and visual recognition on a per pixel basis through a model that’s been trained and validated, initial at least, with hundreds of thousands of hours of previous content. This is novel technology with respect to the public, human generated content and social media. It’s not unreasonable to think Alphabet / Facebook have lost control of their algorithms either through incompetence or ignorance as long as profits keep increasing.

       Agreed. The content is obviously being created to benefit one or more parties (ie money). With the number of views the curators were generating millions in ad revenue per day at some point.

       Are you kidding me. If you can't swap assets and scenes on the fly, and music and sound, you don't know what you're doing. This isn't hand-drawn animation. This is a timeline based where you can incorporate objects, move assets on pre-defined paths or by code. People make sophisticated video games in it. You think they can't script this? Get outta here.

       I'm sure that's part of it but there's no need to be that fucked up to make money off of kids. Somethings going on but unless someone joins them and figures out what it is and speaks up I don't know if we'll ever know for sure.

       Money is not a motive here. These videos have been demonetized since the adpocalypse (started in April), but they are still being posted en masse. Given the complexity of the production process of some of them, money can't be the only motive here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, channels with normal cartoons for kids (like Masha and the Bear) also get tons of views, so why would one want to risk demonitization of their videos by producing weird, scary clips like Elsa instead of making normal cartoons if the amount of work is the same?

       If elsagate is just those Bradbury idiots (and one other fuy who works with them) videos then yeah the motive is money and its a hufe distraction from real chuld harming. If there are more than just that one group then I dont knkw the whole story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many I have seen people link are just the bradbury guys ans some girls they pay. The reason I know what they are doing is profit motivayes is because I watched their whole schtick evolve from people making fun of their channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically they originally did fake prank videos thatbwere horrible and staged. They made bank though and were dudes in their early 20s who werent clever or talented but saw you could exploit youtube so they started dressing as copyrighted Marvel and Disney characters and making short videos to exploit kids keyword searches.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are idiots so they dont know how to make real children friendly content, but the motive is money. Before it was discovered by conspiracy people all the comments were stuff like "dudes what is this why did yous top the prank videos."
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not sating there isnt material with the morive ro harm kids on youtube, but the brasburys are just money hungry idiots. Its kinda funny that there is seemingly more smoke here but legit no fire, but pizzagate had little smoke, but I think there is definitely fire therem

       If you're a parent and you give a fuck about your kids, watch these videos yourself.
. but really binge hours of it. I will guarantee you won't be giving that shit to your kids. 
It doesn't even matter anymore what they are about, pay attention, like I did after the first #elsagate warning. They seem harmless but keep watching... These videos are gonna keep appearing, even after reporting and they get worse the more you let it autoplay.

       The thing that leads me to believe conspiracy and not just money is the fact Disney doesn't care. They are extremely overprotective of content and are reason copyright law is so draconian in this country (to protect Mickey Mouse) . But completely fine with perverted Disney characters doing all sorts of nasty fetishes for children?

       Gotta keep asking the question's. Why did it take until the mass public take notice for them to take action. How could they not notice how popular these channels were, and the amount of money they were making. Isn't it someones job to daily take note of that? how do you even run a business without taking note of what's going on. Do they know all of this, and just wanted the money to roll in as long as possible?

       Yes, the deal is that even if we forget about "intent" for a second, it is clear that some kids are being traumatized, conditioned in a bad way, desensitized etc, as a result of watching this content. I think it is healthy to question the nefarious intentions of i) particular groups or individuals who have created this content in the first place and ii) the role of Youtube in failing to safeguard children from this content. Think about the thousands upon thousands of reports that these videos receive, think of all the comments on these videos that talk about how fucked up it is - now why are these videos still up? Why does Youtube take no action? Why are they still monetized? It either indictates gross negligence, or perhaps something more sinister. I don't believe a company as rich a Youtube/Google who issue DCMA notices at will and take down copyrighted content within minutes are having issues with moderating this stuff!

       Has it been proven that the messages are in fact coded messages that can be decoded? It seems more likely that they're bots just posting gibberish for the sake of the algorithm. I'm not sure how the algorithm works but maybe having activity in the comments helps with it.

       If you type random letters into a thai keyboard, then post that thai letters into google translate, it will make words and phrases that sometimes seem to make sense. There are a bunch of bot accounts that view and comment on certain videos to inflate the views and create ad revenue. They write unique comments to try to disguise the fact they are bots somehow from youtube's counter-measures, so there are comments with random strings of letters. If you process these through thai keyboard and google translate sometimes there are some creepy results, so people think it is a code.

       If this content was directed at kids and on cable TV, parents would be in an uproar and starting up new groups to protest.

       But that is about as far as most people get. Until it hits their TV/mainstream, they do nufin.

       With the advent of more TVs having youtube app built in though, I wonder how long it will take to catch up.
