       It's really that simple.. Thousands of cameras documented whatever he and others did.. but because of security, they can't show us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please fight. If the only evidence can be used against us, but can't be seen by us.. You could be used as tomorrow's basis to surveil us more.

       I'm not the alt right or antifa, are you? I don't think the majority of us are..
      </p>
      <p>
       But we allow them to control what we are allowed to see..
      </p>
      <p>
       The most basic idea I think we all agree on is term limits.. it truly is us versus them. Period, full stop.

       God i just wish we could convince everyone to vote for the Non-incumbent - I don't care who the incumbent is - vote for someone else. The idiots we don't know cannot be much worse than the idiots we have now.

       At minimum, there have to be elevator videos of someone taking all of those guns to the 32nd floor. So why can't we see these videos?

       I mean, it's such a simple detail that they've yet to confirm.. he could have taken them up the stairs gradually over the days he was there, he could have had a bell boy take the stuff up on a luggage cart, he could have given someone else we don't even know about the room key and they brought it all up.. hell, it could all be a setup.
      </p>
      <p>
       We literally haven't seen anything with our own eyes that confirms what we've been told.
