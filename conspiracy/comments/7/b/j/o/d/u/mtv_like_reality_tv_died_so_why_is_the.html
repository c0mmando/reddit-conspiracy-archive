<p>Please fight. If the only evidence can be used against us, but can&#39;t be seen by us.. You could be used as tomorrow&#39;s basis to surveil us more.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not the alt right or antifa, are you? I don&#39;t think the majority of us are.. </p>

<p>But we allow them to control what we are allowed to see..</p>

<p>The most basic idea I think we all agree on is term limits.. it truly is us versus them. Period, full stop.</p>
