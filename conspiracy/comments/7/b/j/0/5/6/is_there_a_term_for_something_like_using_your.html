        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I ask because I just saw an article referring to Google Glass as a failure, but that&#39;s not what happened at all. Here&#39;s what I remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google launches pre-orders for prototype Glass, which is incredibly popular, even though the prototypes kinda sucked</li>
<li>There are a bunch of forced memes on Reddit etc about &quot;glassholes&quot; which shit all over the users, and even (reportedly) incidents of actual violence against them. Very discouraging.</li>
<li>Google stops selling the prototypes because the real version is on its way, which then never actually comes, for some reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>See, I&#39;ve worked with advanced display technologies (different ways to render AR images directly into your eyes, which could easily be mounted on a pair of glasses, which blow those Glass prototypes out of the water), and to me it seems like they couldn&#39;t have done a better job of poisoning the well if they&#39;d tried.</p>

<p>So I assume they did try. And succeeded.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve wanted computer glasses since I was a little kid, and it seemed like they were going to be a huge thing when Glass rolled out. Instead, the tech seems to have completely disappeared from the consumer space? Nobody wants to touch it because the &quot;failure&quot; of Glass, despite Google having unlimited R&amp;D and marketing resources...</p>

<p><strong>Resultantly, a potential threat to the supremacy of smartphones has been effectively eliminated.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this pattern more than once, but I&#39;ve never been able to concisely describe it. &quot;False flag&quot; doesn&#39;t seem to exactly cover it. Is there an accepted term for this kind of behaviour?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems like a dangerous business tactic. You could  hype your dud widgit, hoping to sour the market, only to have a competitor ride your wave of marketing and deliver a better product. It would be like Tesla putting out shit electric vehicles, with a 45 mile range on a full charge, so that the public would give up on electric powered cars.
Glass missed the mark. They looked like shit, and people didnt like the idea of being recorded by the wearer at all times. I suspect the wearer didnt like people  knowing/thinking he was recording them either. $1500 was too high. Plus, we know the contacts are coming soon (fingers crossed).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, Coca Cola apparently owns a shitty-tasting soda named Tab. When Crystal Pepsi was a thing, Coke made a transparent version of their least-popular soda called Tab Clear, supposedly in order to poison the well by confusing people about clear sodas (says Wikipedia). I don&#39;t really get how that would work though, could they really get Tab Clear to people before they tried Crystal Pepsi considering they brought it out six months later? I could see it being a way to take CP&#39;s &quot;white earbud&quot; status away, except there was already sprite, right? I dunno.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also a little skeptical since I&#39;ve always considered Pepsi and Coke to be in an artificial duopoly, with Pepsi playing heel so their marketing can team up. So who knows if they didn&#39;t tag-team the Tab Clear thing, whatever the fuck it was really for.</p>

<p>But those products aren&#39;t the important part. Glass was announced in 2012. If that hadn&#39;t happened I kinda feel like <em>someone else in the last five years</em> would have done computerglasses. At this point it&#39;s not really that believable that someone else could make a new Glass in the <strong>next</strong> five years, technological advancements which make that a lame idea notwithstanding.

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. As a pissed Glass Explorer I get upset when the topic even comes up. I really liked those damn glasses, a lot. When they worked they were great. Ended up trading them in for repair/exchange 4 different times and the last pair they wouldn&#39;t do anything for me. So I have dead glasses at the end of the day. But I really miss a lot of photo opportunities while out riding. </p>

<p>Speaking of which, did you hear Intel dropped the Recon glasses? I think you might actually be on to something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big 4 of Silicon Valley definitely compete at least on a superficial level and Glass is definitely at the superficial level. Hololens is being developed by Microsoft and is a million times better but it&#39;s not really practical until it&#39;s miniaturized to the point it doesn&#39;t need a PC in a backpack. Once that comes out or Google&#39;s Magic Leap (Apple never moves first), the race is on. </p>
