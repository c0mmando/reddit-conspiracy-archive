       Incels was actually banned yesterday for violation of violent content policy. Then they overflowed other places and admins banned all the followup popup subs. Some of them were claiming that r/inceltears made some fake accounts to set them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       My anecdotal experience before and since the ban has been that some fo these guys can be rather hostile/offtopic/suicidal.

       They're specifically looking for monogamous romantic relationships. Young women today are increasingly disinterested in this. Incels' take it that social media and feminism combined to turn them into worthless whores.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two camps from what I've gathered. I'm not sure of the ratios.  First camp is the hopeless, they're physically unattractive beyond any realistic corrective measures. These are the angry virgins that can be dismissed. The second camp is regular men who have little to no trouble finding casual sex but can't find anyone that is worthy and interested in an actual relationship. These guys have some legitimate complaints. They want traditional relationships and pop culture has made that far more difficult than it used to be and they are ridiculed for their preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion their mistake was categorizing all women as useless whores. This is not true, there is a significant majority of women that are decent and sensible who should not be vilified just because most of their gender has turned to trash. Only the whores are worthless and they should have kept focus on that.
