    <div class="md"><p>This has crossed my mind. But who would the one target have been? If someone high profile would have died in the attack we would know about it. Now if your going to crawl real far down the rabbit hole and say paddock was an undercover CIA agent and he was trying to kill another agent. Or some such like that. That just seems too much. I don&#39;t think what officials  told us is the truth. But I find the one target theory seriously wild. Like &quot;they&quot; would have just killed that one person in some other way. Hell &quot;they&quot; killed JFK right in front of everyone and no one else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldn&#39;t be as simple as a person that wronged him personally rather than someone with a &quot;high profile&quot;? I would think that if there were someone &quot;high profile&quot; we would have heard something about a funeral on MSM... </p>

<p>I guess that unravels some of the &quot;conspiracy&quot; around it. Just some dude who wanted revenge on a random person in the crowd. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But &quot;they&quot; have also had to clean their tracks for the last 50 years, the CIA is still actively undermining the release of information regarding the JFK assassination. It would be easy to overlook the implications of 1 individual death in the aftermath of such a mass tragedy. Sometimes the biggest mess covers the cleanest kill. Imagine if 9/11 was enacted just to assassinate 1 person, nobody could realistically narrow down who (may have been targeted) or why, with that kind of bodycount. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See and here is the problem. Your to dedicated to one theory. You&#39;ve got to take what you o ow and piece it together. Not make a theory then add the pieces. You also can&#39;t take other notorious events and use them as proof for your theory. 9-11 and JFK have nothing to do with Las Vegas. That&#39;s just a fact. Sure you can some how strong together some wild circumstantial motive or whatever. But if your really on a quest for the truth you take the real evidence or lack there of and piece things together. </p>

<p>Like where are the tapes of him entering the building? Leaving his car? Checking in? Him in the hotel at all? What was on the note in his room? Why were there photos with multiple window missing? What about videos where it seems there is more than one shooter? </p>

<p>If your just trying to build your own theory to say o look I&#39;ve got it figured out to pump your own agenda or ego your missing the point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t claim to know anything. I am not an expert, I&#39;m not dedicated to any theory. I&#39;m just dropping an opinion on your response. Many of the theories I&#39;ve heard regarding this have seemed plausible, OP&#39;s idea wouldn&#39;t surprise me. I personally think Paddock was probably just a pissed off nutjob, but I&#39;m always interested to hear new arguments and ideas as new information is presented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think its possible, but maybe it wasn&#39;t someone in the crowd that was the target. With JANET terminal being across the street what if it was an attempt on someone of great importance and then firing at the crowd was the decoy to cover that up. Right now there are just too many holes and inconsistencies to prove one thing or the other. </p>
