       That's never stopped me before so here goes. Were any of the woman Weinstein raped Jewish? I wonder if he just rapes gentile woman. Call me what you will but that was my shower thought today.

       I'm pretty sure Weinstein is about as Jewish as Donald Trump is Christian. That is to say...strictly on paper.  Even if Weinstein got secret communiques from the Elders of Zion instructing him not to rape Jewish women, I doubt he'd abide by it.

       People apologize for rapist men constantly in American society, this is true of white people especially, like that kid who got 3 months for fingering a girl behind a dumpster, all because his family wrote letters about what a sweet nice boy he was and he'd never do anything like that.

       That is what I thought, and the term I was using in my head lol. Using Mossad to terrorize these woman had me wondering.  Mossad agents may be a lot of things but they aren;t stupid and I feel that they might have issue with that kind of stuff.  Probly when he used Kroll instead....

       Jews believe they can sexually molest gentiles without religious repercussion because they are lesser humans. They believe Goy/gentiles exist as their beasts of burden to be used and taken advantage of. Americans have been fighting and dying in the Middle East  wars for the coward Israeli jews...they will always get Goy to fight their wars while they hide in the shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway, great question. My 1st guess would be no. Jew women don't need to sell themselves that way in Hollywierd because they are jewish...they will be taken care of.

       1983 US Marine barracks bombing in Beirut. Israel carried out a false flag attack that killed 241 US Marines. It's fucking disgusting what these people will do to advance their sick aims.

       Do you have a link with evidence to support this claim about Israel? I'd like to see it. The US and French governments official story is that Iranian Nationals conducted the attack and worked under a group called Islamic Jihad.

       They at the very least had specific knowledge about the details of the attack and purposely failed to pass on that information to the US. Hezbollah has been blamed for the attack yet we all know Israel created Hezbollah to counter the PLO. Here is a quote from a book written by a former member of Mossad.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the summer of 1983, this same informant told the Mossad about a large Mercedes truck that was being fitted by the Shi'ite Muslims with spaces that could hold bombs. He said it had even larger than usual spaces for this, so that whatever it was destined for was going to be a major target. Now, the Mossad knew that, for size, there were only a few logical targets, one of which must be the U.S. compound. The question then was whether or not to warn the Americans to be on particular alert for a truck matching the description.
The decision was too important to be taken in the Beirut station, so it was passed along to Tel Aviv, where Admony, then head of Mossad, decided they would simply give the Americans the usual general warning, a vague notice that they had reason to believe someone might be planning an operation against them. But this was so general, and so commonplace, it was like sending a weather report; unlikely to raise any particular alarm or prompt increased security precautions. In the six months following receipt of this information, for example, there were more than 100 general warnings of car-bomb attacks. One more would not heighten U.S. concerns or surveillance.
Admony, in refusing to give the Americans specific information on the truck, said, "No, we're not there to protect Americans. They're a big country. Send only the regular information."
At the same time, however, all Israeli installations were given the specific details and warned to watch for a truck matching the description of the Mercedes.
At 6:20 a.m. on October 23, 1983, a large Mercedes truck approached the Beirut airport, passing well within sight of Israeli sentries in their nearby base, going through a Lebanese army checkpoint, and turning left into the parking lot. A U.S. Marine guard reported with alarm that the truck was gathering speed, but before he could do anything, the truck roared toward the entrance of the four-story reinforced concrete Aviation Safety Building, used as headquarters for the Eighth Marine Battalion, crashing through a wrought-iron gate, hitting the sand-bagged guard post, smashing through another barrier, and ramming over a wall of sandbags into the lobby, exploding with such a terrific force that the building was instantly reduced to rubble.
A few minutes later, another truck smashed into the French paratroopers' headquarters at Bir Hason, a seafront residential neighborhood just two miles from the U.S. compound, hitting it with such an impact that it moved the entire building 30 feet and killed 58 soldiers.
The loss of 241 U.S. Marines, most of them still sleeping in their cots at the time of the suicide mission, was the highest single-day death toll for the Americans since 246 died throughout Vietnam at the start of the Tet offensive on January 13, 1968.
Within days, the Israelis passed along to the CIA the names of 13 people who they said were connected to the bombing deaths of the U.S. Marines and French paratroopers, a list including Syrian intelligence, Iranians in Damascus, and Shi'ite Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah.
At Mossad headquarters, there was a sigh of relief that it wasn't us who got hit. It was seen as a small incident so far as the Mossad was concerned — that we had stumbled over it and wouldn't tell anybody. The problem was if we had leaked information and it was traced back, our informant would have been killed. The next time, we wouldn't know if we were on the hit list.
The general attitude about the Americans was: "Hey, they wanted to stick their nose into this Lebanon thing, let them pay the price." For me, it was the first time I had received a major rebuke from my Mossad superior, liaison officer Amy Yaar. I said at the time that the American soldiers killed in Beirut would be on our minds longer than our own casualties because they'd come in with good faith, to help us get out of this mess we'd created. I was told: "Just shut up. You're talking out of your league. We're giving the Americans much more than they're giving us." They always said that, but it's not true. So much of Israeli equipment was American, and the Mossad owed them a lot.

       Thanks for the info. The charge about Israel withholding intelligence is very serious. I'm a little wary about the author of this book being a disgruntled employee and not long term member of that agency. But I am going to search to see if this can be confirmed by other credible sources.

       Distinction without difference. Seems like the latter is just a way to spin it as defensive instead of offensive, aka "The Jews are victimizing me!" which is the oldest anti-semitic trope in the book.

       Then tell me the difference using more than 1 word "Active versus Reactive" tells me nothing except the strategic stance. Both assume that Jews are a threat that must be dealt with.

       You should listen to this guy, I get the sense that you have potential to learn the difference that he is talking about. I know you want to think I am antisemitic. My best friend in college and who has now passed on was Jewish and I cherish her memory everyday. I am talking about elites and the lines between the religions blur up at the top. Look into queen Elizabeth, she had interests in the NAZI work camps and still has liquidated jewish wealth. These are the fuckers you should be raging against.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be so fast to judge people. There are jews out to get us and regular poor jewish folks are as much victims of them as the rest of us. Even if I am wasting my time with you I tried. Less rage and more learning and understanding.

       Not really. Thousands of people question Zionism every day. The problem is people like you who come out saying, "Jews rape gentiles!" and then when someone says "Wow that's anti-semitic as hell" you sya "WHAT?! I was talking about Zionists!

       Editing is helpful for correcting typos and spelling errors. You should try it: It's just "false equivalence" not "equivalency."

       Simply
       <em>
        calling
       </em>
       something a false equivalency doesn't make it one, by the way. You have to actually go through the effort of proving the difference between the two is sufficiently large.

         Source on any Jewish women he raped? Not that I don't believe you, but that would answer the question posed in this post. And you could easily answer it without crying "anti-semite."

         I'm not going to quibble with you over whether something like a question is anti-semitic or not. When the Talmud more or less says that its ok to rape gentile women and not Jewish women, its a perfectly valid question to ask. Nobody cares if you think its anti-semitic, seriously.

       Completely fair question, although in some circles they would have you believe it's anti semetic.  All fair criticism of a jew or Israel gets labeled antisemitic.
