<p>This is a conspiracy because I am deviating from the Gun Narrative that shotguns are <strong>the best home defense weapon</strong> and that no one needs an AR15. I have strong arguments for why it is not the best, but my conclusion is <em>it depends</em>, and supporting this conclusion causes people to become upset and attack me personally.</p>

<p>Shotguns are barrel heavy,  unwieldy, and have massive recoil compared to AR15s and 9mm, 40 , 45 handguns. I am not talking about exotic or high powered pistol rounds so disregard that thought.</p>

<p>Shot guns ammo capacity is very small.</p>

<p>Shotgun rate of fire is <em>very slow</em> for non-professional shooters, followup shots under stress will be very difficult in-lieu of semi-auto ARs or handguns. A semi-auto shotgun will cost more than a handgun or AR.  </p>

<p>Women shooting shotguns:</p>

<p>Shotgun rounds penetrate walls as much as AR15s and handguns:</p>

<p>AR15 with hollowpoint or frangible rounds are a good choice for home defense because they are lightweight, easier to handle, and have minimal recoil.  Handguns are even more lightweight and easier to handle, but a little more recoil dynamics than an AR.</p>

<p>There are exceptions to everything, but I am dispelling myths and I am suggesting a shotgun is not the best choice for home defense. Shot gun ammunition is very expensive, 4x 223 rounds. The merit of shotguns is they can be affordable, but so are handguns.</p>

<p>Edit: The point I can agree with is there is no right answer on the topic, but I got banned for leading towards this conclusion.</p>

<p>Edit: To reiterate, shotguns are NOT the best home defense weapon because the best home defense weapon <em>depends</em>.  </p>

<p>Edit: add more anecdotal evidence on massive shotgun recoil vs AR15. Please focus on recoil and how kids struggle to wield shotguns, I am not suggesting children will defend your home, I am comparing recoil, wieldiness and followup shots.</p>

<p>Kids shooting AR15s, notice how they wield the rifle without struggle when shooting from standing, as opposed to kids struggling to wield shotguns as shown above:</p>

<p>Note, the kids with ARs can followup shoot, but none existent with shotguns because most likely they cannot pump or break the shotgun for a followup shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With a shotgun, I guess that type of situation is more likely to happen because the gun is unwieldy and pump action is horrible for followup shots. I think if you were an Army specialist issued a pump action would be effective however, but I am talking everyone else who practices shooting once a year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is so so wrong. You can effortlessly find many shotguns that are not specifically for hunting, easily under 400 and a few decent under 300. Pretty affordable compared to an AR that will run you at least ~500+tinkering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, you showed that a semiauto shotgun can be affordable used, does this disprove all other arguments and evidence I presented to make a case to show shotguns are not thee best home defense weapon? That is a leading question and rational people would likely respond &quot;no&quot; or &quot;not necessarily&quot;. </p>

<p>Since most people are turned off by my very direct responses that may hurt peoples feelings so that they become defensive, I dont expect you to answer that question because it would mean you agree with me on some level no matter how minute it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shotgun is a lot easier to aim, and very quick to pop a few shells in a pump shotgun.  If you keep magazines loaded with your AR 15 then It would be quick but I have all my ammo in boxes.  Also, if you don&#39;t take care of your AR 15 properly it will be more likely to jam or double feed rendering it useless.  Never seen a pump action shotgun jam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I&#39;m not wasting my time with a blundering idiot.  Common damn sense tells you that a shotgun loaded with buckshot (those are 33 caliber balls if you didn&#39;t know with 9 of those in a shell) that shoot a pattern of roughly 8 to 12&quot; at 15 yards.  Thats 9 bullets going into a target if you aim dead center mass.  If you hip fire or whatever your chances are still high of striking the target because of the big pattern.  AR15 you get one bullet that if you aim dead center will be accurate.  Hip fire and your odds are against you.  So, lets say you empty a normal 30 round clip.  That&#39;s 30 bullets compared to 45 in a 5 round semi-auto shotgun.  So you wake up at 3am and hear a noise.  Your eyes are not adjusted and the perk is coming into your room.  Now your going to tell me that you&#39;d take an AR that you have to aim with groggy eyes over a shotgun that you just point and shoot to kill the intruder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure there is a &quot;best&quot; gun for home defense.</p>

<p>A shotgun will certainly get the job done, but can be heavy and awkward to aim in closed quarters. And you have the intimidation factor. </p>

<p>A handgun in the nightstand or under the pillow is prolly the best bet for immediate selfdefense tho.  If you home gets invaded you can immediately start fighting back. Intruders wont expect someone sleeping to be armed n ready.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing. I am taking such a strong stance with AR15s and handguns because people have been led to believe a shotgun is <strong>far superior</strong> to anything else for home defense.  The reality is it depends. My first home / apartment defense weapon was a shotgun. </p>

<p>I remember going out shooting with it, and my friends not liking it because it blew out their shoulder, I felt the same way but I knew I needed to practice so I took it.  Now after many years and owning several different firearms, I formulated a more realistic opinion and I want to share this with my fellow citizens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Live alone on empty land in the middle of no where. I&#39;m also not dumb enough to try and wield a 48&quot; shotgun inside and possibly in hallways. There good for girls who hide in rooms while the perps loot the fuck out of the house and do what they want until they open the door.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather just use a 26&quot; rifle and have the ability to shoot through my walls if there committed and not be cycling my shotgun while they more than likely have pistols with much larger capacity&#39;s with the ability to pin me down and finish me with easy.</p>

<p>Point being there only nice for people who can&#39;t shoot through there walls because of neighbors. Are shit shots so they need the spread and because there too dumb to buy a fucking rifle mounted flashlight. They also believe that loading the shotgun will be enough to scare away everyone from petty thieves to deranged murders on a quest to kill your dumb ass.</p>

<p>And my favorite most people use a bird shot for home defense. Might as well load it with rock salt and hope there a pack of dumb teenagers.</p>

<p>People who rock large buck shot and slugs literally negate then pro&#39;s of a shotgun in close quarters. Also lets not forget barrel length and the spread at close ranges. The longest room in my house is about 20&#39;. At that range most shot guns begin there spread and again negates the point of a shot gun unless use bird shot and I already brought that up..</p>
