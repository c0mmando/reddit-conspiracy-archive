Can you guys just call PedoGate/PedoRing to include all of this sick shit and stop the nonsense? The focus here is our children in the hands of dangerous people. Thanks.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5060219/LAPD-confirms-investigating-Corey-Feldman-case.html">post</a> from Daily Mail show us that the police are officially investigating a &quot;pedophile ring in Hollywood&quot;.
Well... This corroborate with many theories and info in PedoGate case. Maybe is time to Reddit bring back the sub?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pedophilia is literally the attraction to prepubescent humans.</p>

<p>What you are talking about is statutory rape. Two completely different things. While I think that both should be illegal, one, IMO, represents a real psychological issue (attraction to prepubescent children) while the other represents a good law meant to protect emotionally and intellectually immature people from predators. But I think we have to be careful not to conflate the two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly</p>

<p>Pedophilia=sexual attraction to PREPUBESCENT children</p>

<p>Ephebophilia=sexual attraction to post-pubescent teenagers/young people.  May preclude statutory rape depending on the person&#39;s age/legal status and what state they are in.  </p>

<p>I.e. Sex with a minor doesn&#39;t necessarily qualify as pedophilia, and may be entirely legal depending on their age/consent.  In South Carolina, for example, the AoC is 16, meaning an older person, above the age of 18, can legally have sex with a teenager age 16, even though the teenager is still a minor (obviously with consent).   While this may be distasteful to many people, it is neither illegal nor pedophilia.  It&#39;s an ephebophile still not breaking the law.  </p>

<p>Hell my grandmother was 15 when her then 28 year old husband married her.  And that wasn&#39;t that long ago, historically speaking.  </p>

<p>The outrage and actions taken concerning the pedophilia are legitimate and necessary, but the legal lines and correct understanding of the terminology is also necessary if it is to be combated effectively.  </p>

<p>My humble opinion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;My humble opinion&#39;: Age 12-17. Brain is still being developed. At those ages they are easily manipulated. </p>

<p>Even then, when a predator threatens to kill your family/friends if you do not do what they want and tell them to give them consent... It&#39;s fcking evil. At age 30 you have a developed brain and should be in jail for a long time if you are willing to destoy a soul. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly. Some people remain easily manipulated their whole life--most, in fact.  While I don&#39;t disagree, your stance is very subjective and thus makes any sort of legal precedent setting more difficult.  Action must be taken on concepts that are understood as more concrete and fixed in definition.  Not trying to say you&#39;re wrong by any means.  But I believe that not every person over the age of 18 who is involved sexually with a consenting, legal minor, is evil or wrong.  It&#39;s a distinction we must learn to make before we wind up embarking on a mass witch hunt.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might have a point, but I sincerely disagree. Sure when an 19 y/o date an 16 y/o would not be a problem...</p>

<p>Then again when an 30 y/o dates an 16 y/o, then its an whole other story. Sure there might be circumstances where &quot;true&quot; love is a factor... I doubt at those age diffirences you have something in common though... </p>

<p>I might be biased since I got terrorized in my youth and has been diagnosed with ptsd, but I refuse to accept at those age differences when he/she is underage to be able to accept sexual acts without being aware of the consequences. Where as an adult knows exactly what he/she is doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand and I KNOW where you&#39;re coming from.  I suffered abuse at the hands of more than one person, including my own uncle and neighbor who I thought was my &quot;best friend&quot; from the time I was about 6 until I was about 16.  I&#39;m not making claims about the morality or correctness of these things--only the legality of these things and the differences in terminology about these things, and how understanding THOSE aspects is what is most important when determining how to legally handle this sort of stuff.  </p>

<p>As far as massive age gaps between two partners, historically, the gap has only been as narrow as is typically acceptable for a very (relatively) short period of time (i.e. My grandmother and grandfather mentioned in my other comment, JFE).  All I&#39;m really trying to say is that not every older person who&#39;s with someone younger is inherently malicious, and not every younger person with someone older is inherently a victim.  We must rely on the rule of law AND the rule of tolerance when it comes to what is ultimately a private matter between two consenting individuals.  It&#39;s good to stop the bad guys, but you gotta be able to have a consensus on what constitutes a &quot;bad guy&quot;, so to speak.  Does that make any sense ?</p>

For instance when the person who molested me got arrested he got 1 year in prison while I live my whole live with the scars and even am about to lose my house because of the harm he did 18 years ago, because I cant function anymore. </p>

<p>All I want to make clear is adult people who wants young people are fcking evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>and all i want to make clear is that not ALL adult people who are attracted to younger people are evil.  a shitload of them are creepy sadistic perverts who should never see the light of day...but some of them actually are good people who&#39;s circumstances are unique and non-malicious.  they are rare, but they exist, and they should not be persecuted because of the terrible actions of others.  it isn&#39;t fair just like anything else that isn&#39;t fair.  </p>

<p>if you ever need someone to talk to about what you&#39;ve been through, you can privately message me any time.  i have been fortunate to have a loving family and very good friends who have helped me work through a lot of the issues i have because of what happened to me as a child and as a teenager, and without them, i would, no doubt, have killed myself a long time ago.  people, old and young, have appeared in my life, as friends, as family, as lovers, at the right times, and in the right ways, to remind me that there is still good in the world, and still good in people.  i try to remember that all the time, because the world can be very dark when you forget it.  </p>

<p>i don&#39;t know you.  i&#39;ve never seen your face or known your name.  i don&#39;t anything about you but that you&#39;ve been through something terrible, and i&#39;m sorry it happened to you, but you need to know that you&#39;re not alone, and that there is always hope and love and light.  i love you, whoever you are, and if you need an ear, ever, just let me know.  i hope everything works out for you; but even if it doesn&#39;t, not right now, you gotta press on and know that as long as you stay true to yourself and remember the good, that eventually there will be peace.  i may not seem possible when times are dark, but i promise you that it is.  you have to believe me on that, buddy.  i wish you the best.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually thats not accurate either. technically people attracted to those between about 11-14 are considered Hebephiles. Pedophilia is for people attracted to those younger than that. </p>

<p>But semantics aside, anyone abusing anyone in a sexual manner that is under the age of being an adult is an issue, and any one abusing people who are adults, is just sexual abuse/assault. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The connection is that all these high level pedophile rings are connected - you see how powerful Hollywood people have political power and influence and run in circles socially with politicians etc. Well the pedophile rings all operate that way too, just secretly obviously. The PG investigation was basically a name given to one tiny part of &#39;Pedogate&#39; really it is all the same thing - the Pizzgate part was people finding out specifically the use of coded language in Democrat emails that then led to discoveries about the street upon which that weird pizza restaurant was located, along with several other businesses many of which used pedophile symbology in their logos, all of which were owned by Saudis and frequented by DC politicians.</p>

<p>That investigation that started with the pizza restaurant then led to ties to many other things globally, including Haiti, Dyncorp, other convicted pedo politicians, UK pedo rings, Belgian pedo rings, Norwegian elite pedo rings and Hollywood pedo rings.</p>

<p>So basically it&#39;s all connected.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s deals with elite pedos and their network that allows them to operate essentially above the law. </p>

<p>Pizzagate was a small distraction to the rampant pedophelia in politics and Hollywood. It&#39;s attempt was to debunk itself (pizzagate) therefore nullifying all accusations as just part of the pizzagate story.  We should stay vigilant and correct people when they fall for the bullshit.</p>

<p>Pizzagate/pedogate, it does not matter what derivative you want to use. They are the same exact thing. Again, don&#39;t buy into mainstream trying to brainwash you to thinking its unrelated. This includes Reddit. </p>

<p>The main difference between Pizzagate and these aspects of Pedogate is witnesses and direct accusations. Pizzagate is a bunch of symbolism and attempts to &quot;decode&quot; ordinary messages, while these things have actual victims with corroborations giving their case. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue for those that think pizzagate is unrelated is that they cannot see the bigger picture.  Entertainment and politics are one in the same, you may not understand this but its really simple. </p>

<p>Pizzagate is just referencing pedophilia by elite people, could be either industry.  To think that pedophilia in politics is vastly different to pedophilia in the entertainment industry is absurd.  Look up the attendees of the bohemian grove to see what you&#39;re missing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying pizza gate is not based out of the pizza shop.  The term stems from the code words used in pedophilia rings not the location that was popularized by the ridiculous side show of the dude with a gun.  Yes, I&#39;m saying this was a planned red herring to make you think that pizza gate refers to comet pizza instead of the much larger situation at hand.  It&#39;s quite obvious now that this is a very real issue in the entertainment and political landscapes.  Also, this is likely just the very tip of the iceberg.  </p>

<p>The issue is there is a ton that will never be properly investigated due to the positions of influence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. And then he was interviewed by major newspapers just a few days later stating how stupid he felt for being misled by evil conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>Alefantis even got to be interviewed by newspapers as well as showing up on tv news networks proclaiming how awful conspiracy theorists almost got him killed, how innocent he is, and how it&#39;s all been &quot;debunked&quot; because the police said so without even investigating anything.</p>

<p>It was all a great way to get people to distance themselves from the people talking about it and people talking about <em>any</em> possible abuse rings in general. Not only that, but it was a great way to get people to call anyone talking about any potential conspiracies like that &quot;<em>dangerous</em>&quot; and tell everyone they shouldn&#39;t talk about it because some crazy person might go shoot up a store.</p>

<p>All of that happened because someone went into a store with a gun, shot a door, didn&#39;t hurt anyone and got interviewed as if he was some celebrity and not someone who just committed a crime.</p>

<p>The fact the street/traffic camera that directly showed the pizza place was moved away conveniently for the shooting is the icing on the &quot;the whole thing was a false flag to get people to stop talking about it because people are now calling them dangerous and blaming them personally for making someone take a gun into a restaurant&quot; cake.</p>

<p>In my opinion, of course.</p>

<p>Unlike the recent stories of Hollywood abuse, among other accusations of child abuse, you know what pizzagate <em>doesn&#39;t</em> have?</p>

<p>Victims.</p>

<p>Not a single specific allegation of abuse. Not a single parent claiming their child had been abused. Not a single child saying they were abused. Not a single specific allegation pointing to a specific crime.</p>

<p>Funny, that.</p>

<p>No. There is none. Zero. Nada. Zilch. There is absolutely zero evidence suggesting the kids might have been abused, tying the grandmother to abuse, suggesting the kids were entering an abusive environment, and so on. If there was, you&#39;d post it instead of vague, nebulous nonsense. You don&#39;t because it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to literally <em>make shit up</em> - in addition to your supposed credentials, I mean - why should anyone believe <em>anything</em> you post?</p>

<p>Whether you&#39;re purposely making things up or just don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about is unclear, but the baby wasn&#39;t streamed 24/7. It was nothing more than a blog with family pictures. </p>

I have young nephews and nieces, and my family has fun watching them run around and act ridiculous and, yes, sometimes play in a pool or the ocean or a lake. That&#39;s how people work. Kids are funny, and a lot of people enjoy their company. It has nothing to do with sex. I can&#39;t believe I need to explain this.</p>

<p>Because putting Brock on the list would blow his cover and operation. so instead of Brock they put his lover who also happens to run a very popular pizza place that hosts major politicians regularly....</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Nope. Everyone agrees pedophilia and child abuse are real, and everyone also agrees that when people in power are guilty of it, they are often protected by those around them. There have been many examples of this, and no doubt there will be many more.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the pizzagate folks have attempted to move the goalposts and say it&#39;s about child abuse in general. Because the Alefantis and Podesta accusations lack a pretty crucial thing if you&#39;re going to accuse someone of abusing child: <em>actual victims</em>.</p>

<p>But hey, if we can just say that pizzagate = all child abuse, then we can do like OP is trying to do and anytime an example of abuse happens we can say, &quot;See, proof that pizzagate is real!&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s sad that we all had to come out and make it known that our investigation wasn&#39;t politically motivated. Infact, this whole sub largely rejects the two party system. We just wanted to expose bad people, regardless of party affiliation, but they branded us as an alt-right witch hunt.</p>

<p>Nobody is denying the Franklin Scandal which implicated high level republicans. Nobody is denying Dennis Hastert, longest serving Rep. speaker (and best friend of Tony Podesta) was a pedophile. So stop using that bullshit.</p>

<p>And not every detail is agreed upon by every user here. But the media backlash, the censorship, the staged shooting at the pizza place, those are all classic reactions by TPTB to something very real. Many of us watched pizzagate unfold from the start,

<p>Plus why does PG always have to be associated with the wacky idea of a sexy dungeon in comet ping pong? Lol...very few of us ever implied that. It can be a broad term used to describe all the revelations that came about last October following the podesta email leaks.</p>

<p>Ok, Columbo, what is John&#39;s &quot;pizza related handkerchief&quot;? The fuck is he talking about? It surely isn&#39;t an actual handkerchief with a &quot;pizza map&quot; on it. Is it drugs? If you admit they&#39;re referring to drugs, than you admit the code words mean SOMETHING.</p>

<p>Instead we have quite the opposite.

<p>I think youre wrong about most of the sub buying into pizzagate. SInce we&#39;ve stopped being bombarded by it in inorganic fashion the sub has definitely turned.

    <div class="md"><p>Dude. Trump said in an interview Epstein was a terrific guy he&#39;d known for 15 years and who liked women just like he does. He admitted it!</p>

<p>There&#39;s no evidence Trump banged a kid but him and Epstein were both accused of raping one AND Epstein plead the 5th amendment when asked directly about him and Trump. His own brother gave sworn testimony he rode with them on the Lolita Express yet no manifests exist. You don&#39;t think a billionaire can cover something up with hush money?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve stated a few facts and used leading questions and statements. You&#39;re arguing Trump&#39;s name isn&#39;t on there because he planned on running for president, is a billionaire, and an acquaintance makes him off the books, but a sitting president (26 rides on Lolita express) isn&#39;t powerful enough... Bill Clinton. And other billionaires (Rothschild) aren&#39;t either.</p>

<p>Either way, Epstein is quite introverted and cautious. It is definitely possible there is more to his relationship with Trump. I can&#39;t rule that out as a conspiracy theorist. You helped me realize I might be a little biased so thanks for that. Good day sir.</p>

<p>Buzzfeed had it right but had to back away from this because the public isn&#39;t supposed to know the Clintons were involved with Epstein and his crew. The press intentionally limited Pizzagate to a pizza place basement. <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/fever-swamp-election?utm_term=.xhKEjLP9Q9#.fuN7380pkp">https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/fever-swamp-election?utm_term=.xhKEjLP9Q9#.fuN7380pkp</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s ok though. Hollywood blog, Crazy Days and Nights, will soon break that Singer and Spacey (and perhaps Geffen) were having sex with kids on Epstein&#39;s island. It&#39;s all coming out whether they try to distract from it or not.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He&#39;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot;</p>

<p>Those dozens of suspicious emails with obvious code usage were debunked? Those dozens of Instagram pictures from CPP were debunked? Those spirit cooking emails and pictures were debunked? Those <em>many</em> connections to convicted pedophiles were debunked? That &quot;art&quot; Tony Podesta has in his <em>home</em> were debunked? Or how about that police sketch of two people who kidnapped Madeline McCain? John and Tony Podesta look awfully similar. They also happend to of been living within miles of the kidnapping at the time. In fact they are so similar Tony even has a mole in the same spot! What a coincidence am I right fellow &quot;Conspiracy Theorist&quot;?</p>

<p>Also a hoax is something fake. Are any of those things fake?</p>

It was shut down because one of you nutjobs walked into a pizza place full of families, children, and started shooting the place up.</p>

<p>Do you just not have memories?</p>

<p>But I t&#39;s pretty sad you admit Trump knew in 2002 his friend was a child sex pimp yet he didn&#39;t tell anyone and instead just decided to &quot;signal&quot; it in a magazine interview. </p>

<p>But hey let&#39;s forget that. Look at this pizzaria that&#39;s not at all easily debunkable 4chan hoax designed to focus on democrats. </p>

<p>Meanwhile the actual sex ring is covered up by Trump? lol. </p>
