       Let's edit the post to finish the discussion about what is what in "PedoGate/PizzaGate/etc". Can you guys just call PedoGate/PedoRing to include all of this sick shit and stop the nonsense? The focus here is our children in the hands of dangerous people. Thanks.

       from Daily Mail show us that the police are officially investigating a "pedophile ring in Hollywood".
Well... This corroborate with many theories and info in PedoGate case. Maybe is time to Reddit bring back the sub?

       The "fakenews" blitz (ripping John Rappaport off) last year was the feableminded, hamfisted first response to the grassroots investigations. It takes a year for these paramecium to strategize and choose sacrificial weinsteins, attempting to placate any half interested citizens who catch wind of the grand criminal scheme. Reddit was / is permabanned from legitimate participation in any true justice, after going titsup bitch to the coverup

       Pedophilia or paedophilia is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive sexual attraction to prepubescent children. Although girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at age 11 or 12, criteria for pedophilia extend the cut-off point for prepubescence to age

       Pedophilia is literally the attraction to prepubescent humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are talking about is statutory rape. Two completely different things. While I think that both should be illegal, one, IMO, represents a real psychological issue (attraction to prepubescent children) while the other represents a good law meant to protect emotionally and intellectually immature people from predators. But I think we have to be careful not to conflate the two.

       Exactly
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedophilia=sexual attraction to PREPUBESCENT children
      </p>
      <p>
       Ephebophilia=sexual attraction to post-pubescent teenagers/young people.  May preclude statutory rape depending on the person's age/legal status and what state they are in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I.e. Sex with a minor doesn't necessarily qualify as pedophilia, and may be entirely legal depending on their age/consent.  In South Carolina, for example, the AoC is 16, meaning an older person, above the age of 18, can legally have sex with a teenager age 16, even though the teenager is still a minor (obviously with consent).   While this may be distasteful to many people, it is neither illegal nor pedophilia.  It's an ephebophile still not breaking the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell my grandmother was 15 when her then 28 year old husband married her.  And that wasn't that long ago, historically speaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outrage and actions taken concerning the pedophilia are legitimate and necessary, but the legal lines and correct understanding of the terminology is also necessary if it is to be combated effectively.

       Thanks for this. Everyone needs to be aware of the distinction when approaching the issue at hand. I think there is also a distinction between pedophilia (sexual attraction) vs sadism or ritual abuse (stealing power or life force).

       'My humble opinion': Age 12-17. Brain is still being developed. At those ages they are easily manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even then, when a predator threatens to kill your family/friends if you do not do what they want and tell them to give them consent... It's fcking evil. At age 30 you have a developed brain and should be in jail for a long time if you are willing to destoy a soul.

       Clearly. Some people remain easily manipulated their whole life--most, in fact.  While I don't disagree, your stance is very subjective and thus makes any sort of legal precedent setting more difficult.  Action must be taken on concepts that are understood as more concrete and fixed in definition.  Not trying to say you're wrong by any means.  But I believe that not every person over the age of 18 who is involved sexually with a consenting, legal minor, is evil or wrong.  It's a distinction we must learn to make before we wind up embarking on a mass witch hunt.

       You might have a point, but I sincerely disagree. Sure when an 19 y/o date an 16 y/o would not be a problem...
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again when an 30 y/o dates an 16 y/o, then its an whole other story. Sure there might be circumstances where "true" love is a factor... I doubt at those age diffirences you have something in common though...

       I might be biased since I got terrorized in my youth and has been diagnosed with ptsd, but I refuse to accept at those age differences when he/she is underage to be able to accept sexual acts without being aware of the consequences. Where as an adult knows exactly what he/she is doing.

       I understand and I KNOW where you're coming from.  I suffered abuse at the hands of more than one person, including my own uncle and neighbor who I thought was my "best friend" from the time I was about 6 until I was about 16.  I'm not making claims about the morality or correctness of these things--only the legality of these things and the differences in terminology about these things, and how understanding THOSE aspects is what is most important when determining how to legally handle this sort of stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as massive age gaps between two partners, historically, the gap has only been as narrow as is typically acceptable for a very (relatively) short period of time (i.e. My grandmother and grandfather mentioned in my other comment, JFE).  All I'm really trying to say is that not every older person who's with someone younger is inherently malicious, and not every younger person with someone older is inherently a victim.  We must rely on the rule of law AND the rule of tolerance when it comes to what is ultimately a private matter between two consenting individuals.  It's good to stop the bad guys, but you gotta be able to have a consensus on what constitutes a "bad guy", so to speak.  Does that make any sense ?

       I understand your point and I feel sorry what you have been through. Though there is a diffirence in law and common sense. For instance when the person who molested me got arrested he got 1 year in prison while I live my whole live with the scars and even am about to lose my house because of the harm he did 18 years ago, because I cant function anymore.

       and all i want to make clear is that not ALL adult people who are attracted to younger people are evil.  a shitload of them are creepy sadistic perverts who should never see the light of day...but some of them actually are good people who's circumstances are unique and non-malicious.  they are rare, but they exist, and they should not be persecuted because of the terrible actions of others.  it isn't fair just like anything else that isn't fair.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you ever need someone to talk to about what you've been through, you can privately message me any time.  i have been fortunate to have a loving family and very good friends who have helped me work through a lot of the issues i have because of what happened to me as a child and as a teenager, and without them, i would, no doubt, have killed myself a long time ago.  people, old and young, have appeared in my life, as friends, as family, as lovers, at the right times, and in the right ways, to remind me that there is still good in the world, and still good in people.  i try to remember that all the time, because the world can be very dark when you forget it.
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't know you.  i've never seen your face or known your name.  i don't anything about you but that you've been through something terrible, and i'm sorry it happened to you, but you need to know that you're not alone, and that there is always hope and love and light.  i love you, whoever you are, and if you need an ear, ever, just let me know.  i hope everything works out for you; but even if it doesn't, not right now, you gotta press on and know that as long as you stay true to yourself and remember the good, that eventually there will be peace.  i may not seem possible when times are dark, but i promise you that it is.  you have to believe me on that, buddy.  i wish you the best.

       actually thats not accurate either. technically people attracted to those between about 11-14 are considered Hebephiles. Pedophilia is for people attracted to those younger than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       But semantics aside, anyone abusing anyone in a sexual manner that is under the age of being an adult is an issue, and any one abusing people who are adults, is just sexual abuse/assault.

       Pizzagate is the pedo ring in DC for politicians, lobbyists, diplomats, etc. (often related to Brownstone operations -- providing minors to adults for sexual favors -- that keep pols compromised and voting the "right" way). Pedogate is an umbrella term for the connected pedo operations (e.g., Pizzagate and Pedowood both fall under the term Pedogate).

       Trump was only alleged to fly on the plane in courtroom testimony. He did comment about Epstein though. My reasoning is if they didn't keep Bill Clintons rides secret why would they do that for Trump? But no he isn't on any of the flight logs. (Trump)

       The connection is that all these high level pedophile rings are connected - you see how powerful Hollywood people have political power and influence and run in circles socially with politicians etc. Well the pedophile rings all operate that way too, just secretly obviously. The PG investigation was basically a name given to one tiny part of 'Pedogate' really it is all the same thing - the Pizzgate part was people finding out specifically the use of coded language in Democrat emails that then led to discoveries about the street upon which that weird pizza restaurant was located, along with several other businesses many of which used pedophile symbology in their logos, all of which were owned by Saudis and frequented by DC politicians.

       That investigation that started with the pizza restaurant then led to ties to many other things globally, including Haiti, Dyncorp, other convicted pedo politicians, UK pedo rings, Belgian pedo rings, Norwegian elite pedo rings and Hollywood pedo rings.

       It's deals with elite pedos and their network that allows them to operate essentially above the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate was a small distraction to the rampant pedophelia in politics and Hollywood. It's attempt was to debunk itself (pizzagate) therefore nullifying all accusations as just part of the pizzagate story.  We should stay vigilant and correct people when they fall for the bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate/pedogate, it does not matter what derivative you want to use. They are the same exact thing. Again, don't buy into mainstream trying to brainwash you to thinking its unrelated. This includes Reddit.

       I don't think anyone's distracted really lol. I've been helping debunk pizzagate claims since the whole thing started and it's still obvious Kevin Spacey is a pedo.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main difference between Pizzagate and these aspects of Pedogate is witnesses and direct accusations. Pizzagate is a bunch of symbolism and attempts to "decode" ordinary messages, while these things have actual victims with corroborations giving their case.

       The issue for those that think pizzagate is unrelated is that they cannot see the bigger picture.  Entertainment and politics are one in the same, you may not understand this but its really simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is just referencing pedophilia by elite people, could be either industry.  To think that pedophilia in politics is vastly different to pedophilia in the entertainment industry is absurd.  Look up the attendees of the bohemian grove to see what you're missing.

       I don't see a difference for people in positions of power. There's pedos in hollywood and washington for sure. I'm just saying it doesn't mean there's a specific circle who use coded messages based out of a pizza shop.

       I'm saying pizza gate is not based out of the pizza shop.  The term stems from the code words used in pedophilia rings not the location that was popularized by the ridiculous side show of the dude with a gun.  Yes, I'm saying this was a planned red herring to make you think that pizza gate refers to comet pizza instead of the much larger situation at hand.  It's quite obvious now that this is a very real issue in the entertainment and political landscapes.  Also, this is likely just the very tip of the iceberg.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is there is a ton that will never be properly investigated due to the positions of influence.

       Agreed... the /PG sub should have never gone away. Perhaps stricter rules put in place to protect possible POI/PII... but that's it. Anyone that immediately 'dismissed' PizzaGate and/or PedoGate as fake news is very clearly complying with the PTB.

       I hope his immunity is only protecting him from the Russian side of the equation... however, if* he was caught w/ any kind of underage evidence/witnesses/etc... the hope would be that his immunity deal would result in the total and complete exposure of this ring. How it operates. Who is involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the looks of it, based on circumstantial evidence, global relationships, and the servers connected to CPP - this is very much an international "club" and the initiation is likely something that no normal person could even imagine, let alone perform.

       Would be nice if either of those links had a picture of him, instead of just relying on the name being the same. Also even assuming it's the same guy, there's nothing stopping someone who was once an extra in some movies from believing all the pizzagate stuff. Having access to hollywood doesn't tend to make you more sane, after all. Look at Scientology for instance.

       Yes. And then he was interviewed by major newspapers just a few days later stating how stupid he felt for being misled by evil conspiracy theorists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis even got to be interviewed by newspapers as well as showing up on tv news networks proclaiming how awful conspiracy theorists almost got him killed, how innocent he is, and how it's all been "debunked" because the police said so without even investigating anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was all a great way to get people to distance themselves from the people talking about it and people talking about
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       possible abuse rings in general. Not only that, but it was a great way to get people to call anyone talking about any potential conspiracies like that "
       <em>
        dangerous
       </em>
       " and tell everyone they shouldn't talk about it because some crazy person might go shoot up a store.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of that happened because someone went into a store with a gun, shot a door, didn't hurt anyone and got interviewed as if he was some celebrity and not someone who just committed a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact the street/traffic camera that directly showed the pizza place was moved away conveniently for the shooting is the icing on the "the whole thing was a false flag to get people to stop talking about it because people are now calling them dangerous and blaming them personally for making someone take a gun into a restaurant" cake.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, of course.

       At least you're backing your statements up by something, some other guy said he was a paid actor and just left it at that. I don't agree with it being a false flag or anything like that, but I appreciate that you came to that conclusion with some reason. Personally, I think he wasn't thinking too critically about the whole thing until after when he realized how fucked what he just did was, that's also just my opinion.

       You know this is a real place, right? I mean that Comet Pizza is a real, physical, place, where you can go, sit down, and eat pizza. I just started reading about this Pizzagate thing, and it's kind of mind-blowing, as someone who lives in the DC region. You know you can go there, day or night, and visit, right? It's not a sex dungeon. Because again, it's a real place, a pizza place, where people go to eat and hang out. It's open to the public, and I hear it's pretty good. I don't really eat pizza because dairy messes with my stomach, and I don't play ping pong, but still.

       I never said it would, but Reddit is under no obligation to host discussion of any topic, and when there's literal doxxing going on, they don't want to get sued, so it makes sense why they banned it.

       I think that's mostly because people were focusing on the literal pizza aspect and not the whole picture, some of the theories were way out there and had no basis in reality but the links between high level politicians/authority figures in DC seemed to be too coincidental, I don't think pizzagate was a distraction in its entirety but I do believe there was information sprinkled in meant to distract people and deter people.

       Incorrect, it's never been investigated to discover CHILD victims. Most children cannot make their own criminal complaints. This is the point of the researchers, there is more than enough evidence to investigate, but it hasn't occurred. Why? They're not allowed to given the targets are in almost every seat of power.

       It amazes me that people keep bringing up that email with a straight face, and also saddens me to think about how lonely and disconnected from other human beings the people who think it's suspicious must be.

       I've spent years prosecuting crimes, including sex crimes, in my county. I've run task force operations with local and federal law enforcement. I've assisted in drafting search warrant affidavits. The pizza gate evidence from wikileaks is ample probable cause to support an investigation.

       There is a great deal of evidence and those children should be interviewed asap. Unfortunately, the Evie, the baby streamed 24/7, cannot call the police to complain.

       No. There is none. Zero. Nada. Zilch. There is absolutely zero evidence suggesting the kids might have been abused, tying the grandmother to abuse, suggesting the kids were entering an abusive environment, and so on. If there was, you'd post it instead of vague, nebulous nonsense. You don't because it doesn't exist.

       Look I'm not going to downvote you because it would probably give conspiracy folks more vindication that "powerful forces" are trying to silence your message, but if your message is that normal people don't enjoy kids having fun at their events/parties, I think you need to revaluate your message. I have young nephews and nieces, and my family has fun watching them run around and act ridiculous and, yes, sometimes play in a pool or the ocean or a lake. That's how people work. Kids are funny, and a lot of people enjoy their company. It has nothing to do with sex. I can't believe I need to explain this.

       This is a good point.  On the other hand this could be a negative.  I am following the Danny Masterson allegations and it seems that Scientology's ability to did their tentacles into one department, L.A., led to the burial of the allegations against Masterson.  Im not advocating more oversight by state or federal officers over local officers but I am afraid that it is easier to bury a story buying off one jurisdiction than it is in the UK where it sounds like I would have to pay off local, national, and even MPs to silence my problems.

       Yeah, maybe we should just stop talking about possible child abuse rings
       <em>
        just incase
       </em>
       a crazy person tries to take things into their own hands. (Not that I actually believe that whole thing wasn't just an attempt to make people like you blame the people
       <em>
        talking

       about it for the actions of an individual)

       I mean, while we're at it, maybe we should just stop talking about

       conspiracies involving living persons just incase a mentally ill person does something stupid.

       psstt... that's part of the plan of the jewish world conspiracy... i've seen many homeless people that were part of it too. They would make you believe they're harmless, but then someday.
Well some of that jewish conspiracy weren't jewish at all, okay to be correct it was only two persons out of 26, but they must be the masters behind those evil plans. :)

       WHY?
      </p>
      <p>
       Simple.  At the time of the article Alefantis was dating David Brock.  Brock was for all intents and purpose the head of the DNC propaganda arm.  Clearly Brock was and is far more powerful or influential yet not on the list.....; WHY?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because putting Brock on the list would blow his cover and operation. so instead of Brock they put his lover who also happens to run a very popular pizza place that hosts major politicians regularly....
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW it is a subjective fucking list for all we know maybe james blew the dude who wrote it and gave him $1500.

       pizzagate is related to James Alefantis and Comet Ping Pong, John Podesta, his emails and and others mentioned in connection to those. Just because those people know people in hollywood, does not make the abuse in hollywood part of pizzagate.

       If you want to start something new about all the pedophilia and abuse scandals going on around the country and the world, thats fine, but it doesnt make everything involved with pizzagate.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Nope. Everyone agrees pedophilia and child abuse are real, and everyone also agrees that when people in power are guilty of it, they are often protected by those around them. There have been many examples of this, and no doubt there will be many more.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why the pizzagate folks have attempted to move the goalposts and say it's about child abuse in general. Because the Alefantis and Podesta accusations lack a pretty crucial thing if you're going to accuse someone of abusing child:
       <em>
        actual victims
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey, if we can just say that pizzagate = all child abuse, then we can do like OP is trying to do and anytime an example of abuse happens we can say, "See, proof that pizzagate is real!"

       I think you should really think critically about your argument. It is possible there's more general child molesting going on and pizzagate was half truths meant to lead people away from the truth

       Alefantis is great friends with Michael Maccoby whose son is a director of friends of the orphans, the charity Laura Silsby was given children from(for child trafficking). Max Maccoby, director of friends of the orphans, also represented James alefantis and David Brock for a $850,000 blackmail case (I'll link with all the info). Alefantis had several strange photos of children on his Instagram, most with jokes of selling children.

       I think pizzagate was a series of leads that just went way off the rails.  I don't believe comet ping pong is a sex dungeon, or the spirit cooking, satanism, cannibalism stuff.

       However, I do not find it far fetched that the rumors about Epstein's island are true and there is a very large crowd of the world's elite including Hollywood, politicians, musicians, etc. That engage in very sinister sexual acts and use drugs openly together at these parties.  People like these would kill for a place where the boys/girls are provided and won't tell anyone and you don't have to worry about cameras.

       The "pizzagate was olitically motivated" argument is a tried and true strawman the media came up with back last November/December...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sad that we all had to come out and make it known that our investigation wasn't politically motivated. Infact, this whole sub largely rejects the two party system. We just wanted to expose bad people, regardless of party affiliation, but they branded us as an alt-right witch hunt.

       Nobody is denying the Franklin Scandal which implicated high level republicans. Nobody is denying Dennis Hastert, longest serving Rep. speaker (and best friend of Tony Podesta) was a pedophile. So stop using that bullshit.

       Haha...you have much to learn
      </p>
      <p>
       Not every single detail of the massive investigation known as "pizzagate" has to do with comet ping pong, James alefantis, and John podesta.
      </p>
      <p>
       And not every detail is agreed upon by every user here. But the media backlash, the censorship, the staged shooting at the pizza place, those are all classic reactions by TPTB to something very real. Many of us watched pizzagate unfold from the start,
I can assure you it is not a "hoax"...
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus why does PG always have to be associated with the wacky idea of a sexy dungeon in comet ping pong? Lol...very few of us ever implied that. It can be a broad term used to describe all the revelations that came about last October following the podesta email leaks.

       We have our first "catch of the day" I see...

       The root of the investigation is the emails pal, not the translation guide you speak of. And these codewords were confirmed by actual Anonymous pedophiles and members of that "culture" who frequent 4 chan.

       Ok, Columbo, what is John's "pizza related handkerchief"? The fuck is he talking about? It surely isn't an actual handkerchief with a "pizza map" on it. Is it drugs? If you admit they're referring to drugs, than you admit the code words mean SOMETHING.

       instead of asking someone who wasnt involved in the conversation to explain their words, the burden of proof is on the person alleging that this conversation is indication of a child sex ring
      </p>
      <p>
       as for your second example, I like your strategy. Accuse someone of sexual abuse, then build the case retroactively by viewing all their actions as sexual abuse.

       Honestly man, we're all just fucking tired of dealing with people like you who shit on independent Investigatory work. I just find it extremely odd how defensive and protective, in a Conspiracy related sub, some of you can be regarding elite public figures who have done NOTHING to benefit your lives, and done NOTHING for you to give them the benefit of the doubt in this...
      </p>
      <p>
       You can hide behind, "well I'm just being skeptical and thinking critically like a good theorist should!", but at the end of the day your stance of plugging your ears and talking down to anyone putting in the work, is not only childish but an embarrassment to the nature of this sub...

       base your independent investigations on facts, dont jump to conclusions, stop doxxing the wrong people

       just do a good fucking job and the work would unimpeachable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead we have quite the opposite. My guess would be thats because the investigation is working backwards: starting with a desired conclusion and riding the confirmation bias train around and back to that conclusion in a pointless circle, tossing aside evidence that doesnt fit and forcing the rest in
      </p>
      <p>
       I think youre wrong about most of the sub buying into pizzagate. SInce we've stopped being bombarded by it in inorganic fashion the sub has definitely turned. I havent seen that argumentum ad populum (Based on an untruth in the first place) in a while but its great to have you guys back.

       well if they dont bring pizzagate back from the dead, it seems pizzagate WAS a hoax, and that would make them have to admit they were wrong about something they were zealots about, and THAT is a bad, unacceptable feeling!

       Right.  And Oswald acted alone, 9/11 was masterminded by OBL and fluoride is good for you.  What are you doing here?  And if pizzagate is a "hoax" maybe you can explain why my local news did an excellent investigative piece on it.

       I haven't seen that Ben Swan segment in a long time and god damn it's good. Pizzagate is very compelling and perhaps what's more compelling is the paid resistance to push back in astroturfing campaigns.

       I seen people investigating a pedo ring. It seemed the staring point was a pizza place in DC. Maybe you should check more sources so you didn't get tricked into saying pizza gate was only about a pizza place in DC. Maybe someone had a good reason not to believe James Alefantis. That doesn't mean everyone investigating the pedo ring had the same idea.

       Dude. Trump said in an interview Epstein was a terrific guy he'd known for 15 years and who liked women just like he does. He admitted it!
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no evidence Trump banged a kid but him and Epstein were both accused of raping one AND Epstein plead the 5th amendment when asked directly about him and Trump. His own brother gave sworn testimony he rode with them on the Lolita Express yet no manifests exist. You don't think a billionaire can cover something up with hush money?

       You've stated a few facts and used leading questions and statements. You're arguing Trump's name isn't on there because he planned on running for president, is a billionaire, and an acquaintance makes him off the books, but a sitting president (26 rides on Lolita express) isn't powerful enough... Bill Clinton. And other billionaires (Rothschild) aren't either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, Epstein is quite introverted and cautious. It is definitely possible there is more to his relationship with Trump. I can't rule that out as a conspiracy theorist. You helped me realize I might be a little biased so thanks for that. Good day sir.

       To be fair, an erroneous report linking Epstein to Anthony Weiner is what caused people to look into pedophilia among Dems in the first place. The first place they looked was Podesta's emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Buzzfeed had it right but had to back away from this because the public isn't supposed to know the Clintons were involved with Epstein and his crew. The press intentionally limited Pizzagate to a pizza place basement.

      <p>
       It's ok though. Hollywood blog, Crazy Days and Nights, will soon break that Singer and Spacey (and perhaps Geffen) were having sex with kids on Epstein's island. It's all coming out whether they try to distract from it or not.

       People either seem to care about those abused or seek to only use them as a political weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not really sure how the public isn't supposed to know something that's common knowledge. Although there has to be massive amounts of blackmail and payoffs to keep people silent and manifests buried.

       You realize using quotes means it's supposed to be something someone actually said right? Here's the actual quote:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life."
      </p>

       Hmm. Yeah that looks very bad. How can we spin that to look good? Oh I know! Say he's undercover!

       Those dozens of suspicious emails with obvious code usage were debunked? Those dozens of Instagram pictures from CPP were debunked? Those spirit cooking emails and pictures were debunked? Those

       Reddit doesn't want a witch-hunt, remember guys? Don't need subs like pizzagate and pedogate exposing too many people and asking questions that need to be asked. Also, don't forget, when you get too close to the truth, your posts will be edited by Reddit to include false info.

       The shills jump on board at the term "pizzagate." Look at this thread... Subtle lies being spread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is real = Pedogate = Hollywood. 
 Pizzagate is not a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Easy dots to connect. How was pizzagate defeated in the media if the pedos arent all on the same team?

       Soon pizzagate advocates will be saying "who's Alefantis?". People can't handle the embarrassment of being wrong. It's like Gamergate and Zoe Quinn all over again.

       I know right, they will do anything to protect their perfect little strawman that Pizzagate was about an outrageous conspiracy theory spread by conservative neo Nazis being manipulated by Russian propaganda, all at the mouthpiece of one convenient gatekeeper Alex Jones, who's ridiculous but strategic statements result in quite the effective psyop to the masses as they use this 'controlled opposition' as a tool. Meanwhile poor Edgar strolls into the innocent neighborhood pizza place 'demanding answers' and waving a gun because his poor little brain was manipulated..."this is why conspiracy theories are dangerous" says the puppeteers, and the hammer has struck the nail, they build on that and now use it to completely burn down their tiny little strawman, "Pedogate is all these creepy entertainers!" They say as they shove made men like Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein under the bus with a suitcase of cash and a one way ticket to a "small island off the coast of Japan" just like their pal Denny Hastert.

       Uh guys, the pizzagate subreddit wasn't shut down because it was full of crazy rantings, or because it was or wasn't "correct". It was shut down because one of you nutjobs walked into a pizza place full of families, children, and started shooting the place up.

       But I t's pretty sad you admit Trump knew in 2002 his friend was a child sex pimp yet he didn't tell anyone and instead just decided to "signal" it in a magazine interview.
