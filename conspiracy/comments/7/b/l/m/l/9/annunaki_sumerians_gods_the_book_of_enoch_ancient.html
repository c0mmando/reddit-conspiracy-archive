        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This post will probably get buried because it doesn’t include any political bullshit but it’s something I️ have been researching extensively and am very interested in. I’ve been fascinated recently with our origins, ancient history, Egypt, Babylon, Sumer, Genesis, the Book of the Dead, Book of Enoch, Genesis from the Bible, and Graham Hancock’s alternative view of ancient civilization.</p>

<p>More importantly, I’m interested in our ancestors and how they acquire intelligence, if it was gradual or instantaneous. I’ve been very perplexed on some of the stories of ancient times and I’ve come to my own hypothesis that we are indeed a hominoid of sorts. I️ believe the missing link that humanity hasn’t disclosed is that the Nethanderals were “the human race” as we know it, distinct from monkeys and apes. I️ believe for whatever reason these Aliens or Gods, I️ use the words interchangeably, came here to fuse their DNA and create the Homo sapiens that we know today.</p>

<p>Why they came here? Apparently for resources and I️ think one of the primary ones was Gold, hence ancient historical cultures fascination with Gold to show richness or divineness, or even currency. </p>

<p>I️ believe the “experiment” went wrong, and since most of humanity in 3000BC+ seemed pretty localized in Northern Africa and the Middle East, these Gods, Annunaki, Aliens or whatever flooded the region destroying most of humanity minus the survivors. This story will eventually bring to fruition the Epic of Gilgamesh and the flood story in Genesis.</p>

<p>I’m looking for someone much smarter than I️ am to build off this theory, or perhaps mention other works that touch down on the topic. Hieroglyphics, Cave paintings depicting creatures from the sky. It all seems interconnected. I️ believe in the near future the governments will be disclosing that “aliens” are real. We’ve known about them since Roswell and perhaps before. They’ve worked with world leaders including Russia during the Cold War and that’s where a lot of our technology comes from.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if these creatures are the same ones that fused with humanity thousands of years ago, but I️ do believe some very important high up people have knowledge of this and are threatened into silence for fear of their and their family’s life.</p>

<p>What are your opinions, thoughts, sources or recommended texts on the topic? </p>

<p>Another book I&#39;m reading that might interest you is &#39;The Genesis 6 Conspiracy&#39; by Gary Wayne. If you read Genesis 6 in the old testament, it talks about the Nephilim. Gary Wayne talks about how those Nephilim bloodlines survived the flood into the post deluvian world and currently control the world. It would explain their need for inbreeding to try and keep their nephilim bloodlines as undiluted as possible. </p>

<p>Even before reading Book of Enoch, I had always leaned towards the fallen angel view of Genesis 6. 1 Enoch has a lot of validity that the other Apocrypha lack (including 2 &amp; 3 Enoch, I wouldn&#39;t trust those so much). </p>

<p>I&#39;d be careful with that line of reasoning. If the same people controlled the narrative back then who control it now then that is exactly what they&#39;d want you to think if these spirits or demons as they call them are actually trying to help us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this. I feel like the &quot;all aliens have ill intentions&quot; and &quot;all aliens or spirits are demons&quot; is more boogeyman strawmen from people at the tippy-top that want to keep their feudal serfdom here on Gaia going in perpetuity. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been watching a lot of a YouTube commentator named Aug Tellez. I find him to be fascinating and brilliant but one thing I find odd is that he rejects sacred geometry and maintains that elements like Metatron&#39;s Cube are functions of AI or control and we need to &quot;break free&quot; of them. Why would sacred geometry be hidden from the public, and as soon as we plebes start putting 2-and-2 together and realize that geometric patterns are in flora, fauna, ancient architecture, temples, etc... now all of a sudden it&#39;s something &quot;evil&quot; to &quot;avoid.&quot;</p>

<p>I feel like when I start looking at the Exit door in our holographic matrix, there&#39;s always some messenger telling me the doom and gloom that awaits me on the other side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, all of it feels like a variation of the blind men and the elephant.  Where I do sense big time connections is in the intersection of stuff like ancient myths, NDEs, psychic phenomena, ayahuasca visions, abduction experiences, etc., etc., ad infinitum.  I don&#39;t doubt that different people, groups and lore react to these phenomena in different ways - whether to hoard whatever they&#39;ve got for power or to embark on a quest to find truths or whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find this interesting:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not too long ago someone posted a link to a document in the CIA&#39;s official government website library. It is the overview of their investigation of the Monroe Institute&#39;s Gateway Experience. For those who have not heard of the Monroe Institute, they were an organization dedicated to exploring astral projection and mapping put the world one can access through this practice. They developed a method for synchronizing brain activity between the two hemispheres in order to help induce this altered state of consciousness that they named Hemisync, which can be bought from them or &quot;downloaded&quot;. From what I can tell in their effort to essentially weaponize astral projection the CIA ended up having a reverse Event Horizon experience where they discovered the astral plane in its entirety and discovered many things in the process. The document goes over such subjects as the toroidal nature of our universe and how it explains cosmic inflation, how human consciousness functions, how astral projection actually works, and details on the astral plane itself all from a scientific perspective. The big thing to stand out though is something that they call the Absolute, which they say they found at the end of all the astral dimensions. It is described as having no beginning, no end, no locality, and as infinite conscious energy at rest. It permeates every instance of time and space, existing everywhere and everywhen at once. If that isn&#39;t God I don&#39;t know what is. </p>

<p>Read and decide for yourself: <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf">https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf</a></p>

<p>For those with shorter attention spans, the first mention of the Absolute is in the section titled &quot;The Time Space Dimension&quot;. I would highly recommend reading it in its entirety however, as you miss crucial info otherwise.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw an alien once while staying at my friends house in my teens. We would sleep out in his garage. I walked outside to take a piss and when I had finished I looked up and noticed it. It was about 7-8 feet tall had black eyes little to no nose and was pale or white. I have never in my life experienced terror like I felt that night. The only thing that existed in my mind was to get away as quickly as possible. This doesn&#39;t mean that all aliens are evil or whatever but I felt nothing from malice from that particular being.</p>

<p>Notes: It was in the country, There was a streetlight attached to the power pole next to his house close to the location I was pissing, and there were no drugs or alcohol of any sort involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh I ran into the damn garage and yelled that there was something outside. My friends ran out the door to see it but it had already moved although one of my friends claimed he saw it peeking around the corner of the building then took off really fast as soon as it saw him looking at it. I have had multiple times where I am sure that I have been visited while I was asleep. Every time has been a horrifying experience to me. Note I am not saying they are evil but that they terrify me on a level that is hard to comprehend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m replying to you so I get both of you.</p>

<p>If you are open to aliens, and demons can masquerade as anything they like, then they certainly could appear as benevolent aliens. The vast majority of spirit encounters will start off this way, in order to gain your trust. After all, it is easy to spot a distruth, but much harder to spot a half-truth.</p>

<p>The corruption of the narrative is a valid concern - one only has to look any many modern churches to see true this is - that said, if you do believe a omnipotent God created the world, and will eventually come to reclaim it, it isn&#39;t a stretch to believe He would ensure his truth would be preserved throughout the ages regardless of the TPTB&#39;s intentions. The problem therefore becomes ensuring the doctrine you ascribe to is the uncorrupted one. </p>

<p>How interesting if there are still huge monolithic stones nearby Mount Hermon including a gigantic ancient platform that others later built on top of and also other ancient stone blocks that are upwards of 1,650 tons? What was really going on thousands of years ago if a typical tower crane is said to have a maximum load of about 18 metric tons? And what do people ever learn about in public school?</p>

<p>&quot;4:5 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</p>

<p>&quot;2:1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</p>

<p>2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against <strong>YHWH</strong>, and against his anointed, saying,</p>

<p>2:3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</p>

<p>2:4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: <strong>YHWH</strong> shall have them in derision.&quot;
-Psalm 2:1-4 (RNKJV)</p>

-Isaiah 24:21 (RNKJV)</p>

<p>&quot;25:7 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.</p>

<p>25:8 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Master <strong>YHWH</strong> will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for <strong>YHWH</strong> hath spoken it.</p>

<p>25:9 And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our Elohim; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is <strong>YHWH</strong>; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the post - I love this discussion!  </p>

<p>Watching Ancient Aliens and reading the books of Joseph McMonagle, coupled with some of my own research into consciousness and the nature of reality, leads implacably to the idea that advanced beings of some kinds did visit this planet and either create us or enhance us in some fundamental and key way.  But I have to say, I think the connection is more expansive than gold or slave labor or anything material.  In fact, I&#39;m starting to give serious consideration to the simulation theory.  It&#39;s frustrating because sometimes I wonder if I have the cognitive ability to even begin to grasp the concepts at play here.</p>

<p>I do recommend Joe M.&#39;s book The Ultimate Time Machine.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The short answer (for me, anyway) is that it destroys religious dogma while also legitimizing its origins, which is frustrating.</p>

<p>Or - it seeks to &quot;explain&quot; the prison we&#39;re stuck in along with some of its lies - but it&#39;s still a prison we&#39;re stuck in with a bunch of lies.</p>

<p>Also, ST doesn&#39;t dangle any promises of an afterlife, or attempt to control with fear; rather, it attempts to explain these as &#39;exploitable mechanisms&#39; within the &#39;sim&#39;.</p>

<p>So it becomes just another way to explain &#39;creationism&#39; from a perspective that the people of this age can now understand in new ways.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the ST model may be flawed, but no where near as much as ancient ones were, which may be an important step in our understanding of our place in the universe.</p>

<p>The new model seems like it&#39;s based on exposing the true nature of our existence, making it less likely to be used as a tool of further suppression by the &quot;powers that be&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alternatively, it is a nihilistic simplification of the true story, (in my mind) which could alternatively be either 1) purported by TPTB (I don&#39;t think it can claim any less influence by the rulers) or 2) a recent, organic theory that nevertheless is the product of a civilization that has long passed its prime.</p>

<p>Considering how the 2nd law of thermodynamics is considered the most basic and irrefutable law of our physical world, it seems foreign to me that we don&#39;t acknowledge that everything in this universe, us included, is in a deteriorated state compared to earlier times. This means that any of our ancestors would be not only physically more capable than us, but mentally more so as well. Now, obviously our knowledge as a collective has increased, but I believe an individual&#39;s intellect is but a fraction of what it was a few millennia ago. Just look back 300 years to how our ancestors wrote!</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say I disagree with anything you&#39;re saying - I like to speculate on any possible angle though. Try not to be dismissive of the great minds of today who are really excited about these ideas, with the complete opposite of nihilism driving the work they do in an attempt to further man&#39;s knowledge.</p>

<p>Of course we&#39;d have to suppose there was a special &#39;Matrix outside the Matrix&#39; for those guys too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries friend.</p>

<p>Perhaps that it challenges the &#39;omnipotent&#39; part - or gives it relevance (which is oxymoronic, I know). This is kind of what attracts me to it. The dogmatic model expects us to believe that the almighty creator of everything possesses a lot of petty, human-like qualities.</p>

<p>This was necessary in the old days, because the people needed to be able to &#39;identify&#39; with their god to a certain extent to understand their faith.</p>

<p>Today, too many people just can&#39;t accept that. In my opinion there are things about both models that inform each other. They are both incomplete; I just choose to look at it as another step towards understanding the bigger picture.</p>

While it is true a subsystem may experience temporary negative entropy (meaning less chaotic, improvement, reverse-&#39;deterioration&#39;) another subsytem has to pick up the slack and therefore degrades even quicker. However, it is more reasonable (and consistent with observations) that in reality, pretty much every subsystem continually degrades with time, rather than the above case.  </p>

<p>I still don&#39;t understand how people will buy into simulation but not other, established religions, since the belief is more or less the same. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it&#39;s inarguable that there is an intelligence of some kind or a vast reality or series of realities that exist, for us, behind a one-way mirror.  But established religion is basically interpretation, so for me it&#39;s just about what truths exist within them rather than the full body of dogma &amp; tradition.</p>

<p>Enhance, or greatly corrupt? </p>

<p>Or both maybe?  Maybe different kinds of entities, or individuals within a single group but with different agendas?  I don&#39;t even pretend to grasp the many, many different possibilities but there are clear indications of a more advanced presence here that run the gamut from helpers to destroyers and everything in between.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What most people choke on with ST is taking it too literally, mistakenly thinking the &#39;simulation&#39; is meant to represent something exactly like it, only &quot;real&quot;.</p>

<p>That is only one definition of the word though. For instance, the video game &quot;Pong&quot; is a simulation of &quot;Ping Pong&quot;, which is a simulation of &quot;Tennis&quot; - which itself is a simulation of one-on-one combat. We use &quot;dumbed-down&quot; versions of systems to observe and learn about their &quot;higher&quot; counterparts.</p>

<p>So it only takes a few steps from this to understand &quot;creationism&quot; from a perspective that makes more since than trying to envision the &quot;almighty creator&quot; as having the same petty traits as the &quot;god&quot; of the first testament.</p>

<p>Also, there&#39;s no reason to believe that the &quot;too literal&quot; interpretation I mention above isn&#39;t happening AS WELL - ON TOP of whatever &quot;reality&quot; it&#39;s meant to represent.</p>

<p>Agree.  I think we puny humans are capable of glimpsing or sensing the bits and pieces of what&#39;s probably still bits and pieces of whatever whole exists, but contemplating it, I feel like a bacterium in a drop of mist.</p>

Pyramids, tombs flooded with liquid mercury, ancient remains of a red-haired race of man, and much more all can be found here as well as the Baigong pipes and much more.

<p>It&#39;s not impossible that aliens don&#39;t exist, just highly unlikely. You have a significantly much better chance at winning the super 8 power Ball that life only exists on earth in this extremely vast universe, maybe unless this universe is indeed a simulation. The nearest star to us asside from the Sun is 4 light-years away, which is an extremely small distance in the grand scale of this universe. It would take the closest aliens many dozens, hundreds, or more generations to reach earth without faster than light travel/warpdrive, wormholes, or teleportation.</p>

<p>There are many reports of highly advanced UFOs and whatnot with highly advanced abilities and other encounters and whatnot.</p>

<p>Check out &quot;Unsealed: Alien Files&quot;. It&#39;s on Netflix. It covers a range of things on aliens and UFOs and whatnot. It covers documented siting, such as the Battle of Los Angeles where a UFO appeared off the coast not long after pearl harbour and the military/navy launched a bunch of artillery at it and it did not damage, then it wondered off. The official story was that it was a &quot;weather balloon&quot;. The show covers many reports by military too and whatnot and other things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The antideluvian period described by Enoch is the same story as that of the Sumerians, annunaki, and other ancient religions, from the opposing perspective.</p>

<p>Enoch:
God didn&#39;t make man to be slaves, he made man and gave him <em>dominion</em> over the Earth. Something never given the Angels. A group of them rebelled, first coming to man in the &quot;garden&quot; and deceiving them to eat of that &quot;tree&quot; (ideology). Which Adam and Eve fell for. Once man was cast out and began to multiply, these rebellious Angels took it another step and bore children (nephilim, the source of all evil spirits upon the Earth) which were part divine (Gilgamesh in the Sumerian tablets is describes as 2/3 divine, one of these in Enoch is described the same). IMO this is the source of all the abandoned ancient pyramids. The &quot;knowledge&quot; given man by eating of this tree and the sacrifice and servitude of these people to the Angels effectively put these rebellious Angels in the place of God over men, the desire of Lucifer or Abbaddon or &quot;shining one&quot; or whatever you want to call their leader. For 2k years there was this &quot;chaos&quot; of man following these teachings. At the point in which there was no one left on Earth save Noah and his family who didn&#39;t bow to these beings and their teachings, we get the flood. </p>

<p>Sumerians and other ancient religions are the antithesis to the thesis given by God. While these beings are above us in terms of &quot;knowledge&quot; they lack our creative (procreative) capacity, therefore they are below us, and when we find our way out of this mess they will serve us, after God of course. Many stories of these annunaki and other grey or what have you &quot;aliens&quot; speak of their inability to procreate. This isn&#39;t due to whatever calamity they made up for our consumption, it is by design.</p>

<p>Would a comet that hit at the end of the ice age in a certain spot cause ice to melt causing a flood so devastating it could replace the story of Noah? &#39;The Younger Dryas&#39; is said to have caused the northern ice sheet to flood coastal cities and caused Negroid-Mongoloid&#39;s to migrate south, as far as South Africa. What did Plato say about the cataclysm? Were there fire balls from the sky, then floods? The evidence of the flood on the Mississippi river at the city of Cahokia can still be seen as in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>C. The collision that caused our asteroid belt; was this the &#39;flood&#39; we know of from a time when they openly discussed &#39;Gods&#39; having children with &#39;Daughters of men&#39;? This has to be interpreted correctly, are we talking about ET causing the cataclysm of Earth some 13,000 years ago? Did Utnapishtim (From The Epic of Gilgamesh ) who tells of the flood know who the Anunnaki represented? </p>

<p>The Younger Dryas event was depicted in this stone from Göbekli Tepe dated some 13,000 years ago. The Shaman&#39;s of Göbekli Tepe seemed to have knowledge of the event with waves and fire depicting the cataclysm. Do we really buy that the pyramids and these monoliths were constructed and moved in to place by humans so long ago all by themselves? I would gladly buy your story if there is a rational explanation for all the stonework of ancient times and how immaculate the work was. BTW, there seems to be references to astrological star constellations at Göbekli Tepe way before the Greeks and Romans started using the references.</p>

<p>And if we&#39;ve mixed up &quot;Aliens&quot; with Gods, so what? I think people would care to know some of their mythos may have been a species not of this Earth.

<p>Angels have a great amount of power. They would be more than capable of building anything, in fact they probably had parts in creating the universe, so a pyramid wouldn&#39;t be a big deal. Most people today wouldn&#39;t find this explanation rational though. </p>

<p>It leaves out the only way to eternal life. And I didn&#39;t say Gods, I said Fallen Angels. Also &quot;Aliens&quot; denotes another species which develops like us. Angels were spoken into existence at full capacity. God just is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think people would care to know some of their mythos may have been a species not of this Earth.</p>

<p>They do know. The Greek and Roman gods, as well as all other religions deities/gods were not of this Earth. The Angels are not of this Earth. God isn&#39;t of this Earth. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean, you&#39;d want to know who you&#39;re worshiping right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ahem... The greeks and especially the Romans are from a historical point of view really young civilizations... even here in middle europe they had cult places and sort of temples related to the astrological system... Without looking for the correct time line i vaguely remember that was starting about 4000bc when the neolithic revolution arrived in middle europe. Some theories point to the possibilty that those who brought the neolithic revolution to europe could be the descendants or people from the culture of Göbekli Tepe or just other cultures from the agais or balkan that came in contact with this culture.
Science/archeology will find new evidences and hints that may someday will show the events and time more clearly.</p>

<p>However if find that era most interesting and fascinating, as it presents a major part of the culmination of the societies from which we evolved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s not going to be off when it comes to something like carbon dating if the Flood really happened and yet a carbon dating process assumes an amount of Carbon-14 being produced in the atmosphere has always been equal to an amount being removed? </p>

<p>If fossil fuels are primarily the result of the Flood and the biosphere just prior to the Flood had 500 times more carbon in living organisms than today, then what should we expect to find? And what does not suggest there was a much different atmosphere with more plant life in the past if there are a) fossilized forests in Antarctica and if b) amber bubbles have far more oxygen than the atmosphere in modern time and c) you consider how much oil is found around gulfs and if d) you consider mega fauna?</p>

What&#39;s not pretty compelling evidence if Yellowstone contains 80% of the world&#39;s geysers and Snake River Plain is flowing from it toward the Channeled Scablands?</p>

<p>And consider how much exposed sedimentary rock (essentially mud turned to rock?) is nearby Yellowstone and how close it is to Barringer Crater and Grand Canyon and Great Salt Lake and Monument Valley and Rainbow Bridge and Petrified Forest National Park and Algodones Dunes and Morrison Formation and the Ogallala Aquifer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Enoch says the Fallen angels were thrown into the abyss until the time of the end, however their children were left to roam the earth as evil spirits (This is what you&#39;re talking to when dealing with channeling). Revelation says they would be released to once again propagate their agenda. I think they have already been released, and their ideology is present in this quickly spreading &quot;new age&quot; religion, where man is an immortal soul independent of God. Zionism is just a small part of this. The star on Israel&#39;s flag is much older than David, and can be found in many pagan religions. They do not serve the God of the Bible (Their leaders, just like in America the people really don&#39;t know squat.). This &quot;new world order&quot; our leaders keep working towards is a return to the Roman system of governance. Over the next few years watch as Church and State intermingle to form a new &quot;Holy Roman Empire.&quot; The pope will be the head of this religion. He already speaks in the UN as a representative of all religion.</p>

<p>These are things that must happen for Biblical prophecy to be completed. Everything and I mean everything prophesied by Ezekiel, Daniel, and Jesus has come true. All of it. As far as the Revelation of John goes, the Governmental powers of this new world order are quickly closing in on the last countries not under their umbrella (if any actually are outside of it, I get the feeling NK is just a puppet. Did you Know that Saddam and both Bushes are high ranking members of Freemasonry? They play both sides of invented quarrels to push peoples mindset into the desired direction, look up Hegelian Doctrine and follow it from the Jesuits through all secret societies.)  and it will not be long until that is fulfilled, leaving only the aspect of worldwide religion, followed by the persecution of those who keep the testimony of Jesus.
The plan, as I understand it, is to kill Protestant Christianity (Catholicism is actually quite at odds with the teachings of Jesus) and Atheism in one swoop, leaving the global new age religion in its place.  I&#39;m not sure how they&#39;d do this. &quot;Aliens&quot; maybe? I guess it could be the return of the anti-deluvian gods? That&#39;s just speculation on my end, I don&#39;t know how it will come about, just that to complete the last bit of unfulfilled prophecy it must happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent summary, thank you. I did not know that about Saddam being a free mason, but that makes total sense. </p>

<p>I agree with all of what you are saying. I don’t know how they are going to usher in this new global religion, but the alien idea seems to be a likely route. The new age religion has always given me such a bad feeling, one that I could never put my finger on when I was younger. It is only after the last few years of really trying to understand the foundations of how I was raised as a Christian did I start to realize the bigger picture here. But it all seems so clear to me now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d rather stick to science. ;)</p>

<p>Regarding the Aliens, well there could be some, but define them. I do strongly believe that there&#39;s a good chance that on any other planet of the galaxy or universe there could be other life forms.
But what kind of life forms? Well plants are a form of life as are bacterias. Also it&#39;s possible that there could be intelligent life forms. And to add to this, the universe is several billions of years old, we humanity evolved slowly 2 Million years ago, with us the homo sapiens being just a few hundred thousand years old.
This could lead to the idea that there were probably intelligent civilisations that existed before we as homo sapiens evolved. Maybe there will be one when the earth ceased to exist.</p>

<p>One silly point, the neanderthals were another kind of the homo Family, who got out of africa thousands of years before homo sapiens. Then when homo sapiens went out of africa they mixed up to some extend. That&#39;s why every race, excluding africans, has 1-4% of neanderthal and denovali genes.</p>

<p>I especially find the time 20.000 to 1000BC really interesting and i think a great part of the myths have it&#39;s origin there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s totally wrong in facts. From where you got such stupid racist nonsene. Then in other words it says the africans are less intelligent by nature.</p>

<p>First of all you may want to take notice that to the population with neanderthal genes consists also of Aborigines, Inuit, the tribes of Papua, Afghans, the native Americans and a all other non-african ethnies. 
I slected some of them because they literally still live in the stone age, as our ancestors did and the neanderthals too.
When the homo sapiens arrived in the Levante and spread over the world he was still living as hunters and collectors.</p>

<p>The revolutionary thing when civilization made big step Forwards began with the neolithical revolution, when in the middle east
agriculture and livestock evolved.
As you might imagine, this Kind of civilization would not work in each region of the world, try agriculture in the north or in a desert. That&#39;s why the Inuit or many other tribes still sticked to the hunters and collectors thing to get their food.</p>

<p>The good thing with the neolithic revolution was that it produced more food to feed the people, so population grows and not every hand is needed to produce food, so then the specialization started and craftsmen also came up. And things advanced further an further...</p>

<p>The neanderthals maybe got extinct in the same way as it happened to the great mass of native americans when they got in contact with the conquistadores. Maybe they were exposed to infections their immune system didn&#39;t knew yet. MAybe other facts were responsible or a mix of different developements culminated for the worst possible case for them.
We don&#39;t know it exactly but it&#39;S not a coincidence that their dissapearing is overlapping with the time when homo sapiens came into play.</p>

<p>And a honest last question, how does it correlate with the genes of the neanderthal, that i know of a lot of less intelligent white People and there are so many black academics?
Could this be more a case of the social environment you grew up, the natural conditions that surround your society, ressources and a lot of other variables that play a role?</p>

Some people don&#39;t know about the first twin towers attack, and these cards reference Reagan &amp; Clinton era.
It could be telling, but honestly I don&#39;t think there would be some Magic the gathering type card game detailing their plots. I think the apocalypse theme of the card game just goes in tandem with most apocalypse theories and doomsday prophecy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all. Actually I think that the tourism of the area would absolutely be required. I visited a cave system in Virginia recently, and you were absolutely not allowed to touch things in the caves. Touching things has its own form of erosion. Many people don&#39;t know that the black stone in Mecca was originally a single piece of material that had been broken into many smaller fragments over time due to the veneration offered and the many hands that would rub it. So no, I don&#39;t think the fence is meant to suppress as much as it is to protect and preserve something already compromised by the weather. 
If anything you&#39;d think the Abrahamic faiths would all be crawling on top of on another to protect these sites, as they are probably some of the lingering evidence. 
Sure, many things could be fabricated at this point. Thousands of years, and countless generations of people have come and gone between then &amp; now. Think of the telephone game when you were a child. The whole point of the game was that everyone who transmitted the message would slightly change it, so whatever biblical doctrines we have now are likely always going to be heavily doctored. 
I&#39;d like to see some of the hidden vaults in the Vatican to see what kind of information they have there. I&#39;d also like to know more about the Vatican deep space observatory that&#39;s actually here in the USA.
That would be interesting to have more information on. Surely the Vatican is aware of some pending event and they&#39;re actually monitoring the skies it would seem to be able to anticipate the arrival of otherworldly beings.
That said, they have also had high standing Jesuits come out and make commentary about aliens being brothers and I believe the current pope even made public comments on our cosmic brethren and them being recognized as originating from the same creator.</p>

<p>You might be preaching to the choir to suggest we should be weary of trusting mainstream churches, but how much has really changed about the Old Testament since the first century if there are mainstream Jews and mainstream Christians who are at odds with one another and yet share a text that can be collaborated with the LXX and the Dead Sea Scrolls?</p>

<p>See how high 1 Enoch and Jubilees are found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls#Biblical_books_found">here</a> and then consider where the Rockefeller Museum is found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls#Current_ownership">here</a>?

    <div class="md"><p>If you watched the series Westworld you might remember mention of a book called &quot;The Rise of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind&quot; by Julian Jaynes.  I read the book based on the mention in the television program, and it BLEW MY MIND!  It doesn&#39;t necessarily speak to Gnostic texts, or the dichotomy between orthodoxy and it&#39;s other, what it DOES talk about is this very interesting ontology that supposes at one time our consciousness was split into two: each human sort of a god-voice and an active physical automaton that was doing the bidding of the god-voice.  Jaynes analyzes things like the Gilgamesh Epic to drive home his point.  Whether this theory is true or not, the conjecture is amazing... and good enough to provide a baseline for a pretty solid HBO show!</p>

<p>But I&#39;m skeptical about the Sitchens shtick on many levels. I think the Gnostic mythology sounds more on point and real (glad to see the Book of Enoch mentioned). OP, you should really check out &quot;Not in HIS Image&quot; by John Lash, about the Gnostic mythology. They said humanity is a divine experiment of a Goddess they called Sophia, who came from elsewhere in the galaxy, but that we have alien enemies in our own solar system who prey on us.</p>

<p>The Sumerians — Last of the Andites</p>

<p>78:8.1 (875.5) When the last Andite dispersion broke the biologic backbone of Mesopotamian civilization, a small minority of this superior race remained in their homeland near the mouths of the rivers. These were the Sumerians, and by 6000 B.C. they had become largely Andite in extraction, though their culture was more exclusively Nodite in character, and they clung to the ancient traditions of Dalamatia. Nonetheless, these Sumerians of the coastal regions were the last of the Andites in Mesopotamia. But the races of Mesopotamia were already thoroughly blended by this late date, as is evidenced by the skull types found in the graves of this era.</p>

<ol>
<li>Early Days of the One Hundred</li>
</ol>

<p>66:4.1 (743.10) The arrival of the Prince’s staff created a profound impression. While it required almost a thousand years for the news to spread abroad, those tribes near the Mesopotamian headquarters were tremendously influenced by the teachings and conduct of the one hundred new sojourners on Urantia. And much of your subsequent mythology grew out of the garbled legends of these early days when these members of the Prince’s staff were repersonalized on Urantia as supermen.</p>

<p>66:4.2 (744.1) The serious obstacle to the good influence of such extraplanetary teachers is the tendency of mortals to regard them as gods, but aside from the technique of their appearance on earth the Caligastia one hundred — fifty men and fifty women — did not resort to supernatural methods nor superhuman manipulations.</p>

<p>66:4.3 (744.2) But the corporeal staff were nonetheless superhuman. They began their mission on Urantia as extraordinary threefold beings:</p>

<p>Even if a novus ordo seclorum is referenced on US dollar bills next to occultic symbolism associated with freemasonry and Egypt, what&#39;s really secular about freemasonry itself? It might very much be a religion and even have it&#39;s own temples and altars and priests, but consider <a href="https://lovetruthsite.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/cults-and-esoterica-295-638.jpg">here</a> and <a href="https://rapsta24.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/0093_12.png">here</a>?
 Where does a saying of &quot;the devil&#39;s in the details&quot; apply more applicably and what has more in common with witchcraft if it embraces Egyptian symbolism and goat images and upside down stars in pentagons and a degree system and is also called the Craft?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aliens is a compelling theory, but I think it is more likely that humanity has experienced a series of rise and fall type scenarios due to natural disasters.</p>

<p>People grow up being taught that we are living in the climax of technology and intelligence. But it is quite obvious that humanity has a case of collective amnesia. Graham Hancock theorizes that human civilization reached another peak of knowledge and technology over 12,000 years ago which was brought to a halt by a meteor impact into a massive glacier, instantly melting it and causing the worldwide flood which shows up in countless cultures mythologies.</p>

<p>I have studied many different flood myths as a result of his theory, and there are so many similar myths that it&#39;s incredibly hard to dismiss it as a mythical event.</p>

<p>Imagine if there was a cataclysmic event that took out all the electrical grids and infrastructure we have ceaselessly built up in the past hundred years. What would we have left? We have begun digitizing most of our knowledge and information, but if you think about it in terms of a cataclysmic event, it is incredibly fragile.</p>

<p>It would not take much to erase the entirety of our compiled knowledge and revert humanity back to an age of passing on information through word of mouth. And the next best way of conserving information is through paper, which as the Library of Alexandria serves as a great example, could be annihilated overnight.</p>

<p>For all we know, humanity in it&#39;s current age of civilization could be humanity part four, and we might not even be at the same level of technology as previous civilizations which have been lost to history. </p>

<p>What do they have in common if not details concerned with nephilim? Doesn&#39;t it seem like someone is trying to suppress stuff like 1 Enoch and Jubilees if they are highly represented among the Dead Sea Scrolls and yet generally unknown in the world and shunned by even synagogues &amp; churches? And see what is said here and notice mention of Mount Hermon?:</p>

<p><a href="http://qbible.com/enoch/7.html">http://qbible.com/enoch/7.html</a></p>

<p>How interesting if there are still huge monolithic stones nearby Mount Hermon including a gigantic ancient platform that others later built on top of and also other ancient stone blocks that are upwards of 1,650 tons? What was really going on thousands of years ago if a typical tower crane is said to have a maximum load of about 18 metric tons? And what do people ever learn about in public school?</p>

<p>What&#39;s not part of conditioning by some powers that be if you consider how often Ancient Aliens has been playing on the History Channel? Do you find it suspicious if there&#39;s a novus ordo seclorum referenced on US dollar bills next to occultic symbolism associated with freemasonry and Egypt? See a nd.edu Latin translator page <a href="http://archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/wordz.pl?keyword=novus+ordo+seclorum">here</a>?</p>

<p>How much sense would it make that beings with two eyes and a nose and a mouth and a ribcage and four limbs would slowly evolve from amino acids on two planets thousands of light years apart? What if we really do have a Creator who made intelligently designed both angels and Adam?</p>

<p>How much sense would it make that beings with two eyes and a nose and a mouth and a ribcage and four limbs would slowly evolve from amino acids on two planets thousands of light years apart?</p>

<p>Quite a lot, actually, if you know how evolution and science works.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What most people choke on with ST is taking it too literally, mistakenly thinking the &#39;simulation&#39; is meant to represent something exactly like it, only &quot;real&quot;.</p>

<p>That is only one definition of the word though. For instance, the video game &quot;Pong&quot; is a simulation of &quot;Ping Pong&quot;, which is a simulation of &quot;Tennis&quot; - which itself is a simulation of one-on-one combat. We use &quot;dumbed-down&quot; versions of systems to observe and learn about their &quot;higher&quot; counterparts.</p>

<p>So it only takes a few steps from this to understand &quot;creationism&quot; from a perspective that makes more since than trying to envision the &quot;almighty creator&quot; as having the same petty traits as the &quot;god&quot; of the first testament.</p>

<p>&quot;4:5 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</p>

<p>4:6 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.&quot;

<p>&quot;2:1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</p>

<p>2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against <strong>YHWH</strong>, and against his anointed, saying,</p>

<p>2:3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.</p>

<p>2:4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: <strong>YHWH</strong> shall have them in derision.&quot;

<p>&quot;25:7 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.</p>

<p>25:8 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Master <strong>YHWH</strong> will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for <strong>YHWH</strong> hath spoken it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might be a deep thinker who looks into what powers are trying to lead us away from.</p>

<p>See how high 1 Enoch and Jubilees are listed here?:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls#Biblical_books_found">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls#Biblical_books_found</a></p>

<p>What do they have in common if not details concerned with nephilim? Doesn&#39;t it seem like someone is trying to suppress stuff like 1 Enoch and Jubilees if they are highly represented among the Dead Sea Scrolls and yet generally unknown in the world and shunned by even synagogues &amp; churches? And see what is said here and notice mention of Mount Hermon?:</p>

<p><a href="http://qbible.com/enoch/7.html">http://qbible.com/enoch/7.html</a></p>

<p>How interesting if there are still huge monolithic stones nearby Mount Hermon including a gigantic ancient platform that others later built on top of and also other ancient stone blocks that are upwards of 1,650 tons? What was really going on thousands of years ago if a typical tower crane is said to have a maximum load of about 18 metric tons? And what do people ever learn about in public school?</p>

<p>It may be also a way to cleanse that which is not wanted, to make it easier for a chosen few. Save 8, I don&#39;t think DNA would be so diverse if we were spawned from 8 people. It  would be more likely it was several hundred thousand. </p>
