       It's kids, and adults, pretending and circle jerking. The thing with role play is that people know it's role play, but enjoy the game. A one sided role play is just a guy bullshitting.

       I reject the new 'definition' of LARP,  but yeah, obviously some people are circle jerking and others are just commenting on, or laughing at, the jerk.

       I
       <em>
        don't

       doubt that some of the members have jobs in government or Hollywood or law enforcement, everyone needs to relax sometimes and I get the entertainment appeal.

       It just seems super unlikely to me that a legit person at a high level would choose that forum to release important information.

       it doesn't have to be literally dead physically has no pulse and no heart beat.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your primary job is politician or political advisor and you lose the trust of all your compadres - your career is dead. which if that's all you know - it's as good as being dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for being on the run - if the other team has legit data/facts/evidence against you - and you are making moves to try to stay ahead of them until you get caught - that would also be considered - on the run.

       I feel like he has an excellent grasp of world politics and has put it in a format that is getting people excited to read between the lines of everyday news articles.

       As far as secret intelligence clearances? Hard to say. Most his predictions were telegraphed pretty clearly. I am curious what people feel is the single most difficult prediction/conclusion he has drawn.

       He has frequently used a construction that is like "people wouldn't believe it if they knew"
      </p>
      <p>
       That's been dropped about who actually runs North Korea, which I find weird because we all thought they were insane already, and he implies its even insaner than that - by far.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for the whole trafficking thing - seems like its worse than we could even imagine, and what we imagine (as in p-gate) is as bad as it can be, as far as I can tell.

       He's said several things that I have never heard before anywhere.

       It makes sense to me that they would be leaking to the public who is hungry for that kind of information. It all just resonates very strongly.

       Even if he isn't an insider, he asked extremely important questions in a manner that was so virally effective that I can't ignore the possibility it's legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, why would he lie about martial law, blackouts, military arrests etc.? Q seems aware his enemies are reading the same thing we are. Hence, you throw all the bread crumbs out there, but you also add in a healthy dose of "we are about to pull out all the stops", scaring the shit out of everyone who was worried about getting arrested. Sounds like a brilliant way to get your enemy to start talking, planning, and reacting to the proposed "martial law roundups" - and it even turns the idea of an EMP blackout into something that helps the bad guys, into something the bad guys want to avoid at all costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Game Theory. Know your enemy. Misinformation and disinformation, as long as held together by a hearty dose of truth, are extremely valuable weapons and I think the idea was really to spook the shit out of everyone they're threatening and cause un-forced errors by sparking all this activity.

       I find myself in awe of the whole operation - true, false, or in between. Can't be some teenager or neckbeard in the basement. Any way it turns out, it's internet hall of fame material.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of what this implies - somebody says: "I'm going to tell you the truth, but in that truth I have to sprinkle in a bunch of lies, which will eventually turn out to be good lies, because when you good guys let the bad guys know that you think these lies are true, it will cause the bad guys to stumble, so whether these are true or false, you still need to go publicize this stuff."

       I think at one point someone mentioned 4G warfare and the Art of War.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pinnacle of military strength to Sun Tzu was attacking their plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       John Boyd and his acolytes took this and after conceptualization of the OODA loops discussed the power of getting into the decision cycle of your enemy, effectively attacking and breaking their will to fight and thus winning without losing or killing a single soldier (if and when possible).

       I am more and more convinced Q anon is actually Trump. It's bizarre but it makes the most sense to me. 
The +++ was a slip up. The format, the quick fire questions, its his style.
