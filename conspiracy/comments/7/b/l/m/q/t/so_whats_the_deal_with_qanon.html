<p>I <em>don&#39;t</em> doubt that some of the members have jobs in government or Hollywood or law enforcement, everyone needs to relax sometimes and I get the entertainment appeal. </p>

<p>If your primary job is politician or political advisor and you lose the trust of all your compadres - your career is dead. which if that&#39;s all you know - it&#39;s as good as being dead.</p>

<p>As for being on the run - if the other team has legit data/facts/evidence against you - and you are making moves to try to stay ahead of them until you get caught - that would also be considered - on the run.</p>

<p>That&#39;s been dropped about who actually runs North Korea, which I find weird because we all thought they were insane already, and he implies its even insaner than that - by far.</p>

<p>Same goes for the whole trafficking thing - seems like its worse than we could even imagine, and what we imagine (as in p-gate) is as bad as it can be, as far as I can tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if he isn&#39;t an insider, he asked extremely important questions in a manner that was so virally effective that I can&#39;t ignore the possibility it&#39;s legit. </p>

<p>Now, why would he lie about martial law, blackouts, military arrests etc.? Q seems aware his enemies are reading the same thing we are. Hence, you throw all the bread crumbs out there, but you also add in a healthy dose of &quot;we are about to pull out all the stops&quot;, scaring the shit out of everyone who was worried about getting arrested. Sounds like a brilliant way to get your enemy to start talking, planning, and reacting to the proposed &quot;martial law roundups&quot; - and it even turns the idea of an EMP blackout into something that helps the bad guys, into something the bad guys want to avoid at all costs. </p>

<p>Game Theory. Know your enemy. Misinformation and disinformation, as long as held together by a hearty dose of truth, are extremely valuable weapons and I think the idea was really to spook the shit out of everyone they&#39;re threatening and cause un-forced errors by sparking all this activity. </p>

<p>I find myself in awe of the whole operation - true, false, or in between. Can&#39;t be some teenager or neckbeard in the basement. Any way it turns out, it&#39;s internet hall of fame material.</p>

<p>Think of what this implies - somebody says: &quot;I&#39;m going to tell you the truth, but in that truth I have to sprinkle in a bunch of lies, which will eventually turn out to be good lies, because when you good guys let the bad guys know that you think these lies are true, it will cause the bad guys to stumble, so whether these are true or false, you still need to go publicize this stuff.&quot;</p>
