       I think we all have experienced "that guy" who just has to disagree with what you think. Even if 98% of everyone else agrees, there's always one or two that don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes they're good at explaining things and you come to understand their point of view. But sometimes, they do/say something that pisses you off... which tends to get in the way of seeing things their way.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can't see what they're getting at. Or you just don't want to. What they're saying just seems like total crap. But just because things look one way at first, doesn't mean there's no other way of seeing things.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/7bi3pn/there_are_16_circles_in_this_image/?st=j9r1j480&amp;amp;sh=0b555fd8">
        Here's a pic
       </a>
       that serves as an awesome example.
      </p>
      <p>
       I looked at it and figured it must be some kind of meme or inside joke. Then I checked out one of the comments and went back and looked at the pic again. The pic is what it is. If you can see those circles, you know they're just as much there as the squares are. The only thing that changes (and allows you to "flip btw squares and circles) is your own perception and how you choose to focus it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So next time, if you can't see how someone else's theory or explanation makes any sense, just remember they may be seeing the circles while you're looking at the squares.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't you rather be able to see both?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I think the reason you tend to see squares first (and more easily) is because the shading of the lines adds an impression of depth, whereas the circles don't have this. Depth cues = visual processing priority over non-depth cues?

       And this is why similar definitions and understandings of them are needed, because if we're talking about defined shapes, there are only squares. There are several squares in which an entire unified solid color is defining its shape with borders. There are no circles if we use this same understanding, as no circles are drawn out.

       cool post and cool image.

       relating to the idea of disagreement.  here's the thing.  what is communication?  it's mutual agreement on terms.  it starts with that seed - common language - which is just agreement on terms.  if you have a more complicated idea to express and you can't find agreement, you just have to break the idea down into its components and find agreement on how you'd both describe the components.  rinse repeat.  keep doing this until you have agreement on what you are describing.
      </p>
      <p>
       communication is the process of finding agreement of terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       how can you communicate effectively?  be accurate in your language.
      </p>
      <p>
       the root of most disagreement is poor communication.

       You know what’s interesting? My first glance was dismissive - I didn’t want to spend time getting trolled looking for circles that weren’t there. However, for some reason, I trusted that you said there WERE circles, so I changed my perspective, literally and figuratively and looked for a crumb- any curved lines. Voila! They popped into view.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most of us are here because we are skeptical. That is a blessing and a curse. Trust is a precious commodity.

       I saw them both.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there are SOME people who will disagree with you not because their perception is different, but because they like standing out. Attention-seeking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Important to tell the difference between who genuinely has a different perspective and who just likes being difficult.

       The difference is in the analysis, the deconstruction. For my part it makes for a great analogy about conspiracy in that when we remove the circles altogether &amp; see that there are only stripes; we realize all along we were only seeing what the image was designed to
       <em>
        make
       </em>
       us see.

       Ugh... when talking with anti-vaxxers (
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       the same, just similar arguments) I find they run short of answers when I ask the core questions like: "why?", "to what end?", "who's profiting?". Certainly money is being made in antivirals for hiv patients, but there'd be the same money even if they called the disease something else. Just like vaccine makers would be making
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       money treating those diseases than preventing them.

       It dawned on me while conversing with this guy is that he might be in denial. Maybe he got some bad news from a doctor lately.

       Could be. Or even abt someone he knows/knew. Because of the stigma it's not at all uncommon for families to lie abt what their loved one had. A person I knew lost his life to aids &amp; his family said it was cancer.
