       Notice how vice news just released a video about "targeted conspiracy theorists" or people who think they are being followed.  This is a coordinated disinformation attack on the truther movement in an attempt to get people to self sensor.

       They've had videos before on the subject. I actually really like those videos because they're not like normal vice videos. They don't have some dork going around acting weird it just shows these communities for what they are. I personally believe it's a example of what happens when people reject the idea they have a mental illness and instead congregate with other people who are mentally ill.

       And yet not a single person has ever come out and said "I was an actor and tens of thousands people people are in on it." Not one wife or husband has ever come out and said they were suspicious of their spouse never talking about their job until they learned they go around acting and harassing people. Bullshit.

       I don't know if you're genuine or not, but you got me man. I really hope you're ok. You need to recognize that regardless of the cause of the stress you are under, stress doesn't lend itself to sound judgement. If you want to warn people, I commend you, and I would guess this is as good a place as any. But it you think you are doing under the radar on Reddit, you are fucking way late to the party, brother, look elsewhere for that. Also, look at the tone of the comments. I mean on one hand you might as well get used to ppl mocking you and develop that tough skin, but on the other, how many responses sound like genuine, experienced, caring conspiracy theorists? Even a grade-school level amateur conspiracy theorist is gonna know that any person who has truly been affected by electronic harrasment, or any conspiracy for that matter, is going to be fucked up on some level and probably have some measure of sympathy, yet here they all are making fun of you. What does that tell you about where you are. This sub is like 99% posers, low-level online corporate lobbiests, shills, and hacks from other sub-reddits that just come in here to fuck with ppl. I wouldn't worry too much bout getting harrassed for something you said about the DNC in here though. Ppl say all kinds of shit in here all day long and the DNC is a favorite target. But I'd you are feeling stressed like u r losing it, you probably are to some extent one way or the other. Either you're going crazy or someone is out to get you and driving you crazy and both roads usually lead to crazy. So go into all this knowing both that you are probably a bit crazy one way or the other, but also don't let ppl steamroll you about it. Just cause you're crazy doesn't make you retarded or a loser or even fuck your judgement up in all things, so balance your strengths and weaknesses. Seriously dude, good luck.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, just cause you try and camouflage what you are trying to say doesn't mean anyone else will follow suit and if you are tagged by someone for electronic harrasment I'm guessing theyre gonna notice if you go posting in reddits biggest conspiracy sub. So if there are bad guys they know you are speaking out, but good guys that can help you probably don't, and your warning with this post has fallen on deaf ears. It's probably gonna get harder before it gets easier, if it gets easier. Keep your humanity, it's one thing sociopaths and artificial intelligence can't quite seem to get a handle on regardless of their tricks, I promise. Take care brother.

       i always find the most interesting of theories in controversial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also makes me wonder who's down voting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying I believe this or not, but when people just attack folk immediately in masses... it really makes me wonder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Examples of quick attacks ALWAYS
      </p>
      <p>
       Anytime someone mentions anyhting to do with the sun flickering, moving oddly or out of ordinary ANYTHING at all; people come out let and right to attack them. its so often so, that Im starting to think its a cover up. Pay attention to any post about the sun and notice how abrasive attackers are to OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shape of earth. Not claiming what shape it is, but damn we cant even discuss theories without "bullies" coming out to correct the record.
      </p>
      <p>
       cell phones being used as weapons (3rd post I've seen in a week) all being attacked by people who are suppose to be open minded.

       Thinking for ourselves is all we've ever had my friend...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that for your 1 and 2 examples, sun anomalies and flat earth, are highly objective experiences that most people have a pretty solid opinion on before the discussion ever happens, in FE that is mainly because it has been made into a meme missing all of the actually useful aspects of skepticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for 3, you know the reason for that. And you know who is behind the forum attacks, and if you look closely it isn't the same people as 1 and 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because 3 is the real scary one, and the one that gives TPTB the most leverage over us.
