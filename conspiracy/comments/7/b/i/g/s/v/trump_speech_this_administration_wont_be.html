       You understand "boom" means millions of people would die, many of them South Koreans, nearly all of them innocent people who have no power to change things?

       I mean, it's not like your average guy in NK has the slightest ability to change how things are there - they are victims, not perpetrators.

       Do you remember when Obama looked like he was going to cozy up to Trump. The first week of Trump's presidency I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then this video went viral:

      <p>
       The following week, he was back to attacking Trump. Maybe I am imagining it all but I remember feeling like someone was warning Obama not to ally with Trump in any way.

       Trump isn't the same person he was when he took office. He understands the propaganda machine now; the swamp is real and he knows he doesn't have complete control as he probably expected going into office.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a power struggle, and Trump doesn't yield. This is why I wanted Trump as President -- He would let us know if our country could be saved through democracy, or if it would require revolution. He's the ultimate benchmark on our country, because whether he fails miserably as a president or fulfills his promises 200%, he's going to answer the question regardless. No other candidate was going to do that. Not even Rand Paul, or a Ron Paul type either. Only Trump could've done this.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now, we're witnessing how it unfolds. Lots of time left, but so far I'm optimistic. The DNC, Hollywood, elites, sex-rings and pedo's, etc. are all getting exposed slowly but surely. It's turning out quite well so far, I think.

       For the past couple years I just assumed he was just a big dumb racist asshole who would bankrupt america in order to make a buck for himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Ive never trusted the establishment, tptb, ect...i was glad when trump won because Id hoped itd be the end of the establishment as we know it.  It looks like its finally habbening...the Saudis are cleaning house. China is cutting off NK. Old school shitbird Republicans are retiring or getting voted out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is also destroying our neofascist PC culture of shaming people into silence if they say anything offensive. Also I think we can trance the recent emboldening men and women to speak up against sexual harassment back to the collective horror we all felt listening to his "pussygrabbing tape".
      </p>
      <p>
       Slowly but surely...kicking and screaming...America is slowly but surely becoming Great Again.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's not perfect but by God he's our President. It seems like he genuinely wants America to be the best.

       Mattis are war-mongers. I was hoping Trump would follow through on his posturing as being against foreign intervention, I was hoping Trump would put us on track to end to the ridiculous never-ending wars of the Bush and Obama administrations since he had criticized those illegal wars so much. Now, after seeing him in office for a while, I wouldn't be surprised if he had the US invade Iran or North Korea before he's out of office.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also AG Jeff Sessions deciding to crack down on cannabis. That's fucking dumb. Trump is generally socially liberal and I didn't foresee him picking an Attorney General who would seem to want to do literally exactly the opposite of what the country needs.

       It's a different swamp. Our government is still ruled by oligarchs and he won't change that, but he can help the government be ruled by a different set of oligarchs. That can be an improvement in some ways, especially if rumors about government officials being blackmailed over things like pedophilia are true. It'd be nice if the officials running the government weren't easily blackmailed even if they were still "swamp creatures" of some variety.

       Here is the quote:. He is talking about NK.  How could NK blackmail their way into nuclear weapons?  Look back at Q Anon...  There is a secret about who controls NK- I think this relates to the puppet and puppet master.  NK was puppet and has become puppet master...  When the son took over, lost control? When they got weapons or dirt on BO?
      </p>
      <p>
       All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with the deluded hope that it could blackmail its way to the ultimate objective. So -- and that objective we are not going to let it have. We are not going to let it have. All of Korea is under that spell divided in half. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea to continue to happen.

       The North Koreans have played the same game for a long time: show strength, then offer to stand down in exchange for food and money...resources needed to keep their poor, unfed populations alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has no humanitarian bone in his body. His only motivator in life is money. The “blackmail” he’s talking about is “you’ve threatened to let your people die of starvation if we didn’t give you food and money in exchange for stopping your weapons programs. This administration doesn’t care about your people, but we DO care about our money. Let them die, because we’re not giving you anything.”

       Fucking lol what? If you think Trump is any different than any other president, you're delusional. Every president is part of the machine whether you like it or not. This one just happens to use Twitter. There will always be backroom deals and shady politics at play regardless of who the actual president is, that's the nature of politics in this country.

       I can't believe what the political discussions on sub has come to. I remember the good old days of talking about the bullshittery of every politician of both main parties, this sub is insanely partisan now.

       Has anyone noticed how much Trump likes to tell on himself? He is saying this because that is what he does every time some news is about to break or has broke. So he is just telling us He is being blackmailed. he is like the little sibling. I didnt do it he did it.

       Mattis are war-mongers. I was hoping Trump would follow through on his posturing as being against foreign intervention, I was hoping Trump would put us on track to end to the ridiculous never-ending wars of the Bush and Obama administrations since he had criticized those illegal wars so much. Now, after seeing him in office for a while, I wouldn't be surprised if he had the US invade Iran or North Korea before he's out of office.

       There's also AG Jeff Sessions deciding to crack down on cannabis. That's fucking dumb. Trump is generally socially liberal and I didn't foresee him picking an Attorney General who would seem to want to do literally exactly the opposite of what the country needs.
