<p>This program is bit time red pilling but i also feel is predictive programming especially in the looming crytocurrency boom and the fall of their economy in s2 story line. </p>

<p>Altho talk about split personalities/programming... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get where you are coming from but I&#39;d like to see it as the show having woke writers. It&#39;s also quite meta with them Startin s03 stating how the revolution will have commercial breaks. The show is a fucking parody of itself if you view it from the right angle.</p>

<p>All. I hope is that some people who weren&#39;t woke yet started thinking about some of the stuff that&#39;s going on behind the curtains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just throwing it out there as I can&#39;t find the episode or link to a screencap... Maybe if someone likes the idea they can make a post.</p>

<p>Warning: stranger things spoilers</p>

<p>In S2 of stranger things, when 11 meets her sister and they go to &#39;take care of&#39; someone...</p>

<p>That scene begins with an 80s tv show of a girl waking up with a start, and her dad comes in and asks what happened. She tells him &quot;I had a bad dream that I was at the doctors and he was giving me a needle and it just kept getting bigger and bigger&#39;. </p>

<p>Due to me spending wayyyy too much time here lately, I immediately thought of pedogate. </p>

<p>Easy to dismiss.
But then it got weirder...</p>

<p>The man they are after, who is watching this show, looks like Harvey Weinstein. At least that was the first impression I got. And then 11s sister even makes them appear as little girls to him, asking &quot;remember us?&quot; Or something to that effect.</p>

<p>Now that I think of it... How integrated into the Hollywood machine is Netflix? Maybe they&#39;re on our side.</p>
