       I don't know about you, but daily my tolerance level for normies is growing thinner and thinner.
      </p>
      <p>
       When/if Pizzagate falls apart and is exposed....there will be a major "I told you so" revelation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not just the shills who try to cover up, deny and humiliate conspiracies and conspiracy theorists. It is actual, real educated people who have real lives. Their audacity is just beyond belief; especially their denial and snide derision of sensitive issues like Pizzagate, which involves the most innocent and free being of all: children.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is going to be done when they - the "normies" - eventually experience their "I told you so" moment? I can't just readily accept them into our fold/our reality when they have had the crass to ridicule us and blindly follow MSM. Their total eagerness to submit to authority and revel in the material world, is a threat to people like us who want to have the system down on its knees and return to our human roots.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think that there's unavoidable bad blood and division, and it's prudent to think ahead and prepare for this scenario.

       I haven't heard of that before, and can only guess at the context you mean it in here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Put it this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really expect the "Normie Society" to come quietly when their false reality is dismantled? No. They will beg to have their Hollywood movies and music back, right to their last breath.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you really cope with that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Once, a long time ago, my dog came into possession of a teddy bear that it really liked. Eventually, it got to the point where out dog was really obsessed with the teddy, and guarded it all day - viewing me and my family as a "threat" whenever we strayed to close to the teddy bear. One day we took away the teddy bear. Well, the dog didn't like that! It took it out on us of course. And wouldn't settle down for weeks. Eventually, he got over it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, that's just one dog. Gonna be a different story when it's millions of upset proles unsure what to do with their lives when shit hits the fan.

       You're probably right on one hand, and wildly wrong on the other.
The idea of the whole system coming crashing down because of a few sex and money scandals is cute.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't really see what value this thought adds other than to re-inforce the 'us and them' mentality that already exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someones actions can be thought of as a result of ignorance rather than malice, you should always assume it is the former before the latter can be proven.
      </p>
      <p>
       If aliens turned up tomorrow and provided empirical, irrefutable proof that none of the conspiracies we all believe were true, and that they could all be proven to be just paranoia - would you buy it, or would having all of your world-view shattered in an instant lead you to lash out?

       I don't think it's funny. Already, we're seeing swathes of public society be misled into pardoning and accepting pedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, it's the intention of the elites to mislead. It's deliberate.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the people eat it up anyway. They are the little fish, being drawn away from safety and common sense by the light of the anglerfish.

      <p>
       Like I said, they're a threat to a free thinking and forward society. So easily deceived and manipulated, to the point that they will forgive people like Kevin Spacey, and show no interest in cases like Epstein because to them, it's more interesting to read about the Kardashians instead.

       A better world begins with understanding and forgiveness. I think we can understand why people think the way they think - they've known nothing else, and to acknowledge the truth is terrifying. Many of us who came to the truth stumbled across it - it takes a lot to break down that programming. I understand your frustration but its this kind of condescending view of humanity that feeds the hubris and the sociopathy of the elites. Be different, and have some respect and compassion for your fellow slaves.

       I think the use of the term "normies" will actually hurt your cause. People (on the Internet) think the following groups of people say "normies":
      </p>
      <p>
       Neckbeards
Incels
4channers
People who say REEEEEE
Weaponized autism crowd
The_Donald
The Red Pill
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially, every time you call somebody "normie", they hear it as you calling them "Chad" or "sheeple", both of which have negative connotations and nobody is going to listen to you if you call them names.
      </p>
      <p>
       So unless you want
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to be associated with those groups (real or not) then I would suggest another term. Like:
      </p>
      <p>
       Non-believers
People with cognitive dissonance 
Head in the sand crowd
      </p>
      <p>
       These terms are less likely to cause a visceral reaction, imho.

       You just get it! Maybe they will finally shut up for a minute. I notice alot of contrarian people around me. When they hear undeniable truth, they double down and change the subject, simply so they can hear themselves talk. When you get to the near future and you are vindicated, I bet some will dummy up and give you respect you deserve. Maybe they will tell you "I'm sorry for doubting; teach me your wisdom!" Those converts will be your posse, and normies who are still idiots will go by the wayside.

       Grow up and learn how to communicate.  Until you learn how to do that, people will continue to ignore you and make fun of you.  Also drop the normie buillshit as u/BigBlackCracker pointed out in nicer terms.  You will not, of course, instead you will react instead of listening and grow, but whatever.

       I suspect there's at least three things going on here:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Some people don't believe in any conspiracies, and they think they're better than those who do. For them, this sub is a source of amusement and ego boost.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are many conspiracies that just don't pan out. Some people don't think CNN is credible because they fucked up some of their stories. They got details wrong, etc. That mistrust is going to happen here too for the same reason.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There's an obvious bias on this sub. If an attack is by a Muslim, then the MSM got it right (except for 9/11), but if an attack is by a white guy, it's a false flag. This inconsistency harms the sub's credibility.
