        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Alright so me a 17 year old high school drop out and the proud owner of his very own ged has found out why there has been a spike in mental illness and ways to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s. Now I’m in no way saying mental illness isn’t real as someone who has tried to kill them selves many a time it is very real. So think back to Farm boy jim in 1930. He woke up around 5/6 and went to bed around 8/9. That’s a nice full 8 or more hours of sleep. Now let me tell you something interesting. Just very recently there was a system found in the brain called the glymphatic system. Long story short it piggy backs on the out side of arteries and veins to flush CSF (the fluid that is around your brain) through your brain to remove waste. The believed cause of Alzheimer’s is build up of a protein that kills the nerve cells around it. Now if the glymphatic system works right this might not happen. And Alzheimer’s is more prevalent in women. An important fact to remember is the glymphatic system works its best at night while you are sleeping. Now a whopping 61% of women have reported insomnia symptoms during menopause. I see a correlation there. What is another time in your life where you don’t sleep well. Your teens and 20’s. Realizing this made me think. Hey what about good old farm boy jim. Why wasn’t mental illness a thing back in his time. Well cuz he got all that sleep. There was nothing to do in the dark. It got dark and you slept. Now not so much, I can stay up until 4:30 in the morning watching greys anatomy. It’s obviously not going to solve the crazy in the world if we pump everyone full of sleeping pills. Your brain is very delicate and the glymphatic system is very fragile. Why it wasn’t noticed until 2012 is because when we die it is no longer noticeable. So things such as head injuries could cause damage that would cause problems similar to Alzheimer’s. Also  now with all the shitty food weaker hearts which means less flow in the brain. So nothing new get more sleep, eat better, and avoid head injuries if you want to live a longer happier life. So ya thank you for letting me post my 3 am realization.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s super interesting! I think we&#39;re going to see a huge spike in dementia in the near future if sleep really is the best prevention of it. Why? Wi-Fi. They say that the Wi-Fi signals interfere with electronic signals in the brain, causing them to sorta &quot;stay awake&quot; even when you are asleep. Almost everyone I know has a router in their home. This could be bad for the current population when they get older.</p>

<p>I have yet to unplug my router and turn off my phone when I sleep, mainly because my phone is also my alarm clock. I wonder if unplugging my router and turning on airplane mode would allow me to keep my phone on at night without the negative effects.</p>

<p>Great topic! I do think the telecom industry knows more than they&#39;re telling us, so this is kinda on the conspiracy tip. This is definitely something that needs to be researched more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could be. I believe that just tricks your brain into thinking it&#39;s still daytime so you have trouble getting to sleep. A separate issue than the dementia thing.</p>

<p>Good call, though. Playing with your phone/computer/TV before sleeping actually does mess up your chances of getting to sleep fast.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the information overload is a huge issue. Half of us are medicated to deal with the immense amount of info we take in each day. The fallout from that alone could be rough... do we have much data on someone who has taken adderall every day for 60 years?</p>

<p>Companies are even feeding this culture now by catering work places toward millennials, making them more casual with random shit like putting greens because we&#39;re conditioned to focus on 6 things at once. I know whenever I went to the library to study I was talking to friends in person, talking to friends online, watching YouTube videos, reading articles, listening to musics and mixing in a little homework. </p>
