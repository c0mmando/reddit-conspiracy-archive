       We all know what happens when you try and suggest that TPTB generate newsworthy events as a distraction. You get reactions like "Oh that's crazy" "You must be a conspriacy theorist etc."
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, if we're crazy, then so is the GOP. How so?
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the 90's, when Bill Clinton was in his second term, he got himself in a bit of trouble with Monica Lewinsky. Most of you either remember this or are familiar with the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton was pretty popular back then, so the Republicans couldn't resist the opportunity to take him down a few notches. So we got Whitewater and the Kenneth Starr investigation. As I recall, this thing seemed to drag on forever and it was getting some play on the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then a funny thing happened. Several significant events took place overseas. One of these was a US cruise missile attack on some terrorist target somewhere. That's when it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       People in the GOP started accusing the CLintons (both of them) of conspiring to create news in order to distract the public from Starr/Lewinsky/Whitewater. Sounds pretty familiar doesn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, if Joe Average suggests TPTB create stories as a distraction... they're labeled as some kind of nut. But back in the 90's the exact same accusation was being leveled at Clinton (by mainstream politicians) and nobody had a problem with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny how times have changed.

       Couldn't it just be that the GOP generally disliked Clinton and wanted to take him down and the timing was a coincidence?  The Dems have been trying to take down Trump in the same manner.
      </p>

       Why was the missile attack so important to cover up?  What would make all that trouble worthwhile?

       The point is that Republicans were making public accusations that the President was generating news in order to distract people from his legal problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       e.g. I've got a bunch of people saying nasty things about me on the news. I also have the ability to approve missile strikes on selected targets.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I order a big strike, knowing that it will make headlines... and crowd the other story off the air.
      </p>
      <p>
       My thesis is that it's a valid accusation ( because the principle makes sense). I also think the same holds true today.

       Perhaps I did misunderstand.  You're saying that Clinton intentionally launched airstrikes to take the heat off himself from the sex scandal?

       Ahh yes, the vast right wing conspiracy! Isn't that when Hillary started saying that? More seriously, I was a little surprised by how much the internet called bs on LV, seems like more people are becoming open to the idea of conspiracies and distractions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun fact: it was Harvey Weinstein that hired journalist John Connolly to write the smear book The Insane Clown Posse, which was an expose on the Kenneth Starr investigative team. Harv gave Connolly a Miramax Book deal after he found out Connolly was poised to do a write up on Miramax and Harvey. Connolly pitched a book but was told to do the Kenn Starr smear job.

       Um, no. My point is that the GOP was making accusations that would be labeled as a conspiracy theory today. But back in the (pre-internet) 1990's, people were a lot more open to the idea.

       </p>

      <p>
       What happened was the Republican Congress passed a deadline for Iraq to comply with conditions. The bombing by Bill Clinton occurred upon that pre-existing
       <em>
        deadline
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This was right around the time of the 1998 election too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, the Republicans accused the Democrat of "wagging the dog." The "dog" was already at the food. The deadline was set.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's where it gets really weird. The Republican House
       <em>
        rescheduled
       </em>
       the impeachment hearings to coincide with the deadline.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Republicans played with dates to create a "wag the dog" scenario.

       Will never forget the look on our daughter's face when the light bulb popped on for her while watching this movie.  She made the connection to so many real-life shenanigans had been miss-represented in the media at when announced and then the truth being found out to have been bad business by TPTB later on.

       It is a terrific film, no doubt. What gets me is how many people who have seen the film, a film about literally faking war, still believe the complete nonsense of
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ewvID-bUA&amp;amp;lc">
        Crazy 'Kim Jong'

       and the other boogeymen on their telescreen.
      </p>

       Any sane, objective people with open eyes out there, I recommend you go back and look at footage from even the Iraq 'shock and awe' campaign.

       "Go big or go home" seemed to work with 9/11.  The shock of the moments was such that folks couldn't/wouldn't question the possibility that the biggest, most 'in your face' deception in broad daylight had just taken place.  The balls required to pull this shit off is still hard for me to comprehend.

       After typing that, I was wondering how the hell did they get the media on their side and in total lock step...then I remembered the most recent presidential election run up.  So one-sided and lock step and the only indication that common folks weren't buying it was the election's outcome.

       So how do we, the common people, call BULLSHIT the next time something similar happens?

       I used to wonder about that. Eventually I began to question my fundamental notion of 'we'.

      <p>
       What do I really have in common with the regular normie? Honestly, I wonder about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The average normie doesn't question things, and gets angry if you bring up simple topics like media fakery. He just wants to be left alone in his average home to watch TV and eat processed food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over time I came to see there is no 'we'. There are lots of normies, sure, but they are never waking up in a million years.

       I believe, at least part of it, is a type of fear. Not everyone, for sure. Many people really have no idea. But I think nearly just as many people are afraid to even get near that rabbit hole because they know they wouldn't like what they see. And on one hand, I can't blame them.

      <p>
       Even myself I sometimes think how it would just be easier for myself to ignore these puppet shows and move on with my life. But I know I can't. I know that I need to try and educate myself with an open mind and subtly drop hints, ask good questions, steer converstations, without turning those people away.

       I believe part of it is a type of fear. Not everyone, some people have no idea. But I think that nearly as many people are afraid to get near that rabbit hole because they know that they wont like what they'll see. It looks ugly and so they steer clear. On one hand I can't blame them.

       I often think to myself how it would just be easier to ignore the puppet shows and move on with my life. But that's impossible. I know that I need to educate myself with skepticism in mind. In addition to education, dropping subtle hints, asking effective questions, and gently steering conversation wherever I can without driving those people away.

       Impeached just means indicted. In other words words, to be charged with something.

       You are correct, although the person I responded to seemed to believe he was successfully found guilty.. I think the term is probably misunderstood by most that use it or see it.. they see it as successfully found guilty. My intent was to say he wasn't found guilty, though you're correct that he was successfully indicted/impeached.

       I won't argue, I feel like this word in particular has an actual meaning, versus the way the public uses it which is different, and that creates a problem with being able to discuss it accurately.
      </p>
      <p>
       More or less, I was trying to argue against the public's popular belief of what it means, and I just argued badly/inaccurately. Plus, I never had coffee today, which is why most of my comments today are likely flawed as well. It's just one of those days.

       People still believe Nixon was impeached (he resigned before impeachment), so don't be surprised most people have no idea about how it all works.

       This was actually huge, what really kicked off this "war on terror". There were two missiles fired. They sent a cruise missile to Afghanistan and killed a whole bunch on innocent people. And, more importantly, they sent a cruise missile to Sudan and destroyed one of the only pharmaceutical factory in Africa.

       Bin Laden was in Afghanistan, not Sudan. The Sudan missile was meant to destroyed one of the only pharmaceutical factories in Africa, nothing more. It was what they wanted to do and that directly lead up to the breakup of Sudan a few years later. They planned all of it.

       I think you have to look at the party in power when it comes to the social acceptability of "conspiracy theories", and how the very concept has evolved over time.
      </p>
      <p>
       As
       <a href="/u/LilyoftheCalla">
        /u/LilyoftheCalla
       </a>
       pointed out, Hillary's declaration of a "vast right wing conspiracy" (quoted from a White House memo IIRC) was quite popular because of the leanings of the MSM. They were willing to buy into the idea (but not REALLY investigate it) because of their own confirmation bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, "conspiracy theory" wasn't quite the dirty word it is now (post 9/11).
      </p>
      <p>
       There's been a push to politicize conspiracy theories as a largely right-wing phenomenon, at least in the mainstream media, since that Sept 11, 2001. Anyone (probably everyone here) is familiar with the the way MSM has portrayed theories about that day. They often lump in
       <strong>
        and focus on
       </strong>
       the more outrageous claims with more plausible ones, in essence painting with a wide brush, then adopting the "Truther" label. After Obama's election, they were also able to equate the Truthers with the fringe groups that were carrying around racist signs regarding Obama (oh, and suggesting that they're all "freepers" though that particular term has kind of died on the wayside).
      </p>
      <p>
       Combine the political climate with the increasingly distracted world (thanks, smartphones), and it's all a mechanism of control, too delicious to believe. That's not to suggest that the idea of smartphones is a deliberate conspiracy, just a lucky happenstance for making people malleable, largely via social media's immediacy, and turning "apps" into addiction is a part of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do I mean by addiction?
      </p>
      <p>
       Prolonged use of social media (short form writing like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.), particularly on smartphones, lead people to react more emotionally, throwing rational reactions out the door. There's been a few studies that show the neurological reasons for this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a neurology expert, but...
      </p>
      <p>
       The amygdala elicits emotional responses. For example, when threatened, it's the amygdala that triggers a warning, while the pre-frontal cortex helps you interpret that threat rationally. Take a Hallowe'en "haunted house" attraction. It's your amygdala that makes you scream "Holy crap!" and the pre-frontal cortex that says "Ah, it's only a teenager in a costume." almost immediately after.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more an individual uses social media, particularly on smartphones for some reason, the weaker the connection between the amygdala and pre-frontal cortex becomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recent studies also suggest the reason an individual allows this to happen, in that whether positive or negative, the brain releases dopamine as you interact on such platforms. Again, using the "haunted house" example, one is rewarded for surviving the scare, even though there's no REAL threat, just a manufactured one.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I couldn't articulate it clearly because I'm not a neurology expert, I've often felt that this "gamification" of communication is a large component of "outrage culture" online. I know I'm not the only one. It seems a fair number of people in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       are minimal social media users (beyond searching for pertinent info from those who are).
      </p>
      <p>
       Silicon Valley realized quite some time ago that there's money in addiction, as well. Most of the major services have in-house "gamification" departments using addiction models and algorithms to keep people on their apps for longer periods of time, using a reward model. For startups and smaller companies, there's consulting companies to help you along.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I've been reading about the addiction model for a while, the following video which aired on CBC a week or so ago had a real impact on a few friends I shared it with (hope it's viewable outside of Canada), because it contextualizes the insidiousness in a mainstream manner...

       The advent of a pocketable device that can provide instant distractions to the masses, while making total information awareness available to the alphabet agencies is the one of the most useful tools for shaping opinions ever, in that it distracts people from even wanting to bother with having opinions, especially ones that go outside the normal "Coke/Pepsi" dichotomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr - People are too busy tweeting and snapchatting to be bothered to have their world fucked with by "conspiracy theories".

As it happened, a popular 1997 movie, Wag the Dog, features a president who fakes a war to distract public attention from a domestic scandal. Some Republicans in Congress raised questions about the timing of the strikes. Berger was particularly rankled by an editorial in the Economist that said that only the future would tell whether the U.S. missile strikes had "created 10,000 new fanatics where there would have been none."

       Its funny you bring this up. Yes, republicans accused Clinton of "wagging the dog" and distracting us from the Lewinski scandal. Clinton claimed there were religious fanatics running around the desert plotting to kill us.

       Hindsight shows that if republicans would have been more concerned about those religious fanatics and less concerned with blow jobs we might have been prepared for 9-11.

       Republicans were furious that Bill Clinton refused to bomb everyone in the world after the February 26, 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Originally, it was intended that George Bush would still be in office, but when that didn't work out, they pressured Bill Clinton to use it for giant wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he didn't, they became very annoyed and decided to create a long list of scandals. During the investigation, they came across a certain blue dress and got him misrepresenting a blow job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, they created the "wag the dog" scenario, knowing that George W. Bush was about to try to steal an election, create a "new Pearl Harbor" false flag incident, and finally get those wars the Bushes love so much. They wanted to use "wag the dog" preemptively against Bill Clinton so it would look like a copycat when GWB was accused later.
