    <div class="md"><p>It is still important globally because of the amount of oil it produces. The West would never have been there in the first place if it wasn&#39;t for the oil. That&#39;s why Churchill was so hesitant to switch the British fleet from Coal, which the UK had in abundance at home, to oil, which required going abroad. WW2 showed us what happens when you don&#39;t have oil for the war machine...look at Japan or Hitler in the Caucuses and Romania. Israel may be an important factor now, but Oil got us there, and Oil keeps us there. </p>

<p>Yes I know, point is that the days when the Saudis were the major source of oil is gone, OPEC doesn&#39;t even have the power it once did. There are too many non-Saudi producers of oil, so while dollars are indeed the world currency it isn&#39;t because of oil nor does that amount to political power for the Saudis since their share of it is not as large as it used to be.</p>

<p>However, they DO still have money. And money buys influence in Washington.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, the massive improvements in living standards in Iran predate 2009 and the so-called &quot;Green Movement&quot;</p>

<p>Second, <strong>there was no &quot;Green Revolution&quot; in Iran</strong> that was just exaggerate crap in the US media which wanted to portray the Iranian govt as unpopular.</p>

<p>Let me explain something to you: the leader of the so-called &quot;Green Movement&quot; in Iran was Mousavi, a presidential candidate who claimed he had been cheated of victory in the 2009 elections in which Ahmadinejad (now Iran&#39;s former president) won a second and last term. </p>

<p>Mousavi was not a dissident, and he was not a regime-opponent. In fact, he was a hardline regime-insider, a former Prime Minister himself, and he had criticized Ahmadinejad during the elections for being <em>too soft</em> on the US in nuclear negotiations.</p>

<p>So the idea that the so-called &quot;Green movement&quot; was an anti-regime movement, <strong>is complete and total bullshit</strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, there would not have been any need for any election fraud to occur, because Mousavi was <em>not</em> a threat to the system and in fact like the rest of the Presidential candidates, his candidacy <em>had been vetted and pre-approved</em> by the same regime that supposedly engaged in massive election fraud (for which there&#39;s zero evidence) to keep him out of power.</p>

<p>However, images of people demonstrating in Iran was still good enough for the media in the to misrepresent as an anti-regime movement. Because as long as the government in Iran is shown to be unpopular, that undermines any argument in favor of improving relations with them -- precisely what the Israelis and the Pro-israeli lobby as well as the Saudis want: no US-Iran improved relations, preferably even a war of regime-change.  </p>

<p>Actually you can see the end of the demonstrators, and there were equal or larger counterdemonstrations by supporters of the other candidates,  but in any case once there was a recount and Mousavi was never able to actually point out the why or how of fraud, it all died down.</p>

<p>There were also BS claims that Irans&#39; soccer team members had worn green wristbands as proof of their support for the green movement -- actually green was part of the team uniform.</p>

<p>Then there were claims that Iran had banned the color green itself and even removed it from the national flag, which has a green bar.</p>

<p>Total bullshit of course but back then these were reported as fact.</p>

<p>Like I said, Mousavi is not a dissident. THis was an internal regime conflict, nothing more</p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you an example. Let&#39;s say George Soros funds a protest against Tyranny for some hidden nefarious agenda. If a million people show up to protest against Tyranny, then they are worthy of being praise, regardless of what the hidden intent of the protests were. Does that make sense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This looks extremely important. Astana, Kazakhstan is going to be where they merge the religions into the One World Satanic NWO Religion. They have almost complete control of all film, music, news and information. Surveillance of the public is so large now they have completed their Police State and not many have noticed. David Icke has said for many years that eventually all religions will have some pieces in the New World Religion that brings everyone to the table. All will be forced in the name of &quot;Global Peace&quot; anyways.

<p>Thousands to millions</p>

<p>Actually you can see the end of the demonstrators, and there were equal or larger counterdemonstrations by supporters of the other candidates,  but in any case once there was a recount and Mousavi was never able to actually point out the why or how of fraud, it all died down.</p>

<p>There were also BS claims that Irans&#39; soccer team members had worn green wristbands as proof of their support for the green movement -- actually green was part of the team uniform.</p>

<p>Then there were claims that Iran had banned the color green itself and even removed it from the national flag, which has a green bar.</p>

<p>Total bullshit of course but back then these were reported as fact.</p>

<p>Like I said, Mousavi is not a dissident. THis was an internal regime conflict, nothing more</p>

<p>Who said anything about my feelings. I&#39;m saying that I feel as though you are being disingenuous. For example, give me a source that proves your &#39;fact&#39; that it wasn&#39;t hundreds of thousands to millions of protestors. </p>
