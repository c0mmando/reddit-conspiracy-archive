       I’ve only had this iPhone for a year (maybe a little less) and I’m almost positive they mess up your phone purposely so you can buy the brand new one that just came out. I think this because I’ve had no problems with this phone up until iPhone X came out and now every so often it will say “No SIM card” and I won’t be able to text/call or go on the internet. I would have to restart my phone to get it working again. Today I had to restart it about 7 or 8 times... it’s getting ridiculous. This has happened to previous iPhones I’ve owned and to family members and friends. You can guarantee that I won’t be getting another iPhone!

       It's called manufactured obsolescence. The They Live race that's in charge right now has no shame about purposely designing their products to fail after a certain number of years so you have to buy a new one. Look up Right to Repair.

       It was the third time for me, a software update on a iphone that wasn't the current model, it slowed down the phone, apps quit more often, battery was unreasonably worse.  No problem i said, i just would never update my phone after new ones came out.  Problems stopped for me. until around ios 9 that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       This began the removal of the option to decline updates.  For 3 years at least 6-7 times a day i pressed later, more than a few times it popped up as i was pressing something else, resulting in me having to restart my phone to prevent the update.  It got worse, it started downloading the updates, restricting my storage space, no problem i said, i'll delete it and fill my storage with photos and music to prevent it.  But then came last summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I left my iphone on in my pocket by accident, and 'ghost dialed' the update, it downloaded on LTE and used half of my months data.  This was the last straw, I was to call apple.
      </p>
      <p>
       After 30 minutes on hold i got a hold of a very polite guy, I asked him how to disable updates due to performance, i followed his instructions, but to no avail.  He got his supervisor.
      </p>
      <p>
       After repeating my plight and going through the steps again, he told me what became the final straw.  He said the EULA that i signed explicitly said that i was voiding the agreement if i didn't update my phone.  I paused for a second, and confirmed what he said.  In my mind i was thinking 'I bought this product!, why should i have to modify my property after the fact.  I told him i'll solve it myself and not buy an iphone next time around.  I now have an android and I've never regretted it.

       It is best not to update an older phone late in its life. After the launch of a new model, updates are sent out to improve the performance of the new phone. So if you own an older phone, don't install the update.

       Cell phones ruin your mind.

      <p>
       Most of your day should be without interruption.

      <p>
       Technology is well past the point of benefit and deep into the recesses of exploitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't hook yourself on the dependence.

       If you really

        need

       the technology, at least write your own software.

       ITT: buzzwords like "planned obsolescence", speculation and zero input from anyone technically savvy in the field of cell phone technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun fact: your sim card is a tiny computer that runs at a speed of roughly 8MHz and has about 100 commands that can be utilized. Much like any piece of modern hardware, it does not last forever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get a new SIM. Maybe update your iOS using iTunes to factory load the latest greatest version. You know, the one without dozens of CVEs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and maybe treat your phone like a computer because it is one. Tell me, how well does your home PC run when you have 99 chrome tabs open and dozens of dozens of UWAs installed, all wanting permission to everything on your PC, including it's hardware accessories like the microphone and camera?
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone needs to address and stop this nonsense shitposting. This is

       FWIW, I believe in Bigfoot, mothman and aliens, but posts like this do more harm than good - creating an echo chamber that results in others buying into the notion that somehow not patching an insecure OS will make them safer or better off. Just stop.

       Planned obsolescence. But I don't know, Apple is the only one that actually updates their devices long term, five years I believe, they just leave out new features so you have to buy the next phone.

       I've had an iPhone 4 and 5 before ... Then I went to LG G3 ... I have it for 3 years now. LG and Google are not doing a good job on rendering tech outdated.

       What I can advise you is that you could backup via iTunes, restore to factory settings and then restore from backup. Do not update if you can!

       Use it for a couple of days (iOS is doing some database creating in your phone for a bit after this) and then tell me if it's better or the same.
