    <div class="md"><p>I can definitely see how an upset and paranoid wife could think legit legal porn was pedo porn.  It&#39;s like a whole nitch, legal teens they dress and makeup to come across more scandalous and younger.  I haven&#39;t exactly &quot;investigated&quot; the gay porn side of town, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s no different.  But who knows?  You&#39;re right not to infer such a grave conclusion, imho.  &quot;Pedophile&quot; isn&#39;t something you toss around lightly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I felt that the boys looked underage. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now I’m not claiming to be the smartest or most experienced guy in the world but underage looking boys look very different that 18 year old young adults. She wouldn’t mention the underage part if she wasn’t sure. The reason she mentioned it is probabaly because the porn featured small bodied, scrawny boys with baby faces which is typical of people around the ages of 10-13. Of course, she could be referring to toddlers as well. Either way, there is a huge different in the appearance of 18 year men VS 10 year old boys VS 5 year old toddlers. Claiming to know better than Denise, who was actually there and believes she saw underage boys and reported it as such, sounds invalid.</p>

<p>I believe Denise. Charlie is known as a monster and he’s a high level Hollywood tycoon who is probably under pedo insurance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is not something one would mention in legal divorce papers unless they were sure of those boys being underage. </p>

<p>I trust Denise judgement. Also, I know almost all of these high level Hollywood heavyweights are dirty. It’s damn near impossible to move up this high in Hollywood and make millions upon millions while protected by the oligarchy unless they have solid blackmail on them. The cabals favorite kind of blackmail is video of these Hollywood heavyweights engaging in sexual intercourse with children. Ditto for politicians. </p>

<p>I was <em>joking</em> that he was FBI because in another thread and comment chain on the topic of pizzagate, u/ninjakick666 claimed to have expertise in mannerisms and profiling (LOL). So I followed him here to where he is speaking about his deference to the FBI. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve received several PM&#39;s now from u/ninjakick666 and all of them are rude, deflecting and exactly the crap you are trying to place on me. Get the fuck out of here dude.

    <div class="md"><p>Child porn is a very serious accusation. The Headline is misleading. She said the people in the porn looked very young. Firstly, that doesn&#39;t prove they were under-age; secondly, she had to state things as starkly as possible in a divorce proceeding, even less reason to simply trust what she says.</p>

<p>Charlie Sheen may indeed get involved in those kinds of things, but this is very weak evidence.</p>
