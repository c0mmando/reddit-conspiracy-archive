    <div class="md"><p>It might be naive of me, but I&#39;m kind of comforted by the &quot;Q&quot; 4chan thing. It feels like we&#39;re on the cusp of something right now, the edge of some schism, I&#39;m excited about the idea of everyone around me waking up. I&#39;m watching it happen with my employees, it started with Vegas, I don&#39;t talk politics with my guys, ever, I love to listen to them though, get a normie point of view on things. We&#39;re a pretty conservative workplace and they typically eat every bit of propaganda any MSM gives out... But since Vegas they&#39;ve been real suspicious of things, I&#39;ve had to walk out of the break room a few times because I felt like I needed to praise them. </p>

<p>Fingers crossed, this big, ancient machine is starting to collapse and a new day is on the horizon. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>vegas is 100% hoax.</p>

<p>i can prove it but everytime i try i can deleted/banned. this is why its not anywhere.... its being deleted from the internet. somehow they didn&#39;t think it was a bad idea to be so bold. and they fucked up. but who cares right? they control the flow of information and can shape it to however they want. there was no second shooter or multiple shooters. it was all a hoax. (yes natural news guy is one of them :(</p>

<p>prioritize your time to find a single bullet hole. there are zero. they have faked a lot of footage of course. but start there... look up the term &quot;moulage&quot; and try find one bullet hole that is not faked.</p>

<p>peace</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s those stupid theories like people shooting from helicopters that stop the real truth of what happened that night..</p>

<p>Paddock bought the guns from gun stores, store owners have been interviewed saying yes in fact they did, paddock bought 10+ bags to the casino which clearly had the guns in them, he didnt bring 10 bags of clothes... </p>

<p>If the FBI was going to do it with a helicopter they would do it during one of the many times there is a gun convention is vegas so they know people in hotel rooms are gonna have firearms they can use as a patsy... </p>

<p>The helicopter theory etc has far far FAR more holes in it than the official narrative and fuck me the official narrative has more holes than the door leading to Paddocks room.. yet everyone jumps all over the helo theory and all other nonsense like a politician to a free lunch...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your take on the flight radar helicopters turning off their transponders? </p>

<p>You have a good point. Those may just be flashing lights. The more I look at it the more sense that makes. </p>

<p>The satire wasn&#39;t great. I thought you were serious at first. I didn&#39;t get the joke.</p>

<hr/>

<p>You have a logical explanation for the helicopter thing. So my great solution doesn&#39;t seem that great. Can you give your opinion on:</p>

<p>What&#39;s your take on the whole thing? </p>

<p>Why is the shooter a ghost? NO video, No nothing. The money to the Philippines? The girl friend? His money. His innocuous jobs that appear to tie him to something deeper? The fact that he &quot;made money&quot; slot gambling. The crappy investigation. The ever changing stories. The security guards armed being two stories below him. The Saudi ties to the hotel. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to overwhelm and I&#39;m not being factious. Looking for an opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe they did turn off their transponders, i believe it&#39;s an error/loss in the data from flight radar or from whatever source they use but i may be wrong.</p>

<p>My take on the whole thing -  I don&#39;t have a take, if you make up your mind on what you think happened then you will naturally try to find/try to make the evidence or videos fit your opinion. I&#39;d rather see evidence and see where that leads with no pre-determined idea of what happened.</p>

<p>There is video it just hasn&#39;t been released for whatever reason, there is old video of him walking through the Cosmo hotel and falling over in 2013 he&#39;s not a ghost at all - just not all over social media which as his brother pointed out &quot;what&#39;s weirder taking 10 photos of yourself everyday and plastering them on the internet for other people to approve of or living a private life, whos the weirdo&quot;</p>

<p>Money to the phillipines is only 100k... 100k for any high stakes gamblers is like a steak dinner, it&#39;s a lot of money but it&#39;s not going to affect their life in any way if it&#39;s gone. </p>

<p>The jobs only tie him to something deeper if you have a pre-determined idea he was an agent of some kind, although there is definitely questions that need to be answered there.</p>

<p>The fact that he made money playing Video poker is certainly a red flag or an interesting point of the narrative that reeks of bullshit.</p>

<p>Final thoughts - Honestly the more i think about it the more it stumps me. You can&#39;t have an opinion on it i don&#39;t think until the Sheriff starts telling the truth, because CLEARLY he has lied, not just misled or not accurate information but the guy has clearly lied about what they knew, and if he didn&#39;t lie then it screams incompetence. There were basics facts of the case, the absolute most basic of facts that were still being changed weeks after.</p>

<p>Every person who interviews the sheriff or gets to ask him question never asks any follow up&#39;s and they are the most softball questions, it&#39;s sick that as the sheriff he&#39;s not forced to hold a conference and answer questions the public has. 
My gut feelings are that he was involved in illegal dealing either Cocaine or Asian woman/indulged in Child porn online or he was talking to someone online about illegal things who he did some research on and realised it was most likely Law Enforcement he had been talking to and that he was going to be arrested in the future and rather than going to jail decided to go out with a bang.</p>

<p>He may also have just been frustrated that Vegas has changed a lot over the years and losing the identity as a Gambling town and the hotels comps being reduced.. All the huge outdoor concerts and EDM pool parties all through the summer and focusing on the party side of things rather than being a gambling town.. He also was isolated without a circle of friends so to speak his whole life and that can certainly fuel resentment that he was intelligent,managed to acquire money etc but never acquired friends who liked him for him.. Shooting at a concert and ONLY the concert was either just for mass casualties or it also was part of the motive, to end all the outdoor parties that had annoyed him for all these years. Remember he had made noise complaints about people in the past.</p>

<p>Here there is just theories with bigger holes than the official narrative yet people treat them like gospel, its what makes conspiracy theorists look like retards at times quite frankly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>vegas is 100% hoax.</p>

<p>i can prove it but everytime i try i can deleted/banned.
this is why its not anywhere....  its being deleted from the internet.  somehow they didn&#39;t think it was a bad idea to be so bold.  and they fucked up.    but who cares right?  they control the flow of information and can shape it to however they want.
 there was no second shooter or multiple shooters. it was all a hoax. (yes natural news guy is one of them   :(<br/>
prioritize your time to find a single bullet hole.  there are zero.   they have faked a lot of footage of course.  but start there... look up the term &quot;moulage&quot; and try find one bullet hole that is not faked.</p>

<p>peace</p>
