Yeah let's give him a year just for shits and giggles and then we'll try to get him impeached. The timing is just strange to me

       I think people are concerned about him starting WW3 -- I think its great there are ads to impeach him. The guy is a complete moron. Sorry if you voted for him. I can't say I blame you, Hillary was even worse.

       My question is- on what grounds? I didn't vote for Trump, and I don't support his agenda, but I don't see a single thing he has done worthy of impeachment...why don't we focus on his domestic and foreign policy failures so that we can try and get a real representative of the People to fight against him in 2020? Fuck this bullshit "BUT MUH IMPEACHMENT", it's pathetic and serves no purpose but to rabble rouse, imo.

       The ones I've been saying lately say that he is "mentally unstable" and has "his finger on the nuclear button"... or something to that effect... calmly narrated by a kind old gentleman with a very stern and concerned voice.

       Yeah... their own believers don't need any more convincing to hate Trump... They are already worked up into a tizzy to the point where I am surprised we haven't seen an article about the increase in suicides/heart attacks amongst the resistance.

       I fucking hate that line of reasoning...the "resistance", or when I see "RESIST" bumper stickers...they don't realize they're merely playing the Establishment game with such slogans. The
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       resistance is busy fighting not only Trump but the Democratic Party in general, trying to take it state by state, at the Precinct and Country level, so that a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       representative of the People might actually be able to win the Primaries in 2020 and take on Trump.

       I'll take Tulsi if Bernie doesn't run, which I think he will if he's healthy. The Party would be foolish to run another Corporatist like Kamala Harris or Deval Patrick or Biden...not to say I think they wont, in fact I'm certain they will.

       That's why we need to keep the fight on
       <em>
        now

       , we need to take the Party at every level so that we can ensure fair Primaries, in which I am confident a truly Progressive champion of the People will soundly defeat any corporate whore they put forward, assuming we can mostly level the playing field. The Establishment not only gambles with their own power come 2020, but the fate of the Republic itself.

       Bernie will be dead per my prediction... 18 months left in him tops... complications due to pneumonia. You sound like some revolution is supposed to happen... but unless they wedge Bernie in the whitehouse thru some socialist miracle shit will be business as usual. I've seen a lot of presidents come and go, but everything stays the same... but if I gotta get fucked by a politician it should be Tulsi... Ivanka is hot too...

       I have faith, though I understand where you come from. I just...can't let myself be so cynical. I tried it after HRC won the Primaries and then Trump won in November...I do not like the dark places it lead my mind to. I will be cynical if all else fails and come 2020 we get either a Corporatist Democrat or Trump.

       I want to see Tulsi as VP to Bernie or in a cabinet position, but as I said I will take her if Bernie doesn't run. I would really,
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       like to see her have a few more years of experience, just to solidify what she already represents. Bernie has 30 years of speeches and Congressional legislation/amendments to run on. Tulsi needs a bit more experience to prove she is who she says she is.

       Bernie ain't gonna run... I can see you being optimistic that somehow he might still end up president... but it's not gonna happen. Sadly he got cheated out of his chance... We want em young... being a lifetime politician at 70+ is how you enter the office with so many special interest groups and pwed favors rammed up yer ass that it is business as usual.

       Mostly this, I think. Gotta keep the sheep they've captured before those sheep burn down the DNC.

       In other news, Hillary's been consolidating her control over the DNC.

      <p>
       You don't really need grounds to impeach a president, it's a political process, not a legal one. I mean, god knows how it'd play out, that's a whole different kettle of fish, but you can impeach a president if enough members of congress don't like his haircut.

       It does requires grounds though...especially when both houses are controlled by the party the President belongs to. It definitely requires legitimate grounds if you want the People to go along with you and not reward the party of the Impeached President in the following elections if they think you targeted them unfairly...
