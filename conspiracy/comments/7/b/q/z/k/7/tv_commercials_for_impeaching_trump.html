<p>I fucking hate that line of reasoning...the &quot;resistance&quot;, or when I see &quot;RESIST&quot; bumper stickers...they don&#39;t realize they&#39;re merely playing the Establishment game with such slogans. The <em>real</em> resistance is busy fighting not only Trump but the Democratic Party in general, trying to take it state by state, at the Precinct and Country level, so that a <em>real</em> representative of the People might actually be able to win the Primaries in 2020 and take on Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take Tulsi if Bernie doesn&#39;t run, which I think he will if he&#39;s healthy. The Party would be foolish to run another Corporatist like Kamala Harris or Deval Patrick or Biden...not to say I think they wont, in fact I&#39;m certain they will. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why we need to keep the fight on <em>now</em>, we need to take the Party at every level so that we can ensure fair Primaries, in which I am confident a truly Progressive champion of the People will soundly defeat any corporate whore they put forward, assuming we can mostly level the playing field. The Establishment not only gambles with their own power come 2020, but the fate of the Republic itself.  </p>

<p>I have faith, though I understand where you come from. I just...can&#39;t let myself be so cynical. I tried it after HRC won the Primaries and then Trump won in November...I do not like the dark places it lead my mind to. I will be cynical if all else fails and come 2020 we get either a Corporatist Democrat or Trump.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I want to see Tulsi as VP to Bernie or in a cabinet position, but as I said I will take her if Bernie doesn&#39;t run. I would really, <em>really</em> like to see her have a few more years of experience, just to solidify what she already represents. Bernie has 30 years of speeches and Congressional legislation/amendments to run on. Tulsi needs a bit more experience to prove she is who she says she is. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t really need grounds to impeach a president, it&#39;s a political process, not a legal one. I mean, god knows how it&#39;d play out, that&#39;s a whole different kettle of fish, but you can impeach a president if enough members of congress don&#39;t like his haircut.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The campaign, which was previewed last week by the New York Times, is not a project of Steyer’s political organization, NextGen America. It is funded directly by Steyer, a donor who has not ruled out a run for office himself and who has built relationships with think tanks and elected Democrats in California and Washington&quot;</p>

<p>Think tanks and elected dems of Cali and Wa .... obviously. Destined for success.</p>
