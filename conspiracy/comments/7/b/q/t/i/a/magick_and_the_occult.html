        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I made a copypasta of a self-post I submitted to r/conspiracyundone a couple of months ago and that I have shared in comments here before. It seems like a bit of a slow night so I figured why not try and add something to the /new que? I also saw some people mentioning a lack of Occult/Numerology discussion in a thread earlier today so perhaps this will spark some conversation. I am also looking for any additional links/sources people might have to share.</p>

<p><strong>begin copypasta</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to make a post compiling some links to be used as a quick primer by anyone here, or to be used a a source for links to share, concerning Magick and the Occult. These sources are things I have found that are good to offer a quick rundown of specific topics involving Magick, Mystery Schools, and Occult Numerology. I would gladly welcome any additional links people could provide in the comments.</p>

<p>Before I post these links, I will share my thoughts on what Magick is. To me, Magick is the manifestation of ones Will into Reality. This can be as simple as the basic Chaos Magick, practiced by some, which involves the focusing of ones&#39; Will into a Sigil, to Music, which can be used to create thoughts and ideas in others minds that would otherwise never have come about if not for the song being created. This definition can be read as having either a spiritual or secular basis, which is why I find it such a compelling one.</p>

<p>This is the wiki entry for Hermeticism, a fantastic place for anyone who wishes to begin investigating the ideas surrounding Hermes Trismigestus, the Mystery Schools, and more-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism</a></p>

<p>This is a good primer for Gnosis and also dives in to Hermetic magick- <a href="http://gnosis.org/hermes.htm">http://gnosis.org/hermes.htm</a></p>

<p>Here is a link to start research on Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing and Magick, who was also associated with Hermes in the Greek Mythological tradition. 
<a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/thoth.html">http://www.crystalinks.com/thoth.html</a></p>

<p>This is an excellent primer on Occult Numerology and symbolism- <a href="http://www.cuttingedge.org/news/n1766.cfm">http://www.cuttingedge.org/news/n1766.cfm</a></p>

<p>Here is a primer from wiki on Crowleys&#39; definition of Magick and a rundown of this Thelema, an absolutely essential piece to understanding the modern Occult- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magick_(Thelema)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magick_(Thelema)</a></p>

<p>And Finally here is a place to start on John Dee, the man responsible for &quot;channeling&quot; the instructions to Enochian Summoning Magick, which is utilized by Mediums and anyone who is serious about communicating with other spiritual entities. He worked part in parcel with the Medium Edward Kelly in their attempts to discover this Magick system- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee</a></p>

<p>Here is the wiki on Edward Kelly- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Kelley">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Kelley</a></p>

<p>The History of Magic and the Occult (Book)- Kurt Seligmann</p>

<p>I hope that some might find this useful. These links/sources taken in aggregate are a good place to begin gaining an understanding into Occult symbolism and beliefs, as well as different systems of Magick utilized by them, such as Enochian (which is by no means the only one). This is nowhere near a comprehensive list, but it&#39;s a good place to start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My definition of Magick is closer to Crowley- that it is Will manifested into Reality. This leaves open both physical and extra-physical possibilities, but I like it because I feel that even incredibly mundane seeming things are Magick, such as Music, as I stated in the post. In fact, I feel that Music is an incredibly powerful form of Magick that can be used for good or bad. </p>

<p>Do you have any links you might like to contribute? I&#39;m looking for anything in the hopes that I might be able to learn more and compile a better list for a future post. </p>

<p>Will manifested into Reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exactly, your thoughts and &quot;imagination&quot; exist in 5 dimensional time and space which is then manifested into 3d when enough energy is transferred to it. There are certain rituals one can do to increase the ability to channel energy from these dimensions i.e. using a wand and channeling a ball of energy from it, using a jewlrey or crowns to channel energy to certain chakras, or even getting tatoo&#39;s and cutting one&#39;s hair. But ultimately once you begin to understand that everything is just energy what&#39;s possible and not becomes irrelevant, the only thing that matters is if their is enough energy from other sources to create it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was lucky enough to notice your edits :)</p>

<p>I still have plenty of research to do myself so I&#39;ll respond to just a couple of your points that I feel I can contribute something towards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The key is that you are always choosing what you are creating, consciously or subconsciously. Whatever your thoughts are focused on will have a direct effect on your reality. Choose wisely, sometimes the right choose is to choose nothing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely agree. Just as they say we are what we eat...your mind is what it consumes, we must be careful what we feed it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Take a minute to actually read the lyrics of some of your favorite &quot;popular&quot; songs, some of them are more sinister than you think and have the effect of essentially directly programming mass consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I already do my friend. I listen very closely to my music, and am very careful about what songs I add to my playlists. Music is incredibly powerful, and can be used for good of bad. The Ancient Greeks realized the power of Music as well, even going so far as to classify its&#39; different sounds and the moods they each invoked in the listener, so as to advise others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>or why Christians call Christ, the &quot;Word&quot; of God</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always found it fascinating that Christ was described as the Word, that spoken thought which manifested all of creation. Deep stuff when you really think about it. To quote the actual Greek:</p>

<p>Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν πρὸς τὸν θεόν, καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος. 2οὗτος ἦν ἐν ἀρχῇ πρὸς τὸν θεόν. 3πάντα δι&#39; αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο, καὶ χωρὶς αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο οὐδὲ ἕν.</p>

<p>&quot; In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with (the) God, and God was the Word, in the beginning He (it, aka the Word) was with (the) God, all was made through Him, and separate Him nothing was made.&quot; Very powerful stuff when you consider the idea of Will manifested into Reality, regardless of ones belief in Jesus or God in general. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want you to know that I really enjoyed reading your post and your comments and thank you for sharing this thread there isn&#39;t enough of this type of discussion on this sub.</p>

<p>I do warn you not to believe everything I say because it sounds good on paper. Mediate ask your inner self if what I am saying is really true. You may find me to be wrong and I may be wrong your intuition is stronger than you know.</p>

<p>I have found that the nature of our reality is two-fold one of self-exploration and discovery as we learn who we are and our purpose, but also to interact and share our experiences or &quot;creations&quot; so to speak with others or quite paradoxically actually ourselves because there really is no others :).</p>

<p>Amen brother, check out subliminals I like mind power&#39;s on youtube as they do not contain bineral frequencies which I am not quite sure of the effect on the subconscious. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I always find Greek and Roman cultures particularly fascinating, especially when considering that they had access to information stored in the Library of Alexandria before it was burned down, where reportedly much information from Atlantian culture was still recorded until Justinian destroyed it.</p>

<p>To speak further on Christianity. I think that the idea of the Trinity is really fascinating. The idea that you have the Father, &quot;the infinite&quot;, the Son &quot;Christ&quot;, the &quot;Word&quot;, the paradoxical manifestation of the infinite to finite, and the spirit, the energy that powers the creation.</p>

<p>You and me both, I have always been fascinated by Greek and Roman culture/history. It get&#39;s even more fun when you realize they are the genesis of Western Civ itself :)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From what I have read, some scrolls survived at the Imperial University of Constantinople until 1204 when the Venetians sacked the city. I fucking hate the Venetians...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Same here. The creator, the way in which he created, and the embodiment of the creator among men...incredibly interesting, even if one doesn&#39;t believe in Christian beliefs or scripture. There are deeper truths buried within either way, imo. </p>

<p>The Middle Ages while most would think of them as boring, much of that time consisted of rival brotherhoods, i.e. Knights Templar and Knights Calvary attempting to take control over hidden information to essentially enslave and maintain control over humanity much like what exists today. It sucks that most of this information will never be made official to the public.</p>

<p>I think you made good points in your lower post and you for sure understand the dimensions, I am just wary of people telling people to practice this because I did and I ended up messing with the wrong energies (and it is a lot easier to fall into this trap than people realize) and got myself in a situation in which I am still feeling the repercussions from, although I am a lot better now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, yes this is accurate on what we run into when this happens IMO</p>

<p>I hate to sound like a pessimist but I would strongly advise even touching base on starting to do this. </p>

<p>yes on one hand I know certain things now but it was all fun and games until I literally had to pray for the blood of Jesus Christ to protect me. yes I believe Jung&#39;s theory on this specifically is pretty accurate, but just take the information and use it to help yourself and others. don&#39;t go down the rabbit hole. it&#39;s tempting, it&#39;s literal (although how so would be a very complicated and detailed explanation), and you might not come back. </p>

<p>this world isn&#39;t what it seems, and yes it&#39;s one thing to know this as a good percentage of people on this sub do, but it&#39;s another thing to actually experience it. </p>
