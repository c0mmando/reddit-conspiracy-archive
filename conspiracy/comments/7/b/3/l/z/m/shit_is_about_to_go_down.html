<p>I’ll never not be amazed how people on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> need exhaustive amounts of proof for anything critical about the <strong>president of the United states</strong> to be true. But the flimsiest rumor involving Clinton or Podesta is fact. This sub is practically an executive branch cheer squad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Criminals are criminals. If Trump is doing illegal shit he should be prosecuted, however there isn&#39;t direct evidence of that available to the public.</p>

<p>Hillary and co. have done illegal shit, that does need prosecuted, and the evidence is available to the public. It&#39;s obvious, still, that it was institutional corruption and not just a few bad apples.</p>

<p>So shitty people around Trump, doing shitty and illegal things is bad, yeah, but none of it implicates Trump. Hillary on the other hand, has a trail of bodies, a shit ton of highly suspicious financial transactions and election fraud to top it off.</p>

<p>Justice has been perverted in the case of Hillary Clinton. Justice has yet to be served to Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re weren&#39;t any riots.</p>

<p>Check out this guy&#39;s post history, he averages about eight words per post, all vague defenses of an amorphous progressiveness that just exists in an adversarial propaganda vacuum with the &quot;alt-right&quot;. People who actually follow politics know full well that the &quot;alt right&quot;, insofar as anyone self-identifies as it, is an explicitly ethnocentric exercise. White Nationalism, ethnostate, White Separatism, White Identity Er-vopa, whatever you want to call it. If you ain&#39;t white, you ain&#39;t alt-right. Unless you&#39;re Japanese maybe, you sort of get a pass on the anime thing.</p>

<p>The propaganda value for employees like Tally Mail is in disingenuously associating actual firm political opponents with a white identity movement, thus discrediting it. Tally represents a group seeking greater social control on the population, and thus he uses shame as a weapon to corral the public into compliance on global socialism, cultural relativism, the role of masculinity, and counter-intuitively, the attitude towards Muslim and Islam.</p>

<p>Tally Mail has a pretty simple job, but if he better understood that the reason he must defend communists and Muslims is because his group beholden to Saudi Arabian billionaires and degenerate sadomasochist social engineers, he might reconsider the dismissive tone in his posts. It pays the bills, but it must weigh on you by the end of the day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You might want to read closer... the &quot;claim&quot; that Snopes debunks is <strong>&quot;Law enforcement agents have announced that &quot;antifa&quot; is planning extended violent unrest or civil war beginning on 4 November 2017.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>NOT that groups like Refuse Fascism were organizing events for Nov 4th, which they were planning since the summer. Snopes even linked to the article from the summer...</p>

<p><a href="https://refusefascism.org/2017/08/06/this-nightmare-must-end-the-trumppence-regime-must-go/">https://refusefascism.org/2017/08/06/this-nightmare-must-end-the-trumppence-regime-must-go/</a></p>

<p>The VIOLENCE and outright civil war fear-mongering in conservative media was certainly overblown (anarchists aren&#39;t great organizers, surprisingly), but certain anti-fascist groups WERE trying to coordinate a unifying day of action. I humbly suggest you&#39;re confusing the hype around said (non)events with their very existence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did you even read your own link? That&#39;s a Snopes about Antifa starting a &quot;civil war&quot;, not having a major coordinated protest.</p>

<p>If you read it you might learn that <em>&quot;It is true that some groups linked to the antifa movement planned co-ordinated protests on 4 November 2017 . . .&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;There was an uptick in the rumor’s spread on 1 November 2017, when the groups advertised the 4 November 2017 demonstrations in the New York Times.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Some people believed there would be widespread violence because, you know, Antifa are insane LARPing Neo-Maxists who like to beat people up, throw explosives, set things on fire, stab people, break windows, etc. It&#39;s not exactly weird to think they might do that kind of thing when they announce coordinated protests in 20 cities on the same day and call it a &quot;Day of Rage&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you really this dense? You&#39;re kind setting of alarm bells over here at the Sincerity House.</p>

<p>One last time. Antifa announced a coordinated 20 city protest through their Facebook groups and a full page ad in the New York Times, calling it a Day of Rage and stating their intent to continue the protest indefinitely until they overthrew the government. Many people upon learning of this assumed that the revolutionary groups would use violence, arson, and explosives, since those have been their tactics for the past 12 months. But, for whatever reason, nobody showed up and it was a bust.</p>

<p>So, you can clearly see that the &quot;riots&quot; are an inference by people who saw that a group who routinely riots and sets things on fire was planning a coordinated Day of Rage. Unabashedly violent Marxist revolutionary group plans huge national protest? Yeah, figure they&#39;ll riot, that&#39;s what they usually do.</p>

<p>See, nice and tidy. No confusion at all.</p>

<p>Because various subs said nothing was planned doesn&#39;t mean that that RF wasn&#39;t clearly (and poorly) planning exactly what they said they were. The two aren&#39;t mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>Nothing is going to go down today. OP, and the poor sources he&#39;s operating off of, are presuming that the new sealed indictments filed last week are going to result in fireworks today. That isn&#39;t how it works, if they were filed last week it&#39;ll take longer than a few days for those to go public and get action. Even if it WAS how it worked, 1/3rd of all federal cases in that district are sealed, so there will be a LOT of sealed indictments apart from anything Mueller-related.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You see, here’s where my comment comes into play.  Why does it seem like I’m the current dialogue, either Trump is a horrible criminal, or Clinton is, but it can never be both?  First of all, Trump has personally admitted to sexual assault, which seems to be skated past.  Obviously this is not a huge issue compared to the allegations towards Clinton, but I am definitely also expecting Trump to be charged with money laundering and possibly human trafficking.  However, unlike most people, I don’t think that the crimes that I believe Trump committed make the crimes that Clinton committed fine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I listen to Lift The Veil. He’s a little weird at times and he goes on a little too much about his YouTube channel and such before getting to the actual issues but his calm delivery is refreshing. Plus he usually puts out several episodes per week. I also listen to Ground Zero Radio. It’s a syndicated radio show out of Oregon that uploads episodes each day from the night before. Those two are probably the most topical that I’ve found since they put out podcasts so often they can comment on current issues. Higherside Chats with Greg Carlwood is good for general conspiracy discussion but his interviews are typically planned out in advance so it doesn’t normally include current events. Crrow777 puts out a podcast on his website (crrow777radio) every Thursday. He’s a little more out there but has some interesting ideas. His show is sometimes more topical but he usually has more broader conspiracy theories he wants to discuss. </p>

<p>If anyone else has anymore resources, I’d love to expand my horizons more. </p>

<p>In other words,  the markets/economy could not be allowed to crash,  would be propped up at any cost,  to maintain certain domestic illusions and expectations and mandates,   none of the players was willing to take the heat for &quot;causing&quot; the end of the bubble.    Yet the bubble has to end,  and blaming the end of the bubble on Iran is the ideal solution for these mental cripple psychopaths.    I certainly hope I am wrong,  we have seen the devastation already enacted on Syria,  Iraq,  Libya,  Afghanistan,  we have effectively been in WWIII since 2003 as far as the victims of the US preemptive wars in the middle east would see it,  with hundreds of thousands,  maybe millions dead already,  (especially if you count the half million children Madeline Albright justified) and millions more refuges.   Pictures of ruined cities in Syria,  and how many other countries,  pictures of the refugee crisis in Europe should be proof enough as well.    Hope Iran is not the next to be added to the list,   especially since Russia and China would not stand by any more than they have stood by in Syria or the Ukraine where the US is trying to close down their naval bases.    This has been ramping up but we are at a high stress point with the motivations of the capitalist systems cyclical crash pattern screaming for a signal for releasing 10 years of witheld bad news.   When the bad economic data is finally allowed to come out,  it will flow with a vengance,  many cities and states and pension systems will default,  and the corporate statements will unload all the hemoraging they have been hiding for a decade.   Like sheep,  the whole mood will change.   The crash will be orchestrated and they need a scapegoat that blames it all on someone else,  when it is themselves that have been running a crumbling impossible ponzi scheme way way way past its expiration date as if nothing was rotten to the core.</p>

There hasn&#39;t ever been a democratic primary that heated before?<br/>
They wanted to split the democratic party, and then paint Hillary as evil, so now the democratic party is divided. Divide and conquer.<br/>
Obviously Hillary and Bernie wouldn&#39;t be in on this setup if it was against them.<br/>
But it&#39;s kinda weird how so much shit can just come out of nowhere? I mean, who knows what the CIA and FBI have been setting up to just fuck over people. We live in a day and age where anything can be falsified, where no one knows what the fucks going on, and as the fuckery increases, it just justifies more and more executions and prisoners because people want more and more change but it&#39;s all going the wrong way.</p>

<p>I think we should focus on actual conspiracies like how the Democrats are doing stuff.  I mean have you even heard about Hillary Clinton before?  She must be the source of literally everything wrong with the world right now.  I heard that she was the one actually colluding with Russia and hacking the DNC to help the Republicans even though she totally controlled it the same way party nominees usually do, just so she could sell US minerals to a foreign country that cannot export them outside of our borders, just to fund a pedophile ring that somehow does not include Epstein and Trump.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty clear from my original comment that I thought that the idea of &quot;riots&quot; and &quot;civil war&quot; were overhyped by conservative media, in that I was at least in part agreeing with you.</p>

Most right wingers know that &quot;antifa&quot; are mostly distraught and disillusioned college students and disenfranchised city-dwellers who have latched onto the idea of Antifa.  lmao.  Pretty much everyone knows this.  And they know there is really no centralized planning except for faggots like Soros potentially funding this crap (and we don&#39;t even know this for sure!!!)  What we do know is that the MSM are corrupt lying pieces of shit, getting everyone riled up.  Yes, Trump is a blowhard, and yes, Clinton wasis corrupt.</p>
