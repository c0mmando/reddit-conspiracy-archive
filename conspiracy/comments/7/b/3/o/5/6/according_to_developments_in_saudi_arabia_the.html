        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>China is offering to buy up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco directly. </p>

<p>Chinese state-owned oil companies PetroChina (0857.HK) and Sinopec (0386.HK) have written to Saudi Aramco in recent weeks to express an interest in a direct deal, industry sources told Reuters. </p>

<p>source: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-aramco-ipo-china-exclusive/exclusive-china-offers-to-buy-5-percent-of-saudi-aramco-directly-sources-idUSKBN1CL1YJ">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-aramco-ipo-china-exclusive/exclusive-china-offers-to-buy-5-percent-of-saudi-aramco-directly-sources-idUSKBN1CL1YJ</a></p>

<p>And then President Donald Trump personally lobbied Saudi King Salman to list the Saudi Arabian Oil Co. on the New York Stock Exchange during a phone call between the world leaders on Saturday, according to a readout provided by the White House.</p>

<p>source: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-04/trump-calls-for-saudi-aramco-to-list-on-new-york-stock-exchange">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-04/trump-calls-for-saudi-aramco-to-list-on-new-york-stock-exchange</a></p>

<p>Before the coup d’etat Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman made an expression for showing himself to the west, he is a good candidate and seek support in the next developments: </p>

<p>&quot;We want to lead normal lives, lives where our religion and our traditions translate into tolerance, so that we coexist with the world and become part of the development of the world,&quot;</p>

<p>Then coup has begun. Crown Prince won.  Now China is more dependant to Russian energy. All of these started with Trump’s Asia visit. After succesfull game change in Arabia, Trump made a call to King and gave his appreciation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How does the arresting of these people play into this? And also what’s your take on the “downed plane/helicopter”? </p>

<p>I am someone who voted for trump based on policies and obviously didn’t want Hillary. We ALL know this. So I am definitely someone who believe in the core of what he will so it’s the foreign affairs that always piss me off. This is where I’m starting to get mad. </p>

<p>Thanks op for the great post. A good one, finally. Not from you just the sub in general lol </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bin Nayef was a morphine and cocaine addict.  Passed over for throne, demoted.</p>

<p>So he plotted to kill Salman, wanted to kill PetroDollar, trade oil in yuan, was complicit in Las Vegas fuckery, and is now royally fucked.</p>

<p>May be put to death soon.</p>
