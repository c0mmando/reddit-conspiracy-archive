<p>If our government was behind the attack and had already rigged 3 buildings to implode, they couldn&#39;t risk some incompetent hi jacker would miss the &quot;target&quot;.  Based on the cellphone conversations it doesn&#39;t seem plausible they were in flight anyway.  That means they likely switched planes.</p>

<p>What happened to the 265 passengers?  Nothing short of murder and cremation even remotely makes sense.  The people responsible couldn&#39;t risk DNA or other means of identification.  It&#39;s difficult to grasp something like that would have occurred.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s more likely in 2001 than it is now. Also I don&#39;t think the cell towers were nearly as well directed as they are now - by which I mean the coverage wasn&#39;t as close to the ground (efficient) as they are now.  </p>

<p>Not to start a flame war but making a cell call in 2001 from a plane was pretty common. You see back then, cell phones weren&#39;t computers, they were just talking boxes so they had to talk box real good or no one would buy them. Also many fewer cell towers, so most talk boxes had pretty reliable long range radios that used a lot of power, but since they were only talk boxes and not phones - they only really nuked your battery while you were talking and could sit in standby mode for months. </p>

<p>Now that we have cellular rotaries that are also phones, there are many more cell towers, and many more YouTubes - the cell radios need to be lower powered to cause minimal interference/noise on the network made possible by having 100x as many cell towers so you&#39;re never too far away (and if you are there&#39;s presumably fewer people i.e. Clearer channels). </p>

<p>Also once Jetpacks fell out of fashion cell towers no longer needed to provide cover several thousand feet in the air and it was more efficient to focus them at ground level. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I&#39;ll check that out.  I agree they weren&#39;t close to capacity, but I&#39;ve taken multiple red eye flights which had less than 10 passengers total on large planes.  Sometimes the flights just aren&#39;t full.  Plus fuel prices back then were much lower.</p>

<p>Saying they were the 4 least populated flights of the tens of thousands in the air that morning seems like a leap.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree the official story sounds unbelievable which is the point of my post. You could argue the thousands of tower victims were &quot;collateral&quot;, but the passengers would likely to have been straight up murdered.  That seems more difficult for me to grasp. </p>

<p>I guess I was hoping in the almost 20 years some solid theory was out there for what happened.</p>

<p>I appreciate the feedback though </p>
