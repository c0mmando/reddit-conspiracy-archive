       It seems like as soon as someone is identified as mass shooter or terrorist, their Facebook profile disappears. Is FB doing this on their own accord? Or are they urged to do so by police? Or do the perpetrators erase their FB prior to going on an attack?
      </p>
      <p>
       For my own morbid curiosity, I wish these profiles would stay up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's something sinister necessarily, but I was just wondering about who actually removes these profiles.

       Usually it's not deleted, just has all the privacy settings set way up. My guess is it's a combination of the police requesting that the pages be preserved/archived and family hiding it for privacy.

       Open up the laptop/iPad/whatever they used where they’re probably still signed in.

       Also you can set up someone to be the “guardian” of your page if you die so they can access it.

       Seems common sense that if you're going to commit a massacre, you'd probably try to reduce your digital footprint.. and if they don't, police would obviously want it hidden for investigative purposes.

       I've only seen people say this shit, again, where's the archive? I tend to only trust something I can actually verify, not pictures of claims (this is the very reason everyone archives, and pictures tend to be to used most often to manipulate views).
      </p>
      <p>
       So again, link to archive so I can see for myself. I'm sure others would be just as interested.

       It was up right after they released the name. I looked it up myself. I did not know it was him at the time because there are a hell of a lot of people sharing that name. But it was definitely up. Not much to be seen from public view though.

       I wish I had. There were just so many people with that name. Like, upwards of 50 people. I remember seeing him holding his baby. But it was not until later, and apparently after it gotten taken down, that I had enough info to know which guy it was. It’s a shame no one was able to catch it.

       But it really is weird these profiles get taken down. Or some shooters never have a profile visible.

       Often Twitter and YouTube accounts seem to stay online, but Facebook is usually offline pretty swiftly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect police or other agencies would quite quickly reach out to Facebook and ask that the account be hidden and preserved. I imagine it's possible that Facebook staff might occasionally do this proactively too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume it would be useful to preserve evidence for investigators, but also to protect the privacy of friends and family.

       Indeed, although that's not super important as I'd be incredibly surprised if Facebook couldn't fairly easily rollback any changes. But it would certain make it simpler.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are whole processes around how Facebook can deal with the
       <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1506822589577997/">
        accounts of people who've died

       It is terrifying to think that that anger was more intelligent than the man, that that atrocity was more guileful and capaciously informed than the people of the town. For that anger perfectly controlled the man and eluded whatever vigilance or wisdom there was to explain and defend against such acts. That anger grew in the shadow of late modernity’s generalized unawareness, an endemic humanistic and political ignorance in the midst of, indeed nourished, fortified, and inflamed, by the mirages, images, and otherwise exponentializing delusions of Facebook and alike fora of idolatrous capitalist obsession.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of which, in the case of the rich it is the almost amniotic security of wealth and its reciprocative power that ironically spurs obsession of its increase (perceived or defended as protection against the inverse), while in the case of the working and ever more precarious classes it frequently takes a diametrically material (as opposed to abstract) and literally weaponized form, that of fire arms, preferably those most redolent of America’s militarily imperial destructive power. Yet this concretized and materially weaponized psychology and culture is, for this very reason, likewise ultimately a form of political and ideological possession and control (whereby the working class is significantly corralled and controlled by the disguised–as opposed to transformed–symbolic force of traditional capitalist military oppression). Through their thorough identitary investment in the collection of arms this class, or pluralities of it, becomes in turn collected, controlled, indeed ‘cognitively conditioned’ by the politically narrowly defined symbolic force and character of said object-symbol, in effect becoming weaponized by the weapons they collect in the service of an ultra-capitalist, anti-working class, Republican Party. To wit, the mass phenomenon of fire arms/weapons collection serves by abstract psychological and cultural operations and mechanisms to coalesce, entrap and orient invaluable pluralities of the proletariat in directions which, by all other (rational) measurements, are opposite to their empirical demographic economic interests. Elite interests are thereby served while the proletariat through their hyper-reified idealizations of the world and their role within it is further enchained in an ongoing, self-perpetuating cycle and machine of inexorably increasing exploitation and precarization, upon which the elite capitalist class establishes, renews, and compounds its hyper-fortified bases of national and global imperial systems of control, security, and power.
