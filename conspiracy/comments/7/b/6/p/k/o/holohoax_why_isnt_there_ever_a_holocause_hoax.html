       OK.  Well until I have proof it didn't like I had proof it did in school I'm more likely to believe that 6 million Jews did die, hitler was an absolute cunt who fucked his cousin had one nut and a poo fetish and that the nazi regime was evil as fuck

       There's a lot of proof out there, but much of it is heavily suppressed so you have to go looking for it. It helps to find a place to start. What evidence have you seen that really convinces you that 6 million Jews were rounded up and exterminated via gassing, ovens, etc?

       I hear you. I never questioned it until I decided one day to look for proof that it didn't happen, a couple years ago. I always thought Holocaust deniers were either crazy, or they knew it did happen but simply denied it because they hated Jews. I don't feel that way anymore.

       lol have you ever done the math? Did you know a brick and morter furnace could NEVER burn at the rate they say they did.  Do you know how long it takes to burn a body? Do you know how much fuel is needed? Did you know that the furnace buildings were set up with the furnace on the top floor? That means hauling up bodies on a tiny shitty elevator to burn them.  There is no way it was anywhere near half of what they say.  What ever "proof" you think you read, think again.

       like I said people died, it was war.  6 million people is bullshit.  My step grandmother spent time in camps toward the end and told me all kinds of stories.  Most dont match what we learn in history.

       Interesting! Everyone I've talked to who spent time in concentration camps (granted only two maybe three tops) matched up to what I learnt, to a degree. Didn't push for details as I was just a curious acquaintance with no right to push for information on something as terrible as what they went through and was worried about potential flash backs or something on these elderly individuals, but being your step grandmother I'm sure she's willing to share more information with you than I ever heard from the people I talked too.

       I was very close to her and was toung so holding back questions wasn't going to happen lol.  She told me that when she arrived in the camps they were not what people say.  They were clean and people were happy (as they could be, this IS still a war camp).  She did tell me how they butned all the paperwork people owned and took thier valuables, etc.  She couldnt remember her burthday and had no documents left to prove her identity.  She said that toward the end is when it was the worst because they ran out of supplies and people started to die.  She also confirmed that the trains stopped coming in around this time.  She was in multiple camps throughout the war but I cannot remember which off the top of my head.  There were people still being brought in up until the trains were cut off meaning that people who arrived later in the war never saw the "good" version because by that time the camps were screwed.  I am far from an expert on the topic but through my research so far there are more proofs that show we have been taught lies rather than the history.

How am I dupposed to prove discussions between a grandmother and grandchild? stop being rediculous and go do some reading because she is by far mot the only person who says this is what they experiemced.

       First I dont look for spelling or grammer when I post/reply, etc.  I am on monile and at work usually so I just post.  I understand you cant just tale me on my word, I expect that much from r/conspiracy! lol BUT I am not a liar and I only like to seek out information.  I have no way to prove what she said to you but it is something I compare to when reading on this subject.  I dont care if you believe me but I hope that you can entertain the idea that you may have been lied to....

       If this is the first time you are hearing these things, you need to look deeper.  There have been many people over the years who show evidence contrary to mainstream thought.  Also WW2 was a complexity of happenings amongst the world leaders and there is good evidence that the war was created same as we did after 9/11.

       It’s outlawed to deny that the holocaust occurred in much of Europe. You should try to travel there and visit the concentration camps and talk to people who were actually there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read up on a guy called David Irving (listed on Southern poverty Law center site as an extremist) he is banned from Austria because of the harm his hateful speech causes to people who were directly involved in the holocaust.
      </p>
      <p>
       I 100% believe the holocaust occurred because: I have heard first hand accounts of it in school (grew up in France) and visited actual camps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t be a hateful prick like David Irving who goes to Austria to stir up racist ideologies and groups.
      </p>

       You can however go and strike up respectful and intellectual conversations with the appropriate people - those who speak English, for one, and those who have a lot (really a ton) of more knowledge on the subject than you.

       the camps existed but not as murder camps or anything.  They were created for the jews who refused to leave so they were placed in camps so an eye could be kept on them.  isnt it funny how hatred for jews has its own identifiying word.  That alone tells me they are controlling information.

       Francophobe, Anglophobe, Russophone, Germanophobe. Just for those I've listed. These are actual terms. Google that. The difference is that usually there's no religious motives attached to them, so they're not as prominent, and not nearly as many cultural motives as the ones that propel anti-semitism.

       Great info!  I just don't understand why the Jews are so hated.  Even when I look for it, I can't find it outside of the Holocaust.  I see accusations at times, but I've never seen the actual discrimination or persecution.  Same thing with the various phobias you listed above.. haven't seen them.  The only thing I've seen is some toward Blacks, Mexicans, and Native American's (and what I saw was based on stats that support the racist view.)   Just observing.

       Jews were widely persecuted almost everywhere they were. Pogroms in Russia, hunted down by Catholic church and more. The reason is simple - the people need a scapegoat.
The church or monarch screw up? They blame the jews and save their political careers. If there weren't any Jews around, or there was a smaller minority, the government would blame them instead and the Jews would be spared. This is a very natural action and thus was very frequently used.

       While succeeding so much? Not many, or none at all. But if you remove that factor, then many.
But please spare me the "intelligent race/culture" thing. I'm Jewish and I can tell you from first hand experience it's not the case. Only the secular or atheist Jews can be considered normal in a European sense. The rest, orthodox and ultra orthodox are embattled in power struggles and the seculars can't seem to unhook themselves (ourselves) from the grip of fundamentalists. Ws're very much a divided country and nation.
An intelligent race cannot be divided as easily.

       I've veered too much off topic, so I'll just repeat; Other than a few successes, many more peoples suffered a similar fate.
Perhaps two distinguishing factors can be origin and political status.
Jews have developed their culture all across the world but established a very strong presence in Europe before WW2. As such a western man who dominates social media (as a group) will regard Jews with more importance (for better or worse) than, say, an African group. Because of familiarity.

       Second, Israel is in the heart of the world's most volatile region. It is bound to be discussed.
And it has its effect - following several wars Egypt and Jordan transitioned to the West, and perhaps Syria and Lebanon may too, in the future.

       Hitler believed, along with others, that the Jewish presence was a non-native threat to the well-being of the people. Post WW1 the Germans were bankrupted &amp; money was worth more as fore starter than its purchasing power. Think USA great depression. Hitler claimed that the Jews were the money changers, and that they hid themselves by being matrilineal, meaning they decide Jewish heritage based upon mother's lineage, rather than fathers. Many who would claim there are inequities with the Holocaust "official story" would also claim that the same story was used as fodder for the request to establish Israel, which was authorized post WW2.
If you read further into the Jewish conspiracy you'll find that the Jews were seemingly used as a scapegoat by men who were of alleged Jewish descent but were not of the Semitic people. I think Khazar was the term I read at one point when I jumped into this curious rabbit hole in the past.

       There is actually a very good reason for this. Historically, Jews could not own property or sell goods with the same level of freedom as Christians. Consequently, they were forced to gravitate towards professions like Usury, Law, Accountancy, and Science. Whilst such limitations have disappeared, people largely remain in the same fields as their families.

       Look through history and there is so much hatred towards Jews. Marx wrote a book called "on the jewish question", Luther absolutely despised them, the peasants crusade in Germany murdered as many as they could, they were expelled from numerous Christian countries ij the middle ages, Russia had numerous pogroms against them. I haven't read it yet but David Nirenberg has a book that looks very good called "anti-judaism"

       you are rewriting history: Jews were desperate to leave there was no place to go. People went to France, Hungary, Chechslovakia and ended up in camps; people watched their parents walk away and be gassed. Eyewitnesses.

       Did you read these peoples testimonies? There are a lot who said in court that they didnt actually see those people go into the building.  they saw them walking toward the furnace, this is not proof, its an assumption.  I am not rewriting history, lmfao, that has already been done...

       Read? I heard their testimonies from living survivors and they didn’t walk towards the crematorium - the went Into “showers” where they were gassed, that is murdered.  There were people who worked in the crematorium recognized people they knew.  Other people described carrying the dead out of the “showers”. People who cannot accept  that people, and jews were gassed and died in the Holocaust deserve a special place in Hell.

       I fucking hate breaking reddiquette and everything but this is the straw that breaks the camel's back.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you'll tell me I'm a shill or I got bamboozled or whatnot but man I grew up in Elsass and I had friends whose grandparents were taken to camps. So sure maybe all of those 100s of people I've met over the course of my life who were survivors or had been in direct contact with survivors all lied or were in on it. You can decide to believe that. I'm just gonna go with the believable option that it's not a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure it's what the schools teach, because schools don't exist just to teach bullshit. You learnt 2+2 = 4 at school and I hope you're quite convinced by that one. I know it's hard to admit that sometimes,
       <em>
        sometimes
       </em>
       , the "official truth" is just "the truth". But man the Holocaust is real and no amount of "but it could be an elaborate hoax" hand-wringing is gonna change that reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       For fuck's sake I know it's hard to believe real humans would do this shit, and that's why that American general whose name I forget wanted pictures and films to be taken, because he himself,
       <em>
        being there in person
       </em>
       , had trouble processing it. But maybe that should hint you that this isn't a complete load of bullshit.

       I've seen it! Extremely interesting, as though history were different.  I do take some of what is said with a grain of salt, but I must say that the series really opened my eyes.  Most of what was presented is independently verifiable.  Check out the "foundation myth" video by "black pigeon speaks" when you have the time.  Insightful.

       In the US, we can--for now--but, laws against holocaust denial have been proposed and rejected a number of times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently, it is illegal in 16 European countries and Israel. There are additional countries that criminalize genocide denial, of which the holocaust would apply. In Austria, one could potentially be jailed for a decade for minimizing the events/effect of the Holocaust.

       I'm just thinking it would be really funny to try and /exaggerate/ the effects of the Holocaust. Like saying 60 million Jews died after being subjected to MKultra.

       If it weren't for those laws, I never would have even thought to look into the holohoax. I went to the camps, I saw the documentaries/movies, and I believed what I was taught in school. But, when I came across those laws, I immediately knew something was askew. After looking into it, I just felt dumb for having believed it was real.

       It’s pretty simple though - it’s “illegal” to deny the Holocaust because of people like David Irving who go to Austria and other European countries to try and rattle up racist groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point me towards a Holocaust Conspiracy Theory that doesn’t end up being anti-Semitic and you can start connecting the dots that it isn’t a law that stops people from talking about the holocaust all-together but instead prevents people from saying the worst genocide in human history was a Jewish conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason these laws exist are because, usually, the people who are claiming the Holocaust never occurred are neo-nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s take Austria for example: made the use of the Nazi symbol illegal and suppressed any possibility of Nazism reviving in 1947.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1992, because of people like David Irving - actual Neo Nazis, spreading racist ideologies across Austria, they made an amendment to the 1947 law to forbid the denial of the Holocaust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I realize that believing the Holocaust isn’t real does not mean you are a neo-Nazi automatically but look into the laws banning holocaust denial from the countries that adopt them and the events that were going on at the time and it starts looking a lot less like a conspiracy.

       But, it takes a certain amount of time to burn a body. This information is well-know and documented. Even if the ovens were running 24/7, and they overloaded the intended capacity, there is no possible way they could have burnt +6,000,000 bodies. It is not even possible using using modern crematory ovens. Because of fact like that, the number was reduced to 4million, then down to 2 million, and latest official number I saw was something like 600,000.

       I’m confused because the Holocaust was never defined as 6m Jews being cremated, but in fact the mass murder of 6m. Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       So your saying because of the fact that it is impossible to cremate 6 million Jews the holocaust could have never occurred?

      <p>
       Who says (other than you) that all murdered Jews were cremated? Did you forget (or ignore doing any research) that Nazis rounded up Jews, either forced them to dig a giant grave or just lined them up and shoot them?

       Besides, if you round up millions of people, force them to dig their own grave, then there is ZERO reason to also spend the resources to transport them to these supposed crematory camps. Your logic and your thinking is flawed. But, that is your own problem.

       How is asking someone to cite a source for a claim they are making unethical? Please explain this because I’m genuinely interested in hearing your mental gymnastics of trying to explain yourself when realizing you don’t know what the word unethical means.

       And Jesus man, sourcing the information you’re using to make an argument, especially when you are making such wild claims, is a very fundamental principle that is used by everyone in all academic fields, including history.

       For you to research the word unethical? Ok but it looks like I’ll be waiting a couple days for that. Take your time with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s summarize: you think that the holocaust was over exaggerated because it’s impossible to cremate 6m bodies in the given timeframe - this is true - But you forgot that cremation wasn’t the only way Nazis killed Jews - because like you said, terrible things happen to people during war such as starvation, gas, being worked to death, and mass executions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also you believed that the Nazis couldn’t possibly allocates any resources to this mass extermination - even though it was a very central plan to their war.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then there is your misunderstanding (of simple concepts and) how citing sources works and why it is done in academic/scientific research.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m dealing with a troll because no one is this stupid.

       Dude, I've been part of academia for over 2 decades; my parents were in leadership positions their entire career (i.e., president/chancellor). Academia has been my entire life; I know exactly how the system work.

       If you’ve been “part of academia for over 2 decades” wouldn’t you know how to cite a source?

      <p>
       Wouldn’t you know that asking someone to cite a source is not an unethical thing to do?

       High school was a breeze: I graduated egregia cum laude and started college at 15. A decade later I had completed 5 degrees in 7 concentrations. I am not concerned in the slightest what you think of my credibility.

       Hahaha this has got to be a troll... 5 degrees and you still think someone who is asking you to cite a source in an argument is unethical?
      </p>
      <p>
       When you wrote research papers for these degrees did you just end them with “I’m not citing any sources because it’s lazy and unethical, my parents are President/chancellor”
      </p>
      <p>
       let’s keep this troll going, what five degrees do you currently possess because I graduated Summa cum laude from high school when I was 12, got 8 degrees from 12 different colleges, all while completing medical and law school at Harvard and Yale.
      </p>

       It's not my job to educate you. You may continue to ask all you want, but I'm not here to do your bidding. Scream troll all you want, but just because you ask, doesn't mean that anyone will lift a finger for you. You are not important, and no one cares what you think of them.

       Yes after I graduated from hogwarts, which my mom and Dad were President/Chancelor, at age 14 I couldn’t help myself but eat chocolate frogs.
      </p>
      <p>
       But after my own research, I used a series of spells to lose 500 pounds, so it’s ok now.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this is very real because I did my research and I’m not going to cite the source of the research I conducted because even though I have been in academia for over two decades (did I mention my dad and mom are President/Chancelor) I think citing sources for other people is lazy and unethical and it’s not my job to do their homework.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not think it is ironic at all that I have been in academia for over two decades with very real degrees in troll theory; I do not want to help other people learn by sharing my knowledge with them, Instead it’s better to act like a troll.

       You want to believe in fairytales. Good for you! Whatever floats your boat. But, the holocaust never happened. People died, horrendous atrocities happened, but the fairytale know as the holocaust was an agenda. You can make it about my weight and education all you want, but that has nothing to do with the fact that 6 million people did not die because of a holocaust. It never happened.

       I love how my life has turned out so far, and I'm not even half way through it. Everyday I wake up excited to do exactly what and who I want. I've accomplished everything that I've set out to accomplish, and I literally have nothing to prove to anyone. But, it's not like I every did. I never have had the need to seek the approval of others. Normal people don't really do that.

       I think we've already established that you have no idea what I believe, think, or know for a fact. You may keep trying though. I give you permission.

       The shape of the earth isn't an argument for the holohoax. You silly bear. I will remind you that while there were labor camps, there was no such thing as extermination camps. That's just a bedtime story to frighten little children.

       Nope, I'm not autistic, but that is sweet of you to care so much.

       My parents love me. And, they'll do anything for me. In fact, they call me the golden child, because in their eyes, I can do no wrong; I'm also their favorite child, so that's cool.

       Can you do no wrong and are you their favorite because (you’re an only child) and you’re the “special” one of the family?

       Nope, wrong again. I have three siblings, and a shit ton of nieces/nephews. Yet, still, I am the golden child in the family, because of who I am and what I do. I am the only one that has done what the parents have expected of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe in conspiracy theories. Belief requires faith. I have opinions; I've made observations based on my experiences.

      <p>
       I'm more productive and happy with my life than anytime in the past. I know who I am, and I'm good with that. I have a tremendous amount of freedom to do whatever I want with my life. I'm not enslaved to a 9-5 work week. I travel where I want, and when I want. I love life. And, I love that I can experience everything that it has to offer.

       Again, the figure is inaccurate. Do you really believe that they would push a huge lie like this and then say that there are no missing Jews?  Do you realize how easy it would be for numbers like that to be falsified?

       There's also a ton of literature on extraterrestrials. Lots of people have totally seen them, and some have even been abducted by them! Hopefully you don't question their accounts, either.

       Nearly as ridiculous as asserting that, because there is literature regarding the Holocaust, it must be true. You haven't and can't point to any actual, credible evidence, so you just wave your hands and say that "lots of people believe it, so it must be true!"

       I'm not saying that. I'm saying that the level of people arguing the holocaust happened vastly outweighs the number arguing the opposite, and generally they come from far more trusted sources (Irving, perhaps the most notable denier, is after all a fraud). The best evidence is that there is simply little reason to lie, and such a lie would have been impossible to keep secret.

       I've already explained the reason for that. Go try and try to publish some findings that disprove an aspect or all of the Holocaust, and see how that works out for you. In some countries, you would be thrown in jail for trying. In other countries, you would be punished in other ways. And what parts of Irving's work do you consider "fraudulent."

       First, that isn't evidence. Second, its wrong.  There were many reasons to lie and much to be gained from the lie. The Holocaust is still being used as a crutch to this day, and helps to supress any criticism of Jewish people, and especially the Zionists who control things and siphon away our wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the lie hasn't been kept a secret. There is a reason why "Holocaust denial" is so prevalent, and always rising. Since the advent of the internet, more and more people are becoming aware of the lie every day. They have even resorted to making it illegal to question the lie, which shows how desperate they are.

       Not really. The Jews were not a beloved people across Europe. The Americans had no desire to let them enter, and even after the war the British Foreign Secretary Bevin says that American diplomats had no intention of letting in Jewish refugees. The British were far more pro-Arab at this time in terms of their policy towards Palestine due to oil concerns, so I fail to see why they would conform. The Soviets were heavily anti-Zionist following the Six Day War, so I fail to see why they would keep things quiet. Yes the Jews would gain, but it caused nothing but a headache for the British, and the Americans and Soviets were not especially bothered about establishing a Jewish state. Furthermore, how did they get every Private and Trooper to lie about these damned camps? The US government can't build a fighter jet, and the average squadie isn't well known for discretion, how do you think they hid such a deception?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have literally pointed you in the direction of near undeniable evidence, and you have failed to do the same, so don't suggest I have none. Holocaust denial lacks any sort of academic rigour, and is illegal because it fosters Nazism, which too is illegal. If you have actual proof of someone deciding to fraud the Holocaust, publish it because you will be the most renowned historian in the history of the world.

       LOL not even close. You haven't pointed to any good evidence at all. Again, arguing that it would be a difficult secret to keep (which I agree with) is not evidence. And it hasn't been kept a secret, anyway.

       They didn't lie. In some of the camps, conditions were very bad due to Allied bombing of supply chains, leading to malnutrition. Typhus outbreaks were also common (which is why they had delousing chambers and used Zyklon-B). Its sad that many of the camps prisoners did suffer and die, and the Allies saw and photographed some of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have Jews who were in Auschwitz for years (and somehow miraculously survived) who never heard or saw anything to do with gas chambers or extermination of Jews. Now that would be a pretty difficult secret to keep!

       Because Auschwitz wasn't a death camp, only part of it was. The book will source claims infinitely better than I have, and you've still offered nothing to A) suggest why western powers went along with something despite being indifferent to the plight of the Jewry, or B) why senior Nazis said the Holocaust happened?

       A) Allies didn't really know what was going on in the camps. They saw emaciated bodies in some of them. And if they hear horror stories of their enemies, the Nazis, which in turn makes them look like heroes, do you really think many will argue about it? Have you read the Patton Papers? He didn't seem to think the Nazis were that bad at all, and certainly said nothing of any "death camps."

       And we have different world views. I think the Jews had far more influence at the time than you seem to think. The Bolshevik leadership was full of Jews.

       The 6 million is probably an exaggeration; after all, The Holocaust was the main justification for the creation of Israel, which the west was behind. No doubt it was easy to rope in scholars to inflate the number of jews killed.

       Firstly, bigotry has always been around. Anti-Jewish feeling (as opposed to anti-Zionist feeling for example, i.e. simply hating jews for being jews) is more or less the same thing as racism, which will always be with us. This is party due to pure bigotry, partly due to the fact that the Jews are usually very insular, and partly due to the fact that some Jewish families had become very powerful and wealthy through banking/finance.
      </p>
      <p>
       2nd, there was still that lingering feeling amongst the Christian west that the Jews were somehow responsible for crucifying Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       3rd, at the same time, there are (or were) many Zionist Christians.
      </p>
      <p>
       4th,
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       Zionists, such as the Rothschilds (without whom many western countries couldn't fund their war efforts), were very rich and powerful at the time, and influenced western countries to support the Zionist vision of creating the Israeli state, which could only happen if Jews felt they
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       to leave the west (which had been their home for centuries), and this could only be done, firstly with The Holocaust, and secondly if countries around the world refused to accept Jewish refugees. Thus it appeared a Jewish state was the only solution to the 'Jewish Problem'.

       Thank you for your well-thought out and truth-seeking reply!  All your points make a lot of sense to me, except for #2, as I've never heard anyone "blaming" the Jews for killing Jesus.  Jesus was a Jew...seems absurd to "crucify" the Jews for killing Jesus.

       I'm a little new to WWII, but the more I've learned, the more the whole thing stinks.  Literally like the LV shooting, but on a grander scale.  Don't get me wrong, there's no doubt in my mind that Hitler did some horrible things.  But what I don't like is that I'm learning more and more that he wasn't as bad as he is made to sound, and that Stalin was actually much worse...but no one seems to care about Stalin.  I realized that the Allies, as victors, become even greater hero's the greater the evil they defeated.  Allies worked with Stalin, and made Hitler the central enemy, and the central evil.  I know I sound like a shill, but a video by Black Pigeon Speaks, regarding America's "foundation myth" resounded a lot with me.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NanumqpBDtA">
        The video

       is so racist that youtube blocks it to an extent.

       Yes, regarding #2, it's not so common in Christian thought today, but it was a bit more common at the time, I believe.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_deicide">
        Here's an entry in wikipedia
       </a>
       . I can't find any articles specifically about feelings of "Jewish deicide" around the period of WWII, but I'm sure there was a little bit of that at the time. How much in the various places in the West, I'm not sure. Probably a minor influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, the most common Christian opinion on this is that it was
       <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/responsible-Christ-death.html">
        God's decision to sacrifice himself
       </a>
       that was ultimately the cause of Jesus' death.
      </p>
      <p>
       I too would like to read more on the WWII, but it's difficult to get hold of alternative materials that don't come across as being written by a nutter. WWI was dodgy as fuck too.

       Yes, that's totally how I grew up: was that it was God's will that Jesus be sacrificed.  I honestly wouldn't even consider any people "blaming" the Jews for Jesus' death.  Of course they are to blame! -but God more so! --and isn't the whole point of Christianity that Jesus died for your sins? (So to get mad/blame the Jews for it seems ridiculous!)

       Many experts are saying another economic collapse is coming soon...that's going to be scary as fuck. I don't care what the official stats saying, we didn't recover from the '08 collapse. In fact, I've heard some economists say the current recession is even worse than the Great Depression...and another collapse is still coming? Sheeeet... (If you're not aware of it, watching
       <a href="http://www.maxkeiser.com/">
        The Keiser Report
       </a>
       is really good for finance/economics)
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus we have robotics and AI looming. I'm not like all those delusional optimists in the mass media who think that will free us from work; quite the opposite, I think it's going to put huge numbers of people out of work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talking about a bit more speculative things, after the next economic collapse, and robotics/AI makes things even worse, we'll have the top 1% or whatever with everything, everyone else with nothing, and I think we'll see the return of polygamy, evey woman will end up marrying the handful of guys with all the wealth.

       You're probably highly intelligent, and many intelligent tend to be pessimistic.  This means you will have a higher chance than average at surviving, or even making a good life for yourself!  I too tend to be pessimistic, but it's best to focus on good things so long as we are alive. ;)

       One of the biggest reasons is fighting for Shabbat, the Jewish Sabboth which is a day of rest. During ancient times slaves had to work without any days off Moses fought for a day of rest for the slaves. Ever since this the Jewish people have been fighting for their right to practice Shabbat. Rest was only for the wealthy and ruling class so it was unheard of before this.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Syrian-Greeks ruled the holy land they forbade Shabbat and many Jews had to flee the city to live in cave hills so they could keep the day of rest and many were discovered and killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Rome, Jewish slaves were beaten for refusing to work on Shabbat. Many people thought they were lazy for not wanting to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in America Jews had to fight to keep Shabbat as Saturday was not considered a day off at the time and this was a big reason that hindered them from assimilation and acceptance. (This is why we now have Saturday and Sunday off).

       Jewish people also did not have laws against interest which Christianity did have. This was one of the propaganda used against the Jews to make them be viewed as "Greedy".

       that makes them look good. fucking being a slave and working for the man, we need to fight to get more days off, one at a time. no I'm not saying be lazy I am saying work for yourself on your own terms. How about a 4 day work week next. Impossible? economy collapse with that? Nah.

       It's weird that people who had there properties destroyed, lives ruined, land lost, all assets taken, went on and did the exact same thing to the Palestinian people, although there is a lot of bullshit with them as well, they were literally invaded after a world war, by the victims?? and then became the victims, when they said anything, everyone felt for the Jewish people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't deny that it happened, I don't deny it at all, but something about how the end of the second world war played out kind of makes no sense to me personally, if you were just terrorized, you would want to rebuild.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will be honest as well and say I don't fully understand the creation of Israel, but something isn't right.
      </p>
      <p>
       It almost seems like it was a foreshadowing, they needed something to be able to destabilize that part of the world so the Bankers or whoever could take over, and since Israels creation, how has the Middle East got along?

       Yeah that's absolutely not what is written here. This means that if you want to emigrate to Israel only because you are jewish (not for any other reason), they will try to see if you are indeed jewish. Now, how would they prove that with DNA and why, i don't know.

       Why is it fascinating- - it is a Jewish homeland founded by Jews - don’t you think they would want to welcome Jews - the point is you don’t Have to be Jewish to be an Israeli citizen . Furthermore there is no genetic test for being Jewish - those who convert to Judaism are as Jewish as those born that way

       Partially fascinating because it was Jew who forced open immigration in the US to include greater numbers of non-Europeans.  Total double standard.  I'd like for there to be some European-only countries or states.   Also, no current genetic test, but it's on the table believe it or not.

       Hitler was defending his country and pushed out the central bank and the elite, who just happen to be jews, and was brought to war as consequence.  These people are not messing around.  World war, attacking thier own people, creating terrorist groups, etc.  Now russia, china and NK are refusing central bank ownership and look at how they are all being portrayed in the media.  There are easy to spot cycles if you look at history.  There were camps but they were only meant as a holding place during the war.  Major deaths occured because the "good guys" cut off aupplies to these camps causing famine and death.  Jews played up the war to obtain as much money to start thier own country.  Its all bullshit and there is absolutely jewish people among the elite controlling the major powers of the world.

       Also yes firebombings were horrendous, stalin was awful. But you can think all of this and still criticise the nazis. The systematic nature of the extermination  (plus how awful their plans for say russia were, the hunger plan aimed to kill 1/3 in a single winter)
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes the victors do write history, but with time events can be looked at more thoroughly. And I too hate the holocaust denial laws, all they do is feed into the idea it wasn't real

       Everyone knows the 6 million dead Jews thing is a total myth, that is why it is a censored topic. Also, it was not the Germans that starved the Jews in the work camps, the Allies knew exactly where the work camps were because they had ariel surveilience of all the railroad lines that lead directly to the slave labor camps. The allies bombed the supply lines to the slave camps to cripple the Germans means of production, thus causing the slave workers to starve and not be able to be used as a source of labor to support the Germans war machine.

       They were built and used primarily for burning disease-infested clothing and
       <em>
        dead

       bodies.  Some of the chimneys weren't even on the building during WWII, but were added by the Russians later. lmao. Check out TGSNT.  Probably only you can convince your self, so you will need to research.  I used to not believe this stuff, but I've done enough research to be satisfied.

       The "Gas chambers" at the Auschwitz museum are a totally fake "recreation" of what they want to pretend it was. Fist off, Fingernails can't scratch concrete, go read about the Mohs Hardness Scale. Also, if someone was being gassed to death in a room full of people they wouldn't take the time to carve "Never Again" into the concrete wall.  I suggest you go do some research.

       Once you make that ok, where does the list end?  Then every tax-payer is a legitimate target due to helping to sustain their military.  By that measure, anyone (Jews included)
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       supporting Hitler could be categorized as against Hitler, and thus legitimate targets.  US had a double standard during the war. The victor is
       <em>
        always

       right. (and this is also why leftism/"SJW'ism" is so dangerous.  If that philosophy wins, they will drag down their own civilization.  It is regressive, not truly progressive.)

       People talk about the Holocaust all the time. We are right now. Nobody is kicking down my door stopping me from doing so. But thats not what you want to talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to talk about how Germany was innocent. You want to talk about how the US was really the bad guys. You want to talk about actively denying a genocide and how despite pictures, confessions, testimonies, relics, documents, recordings and other evidence is just what (((They)))) tell you. I honestly used to feel sorry for you who looks at an already tragic set of events and go "Well fuck, theres so much worst then people know. And only I, can spread the truth"

       Yes, regarding #2, it's not so common in Christian thought today, but it was a bit more common at the time, I believe.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_deicide">
        Here's an entry in wikipedia
       </a>
       . I can't find any articles specifically about feelings of "Jewish deicide" around the period of WWII, but I'm sure there was a little bit of that at the time. How much in the various places in the West, I'm not sure. Probably a minor influence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, the most common Christian opinion on this is that it was
       <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/responsible-Christ-death.html">
        God's decision to sacrifice himself
       </a>
       that was ultimately the cause of Jesus' death.
      </p>
      <p>
       I too would like to read more on the WWII, but it's difficult to get hold of alternative materials that don't come across as being written by a nutter. WWI was dodgy as fuck too.

       Great outlook! I do recommend watching some of "The Greatest Story Never Told" that I saw you were linked to by someone else. It goes in to a lot of depth regarding the side of WW2 we don't learn about.

       is the full-length documentary...freaking long at 6 hours, but worth it, IMHO.  Thank you too for the tips.  Interesting times we live in. Might see the balkanization of the US, or globalization, or perhaps even a strong nationalist movement.  Do you have any hunches or theories as to where we'll go in the next 5-10-20-50 years?

       A discrepancy of +5,000,000 deaths is a significant factual error. If you don't like that claim, well, that's too bad. Peer review in academia is not science, it's gatekeeping.

       You say you never engaged me in serious debate, but here we are... 20 comments deep, I’ll keep going because now you seem to be getting more and more aggressive.

      <p>
       Looking through your comment history, you seem desperate to prove something in this world is a lie - does this obsession come from you being upset at how your life turned out?
