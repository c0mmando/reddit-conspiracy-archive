        EDIT. BIG FUCKING EDIT!!! I still think Saudi money is severely linked in from Bush Snr to the Obama presidency. There is no escaping the so many facts. But I have just read this from psy_raven about the motive of the LV shootings and the recent happenings in SA right now. It's really good and plausible. I suggest you go there and read what he/she posted.

      <p>
       My opinion of course, just bits and pieces that I've gleamed over the last few days. Some are in order, not all.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Money talks! Combined worth of Saudi Princes = 2 TRILLION. That's the context I am leading with.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Four of the top 4 American political families are controlled by Saudi Princes, including scumbag Soros.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         LV shootings happened, Mandalay top floors owned by a Saudi Prince. With a helipad on top, weapons used that night were flown in, which is why no one saw Paddock carrying heavy duty weapons through the casino up to his room.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Paddock is a patsy and human trafficker. His brother arrested for child porn and even he said Paddock was a kiddie trafficker. But trafficking for who? The Saudis.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         News and investigations are seriously hampered by obstruction and lies, why?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump is trying to prevent civil war, has always been his agenda to unite the country.
         <strong>
          Full disclosure
         </strong>
         of mass shooting would mean the public would tear the country apart becasue of the seriousness of the 4 political families controlled by foreign entities, maybe could even go to war with Saudi Arabia and serious soul searching of the US democratic system.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump twitter feed down ... SA prince owns a heavy chunk of twitter.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Lebonese PM resigns, something is going to happen.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Kushner, Mnuchin flies to SA, and then high level arrests in SA of Saudi princes by the new Saudi King.
         <strong>
          Could be Trump threatening SA because of the LV shootings by the princes.
         </strong>
         Calm before the storm.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump flies to Asia for 2 weeks, for protection against assassination. Meanwhile marines good actors are cleaning house stateside.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump tweet Aramoco, promises to  protect SA economy because ...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The combined worth of all the Saudi princes is 2 trillion. That's a lot of influence to even collapse an economy, the SA economy.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I can't really say I have evidence but I can't be far from the truth. Still much more happening especially with the recent Paradise papers being released, Huma is nowhere to be found, the church shootings can't be a coincidence, the Podesta brothers are in serious trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stunning how Trump keeps winning. Him being elected wasn't a coincidence. I'm guessing some powerful US generals asked him to run with them watching his back. All what is happening now has been planned for many many years before Nov 2016. It has to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fun times we live in indeed!
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Reminder: The hijackers in the September 11 attacks were 19 men affiliated with al-Qaeda. Fifteen of the 19 were citizens of Saudi Arabia ...
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Point: SA is
         <strong>
          heavily
         </strong>
         entwined with American politics, starting off the creation of the petrodollar, and so Bush Snr

       LOL...I generally don't get into the entertainment of politics, but stating that POTUS' agenda is to unite the country is a bit absurd. Almost everything that he says/tweets is reactionary and divisive. I don't have a problem with that, just stating the obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would full-disclosure of mass shootings tear the country apart? CIA/FBI/NSA/WHATEVER would have to have been involved. So, I don't get your point about SA.

       What is the political left doing now, have been doing since Nov 2016? What tools do they have to help them? The MSMs.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is NOT Trump creating the divide, it is them. Which is what you have been hearing from main stream news for the last 12 months. I'm guessing you need to take your head out of r/politics ... it is an echo chamber. If you doubt me, go there now, take a screenshot of all the news headlines, pay attention to the sources of them headlines.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if they are creating division, why? Creating such division that it removes Trump from office, by force if it comes to it.
      </p>

       CIA = paid by princes = 4 political families.

      <p>
       Trump never posts/preaches "let's all get along" rhetoric, it is the exact opposite. Again, I have no problem with that. But, he has always been a polarizing figure. That is his stick. It works for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB create division to keep people distracted and fighting amongst themselves. It is known as divid an conquer. It works.

       I concur that the CIA is up to no good. But, IMHO, the CIA is higher on the ladder than your princes and political families.

       Again, I don't care what MSM or POTUS says/writes. None of it is intended to unite the country; it is all for show (i.e. it is what keeps people distracted and divided). I'm not going to argue with you about who is worse. It is all entertainment for the masses. If you don't like the show, do something else with your life.

       I don't advocate doing nothing, but there are so many people that actively consume MSM. If everyone would simply unplugged the TV and boycott print [including interneting propaganda], then I think that would be a step in the right direction.

       That's not going to happen, especially with this generation.

      <p>
       If you look at the public school system, they don't teach for critical thinking anymore. Mostly it is teacher centric where instructors spew information for most of the class, kids need to remember because of standardized testing, and spew the exact information out. No thinking whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's where the problem lies and that is where it should start I believe.

       I'm not going to spend effort debunking what you've said, none of that was proven, most is just common sense nonsense. Simplest example: he is a millionaire. Why would he have debts, unless he was broke and couldn't pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen it much more often pointed out he might be money laundering, which although may not be true, at least leads to more plausible theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've noticed the qualities of people's theories is getting shittier the more time has passed, more and more people trying to tie this into
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       else.. which is pretty much what makes us look like crack pots. Trying to find some elaborate pattern, rather than find something much more concrete and build from there, see what actually makes sense.

       I dunno about Steve Paddock being a human trafficker though, but it's possible.  Eric Paddock seemed like was being open about his brother in his bizarre interview, but never mentioned his third brother ever in it...or did he?  I could understand why he wouldn't since he didn't want to put further scrutiny on the Paddock family.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just that he was so candid in the interview saying they were "bad kids" growing up as if to give a little perspective and humanity to him and his brother, but no mention of Bruce. In tandem it makes Eric seem to be the straight edge one of the three, but that interview made it also seem like he knew more than what he was saying.

       The Vegas sheriff called it conspiracy fantasy, and for a post like this one, I feel like the title fits.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm here for the more serious theories, not the stuff you have to watch 50 hours of YouTube to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question, have the lefties ever made big elaborate theories like this, trying to make Obama or the Clinton's some sort of Jesus-like savior of the people?

       I'm starting to think that Trump has a base that's actually delusional at this point.. not even based on this sub, the Donald seems far far worse.. it's just kind of sad that they're leaking so heavily here.

       I've wondered the same, I just made one kind of not completely serious post a few minutes ago inspired by this one, but with Trump as the enemy. Downvoted to Oblivion.

       I've lurked on conspiracy for a while now.  Sometimes its silly fun like a TV show with too many characters.  Sometimes it gets you thinking.  I've never seen such forceful enthusiasm here for any state actor, until Trump came along.  But, if the deep state or the elite or the CFR or the Bohemian Grove folks or whatever truly exist and pull strings behind the scenes how on Earth did
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       , let alone Trump, get into the White House without their support?  On the other hand, if our democracy is a scam, he would have had to be placed by the swamp and why do they care one way or the other that the DNC conspired against Sanders?  Honestly my bet would be on the Saudi/Clinton stuff and the Trump/Russia stuff both being true to whatever extent.

       You really should look at that last post I made. Although it wasn't intended to be realistic, it is supposed to get people to think about all the possibilities, one of which is that all accusations are true, and that we really don't know who's pulling the strings, if in fact they're being pulled.
      </p>
      <p>
       It got heavily downvoted because I was intentionally saying things that would trigger both sides. I hate how common that term has become, but I think that triggering people, making them uncomfortable with the ideas being presented, is how you get people out of the "accept our reject views that I agree/disagree with".
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, both sides seem pretty fake to me, at least online.. people agreeing far too much about a wide degree of ideas, that in real life, people have more nuanced opinions. I truly feel like that's the conspiracy, whether here or Twitter, people subscribing to ideas that people in real life simply don't subscribe to (the political views, rather than the content in this sub).

       How about this narrative. Israel likes to frame Muslims for their wrong doing. It seems they have moved on to framing white men in their hoaxes. Most of the people pushing anti Saudi Arabia also claim Las Vegas was legit and seem to be (((new))) here

       Well said. Time to become awoke and aware. How far this corruption trickles down? World billionaire bribes seem distant. Local heroin, ++drug trade off scale ruining our families and neighborhoods becomes close to home. Gun violence, break-ins, theft direct part of this and felt locally. All related.

       Sure are a lot of people in this sub using words like "they" and "them" to describe this sub. Must be a drought of quality new hire candidates. Maybe the good infiltrators realized they're serving evil and jumped ship so now they're having to deal with the types of unscrupulous basement dwellers who frequent mturk and clickworker? Who knows; just an observation.

       I mean, I've shouted as much as possible, why didn't the fucking travel bad include Saudi Arabia!?! Weren't most of the terrorists from there? Isn't most terrorism from there? Fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen plenty that shows Trump has interests there, which would explain why it wasn't in the travel ban. Nothing makes sense as far as other reasons
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       to ban Saudi Arabia. This shit pisses me off.

       Initiation ritual. See, while
       <em>
        MSM tries to convince us it's the Russians
       </em>
       , everyone was distracted from the fact Saudi Arabia bought Trump and he is their literal puppet.
      </p>
      <p>
       See, OP says they own Twitter, but actually they own all of the MSM, that's how they're able to keep this under wraps so long.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Obama is part of a secret organization that was created in order to fight the deep state created by the Saudis, that's why he travels everywhere before Trump. He's literally America's version of mi8.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Trump is using mind control techniques, watch
       <a href="https://youtu.be/u_aLESDql1U">
        this short video here
       </a>
       (watch it all for it to work), and each time he says those words, he's telling the Saudi princes he appreciates their contributions, and he's still their man. That's why he says it so much.

       i've gleaned that the overarching "theory" concerning LV bullshittery (which definitely exists, that much i'm not arguing) is that the "event" was supposed to have been something much bigger.....including some LARP material that suggested there was a nuclear device involved in some form or another.  i'm running of the premise, based on running of THAT premise, that
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       LV not been partially "thwarted" (or whatever), the resulting chaos may have been the impetus for civil war-like situation.  i honestly have no clue what's heads or tails these days.  ever since the election, it's just been opposite-world everywhere you look.  words mean nothing.  actions mean nothing.  nobody is accountable for anything and the world is on fire.  good times, ya'll, good times.

       Saudi Arabia is going through a major war of succession right now, the first generational shift of leadership since the 1940s. Without a primogeniture method of succession (first born son gets it), you have a bunch of powerful princes that either need to kill or be killed. Last one standing becomes King.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now Saudi Arabia has
       <em>
        less
       </em>
       power than it ever had. The princes have the power to make some amazing
       <em>
        promises
       </em>
       right now, but just because they made a promise, doesn't mean they won't end up dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most likely candidate for King has done the following: killed a number of Trump's enemies in Saudi Arabia, offered cooperation with Israel, pushing moderate Islam, looking to open up Saudi oil with an IPO, and finally ending subsides to citizens and instead taxing them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If successful SA becomes a highly westernized middle eastern country that uses it's oil to move beyond an oil economy, maybe looking like what everyone once hope Turkey would be.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it fails? Extremists pull in the newly non-subsidized poverty stricken poor, the leader falls, the oil gets nationalized with a fuck you to the investors .... you're looking at the Iranian Revolution meets ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just the internal politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next you get a pissed off west, the Iranians being angry and seeing weakness (this part happens whether or not the new leader fails), and a general huge destabilization of a long-time stable Middle East power that has been quite friendly to the west (via the petrodollar.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Ahead of all of this, they
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       started a war with Lebanon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and this all happens in the Holy Land.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let's say they Saudis did have something to happen with what happened in Las Vegas -- which I don't think they did -- compared to the rest of what is going on, that is such a minuscule and minor affair, with such a small impact on geopolitics that it's barely going to rank as a footnote in the history books that will be written on this event ... you know if we still have writing and civilization after there becomes a power vacuum and Mecca is up for grabs.
