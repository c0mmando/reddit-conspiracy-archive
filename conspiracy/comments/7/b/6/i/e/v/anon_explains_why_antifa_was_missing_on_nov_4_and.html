       Further, VOTL claims Prince Bin Talal is also the man who financed the Saudi dry run of 9/11 and the man who logistically &amp; financially orchestrated LV Massacre. Podesta Bros were selling all kinds of slaves to him including men, women, and children.

       I love that how the right was taken for a ride about this horrible Nov 4, mass protest that, that Antifa was just gonna cause mass chaos, and then it never happened.....
      </p>
      <p>
       And instead of maybe admitting they took the bait, now it must have been cancelled at the very last minute because trump and the Saudi Arabians silently fixed the issue? I'm fairly confident trump would never just cut off the secret international support being funneled to antifa, if he did anything remotely like this he would have already gone on a twitter rampage about it, this is just fan-fiction writing from the cult.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Also would love to see the proof of all these wasted manufactured products, posters and signs and what not for this non-existent antifa protest that was cancelled last minute? Surely we shouldn't need to just take this random larpers word right?

       Antifas protests never happened bc their funding from SA was cut off before hand. That's why they had the signs ready, but leaders and protesters never showed up so it was a flop

       OP post a link of an obvious larp.

       I call it out as an obvious larp

       You comment on my comment in disagreement I guess? (which btw is great as should welcome our views to be challenged, it's how progress is made)

       Except your link is literally the same thing as what the OP posted?

       I mean you didn't even make an attempt at forming an original argument here, you basically just said "oh yea, well what do you think about THIS!" And showed me the exact same thing we were already talking about?

      <p>
       Did you have any sources to prove all these posters and signs were ever actually made? Or you were you just taking a anon's word for it because you liked what he was making up?

       Most people believe VOTL to be real. You are just a very cynical person. You know what they say. People who don't trust themselves don't trust anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what epic fuckup are you talking about? Like I said you are very cynical. You think just because VOTL emailed himself certain emails means that he is a LARP. You just jump to conclusions don't you? Don't you realize people email themselves like that when they want to strip away private information such as the sender of the email?

The dude was straight up busted sending himself emails and then saying they were from some insider... busted cause he forgot to redact some of the addresses so it was obvious he had just made a fake conversation with himself... it wasn't just a forward... it was a whole back n forth conversation with himself. Thats why they were yanked down almost instantly when everyone spotted it.

       I read all of those emails. They were merely notes from ground troops sending updates and intel to him via email. He and his team set up the 7-17-2017 PSYOP campaign to trick the dark forces that they were going to get arrested on that day. This set them off in a scramble and they fell directly into the light forces trap. Also, Twitter deletes tons of his messages. Anything that gives out too much info is deleted. Prince Talal and the Saudis are a big part of the Twitter ownership and he just went down. They even deleted Trumps twitter account but the media blamed it on a "disgruntled employee."

       Like I said. You seem to be a very cynical person. People like you blanket everything as untrustworthy so you are quick to judge. VOTL has dropped some insane and I mean INSANE intel over the past year or 2 ever since he went up. There's no way r/conspiracy or me were behind it. I didn't even know any of the shit he posted about existed (IE Israeli control over the world, Sabastian-Frankism, ect..). VOTL does talk about shape-shifting reptilians because they are real. I know it sounds crazy but life is a lot more interesting than we were led to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see how people would get very confused. Unless you are intimate with the VOTL twitter page, you will easily misinterpret some of the happening around the psyop against the cabal they ran in July. They have been 4D chessing the cabal like crazy. Btw, VOTL is under the Trump umbrella along with many others of course. They are all on the same team.

       I am not 100% positive shape-shifting reptilians are real but this statement has been repeated thousands of times across thousands of sources. I'm just saying, people wouldn't be hollering about this from teh 4 corners of the world for the past few decades if it was completely fake. There should logically be some truth to it.

       This isn't a police department where we have all the evidence we need to determine our reality. We are working with bits of evidence here and there. We are forced to create a picture using whatever we can. Why? Because the government has 0 transparency in it so they can hide all their crimes. Until we establish total transparency, we have to make the clearest picture we can about reality by averaging out all the evidence we do have. Later on, after we flush the cabal, we will create transparency and all will be known.

       Yeah... just average out all the information fucked up David Icke LARPs with the actual truth and a billion other conspiracy theories and yer gonna end up thinking that fuckin' shapeshifting reptilian overlords are real... and fuckin' Darth Vader is real cause people have been talking about him for like 40 years... and Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster and vampires and Sherlock Holmes and a bunch of other fiction... thats why you like VOTL... cause it's fuckin' fiction.  Jeeeeeeesus, man... stay in the kiddie pool cause you've gone off the deep end.

       I was just reading a theory on some anon post that Disney own North Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first, I thought WTF? But then I remembered that Disney is dead center in the MK Ultra program and that Mickey's ears are directly connected with MK Ultra somehow. Also, there was a logo of Disney that, when turned upside down, read WICKED.
      </p>
      <p>
       The anon mentioned "Imagine how outraged the people would be if they realized Disney owns North Korea."
