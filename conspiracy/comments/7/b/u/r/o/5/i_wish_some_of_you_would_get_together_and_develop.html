       Have I said something to insinuate otherwise? 
Or are you insinuating that something is wrong with Rob Halford for being gay, and in a thread related to Robert Plant potentially fucking young boys, as though the two have anything even remotely to do with each other?

       Wait. I'm a pretty big Led Zep fan for decades and I've never heard the Plant/young boys claim. Do you have a link for that?

       Death of his son is a "tell" of sorts when it comes to the occult and satanism, however. It's what ultimately broke up the band, too--can you imagine your young kid dying and your group's lead guitarist and bassist/keyboardist can't be bothered to attend the funeral? [Just another example of how they are "bad people" who made "good art."]

       Dude, you think I'm just making this up? Plant has gone on the record about how Page and Jones not attending the funeral changed his view of them forever. Here's one link, you can search your way around for others.

       Well I don't exactly have a list of links to every celebrities' depraved fetishes on hand because I'm not a creep lol. 
I swear I wasn't actively trying to spread misinformation or anything (in fact I would LOVE IT if I'm wrong about this) I had just always heard it as another "open secret" of the entertainment industry - like John Lennon beating his wife or Sean Penn being an abusive piece of shit to Madonna. 
So no I don't have a link memorized it's just something I've always heard for years from coworkers, older family members, my old guitar teacher, Reddit, celebrity talk shows/podcasts, etc.
Again, I apologize if I'm propagating an awful lie; but between all the other shit in the music industry back then, and the fact that none of it affects me in ANY way, once I heard it so many times I just kind of took it for granted without searching for some MLA formatted document to prove its legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yea the jimmy page thing at least is VERY well known and nobody ever seemed to care much. He's not the only one though, it seems like 14 was considered more mature back then or something? I'm pretty sure Olivia Hussey was 14 in Romeo and Juliet, and wasn't Brooke Shields like 15 in Blue Lagoon?

       I really do hope you guys are right. I don't care about jimmy page's interest in the occult because I'm fascinated with it myself, so that judgement doesn't bother me. And while his 14 year old girlfriend was fucking disgusting , the frontman actually being into kids really has noticeably tainted their music for me (in addition to being overplayed to DEATH on the radio where I live ). It'd be nice to be able to listen to them again without that nagging voice in the back of my mind that won't let me enjoy it as much as I used to.

       If you've not read "Hammer of the Gods," you definitely should. It's a terrific read, but also full of juicy gossip about sex, drugs, the occult and, of course, rock &amp; roll.

       I remember in one of the chapters on sex and groupies, there's a passage where it claims Page would pick out underage girls after the show and have them cat fight while he watched, and the winner would get the honor of sucking his cock.

       That said: I own every one of their albums, even the mediocre "Coda." It's almost like their work transcends their evil. Maybe that makes me a hypocrite, IDK.

       "Sleeper" and "Love and Death" are pretty funny movies. "Annie Hall," "Hannah and Her Sisters" and "Manhattan" are very good comedies for discerning adults. movies. "Zelig" is superb. There are even more than that. He's made maybe two good movies in 20 years, but in his prime, he was exceptional.

       That's because the whole thing was a psyop.  Gibson makes Christian movie outing Jews as the killers followed by Gibson being arrested, outing him as a drunk antisemite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mission accomplished.  Christians smeared.  Gibson takes a vacation and then comes right back to work.

       It's called "Independent Film". The non-Hollywood movies are different, feel different, resonate in different ways, don't have the compulsary sacrifice-of-the-innocent, have some genius in them.

       Hollywood films, like Bladerunner 2049, are usually (39 out of 40) well-made complete shit.
