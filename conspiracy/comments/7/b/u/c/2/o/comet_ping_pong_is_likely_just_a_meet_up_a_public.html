       The first time I actually heard the "Sex dungeon in the basement!" Claim was from Stephen Colbert when he did his hit piece on PG few weeks after it broke.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a lot of us are more interested in the money laundering aspect of Comet Ping Pong, why it holds fundraisers for political candidates, and what it's potential function is regarding the human trafficking taking place in DC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it simply be a place for clients to meet with their "pimp" (Who I assume would be JA, considering his vast wealth and power/influence within the city, and his blatant pedophilic Instagram content.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed in a few of those photos he is even flashing around large amounts of what looks to be foreign cash. Boasting to his Pedo buddies online following a "transaction" perhaps?

      </p>
      <p>
       I think the pizza place is just a hub for them to launder their trafficking/art money,  hold pre-transaction meetings with clients, and at night time it's a bit of a "hangout" for the pedos with the pedophilic and satanic imagery, live music, ect.

       it kind of hard to keep facts straight when you mix in implications. Comet has no basement, there is a basement but its not comets, there is a basement but its not comets its just owned by the same guy.

       Yes, people here and on T_D pushed the idea that Comet Ping Pong had a basement that was used for child abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Specifically,
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3s9Lh">
        these pictures
       </a>
       were used to argue that secret tunnels were being built under Comet Ping Pong (because there was no building permit for them).
      </p>
      <p>
       And the video
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6vvx2rHid0&amp;amp;t=37m50s">
        #pizzagate: A Primer
       </a>
       —with over 334,000 views and posted here multiple times— claims (at 37:50), "Here is a clip from a video taken by Frank Winstead. Frank claims that the screaming and crying that is heard coming from inside Comet Ping Pong are the cries of children being beaten and raped."
      </p>
      <p>
       The
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHXBrEXmowo">
        original video from Frank Winstead
       </a>
       makes no such claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can claim all you want that nobody claimed there was a secret child abusing dungeon under Comet Ping Pong, but some of us have good enough memory to remember that's not true.

       That was my thoughts on the matter. The basement is so unimportant to the story, yet you had news coverage, discreditors and posters only discussing this theoretical basement. It was an odd focus on an idea that was not even remotely pivotal.

       I love the frantic hand-wringing of PG folks that this was not the original theory. The original theory didn't make any sense and frankly neither does not new more nuanced versoin. 6 Months from now we'll be reading the "PG was never about comet ping pong" posts when that ship finally sinks.

       I wish I could say that I am surprised to see this Pizzagate nonsense at the top of r.conspiracy a year later, despite not one witness, not one victim, no evidence of sex dungeons, etc, but I am not. I guess they have to keep beating this dead horse rather than admit that they had been fooled by Trump's dirty trickster PR team comprised of real life pedos like Roger Stone.

       Yep. And Epsteins brother even testified that he had seen trump on the plane at least once. Also, trump has spoken highly of Epstein in the past.

       You know, I could believe it,  but the clear war that he’s having with the deep state, is making me think not. They could destroy him easily if that were true. With how much the MSM/DNC/CIA/FBI seems to be against him, it’s hard to believe that dirt exists. Unless it’s all controlled, which is another level. ¯_(ツ)_/¯

       The fact that a nobody who owns a small Pizza Shop is well connected with some of the most powerful people in the country. Explain that. Before you say it's because he makes ridiculously good pizza, the food there is crap and they barely get any customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also explain why he and the media hid the fact there's a basement in Comet Pong Pizza. City permit shows a basement, buildings it shares a foundation with have a basement and old interviews with him saying they keep tomato's in Comet Pongs basement

       Is your buddy ranked the 49th most influential person in all of Hollywood? Like Alefantis is ranked the 49th most influential person in DC? I don’t really follow pizzagate so I’m not on one side or the other. I just want to point out that this argument isn’t too strong.

       Is there a real conspiracy sub at reddit?  There is a lot of information pointing to Comet Pizza being everything that Pizzagate is about.  At the earliest moments of the conspiracy you could still go to their Facebook page and see all of the child abuse type images that would make you shudder, the art on the walls, the events held there, the entire "pizza" code found in the wikileaks, the bizarre shooting there that only shot the computer hard drive...

       What's the evidence that he's a Rothschild? I saw a picture that showed he looks a bit like one of them, but tons of people look like people they're not related to. Was there any other evidence? Not that I'd be surprised, but I'd also not less surprised if he's not at all related.

       This is not good evidence sorry. The enfant thing is speculation to begin with and may be a mistranslation.  Then saying because his name is French it lines up with the Rothschild line is just silly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real evidence come from some sketchy stuff with his voter id.(s) apparently he has more than one under different addresses, and one used to be shared with a Rothschild.

       It's not a mistranslation, just circumstantial evidence. I haven't done the research but I'd put money on the fact that the Rothschild's pic with is look-alike is from the French line of the family.

       Why would those be bad, as long as the hours they were open made it profitable?  I knew of a steakhouse that was expensive and only open for six hours a night(more on weekends), but it was an incredibly profitable six hours.  Not every place needs to be open 24, or even 12, hours to make money.  And if the owner is already rich or has another/better source of income then they don't even need it to be all that profitable.  I knew of a used bookstore open five hours a day and four days a week, ran by a well-off old lady who was mainly doing it because retirement bored her.

       I made a comment on voat detailing how there is no way he turns a profit with the hours he is open, along with lying about how much tomato sauce he really cans. I used my 5th grade level maths skills to deduce this while finding out from pizza enthusiasts how much sauce on an average pizza, etc... If you want the original thread, here it is

       This is very interesting I'm going to do some digging into the costs of actually using the brands of tomato's he claims and looking at the costs.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Comet's lightly cooked sauce is made from a combination of tomatoes, including heirlooms (such as Brandywines), beefsteaks, Romas, and some Pennsylvania-grown San Marzanos, says farmer Mark Toigo of Toigo Orchards.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This quote has my eyebrows raised.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The problem, as more than one chef pointed out, is that you can't realistically use heirlooms for sauces in restaurants. Finding consistent, perfectly ripe specimens would be nearly impossible. And even if you could, the expense of turning those heirlooms into, say, a pizza sauce would be prohibitive. It might cost you $16 in heirloom tomatoes to make enough sauce for a single pizza, MacQuaid guesses. That pie would have to sell for about $45, he suggests.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       edit: It more looks like he is just fibbing on his sauce as I would expect most restaurants do. I'm doing the calculations and If he used 4000lbs of tomatoes and lets say they are all heirlooms (pricey) lets give it a 3$ a lb for a wholesale price, thats all 12 grand to supply your pizza shop for the year, well just sauce anyway. I don't know the financials of a pizza restaurant so I can't speculate any further.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps someone more in tune with whole sale food purchasing could chime in, probably not though. Although I do wonder how he manages to find 4000 lbs of quality heirloom tomatoes at a good price, and further more he has claimed before that he used 10 tons of tomatoes per year, and has about 35 employee's per restaurant.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.metroweekly.com/2015/04/from-scratch-james-alefantis/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But 10 tons of tomatoes for sauce is a different story, thats 30,000 for just your sauce and counting employee salary and usual business costs, that sounds like a tough profit margin to hit in my opinion. He has to be lying about the sauce its not sounding feasible to get 10000 lbs of organic heirloom tomatoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we do 12,000$ for 4000 lbs of heirloom tomatoes, mixed with 6000lbs of shit tomatoes its still 18-20,000 for just your sauce. Not counting cheese and how how he claims "EVERYTHING is made from scratch". No way he could realistically make profit on an operation like that. (Please I would like someone more knowledge on these topics to chime in)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Edit: math was wrong
      </p>
      <p>
       20,000 lbs of tomatoes is roughly equal to about 10000 cans of 28 OZ tomato sauce. A typical pizza from what I have read around is roughly 3-6 ounces of sauce. To make life easy lets say he gets 5 pizza's out of every can.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's 50,000 pizza's he can make... 50,000 pizzas for a whole year of course he states they used canned san marzano to fill in the gaps of sauce availability (few weeks he states).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets say on an average week day he sells 100 pizzas. Thats an acceptable number(probably more). He is only open for 4 and a half hours on a regular weekday (not friday).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now fridays and saturdays he is open for 11 hours, 11:30 am to 10:45 pm. These are where the profits are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizza chains can do hundreds of pies a day, some restaurants do 200-300 a day on average weekends from my research. A dominoes in cali can do 1000 pies a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       For how popular this guy claims it is, I don't think these are over estimates on pizza numbers per day I could be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       52 weeks in a year 2 "busy" days of friday saturday = 104 days
      </p>
      <p>
       104 busy days + 52 sundays = 156 busier days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sunday is open from 11:30am to 9:30pm So not quite as busy of a day but still busy so maybe 150-200 pies on sundays.
      </p>
      <p>
       Factoring in holidays you got about 6 or 7 days where it would be closed. (christmas eve, and christmas, thanksgiving, new years eve, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       to make math easy lets just say 355 days a year he is open. out of those 355 156 are busy days with 10+ hours. 199 regular days with 4 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       156 x 200 = 31,200 pizza and 199 x 100 = 19,900 pizza
      </p>
      <p>
       So this man makes 50,000 pizza's a year based on his grand statements. And the amount of sauce that is required to do that is 20,000 lbs of tomatoes. (10 tons)
      </p>
      <p>
       So really I'm only proving that his sauce story is only factual if he actually uses 10 tons. But why would he claim to only use 2 tons in other articles?
      </p>
      <p>
       How that factors in with basements at bucks I don't know. But I just rrreally doubt he cans his sauce ahead of time like he says.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if he got his tomatoes wholesale at 1$ a lb thats 20,000$ just for your sauce. NOT even factoring in all your from scratch ingredients and of course CHEESE holy crap, how is this guy even making profit?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you factor in that he has ANOTHER company process and can the tomatoes for him, transport it to him thats more money. But the question really is, where is the money coming from? He can't possibly profit that much from just this place. He has buck's as well. I wonder about their financials as well.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       My point is the financial aspect, and how there is no feasible way he could pay for 10 tons of tomatoes and send it to a processing plant (more $$) then have it delivered(more $$) If he somehow managed to get heirloom tomatoes for 1$ a pound (yea right buddy) then he still spends 20 grand on JUST sauce. Now think about all the other costs that would come with a pizza restaurant...
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee's, taxes, utilities, rent(if applicable), HEALTH INSURANCE my god every employer knows how expensive it is now. (thanks obama).
      </p>
      <p>
       But also that he has conflicted the 10 ton statement with a more recent one stating he only uses 2 tons a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Where does he store the 10,000 cans at bucks that isn't already being used by bucks for food storage itself?

       Some dude hacked into the comet ping pong website. One area of their website is password protected. He found child porn and other things that would raise questions about comet ping pong. Sent it to the FBI and cops. Followed up etc no traction. And then he got harassed etc for exposing this stuff as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my position, he should have just uploaded the files and censored everything so we know he's legit. He didn't want to upload it cuz he'd get in trouble.

       TLDL: Anon claimed to have hacked the encrypted part of CPP's website (
       <a href="https://ibb.co/hOjnyG">
        https://ibb.co/hOjnyG
       </a>
       ), found CP (images and movies) and reported it to DCMP.  The CPP network included 9 different servers across the globe, including Berlin, Germany. It appears the files were able to be sold through CPP.  Shortly after the report was made, the false flag occurred (magically shooting CPP's hard drive). After the false flag, Anon spoke to Det. Marcus Stevens at DCMP and reporting his findings, offering to help DCMP in any way. CP cannot be disseminated, so Anon had to describe what he found and how. After about a month, Stevens stop communicating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the lack of interest by DCMP, Anon turned to the FBI, DHS, and the NYPD. No agency pursued the report, however, Anon said NYPD was interested but inferred their hands were tied. In desperation, Anon went to the press. Some media people claimed interest (FOX 5), but implied they couldn't cover the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the time Anon reported what he found, his mail was opened and a prowler was found outside his house, hiding in the bushes. The suspect lived two states away and was charged with vehicle prowling. In addition, some of his property was damaged in a separate incident. Anon said he lives in a good, quiet neighborhood.

        ALEFANTIS: Well, we make everything from scratch. Other restaurants, even good restaurants, will, like, not roast their own peppers. You can just buy the roasted peppers in a can. Or you can buy garlic oil. Some products you can get, and they’re consistent and they’re easy. But I didn’t even know that existed actually until they said that. I was like, “What do you mean? There’s another way? You can just buy these things?” Because a lot of restaurants will open a can and put it on. Like our sauce — we harvest a whole crop of organic tomatoes — 10 tons of tomatoes every year. Can them all, store them in the basement, have like a harvest party when it gets loaded in.

       That's the standard disinfo tactic. Plant obviously impossible ideas into the narrative to destroy its credibility but make them ones that are just plausible enough for the craziest, dumbest 5% to support. With enough mouth-breather idiots involved, the smart audience turns off.

       The "hologram" plane shit is targeted toward the generation who were children when 9/11 happened and don't remember anything about it, and are just now "investigating". It's rather brilliant actually, it misdirects in a very specific, "hip" technophile way while stopping any  forays into the "why".

       Poison the search engines. Look at the X-Men movies. Director Bryan Singer is the big pedophile working on them, and runs the "Digital Entertainment Network" parties. However, they busted some minor crew member for pedophilia (not saying he doesn't deserve his jail time), but it makes people (and search engines) think that that is what is being talked about with X-Men and pedophiles.

       I see tons of stories on questionable sites where they tell most of the story, but twist a little detail here or there. It also works to discredit the people who repeat those stories verbatim (I see that often here.)
      </p>
      <p>
       By even getting a detail wrong, it allows the "skeptics" to say that the whole thing is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the internet, information is everywhere, you can't remove things you have to bury it in more information. The intelligence agencies can add little twists into their operations that make them seem far-fetched ... violate occam's razor and you're halfway to a successful cover-up. They own the media and the mainstream story, the key now is to also own the "truther" story from the beginning. Make it so neither side has the answer.

       Yeah the problem with this one is that you guys were so "super professional" in your investigating that you documented all of this. Just go back to all the threads, the terrible Wordpress blogs, the infographics from when Pizzagate was invented the week before the election --- you guys were sure that there was an illegal sex/murder ring happening in the basement of Comet Ping Pong.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys invented that, you own it now. Stop trying to pussy out of this by saying it's "pedogate" and involves every child abuse in the history of the world.

       That isn't true at all. Yeah there were people looking into the possibility of there being a basement there but it was never, among the serious investigators who were working on reddit and then voat, a central part of the investigation and it was never a confirmed thing and only maybe a couple of people ever tried to push the idea that there was a sex dungeon in the basement of CPP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes there were terrible Wordpress blogs and bad infographics and bad information put out. But you can't dismiss the whole thing on the basis of that, nor can you lump every single PG investigator in with all of the crap that anyone who talked about PG ever put out including those who were working to try to make it sound crazy in order to build up a straw man to easily debunk officially.
      </p>
      <p>
       A sex dungeon in CPP was never a central thing - the media made out like that was what the whole thing was about when in reality it was something that had been suggested or pushed by a small minority. There were plenty of professional investigators and researchers involved, plenty of independent journalists, tons of people across the world were pitching in and they discovered a hell of a lot of genuine, frightening and damning information. Even if a minority pushed some stupid untrue stuff it doesn't detract from everything that was discovered and it doesn't excuse the media from their blatant warping of the whole thing and their refusal to address the serious concerns and issues that were raised in favour of pushing the sex dungeon myth as somehow being the key aspect upon which the whole PG investigation was based.

       Nah man, the "investigators" started it. A one point earlier this year Pizzagaters tried to link some random ARG videos to Pizzagate saying it was John Podesta terrorizing some kid, and went as far as saying it was in the basement of Comet Ping Pong because the video shows a bunch of colored strobe lights and a door similar to one at CPP.

       Do you not realise how many people were/are investigating this? That a few people put out bad info isn't surprising and it doesn't mean anything about all the other investigators who discovered and exposed good credible information. PG investigators aren't some official consortium who all know each other and all agree with everything put out by others who are investigating the same thing. In fact, one of the aims was for people to try to debunk one another's information in order to produce stronger evidence.

       Where did that video come from? I’m simply curious. I watched it last night and it was deeply disturbing, and I was curious if it’s origins. It said “a Twitter user posted this video” in the credits. But i can’t find any information where it came from originally

       Its an excuse. What proof do you have that it was a false flag? Im pretty sure its none because that would not make sense. You don't attract attention to a building that you are money laundering or trafficking children at. Even to divert attention, its to risky of a play.

       I guess you could call it first hand experience. I didn't launder money or traffic children or anything close to that serious as a juvenile delinquent, but I knew enough to know that attracting attention is the last the you want to do to be a successful criminal.

       It was very very clear at the time that he was not a genuine investigator of PG. There was absolutely no evidence that he had been involved in any of the investigation, had communicated on any of the forums or threads about it or anything. Other investigators took video when they went anywhere, for proof. If this guy was genuinely looking for evidence then he would have taken a camera, not a gun. The only thing he shot was the hard drive? The police claimed they had debunked PG, then the media repeated that ad nauseam, only for a FOIA request to discover that the police lied and they hadn't investigated any of it at all. You'd think if a man with no prior criminal history had turned up somewhere so convinced children were in danger that he'd risked his life and his freedom by going with a gun to 'free them' that a legitimate police force would have at least checked out the claims given that harm to children was being alleged, instead of lying and pretending they had looked into it when they hadn't. You're asking us to believe that not one police officer thought, hang on a second, this person is SO worried about kids being harmed here that he took a gun and shot it in there, we should probably make damn sure that there's nothing to it?
      </p>
      <p>
       But to you it makes sense that a person who had never had a criminal history or a history of this kind of behavior, a person for whom there was no evidence he'd been engaging in PG online, would risk his life, his reputation, his safety, his freedom etc, on the basis of some crazy conspiracy theory that, were you to believe it and understand its implications, would involve extremely dangerous people with enormous power and wealth and a hell of a lot to lose - you believe THAT. And then you believe that an otherwise ordinary up-til-now mentally healthy person taking such huge risks on the belief of some heinous criminal activity taking place would not at all pique the interest of the police and that the police would instantly, without investigation, dismiss this person's claims right away.
      </p>

       And yet somehow, you're telling others to act seriously? How about you start by thinking seriously!!

       You cant say that for sure. Its seems pretty obvious that he is not mentally healthy now though. That's the thing with crazy conspiracy theories, some crazy people latch on to them.

       None of you are genuine investigators. You think you are, but your efforts and antics are impeding the actual professionals. Going to Comet Pizza and taking cell phone videos is not an investigation, its a person that is living a fantasy.

       I'm left leaning on the spectrum, 25 living near ASU. Like I'm the demographic target of Last Week Tonight and Vice, but the bullshit programming and agenda they push is too much. As a matter of fact right before Vice put out that repugnant email 2 weeks back I had emailed and asked them who was controlling them and how they were so fucked that even a liberal was like whats the deal with all this horse shit layering. Makes me sick, I'm independent btw but still, who do they think they are fooling?

       Agreed, we must all keep the pressure on the D.C. Police Department to investigate this properly and honor the oath they all took. They have proven themselves to be a bunch of scoundrels who have covered up for Comet Ping Pong until now, but given everything else that has been going on lately I have hope that there may be some real changes in motion and we may finally see heads roll very soon.

       Love how you guys change your tune when it's convenient for you. Pretty soon you are going to deny that you pushed the alleged pedo code, now that that has been debunked.

       it's not. they were being brazen and just had this shit not even on private like a bunch of dumb-fucks. I always wondered if there was a more cohesive attempt when PG broke out to find answers if things would be different. Like instead of everyone chasing after 80 different things it was all boiled down to like 10 leads.

       TP has an open FB profile.  On it he has a pic. People are wishing him HB. Look at all the comments. 
There are two pizza related comments. 
The first one is a lady that just happens to be into weird art.  Also just happens to friends with none other than Pizza Pedo.
      </p>
      <p>
       She also is friends with a guy KK. He has a pic thst says, "isn't it great you love pizza,  i love pizza". Then another pic of him in front of a pizza shop called "Pizza Movers" in DC.

       Guys, I'm just going to put it out there since a lot of talk in this thread is about how they could sell so much pizza. I've ate at comet. A am I a reptilian elite that shares the same bloodline with the Rothschild's? Perhaps. Do I sacrifice children to gain power from Satan? Maybe. I'll let you guys figure that out on your own. I will say, Comet pizza is pretty f'ing good. It's maybe the best pizza in DC outside of 2 Amy's.

       I have to be honest here. I thought pizzagate sounded ridiculous. I have been into conspiracies since 9/11 and the start of the Iraq war but took a break after Sandy Hook because as a mom, it was too hard to read about at all. So, I heard about pizzagate from Stephen Colbert and what I now see are other disinfo "personalities"  first. It sounded so silly. Hillary eating babies, a guy looking for a basement when there was not a basement, I mean a damn pizza parlor itself sounds ridiculous with out knowing the facts. Now after waking back up and reading this sub, I see it is a very real thing. I wish more people knew the truth. And if I ever have a few months to live well...someone's at the top of my list!

       Even if it has a basement, this would likely only ever be used to hold people for a number of hours, not for sex parties.  Why would people who own huge mansions in private communities risk using a small basement in the middle of the city!?

       Yeah, I mean they probably don't have a literal sex dungeon right underneath a restaurant in the middle of a highly populated cosmopolitan area.  It's possible, but unlikely... that's how you get caught.  Wealthy, connected people usually do this stuff on large private properties
      </p>
      <p>
       That does not imply that nothing strange/illegal/immoral is going on there - it likely is as you said, a place of business for these people, where they can meet up and exchange money/promises

       I don't care if they have a basement or not. But it does verify the lies JA told when caught.  The theory was that the frozen locker on his instagram was down in the basement I guess.

       Why do you think JA posted babies with money and drugs on his pizza place instagram? How does that promote a family restaurant?

       You never saw the hidden part of the Comet Ping Pong website then. You had to obtain a password from someone to get in, but you could tell something wasn't right there. Who pays $1,000 for a photographer to take one picture? Unless you're also buying their  silence for what you're doing. Check out Titus Frost's posts on it. He and a hacker were able to make their way into it and it was child porn. I know the site was real because I saw it firsthand before they hid it or removed it.
