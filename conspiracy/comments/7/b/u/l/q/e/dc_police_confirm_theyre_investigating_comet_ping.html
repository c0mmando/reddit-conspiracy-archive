<p>I reported someone at the swap meet for selling illegally counterfeit goods and got the same response. No evidence at all, just an accusation. </p>

<p>And this type of evidence can be faked. Shows that he sent the officer a video of him accessing the site. Do you know how easy it would be to fake that video?</p>

<p>Also, he asks for clarification that an investigation is taking place and doesn&#39;t get that confirmation at all. </p>

<p>All the officer said was that a detective would look at the link. And one will. Doubt it goes further than that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been trying to put my finger on why the conservatives here <em>suddenly</em> became so concerned about sexual assault, when previously, their emphasis had always been focused on the dangers of false allegations, and generally defending misogyny while attacking feminism. The partisan motivation behind pushing the pizza-gate disinformation was clear, of course. What I couldn&#39;t quite figure out was why sexual assault against (mostly) female actresses was getting such play here, with conservatives seemingly rising up to defend these women. I think your wording here has shed light on why conservatives are suddenly so concerned about sexual assault:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hollywood can burn for all I care</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see now that what we&#39;re dealing with is a conflation of &quot;powerful sexual predators and the institutions that enable them&quot; with &quot;all of Hollywood,&quot; which conservatives have loved to hate for a very long time now.</p>

<p>To illustrate my point with an example, do any conservatives here want to tell me how they feel about the women who have accused our President of sexual assault? Or tell me how you feel about Trump bragging about sexual assault? I applaud fighting against sexual assault in Hollywood, but why does it so abruptly stop there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true that no one died at Sandy Hook, even the FBI website says there were no manslaughters in Newtown, CT in 2012. The best documentary I&#39;ve seen on the Sandy Hook Hoax was &quot;Dear Wolfgang | Revisiting Sandy Hook&quot;, it&#39;s on Vimeo currently (censored from YouTube) and I highly recommend it to everybody to watch. It&#39;s the most important documentary I&#39;ve seen all year, really points out the inconsistencies and impossibilities in the official story beyond a shadow of a doubt and makes one wonder how many of these other shootings are complete fabrications as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong. The FBI website only listed deaths reported by local police departments, and the Connecticut State Police handled that investigation. CT government categorized the deaths in a manner that the FBI would not have picked up on.</p>

<p>Also - put your logic cap on. You say the government staged the Sandy Hook massacre and can&#39;t be trusted because all their reports are lies, then cite the government&#39;s own report as proof it was fake? How does that make any logical sense at all? </p>

<p>And I did watch that documentary. It&#39;s full of circumstantial arguments that at face value seem to make sense but if you look at them logically are absurd. Like the idea that you need to be an expert marksman to shoot a bunch of second graders at point-blank range (as is claimed by the documentary&#39;s argument that the shooter was too week and too nerdy to have possibly committed the acts)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Connecticut&#39;s homicide count is correct, but the FBI&#39;s detailed supplementary material includes only the shooting of Adam Lanza&#39;s mother at her home in December 2012, just before Lanza went to the elementary school. Lt. Paul Vance says his department submitted a six-page report on the Newtown school victims to the FBI but later identified a mistake. Updated data was provided too late to be reflected in the database, Vance says, but the information should be added soon.</p>

<p>Where do you get your understanding of what your average murder scene looks like, TV? In real life people don&#39;t ooze gallons of blood when they&#39;re shot. And I can&#39;t tell what the consistency of the blood in that photo looks like because its so low-res. Neither can you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had nosebleeds where I&#39;ve bled more than that, and that does NOT look like dried blood. And that is the tip of the iceberg in the Sandy Hook Hoax. Why were no trauma helicopters called and why were no paramedics allowed in the building? The parents of the &quot;dead children&quot; were not allowed into the building or the morgue to see their child one last time- they were asked to identify their child from photographs allegedly, which no one had any issue with. Does that seem like a normal reaction from dozens of parents who just lost their 6 year old children? Not to mention the ridiculous crisis actors who couldn&#39;t muster up an ounce of genuine emotion. Robbie Parker smiling and hyperventilating to get into character before his interview. David Wheeler, a grieving father who played another role as a SWAT team agent who held his gun upside down by the magazine cartridge. All of the families received hundreds of thousands of dollars and every single one of them moved out of town. It remains the juiciest of all hoaxes in my opinion, there are just so many holes in the narrative that everyone should be able to see through. If none of this is suspicious to you, I honestly do not understand why you are interested in reading posts on a conspiracy forum.</p>

<p>Wow, that makes you totally an expert on gunshot trauma and thus qualified to make broad statements on the validity of gunshot blood spatter!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why were no trauma helicopters called and why were no paramedics allowed in the building?</p>

<p>Because most of these kids had their faces blown apart with their bran matter all over the ground? Trauma helicopters are valuable resources and arne&#39;t going to be wasted responding to blatantly dead and non-revivable casualties.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The parents of the &quot;dead children&quot; were not allowed into the building</p>

<p>WOW! Hysterial parents werne&#39;t allowed to trample over a crime scene! </p>

<blockquote>
<p>or the morgue to see their child one last time- they were asked to identify their child from photographs allegedly, which no one had any issue with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t find any sources for this one. But at any rate, it wouldn&#39;t be shocking - see the above point about having their heads blown off. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not to mention the ridiculous crisis actors who couldn&#39;t muster up an ounce of genuine emotion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you hold a psychology degree or training that qualifies you to dictate who is or is not grieving to your professional standards? Grief takes all forms - hell even laughter isn&#39;t all that uncommon (which I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re referring to here). As an anecdote on this - I had to keep my grandmother company when my uncle (her son) died in his sleep in between the police/EMTS and medical examiner responding. She&#39;d go from smiling and laughing and making casual small-talk with the police officer to going into hysterics every few minutes. That&#39;s called shock and grief. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>who played another role as a SWAT team agent who held his gun upside down by the magazine cartridge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LOL! I&#39;d love to see a high-resolution non-grainy photo you used to get this ridiculous notion from. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of the families received hundreds of thousands of dollars and every single one of them moved out of town.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>never heard this claim before. I thought they were all getting paid by lottery winnings and free houses? Your ridiculous narratives you get from paid conspiracy bloggers changes so fast it&#39;s hard to keep your lies straight. </p>

<p>They could watch a video of the entire Clinton/DC/CPP cabal participate in a satanic ritual in Tony Podesta&#39;s underground movie theater (because that is a real thing he claims is for &quot;viewing complex art&quot;), then get DNA samples and fingerprints, a police report, watch them get sent to Federal prison for life and say something like... &quot;That was all CG and the evidence was fake.

    <div class="md"><p>It is a fully bipartisan conspiracy... that stretches far beyond a singular Pizza place in DC, and far beyond the Democratic party. </p>

<p>But one must follow 12 months of bread crumbs to realize this is not, and never has been about Democrats vs. Republicans or Basement vs. No Basement. It&#39;s about protecting kids and completely decimating those who abuse/traffic/exploit them. It&#39;s about connecting data points beyond even just the children, as we quickly get into drug trafficking/weapons/organ harvesting/black market operations etc... </p>

<p>I think we will find that it is all connected. These black market shipping corridors are going to be a massive investigatory push in the near future, how did they get away with it? How many people/departments needed to comply? What kind of incentive and/or blackmail was used to force compliance? Where did all the money go? How was it laundered? </p>

<p>As for Moore... and everyone else, Hollywood, Elite, Politician, that is implicated? Let&#39;s work on proving it. We need witnesses. We need evidence. We need to connect them to existing rings and each other. </p>

<p><em>Are you denying that there was a computer in CPP, that was struck by the single shot fired by the shooter (Maddison)?</em></p>

<p>The basement fallacy is a non-issue. It&#39;s like saying that if an investigator got the address of a murder wrong in their GPS system, the murder didn&#39;t happen. The CPP basement was looked into, extensively, and ultimately agreed to by everyone VERY early on that there was not a basement. This eventually lead to the discovery of some fuckery w/ Pegasus Museum and Buck&#39;s. But, I digress and will not fall into the same silly trap. </p>

<p>Lol, this story changes every time I hear it.  Yes, I am denying a shooter came into Comet Ping Pong, fired a single shot (which struck a computer) and nothing else.  Yes I am.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I am making no claims about this entire article or even the entire situation as a whole... the only thing I&#39;m trying to show you, is that the single shot fired by the gunman did indeed strike a computer in a closet.</p>

<p>All accounts have reported multiple shots from outside a locked door (at the lock).  After he realized nothing was in the room, he surrendered.  No accounts that I have seen claim he fired additional shots once inside the room (nor would your own account suggest this).   </p>

<p>So the original account (single shot directly into a computer) is objectively wrong.  </p>

<p>Yeah, that one. I don&#39;t know if the computer was intentionally shot through the door by Maddison, but I would bet quite a bit of money that the computer was intentionally shot. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is no investigation of said hard drive... and it is destroyed... perhaps the point wasn&#39;t to actually destroy the data, but to justify the disposal of the HDD. If the PD preserved every single item that a bullet struck as evidence, they&#39;d run out of space in their evidence lockers. If the PC @ CPP wasn&#39;t under investigation (which was admitted months after PG broke, that no investigation of Comet was ever conducted) - why would they arbitrarily hold onto a PC damaged beyond reasonable repair?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn’t watch the entire video, but I can assure you that it is much more than just the email. 
The video is an interview with the person who supposedly got access into a backroom encryption of Comet Ping Pong’s website. He claims he saw an area for a “Shopping Cart,” for transactions, and several zip files that allegedly contain tapes of children and the likes. Alongside with this, the guy being interviewed claimed he sent that email you saw containing the information about what he found to a D.C Police Detective. 
Whether it is true or not, you should definitely watch the video. I got lucky and skipped to about 15-25 minutes in and got a lot of interesting information about it. Apparently the owner of Comet Ping Pong had nefarious images of children, not necessarily nude images but grotesque nonetheless, on his Instagram account. After the allegations started, he set his account to private. Very weird stuff man. Also the guy claims that after he sent this information to numerous local news agencies, detectives, etc, his neighbor called the cops on somebody who was waiting outside of the guys house. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You certainly are the sweetest of summer children. I almost feel bad telling you the extent of the corruption. the head of the D.C. Police is a drunk who busted his wife&#39;s teeth in. That&#39;s the man that you expect to seek justice? Child rape and murder is utilized by fascist organizations to further their selfish agendas. pedophile is simply another word for psychopath someone who has no empathy or remorse and feels nothing while violating the sovereignty of another human being. These people are naturally drawn to positions of power where they can better control the narrative and control the opposition. These people when in positions of power are black mailed by even more powerful people thus keeping the faggot strong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there is nothing wrong with being uninformed then say uninformed. If you need to explain why something you said &quot;isn&#39;t really an insult&quot; it&#39;s because it is an insult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of websites have cookies that aren&#39;t easily found. In college I was an athlete and on our school website our coach had a link placed in a really obscure place and when you clicked on that link it took you to the team member login. There were all sorts of things we had access to that came from that difficult to find link. </p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t shock me if the Comet Ping Pong website were similar. I remember when all of this stuff &quot;came out&quot; I was interested in it and I remember going to their website. It was super odd and it looked like something you would have found in the late 90&#39;s from geocities. </p>

<p>It was a very odd website for a modern business</p>

<p>The chances are close to 0 that any given pizza shop has their own servers, they just throw a site up on Godaddy or something with standard templates. The fact that this &quot;hacker&quot; claims he got into their website and found a stash of child pornography casually available is laughable.</p>
