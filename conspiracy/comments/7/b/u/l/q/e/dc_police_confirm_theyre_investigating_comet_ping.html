       if you tell a police department you have evidence that there is child porn being sold/distributed by a local business, they will assign a detective to look into it.

       that doesn't necessarily mean there is any kind of "official investigation" happening.

       Sure, but it also means this person provided some sort of evidence for them to act on. If you just contact the police and make a wild claim without any evidence, then they won’t still be looking into it almost a year later

       He confirms that a detective has already been assigned to this case, i.e. he’s investigating it. I’m not sure what else would constitute confirmation in your eyes. I get that you come to this sub to dismiss everything unless it relates to Trump, but the good news is that you can email them yourself if you truly want to get to the bottom of it

       what is disgusting to is like even if you're don't fully believe Pizzagate (most likely because you didn't do an ounce of research) just leave it be. Don't actively try and tell others not to look into it. If you are against Pizzagate you are, by default, FOR pedophilia

       In fact, this is actually the first time they watch into it, that means that only this week the first potential evidence came. I congratulate all the pizzagate believers with this amazing succes, but I would advice you not to get your hopes up, as I think chances are very likely that the evidence is either fake or planted.

       No it doesn't. I've done this before. Anything you email them and tell them they'll assign someone too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I reported someone at the swap meet for selling illegally counterfeit goods and got the same response. No evidence at all, just an accusation.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this type of evidence can be faked. Shows that he sent the officer a video of him accessing the site. Do you know how easy it would be to fake that video?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he asks for clarification that an investigation is taking place and doesn't get that confirmation at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the officer said was that a detective would look at the link. And one will. Doubt it goes further than that.

       I don't think it really matters to some people what the results would be anyways.  If they corroborate, it's proof they were right.  If they don't find anything then it's proof the cabal got to them and covered it up, meaning they were right.

       I've been trying to put my finger on why the conservatives here
       <em>
        suddenly
       </em>
       became so concerned about sexual assault, when previously, their emphasis had always been focused on the dangers of false allegations, and generally defending misogyny while attacking feminism. The partisan motivation behind pushing the pizza-gate disinformation was clear, of course. What I couldn't quite figure out was why sexual assault against (mostly) female actresses was getting such play here, with conservatives seemingly rising up to defend these women. I think your wording here has shed light on why conservatives are suddenly so concerned about sexual assault:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hollywood can burn for all I care
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I see now that what we're dealing with is a conflation of "powerful sexual predators and the institutions that enable them" with "all of Hollywood," which conservatives have loved to hate for a very long time now.
      </p>
      <p>
       To illustrate my point with an example, do any conservatives here want to tell me how they feel about the women who have accused our President of sexual assault? Or tell me how you feel about Trump bragging about sexual assault? I applaud fighting against sexual assault in Hollywood, but why does it so abruptly stop there?

       Tell me this. What possible motive does he have to make these allegations to authorities, potentially making him libel of defamation if they are false? That could put him in jail or ruin his life. What motive does he have unless he is telling the truth?

       The guy names Bigfish aka Trebillion on Twitter was the hacker. He doesn't have a Youtube. Titus Frost interviewed him recently. Months ago he filed reports to authorities to no avail. Months ago Titus Frost did a video on it, but again authorities did nothing. However he recently did a full interview with Titus Frost, and that got more attention. An entirely different Twitter user has contacted DC police and that is the email you see.

       The answer is painfully simple: forwarding the narrative that Podesta, the DNC, and Clinton are scumbag pedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at how casually people here are in calling every Democrat under the sun a pedophile. It's a very serious accusation and it gets tossed around here as if there's no such thing as a burden of proof.

       I'm not talking about Titus Frost. I'm taking about the guy who found kiddie porn behind Comet's website. The guy who did the interview, and the guy who contacted DC police. Titus Frost just interviewed him, he didn't contact the police. The guy who FOUND the CP has already contacted the FBI and authorities. Why would you tell the FBI and DC police you've found child porn when you haven't? What do you gain from that?

       It's true that no one died at Sandy Hook, even the FBI website says there were no manslaughters in Newtown, CT in 2012. The best documentary I've seen on the Sandy Hook Hoax was "Dear Wolfgang | Revisiting Sandy Hook", it's on Vimeo currently (censored from YouTube) and I highly recommend it to everybody to watch. It's the most important documentary I've seen all year, really points out the inconsistencies and impossibilities in the official story beyond a shadow of a doubt and makes one wonder how many of these other shootings are complete fabrications as well.

       Wrong. The FBI website only listed deaths reported by local police departments, and the Connecticut State Police handled that investigation. CT government categorized the deaths in a manner that the FBI would not have picked up on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also - put your logic cap on. You say the government staged the Sandy Hook massacre and can't be trusted because all their reports are lies, then cite the government's own report as proof it was fake? How does that make any logical sense at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       And I did watch that documentary. It's full of circumstantial arguments that at face value seem to make sense but if you look at them logically are absurd. Like the idea that you need to be an expert marksman to shoot a bunch of second graders at point-blank range (as is claimed by the documentary's argument that the shooter was too week and too nerdy to have possibly committed the acts)

       Connecticut's homicide count is correct, but the FBI's detailed supplementary material includes only the shooting of Adam Lanza's mother at her home in December 2012, just before Lanza went to the elementary school. Lt. Paul Vance says his department submitted a six-page report on the Newtown school victims to the FBI but later identified a mistake. Updated data was provided too late to be reflected in the database, Vance says, but the information should be added soon.

       Where do you get your understanding of what your average murder scene looks like, TV? In real life people don't ooze gallons of blood when they're shot. And I can't tell what the consistency of the blood in that photo looks like because its so low-res. Neither can you.

       I've had nosebleeds where I've bled more than that, and that does NOT look like dried blood. And that is the tip of the iceberg in the Sandy Hook Hoax. Why were no trauma helicopters called and why were no paramedics allowed in the building? The parents of the "dead children" were not allowed into the building or the morgue to see their child one last time- they were asked to identify their child from photographs allegedly, which no one had any issue with. Does that seem like a normal reaction from dozens of parents who just lost their 6 year old children? Not to mention the ridiculous crisis actors who couldn't muster up an ounce of genuine emotion. Robbie Parker smiling and hyperventilating to get into character before his interview. David Wheeler, a grieving father who played another role as a SWAT team agent who held his gun upside down by the magazine cartridge. All of the families received hundreds of thousands of dollars and every single one of them moved out of town. It remains the juiciest of all hoaxes in my opinion, there are just so many holes in the narrative that everyone should be able to see through. If none of this is suspicious to you, I honestly do not understand why you are interested in reading posts on a conspiracy forum.

       Do you hold a psychology degree or training that qualifies you to dictate who is or is not grieving to your professional standards? Grief takes all forms - hell even laughter isn't all that uncommon (which I'm assuming you're referring to here). As an anecdote on this - I had to keep my grandmother company when my uncle (her son) died in his sleep in between the police/EMTS and medical examiner responding. She'd go from smiling and laughing and making casual small-talk with the police officer to going into hysterics every few minutes. That's called shock and grief.

       I’m pretty sure if you are powerful group in DC involved in this shit, the FIRST avenue you would take care of is to make sure that the cops were on the take to not investigate what you’re up to.  I think this shit may be happening, I just have no faith the conventional police will ever / can ever expose it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It needs to be exposed by an insider blowing the whistle with explosive, undeniable evidence implicating many powerful people, or it needs to be exposed by somebody NOT corrupted infiltrating it and blowing the lid publicly with undeniable evidence.

       Some dude already put in a request for DC police to investigate CPP. They came back with a statement that they had investigated and found nothing suspicious. Then the same dude put in a FOIA request for the investigation details and found out
       <em>
        there was never an investigation, not even cursory.
       </em>
       The DCPD lied.  I wish i could find the sources and FOIA results on this but will have to do a little bit of digging

       DCPD does have a stigma for corruption.  It doesn't surprise me they sandbagged the claim or any hope for an investigation before Trump was inaugurated.

       I'm just gonna say, the biggest portion of the public (anyone who's not in a the half million that subscribe here), don't believe in the whole pg conspiracy.. so seeing a cop at a pizza place isn't fucking weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       By your theory, donut shops are a front, because that's where you'll typically see the most cops. Did I just solve this myself?

       As for the picture of an email, I need a little more proof than that, to believe there's an investigation. Plus, in this very thread someone just proved that they said they'd investigate before, and they didn't.

       It's difficult to get people to be aware of it because there are millions of dollars literally being thrown at this to bury and blur the spotlight because it's connected to a very large underground criminal trafficking syndicate.  Do you network?  Because these people do and do it very well.

       no, it was not. this whole video thing mentioned in the comment above yours was the very beginning of the whole PG/comet pizza/besta pizza/alefantis shit... it occurred shortly before the podesta emails and such came out. i remember when it happened, i was in that very thread(OP basically suggested something odd was going on because "why would a pizza shop even HAVE such large files/videos?"), HOWEVER, there were also followup threads too which stated that once they got into see the actual files and not just their names, the footage was simply security cam footage. and yeah, none of yall seem to remember this, it's crazy, i have mentioned it here before and people got all "NO WAY JOSE you don't know what ur talkin about!!" etc, ofc lol

       I think you are overlooking the influence of the media, and it's ability to snowball things like this. Yes, "they" might have individual police on the take, but if the chiefs are under pressure from the commissioner who are under pressure from the governor etc and up the line, they will do what the "public" wants.
      </p>
      <p>
       All it takes is pizzagate becoming "interesting" again to the media for the ball to roll.

      <p>
       You can explore the link results yourself to get the context of the references, as I did, which show that there is, indeed, a Jeremiah Johnson affiliated with the DC police dept.

      <p>
       Also, try another search to find info on him on your own, using various search engines... good practice for you to hone your own search capabilities. Hint: enter this phrase: most popular search engines 2017.

      <p>
       Try a few different ones, as Google is very (VERY) biased in their results. And, they track the hell out of you.

       No, they won't... trust me. I spent countless hours uselessly debating them. No matter how bad something looks/is or how much past/present evidence builds up, they find a way to explain it away or deny it.

       We can refer to them as the Perpeptual Nothingburgerites

       They could watch a video of the entire Clinton/DC/CPP cabal participate in a satanic ritual in Tony Podesta's underground movie theater (because that is a real thing he claims is for "viewing complex art"), then get DNA samples and fingerprints, a police report, watch them get sent to Federal prison for life and say something like... "That was all CG and the evidence was fake. Pizzagate is a fictitious and ridiculous theory"
      </p>
      <p>
       And then ironically go on to ridicule us for pointing out that the Russian investigation has always been full of holes.

       It is a fully bipartisan conspiracy... that stretches far beyond a singular Pizza place in DC, and far beyond the Democratic party.
      </p>
      <p>
       But one must follow 12 months of bread crumbs to realize this is not, and never has been about Democrats vs. Republicans or Basement vs. No Basement. It's about protecting kids and completely decimating those who abuse/traffic/exploit them. It's about connecting data points beyond even just the children, as we quickly get into drug trafficking/weapons/organ harvesting/black market operations etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we will find that it is all connected. These black market shipping corridors are going to be a massive investigatory push in the near future, how did they get away with it? How many people/departments needed to comply? What kind of incentive and/or blackmail was used to force compliance? Where did all the money go? How was it laundered?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Moore... and everyone else, Hollywood, Elite, Politician, that is implicated? Let's work on proving it. We need witnesses. We need evidence. We need to connect them to existing rings and each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without proof/credible witnesses? No one will go down.

       No, sorry. I know that you WANT to think that this has a heavy anti-Dem spin to it which was "engineered"... and obviously posts on the T_D will. But if you dig into the actual PG research, there is zero partisanship to it. Rep or Dem, doesn't matter, if implicated or connected to PG in anyway, the rabbit hole is explored.

       No, I'm not doing that at all. There's plenty of circumstantial evidence... I never claimed that there was concrete evidence, nor was I claiming that the lack of evidence would be considered evidence.

       I was simply making a point that no matter what the Clinton group does, gets caught doing, they never seem to get in any actual trouble. The worst punishment to date has been resignations. For crimes that would land anyone else in prison.

       Just be aware, that anyone pushing this "Pizzagate is fake because there is no basement in Comet Ping Pong!" ideology has completely fallen for the mainstream trap. Hook, line and sinker.

      <p>
       The basement fallacy is a non-issue. It's like saying that if an investigator got the address of a murder wrong in their GPS system, the murder didn't happen. The CPP basement was looked into, extensively, and ultimately agreed to by everyone VERY early on that there was not a basement. This eventually lead to the discovery of some fuckery w/ Pegasus Museum and Buck's. But, I digress and will not fall into the same silly trap.

       Well then you are very much mistaken. They even released a picture of the damaged computer, which has now been pretty successfully scrubbed from the internet. Luckily, I was able to find an article that has a screenshot of it.

       Just to be clear, I am making no claims about this entire article or even the entire situation as a whole... the only thing I'm trying to show you, is that the single shot fired by the gunman did indeed strike a computer in a closet.

       All accounts have reported multiple shots from outside a locked door (at the lock).  After he realized nothing was in the room, he surrendered.  No accounts that I have seen claim he fired additional shots once inside the room (nor would your own account suggest this).
      </p>

       So the original account (single shot directly into a computer) is objectively wrong.

       If there is no investigation of said hard drive... and it is destroyed... perhaps the point wasn't to actually destroy the data, but to justify the disposal of the HDD. If the PD preserved every single item that a bullet struck as evidence, they'd run out of space in their evidence lockers. If the PC @ CPP wasn't under investigation (which was admitted months after PG broke, that no investigation of Comet was ever conducted) - why would they arbitrarily hold onto a PC damaged beyond reasonable repair?

       And here's a rare image from a FoxNews clip that showed the damaged computer... it was initially reported that it specifically struck the hard drive:

       I'm not going to watch the video, so can someone who's watched summarise if there's any evidence and what that evidence is. If it's just that email (which is what it sounds like), that looks exactly like what standard procedure would look like, and thus literally means nothing.

       I didn’t watch the entire video, but I can assure you that it is much more than just the email. 
The video is an interview with the person who supposedly got access into a backroom encryption of Comet Ping Pong’s website. He claims he saw an area for a “Shopping Cart,” for transactions, and several zip files that allegedly contain tapes of children and the likes. Alongside with this, the guy being interviewed claimed he sent that email you saw containing the information about what he found to a D.C Police Detective. 
Whether it is true or not, you should definitely watch the video. I got lucky and skipped to about 15-25 minutes in and got a lot of interesting information about it. Apparently the owner of Comet Ping Pong had nefarious images of children, not necessarily nude images but grotesque nonetheless, on his Instagram account. After the allegations started, he set his account to private. Very weird stuff man. Also the guy claims that after he sent this information to numerous local news agencies, detectives, etc, his neighbor called the cops on somebody who was waiting outside of the guys house.

       dumb how they won't even upload any one bit of the pictures online to help push the investigation forward. you can censor a lot of the CP ones, or upload photos that don't contain nudes, etc.

       So in other words guy claims he found smoking guns, and can't upload any form of hard proof because reasons.

       Wow, people actually fall for this crap? Remember when the Mega guy was going to release the Pizzagate smoking gun? Or some random "journalist" who was going to releaes the smoking gun? Or Alex Jones?

       Well, to be fair, that response looks like the standard response given to any request for an investigation.  For instance, if my neighbor killed my cat or something, and I report it, I would assume that's the "ok pal, we got better things to do.  Go away, but we're gonna say it politely" type response I would expect to receive.

       Hopefully this person doesn't start/stop taking depression medication. I hear the side effects are... killer.

       The fact that this cesspool of filth has infected so many people high up and down inside the system doesn't give out much chance of a real investigation happening and producing results, but still hoping those bastards are stopped.

       "You guys" are the people who say Pizzagate is all true. One computer scientist did something but everyone else with the evidence didn't for over a year now? If the evidence is so convincing it would be a super easy bust and save the kids.

       You certainly are the sweetest of summer children. I almost feel bad telling you the extent of the corruption. the head of the D.C. Police is a drunk who busted his wife's teeth in. That's the man that you expect to seek justice? Child rape and murder is utilized by fascist organizations to further their selfish agendas. pedophile is simply another word for psychopath someone who has no empathy or remorse and feels nothing while violating the sovereignty of another human being. These people are naturally drawn to positions of power where they can better control the narrative and control the opposition. These people when in positions of power are black mailed by even more powerful people thus keeping the faggot strong.

       Ok so why are you trying to convince me? Forget "the head of DC police" and go to the FBI. Make a PDF, print it at a FedEx store. Compile the evidence. You will be a hero.

       I'm not trying to convince you you seem happy in your ignorance.  If you listened to the computer scientist you would know that the FBI has been contacted.  If they too are corrupt then this isn't such a wise move.

       If there is nothing wrong with being uninformed then say uninformed. If you need to explain why something you said "isn't really an insult" it's because it is an insult.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you are 100% correct, you're free to present the truth however you want. That said, if you're like most of the humans who participate in conspiracy theories, your end-goal is (typically) to convince as many people as possible to open their eyes and think of themselves. Becoming hostile and hurling insults is
       <em>
        the quickest
       </em>
       way to make someone defensive and close their mind. And closed-minded people are completely antithetical to conspiracy theories/theorists.

      <p>
       If you really want people to respond to your message and grow the conspiracy community then your message shouldn't be so dickish.

There a so many private members gentleman clubs around DC and the world that creep the fuck out of me when I am in them. Ive been to one which I wont name and there were a hand full of very creep fat old men who had a new young guy with them every week. Always claiming to be mentoring them into University.

       I assume pizzagate is about pedophilia. It's not about democrats. It just so happens to have some democrats at the head of the snake. I don't care if they are democrats, republicans, libertarians, or communists, making something as ugly as this political is disgusting. That's not what the real people who a investigating and trying to expose pizzagate are doing. When I see someone make it seem as if pedophilia is a political argument, it tells me you know nothing about it or you're purposely trying to make it a trivial issue.

       There you go making it a political issue again. I got kicked out of the Donald. I don't give a shit about party lines. It's for weak minded people who can't see how the government works. I figured that out years ago. It never was a political attack. Just because people like you try to hijack the narrative and make it political doesn't make it so. Yes there are people on the other side making it about dems. They are doing the same thing you're doing. Hijacking an investigation into pedophilia rings and making it political so it trivializes the issue.

       Of course he'll resign. Any defence he puts up will be moot. And if they're true, he deserves to be shunned by society in general.

       He hacked website, found bad stuff, reported it to police, police acted like they didn't care (or that they were talking to a crazy person) then random people/things started happening around his house. They provide a news story from his local paper, from one of the people showing up at his house.

       A lot of websites have cookies that aren't easily found. In college I was an athlete and on our school website our coach had a link placed in a really obscure place and when you clicked on that link it took you to the team member login. There were all sorts of things we had access to that came from that difficult to find link.

       It wouldn't shock me if the Comet Ping Pong website were similar. I remember when all of this stuff "came out" I was interested in it and I remember going to their website. It was super odd and it looked like something you would have found in the late 90's from geocities.

       Again, not taking any side in the guilt or innocence of people in this, but I'm pretty sure that any police force that receives accusations of child porn will investigate it, so I don't think they someone making the allegation of child porn receiving notice that the police are looking into it is any sort of smoking gun.

       Okay if anyone actually listened to the interview with said "hacker" there was a hoax of an investigation that has already been concluded and he is lucky to be alive still. He also now knows that contacting the FBI and local police was a bad idea as the day after he came forth with this information was when the computer got an alleged bullet in it.
