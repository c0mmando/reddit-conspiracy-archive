    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Islamic culture was westernizing in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s. No hijabs or full cover up for women. They had shopping malls and thriving culture they just liked being Muslims instead of Christians.</p>

<p>The CIA and NSA changed though and somewhere along the line the agencies were directed at destroying the middle east. Probably had to do with oil and religious beliefs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is patently false.  </p>

<p>The similarities between Judaism and Christianity go way beyond monotheism.  It is the same God.   </p>

<p>Christianity says that God in the Old Testament is the same as God in the New Testament.  Character, attributes, decrees, etc etc are the same.  They also say that the method of salvation was the same as in the Old Testament, but the means of salvation had not yet been fulfilled.  ie. faith looking towards a Messiah vs. faith look back at a Messiah.</p>

<p>The only thing that changes for Judaism is that they don&#39;t see Christ as being the Messiah.  They still see it as yet to be fulfilled.  Different religion, but same God and therefore same ideas on how to live.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the origins are the same, but it breaks down because Islam doesn&#39;t view the Old Testament scriptures as authoritative.  They believe the OT to be mostly human writings that were distorted until the writing of the Koran.  These scriptures are not used in Islam.  Christianity and Judaism view OT scripture as authoritative revelation from God.</p>

<p>So yes, the Abrahamic god is present but it is a much bigger division regarding who that God is and what he requires from humanity than most people realize.  Jews and Christians are much more likely to claim to worship the same God that Muslims would and vice versa.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a mainstream media thing to make it sound like Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are basically the same thing so there&#39;s a lot of misinformation out there.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s been a cautious alliance between Christianity and Judaism since the inception of Christianity.  And they&#39;ve had bad blood with Islam dating back to the crusades.  Judaism/Islam bad blood dates back much further. </p>

<p>While Allah and YHVH share some similarities, there are some uncanny differences between them, for example, Allah has no son.</p>

<p>That being said, they cant be the same being. So if both claim their vision is the truth, one (or both) of them are mistaken, because they cant be both right at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two quoted rabbis. Doubtless there are others. Rabbinical Judaism, as handed down by the heretical Pharisees, is not the religion of the Bible. It’s the religion of man. Jews are at odds with God as we know Him. The words attributed to Jesus made that completely clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we&#39;re coming at the same thing from two different angles here.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is that because of the &quot;family&quot; history of these two religions, they share a lot of common ground.</p>

<p>For example, the Judeo-Christian view of government.  Both hold to the the under-lying premise that mankind is inherently wicked and fallen - that there is something inside that corrupts a man and not simply his environment.  Therefore, government is needed to restrain evil and that government should not be all powerful - power should be distributed among many because ultimate authority belongs to God.  </p>

<p>This is why there was the Tower of Babel distributing and breaking up a unified one-world system and why it was a sin for the nation of Israel to want a king like the other nations.  This is also why Jesus, Paul and Peter affirm the authority of the state in the NT.  All these ideas are captured through a full reading of all the teachings of the OT and the NT.  </p>

<p>So the fact that the US has a common ally in the area that can appreciate ideas like individual sovereignty, economic freedom, limited governement, and other federalist ideals is what brings us together.  </p>

<p>Islamic scriptures carry a very authoritarian perspective about human governance. That&#39;s why we don&#39;t have good relationships with Iran and Syria. </p>

<p>Syria, like “our” other enemy Lebanon, is not an authoritarian Islamic state. They are open opponents of Zionism, however. Like Iraq. Like Yemen. Like Libya. Cohencidentally, the ME states that <em>are</em> head-chopping extreme versions of Islamic governance are allied with us and the Jews against these more moderate majority-Muslim countries...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What gives the dynamic a particular look is the large population of Evangelical Christians.  Now what you have to understand, is while the professed rates of religiosity are extremely high, the general population simply does not know anything about the Bible, or Judaism nor Islam.  This goes for the evangelical crowed as well.  There are a set of cliches that they all know, you know, &#39;Jesus saves,&quot; type of knowledge.  So you end up with stuff like you see in this very thread, with &#39;we have a Judeo-Christian&#39; background level of rhetoric.  </p>

<p>The fact is that people just don&#39;t know anything about Judaism or Christianity.  </p>

<p>On top of this you had a conscious Zionist political project,  to make sure that culturally pro-Israel views dominate the news, academy and churches. </p>

<p>There are two academics who wrote a paper that eventually became a book concerning the influence of the Israel lobby.  The book is a must read, but you should give the shorter paper a try for sure. </p>

<li><p>The middle-east is a portal for the Reptilians. Their powers/requirements for destabilization are especially strong there.</p></li>
<li><p>The Temple of Solomon is located in the area of Israel. It&#39;s an important site for Freemasons and other factions. The goal is to rebuild it.</p></li>

<p>Possibly these two may also be connected.</p>
