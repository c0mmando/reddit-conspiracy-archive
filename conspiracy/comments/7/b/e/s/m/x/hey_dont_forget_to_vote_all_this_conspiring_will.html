       Really? Because voters, especially in key states allowed the Republicans and Trump to take office. Yeah Democrats are no better, but we are putting through our inaction, people into office that are terrible. We are letting the old and the dumb, choose who works in the White House. THAT IS A CRIME to us and to everyone in the world as the U.S. is one of the countries the international public looks to, to set an example of democracy.

       this is a silly idea.  All of this talk of corruption and you still think voting matters?  If your aware then you already knew it doesnt matter, the favt that "normies" are aware of this from msm talking about corruption simply solidifies for.me that voting is total and complete bullshit.

       Dude, I respect your right to think there is a difference between Democrats and Republicans, but it is a mistake to assume that we all believe that. I used to believe it - I was actually a delegate at the state level for Obama - but I no longer do.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you want to make an argument that elections matter for some reason other than picking which criminal is in charge I will listen. But if you come into the conversation requiring that others agree that Democrats vs. Republicans is a real thing... then you can only have a fruitful conversation with other people who believe that. Those people tend not to post on this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe that voting props up the charade of democracy, but democracy itself does not exist. Not even a little bit. So although I really did vote I did it because of the lingering doubt that maybe, just maybe, I am letting them get away with something by not voting. On the other hand maybe, just maybe, I am contributing to my own servitude by voting.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a tough nut to crack and I'm open to discussion, but if you just want to say "You need to do this or you are bad!" then you can fuck right off.

       I think we are letting the rich and powerful choose who is in the white house. I think this because they control the media and the media controls the populace. People vote the way the media tells them they should because people are scared, lonely and lost and they feel better when they are part of a group. Voting the way your group votes is the best way to feel like part of that group. Trump started out with a small vocal minority of Republicans supporting him. $1 billion dollars in free news coverage later - news that said "Holy smokes,
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       seems to like Donald" and we have him in the white house. So, was that the old and the dumb or was that the fucking media that did that to us?

       Yeah I used to think you should vote. Now I know for a fact ti doesn't matter at all. All the world is a stage and they are all FULL of shit.

      <ul>
       <li>
        I Like this quote I dislike this quote
“I don't vote. Two reasons. First of all it's meaningless; this country was bought and sold a long time ago. The shit they shovel around every 4 years
        <em>
         pfff
        </em>
        doesn't mean a fucking thing. Secondly, I believe if you vote, you have no right to complain. People like to twist that around – they say, 'If you don't vote, you have no right to complain', but where's the logic in that? If you vote and you elect dishonest, incompetent people into office who screw everything up, you are responsible for what they have done. You caused the problem; you voted them in; you have no right to complain. I, on the other hand, who did not vote, who in fact did not even leave the house on election day, am in no way responsible for what these people have done and have every right to complain about the mess you created that I had nothing to do with.”*

       Ask Scandinavia how voting is useless. Maybe you'll see that giving power away is as easy as not participating in the process.

       The voiceless in this country are so quick to disenfranchise themselves. Yes, go ahead and prove to the government that you don't care anymore. That you gave up. I'm not. I still have a voice. Peace out, I'm going to vote.

       The elites generally misdirect idealistic ppl into voting for their pre-selected stooges.
      </p>
      <p>
       The candidates they haven't approved are either killed (JFK) or ignored (Ron Paul)... if all else fails they steal (Bernie Sanders)
