       In 1996, 2000 and 2004, i voted for Ralph Nader.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2008, I voted for Cynthia McKinney for President and Rosa Clemente for Vice President.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 2012 general election, i voted for Jill Stein.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 2016 primary, i voted for Bernie Sanders.

      <p>
       In the 2016 general election, i voted for Jill Stein.
      </p>
      <p>
       No well-informed individual, free of misinformation and disinformation, wasted their vote on either Hillary or Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       In every election, i vote for the most progressive candidate on the ballot.
      </p>
      <p>
       The level of willful ignorance and shameless apathy is mind-boggling.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is so much misinformation and disinformation put out by the corporate media.

       However, in the age of the internet, ignorance is a choice.

       Ever since at least 1980, We the People of planet Earth have had the capability of providing the highest quality of food, the highest quality of clothing, the highest quality of shelter, the highest quality of healthcare, and the highest quality of education for each and every man, woman and child on the face of the Earth, and to do it in such a way that was in Harmony with Nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       We already have gazillions of creative practical solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we don’t have here in the USA is at least 80 million citizens who are well-informed, free of disinformation and misinformation, on all the major issues of today AND devoting their time, energy, talents and resources to make sure that only the most Loving and most Wise among us become our public servants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then and only then will we finally be in a position to transition to a Whole New Way of Living rooted in Love and Wisdom, with no need for government.
      </p>
      <p>
       i am waking up and mentoring around 10 new uninformed/misinformed individuals every week. It's imperative that each and every one of us, without exception, does so too.

       There is way too much talking about stuff we already know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Too many people are merely do-nothing talking heads.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is: what are we going to do about it all?
      </p>
      <p>
       How exactly do we get from where we are today to a Whole New Way of Living rooted in Love and Wisdom?
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't mean solutions. We already have gazillions of creative practical solutions that have not been implemented yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       i mean how exactly do we get into a position where we can actually implement those solutions on a grand scale?

       It was actually a mistake, but i might not be far from truth in that statement. Zionism wants to destroy western society, jews created zionism, feminism is destroying western society, so i am not completely wrong, or am i?

       Huh, so do you use "Zionist" as a way to avoid being called anti-Semitic, when really you're talking about Jews?

       I was banned from r/history for alledgedly holocaust denial, i was banned from r/videos for anti-semitism... i really don't care to look anti-semite.

      <p>
       The term anti-semite is just weaponized language, you use a word and attach so much death, fear and racism so that people is afraid to criticize an ethnic to avoid being labelled anti semite.

       Nope i don't care about the anti-semite card.

       Just out of pure curiosity, when does it stop being "confirmation bias" and start being "truth"? Not necessarily speaking about this particular topic, but in general. I've seen things that are verifiable truths be called "confirmation bias", and vice versa. This idea of "confirmation bias" is such an interesting one to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a chart going around not to long ago that listed out all these psychological things we feel and use as conspiracy theorists, and confirmation bias was on there (IIRC), and the big question I had in regards to that was "Is it REALLY confirmation bias if the data is true, though?" Just reminded me of post-modern thought process, in which there is no absolute truth, and all things are subject to our own personal truths.
      </p>
      <p>
       (not trying to start anything, just been genuinely curious and thinking about this a lot recently)

       well, it's confirmation bias when you ignore data that is contrary to your opinion/conclusion, but it's also confirmation bias when take small data groups and use that reach a conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       for instance, other fallacies can be contained within confirmation bias, notable cherry picking and selection bias. like when someone believes that evolution isn't real, and they see an article about carbon dating being less reliable than previously thought, and they go "a-HAH! i knew it, all those stupid scientists were wrong and all that millions of years old crap is a bunch of garbage" But really, they are ignoring the fact that there are many other dating methods that are even more accurate, and there are also mountains of evidence beyond radio dating that indicate "deep time" in regards to the earth's age.
      </p>
      <p>
       also, confirmation bias doesn't necessarily mean someone is wrong, but it does mean that they are being unscientific and illogical in their methodology of determining what's true. but you know the saying, even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while.

       I agree. Instead of looking for a description of what "confirmation bias" is, I guess I was more just wondering at what point does it stop being bias and start to become truth? Maybe this isn't the place for such a discussion; I've always been wary of holding conversations about things like this through text-based mediums, as you can't really decipher tone and inflection properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for the reply, though. I was having a discussion with someone the other day (in person) about this, and was having a hard time describing in words what confirmation bias is. I'll be utilizing your description from now on, if you don't mind.

       feminism existed for hundreds of years prior to the surge of jewish feminists in the 1970s, so the statement "Feminism was pretty much a Jewish idea" is not supported in any way, shape, or form by the article you just linked.
