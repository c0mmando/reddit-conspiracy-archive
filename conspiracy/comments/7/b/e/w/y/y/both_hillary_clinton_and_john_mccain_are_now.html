       If Mueller is taking his investigation seriously, he's investigating that dossier. And both Clinton and McCain had a lot to do with that dossier.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he has evidence of wrongdoing on their part, and if he suspects they know he has that evidence based on who he hired (a bunch of people who know Hillary's campaign very well), he'd probably consider them a flight risk. Especially if that evidence is truly damning.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, is it really just a coincidence that both of these people injured their foot just three weeks apart? And that neither gave a full explanation of exactly how this happened -- people who's job is literally to talk and talk and talk about everything that pops into their head? Hillary never wears heels, yet broke her foot wearing heels "running" down the stairs. McCain is on a lot of cancer drugs, supposedly, which weakened his Achilles tendon, but we got no more to the story of just exactly how that happened (and why he'd be allowed to continue walking around lugging that boot on his foot if his tendons are really so weak -- his other foot must be very strong?
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I know Hillary got her boot in the UK. But it only makes sense that Mueller would allow her to remain abroad, so as not to raise suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, Hillary was off the grid for five days last week in the middle of a book tour. No tweets, no nothing. Very, very odd. The opposite of what your publicist would want you to do, especially when things like the Texas shooting happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could they both be on tracking devices, and using "foot injury" and boots to cover them up? Is Mueller on to them?

       Ya, My druggie Uncle got caught manufacturing Meth and had to wear a tracking device. I caught a glimpse of it a few times. It's hard to really hide but he did try. Fucker threatened me on a visit to my Grandparents. I reported his ass after he threatened  my Grandparents as well. They locked him down in his house again for months. That'll teach the bastard. He was way more polite after that.

       Why would they need to put a tracking device on some of the most famous people in the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       FBI/NSA/CIA would all have access to cell phones/laptops/devices for tracking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both of them have public schedules they keep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both have government security details.

       This isn't like one underpaid probation officer trying to keep track of Yolanda  down the street.

       HRC was in London with her boot making television appearances, so it's not too keep her in the country...

       If they wanted to keep track of someone like this they would just have agents follow them.

       I would be surprised if they made any of these celebrity political types actually wear a device. They are not going to be able to sneak anywhere very easily. If they were publicly given a device to wear, it would probably just be a dog and pony show for the public's benefit.

       No need for those two to wear the clunky ankle-
bracelet tracking devices worn by the average
non-elite criminals. They are both micro-chipped with
RFID and are constantly monitored by satellites for
their own protection from the angry proles and
would be assassins.

       Maybe both Clinton and McCain got their feet or ankles broken at a secret society meeting this past month?

       Look at how many politicians have had black eyes over the years. Has to be something to that.
