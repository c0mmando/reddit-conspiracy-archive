        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If Mueller is taking his investigation seriously, he&#39;s investigating that dossier. And both Clinton and McCain had a lot to do with that dossier.</p>

<p>If he has evidence of wrongdoing on their part, and if he suspects they know he has that evidence based on who he hired (a bunch of people who know Hillary&#39;s campaign very well), he&#39;d probably consider them a flight risk. Especially if that evidence is truly damning.</p>

<p>That said, is it really just a coincidence that both of these people injured their foot just three weeks apart? And that neither gave a full explanation of exactly how this happened -- people who&#39;s job is literally to talk and talk and talk about everything that pops into their head? Hillary never wears heels, yet broke her foot wearing heels &quot;running&quot; down the stairs. McCain is on a lot of cancer drugs, supposedly, which weakened his Achilles tendon, but we got no more to the story of just exactly how that happened (and why he&#39;d be allowed to continue walking around lugging that boot on his foot if his tendons are really so weak -- his other foot must be very strong?</p>

<p>Yes, I know Hillary got her boot in the UK. But it only makes sense that Mueller would allow her to remain abroad, so as not to raise suspicion.</p>

<p>Anyways, Hillary was off the grid for five days last week in the middle of a book tour. No tweets, no nothing. Very, very odd. The opposite of what your publicist would want you to do, especially when things like the Texas shooting happens.</p>

<p>Could they both be on tracking devices, and using &quot;foot injury&quot; and boots to cover them up? Is Mueller on to them?</p>

Fucker threatened me on a visit to my Grandparents. I reported his ass after he threatened  my Grandparents as well. They locked him down in his house again for months. That&#39;ll teach the bastard.

    <div class="md"><p>Why would they need to put a tracking device on some of the most famous people in the world?</p>

<p>FBI/NSA/CIA would all have access to cell phones/laptops/devices for tracking. </p>

<p>Both of them have public schedules they keep.</p>

<p>Both have government security details.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t like one underpaid probation officer trying to keep track of Yolanda  down the street.</p>

<p>HRC was in London with her boot making television appearances, so it&#39;s not too keep her in the country...</p>

<p>If they wanted to keep track of someone like this they would just have agents follow them.</p>
