        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Fell down this rabbit hole while reading about recent test site collapses.... Remember all the questions Q posed about who was actually running North Korea and why they started weaponizing so quickly in 2013? Well, it seems to all link back to Johns Hopkins and 38 North, the firm now releasing all the juicy satellite details about how <em>afraid</em> we should be of North Koreas missile sites, that <em>the very people who run 38 North helped acquire</em>..</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/07/north-koreas-nuclear-tests-turn-area-wasteland-lead-deformed/">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/07/north-koreas-nuclear-tests-turn-area-wasteland-lead-deformed/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, 38 North, a North Korea monitoring site operated out of Johns Hopkins University, Maryland, reported at the weekend that commercial satellite imagery of Punggye-ri had shown significant movements near the West Portal, a yet unused tunnel complex.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Johns Hopkins... AKA the epicentre of everything deep-state/CIA, from Catholic Priests coming for &quot;psychological training&quot; that later went on to abuse kids, to strange surgeries and treating celebs, to weird experimentation...</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/38_North">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/38_North</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>38 North is a website devoted to analysis about North Korea; it is a program of the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University&#39;s Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies and is managed by former U.S. Department of State official Joel S. Wit and USKI Assistant Director Jenny Town</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joel S. Wit? From the DoS? Let&#39;s see what sort of stuff he promotes publicly</p>

<p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/author/joel-s-wit/">https://www.brookings.edu/author/joel-s-wit/</a></p>

<p>&quot;Dealing with states <em>formerly known as rogue</em>&quot;

<p>&quot;Back Channel to North Korea&quot;
&quot;How Trump Could Get a Deal With North Korea&quot;
&quot;Can Trump Make a Deal With North Korea?&quot;</p>

<p>What does he start writing after NK gets the nuclear weapons <em>he personally wrote the agreement to give them</em>?</p>

<p><a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/10/07/you-should-still-be-scared-of-pyongyang/">https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/10/07/you-should-still-be-scared-of-pyongyang/</a></p>

<p>&quot;You should still be scared of Pyongyang&quot;</p>

<p>Seems like he is causing the problem and then promoting his solution...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.uskoreainstitute.org/directory/staff/joel-s-wit/">https://www.uskoreainstitute.org/directory/staff/joel-s-wit/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Joel S. Wit is concurrently a Senior Fellow at US-Korea Institute at SAIS and a Senior Research Fellow at Columbia University Weatherhead Institute for East Asian Studies.</p>

<p>He has served as Senior Advisor to Ambassador Robert L. Galluci from 1993-1995, where he developed strategies to help resolve the crisis over North Korea’s weapons program, and as Coordinator for the US-North Korea’s weapons program and as Coordinator for the US-North Korea Agreed Framework from 1995-1999, where he was the official in charge of implementation. He was also a key participant in the establishment of the Korean Peninsular Energy Development Organization (KEDO).</p>

<p>Prior to his efforts on the Agreed Framework, Wit was assigned to the State Department’s Office of Strategic Nuclear Policy, where he was responsible for U.S. policy on a range of issues related to nuclear arms control and weapons proliferation. In that capacity from 1988 to 1992, Wit helped negotiate strategic arms control agreements with the former Soviet Union and participated in the Nunn-Lugar program to dismantle its nuclear weapons. He was also a Guest Scholar at the Brookings Institute from 1999-2001.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We KNOW these decommissioned warheads were not done so for peace, but instead to sell off the valuable radioactive material to all sorts of buyers worldwide. Why are the very characters that were helping NK get arms and decommissioning the US&#39; now promoting war with them? Is the John Hopkins Institute helping a certain US government agency run North Korea, as Q-anon (whether LARP or not) has been hinting at?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An internationally recognized expert on Northeast Asian security issues and non-proliferation, Joel Wit has 20 years of experience in the U.S. State Department and the Washington think-tank arena. After a short stint on detail to the <strong>Central Intelligence Agency</strong> writing the first National Intelligence Estimate on ballistic missile proliferation, Mr. Wit was a member of U.S. delegations to the Strategic Arms Limitation and Intermediate Nuclear Force Talks with the Soviet Union. </p>

<p>“Slowly, desparatly slowly, the remains of passage debris that encumbered the lower part of the doorway was removed. With trembling hands I made a tiny breach in the upper left-hand corner.

    <div class="md"><p>someone wrote a really detailed fanfic on 4chan last week, that basically said that trump is fighting a secret shadow war against &quot;the globalists&quot;/TPTB/&quot;the deep state&quot;/(choose your own boogeyman)</p>

<p>so even though none of it is true and even though it contained specific predictions that already have failed to come true, a bunch of trump apologists have decided to treat it like the gospel truth.</p>

<p>so because this fanfic had something in it about NK being &quot;owned&quot; by someone unexpected, OP made some spurious connections to try to make a theory on how it&#39;s the CIA</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure double meanings do exist, I just don&#39;t think that in this case there is any double meaning.  My question to you is why would a person who allegedly did all those things, and so secretly that pretty much nobody thinks he did any of those things, leave a big clue as to his relationship to the CIA in the title of his website?  That seems like a really stupid thing to do, a needless exposure of his activities.</p>

<p>The 38th Parallel has long been associated with the DMZ, going back waaay before this guy was even old enough to be involved in policy.  It&#39;s a number deeply associated with the DMZ and the Korean War.</p>

<p>Seriously, why do you think secret CIA deep state operations would leave clues about their origins in the name of the website?  Wouldn&#39;t it be smarter, more secretive and simply better all around if they didn&#39;t do that?</p>

<p>I figured that&#39;s all you had to offer.  They were able to secretly give NK nuclear weapons but were so incompetent that they left a reference to the CIA in the name.  Right...</p>

<p>BI Corp is not owned by the CIA, it&#39;s initials don&#39;t even spell CIA, and it&#39;s only known affiliation with the CIA is that it provided NOC to several CIA agents back in the 50&#39;s.  NOC, or Non-Official Cover is a standard procedure that the CIA uses to infiltrate agents into foreign countries.  It&#39;s called Non-Official Cover because the businesses chosen have no affiliation with the government or the CIA, if anyone at the companies is made aware of the agents, it is typically only at the very top of the company hierarchy.  The purpose of choosing businesses that have no relationship to the CIA is to make it harder to find out that they are agents.  If the businesses were actually run by the CIA, it would defeat the purpose, since that affiliation wouldn&#39;t be anywhere near as difficult to discover. </p>

<p>So no, I don&#39;t buy your &quot;secrecy breeds incompetence&quot; idea.  One would expect evidence of that incompetence to exert itself across all the activities of that secret organization, not just in selecting the name.  </p>

<p>Do you think that Graduates of the Culinary Institute of America are members of the CIA?  Things can have the abbreviation CIA without it being the actual Central Intelligence Agency.  Finding the letters CIA in a name or the abbreviation of a name, does not constitute evidence of anything.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You assertions aren&#39;t evidence to the positive!  And your evidence relies upon the people starting these fronts being incompetent and extremely competent AT THE SAME TIME.  Aside from your assertion that they stupidly gave a clue to the origin of the business in the NAME of the business, what other evidence do you have to prove their Incompetence?  Why don&#39;t you address that I wonder? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>you&#39;re not contributing anything besides &quot;I disagree because I say so</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t prove a negative, as you should be aware.  For instance, did you know I have a rainbow colored Unicorn in my Garage?  I do, it&#39;s true.  And there&#39;s literally nothing you can say that would disprove it.  You saying &quot;He&#39;s in the CIA because I think the #38 refers to the CIA HQ instead of the obvious 38th Parallel reference&quot; is not a disprovable assertion.  You are asking me to do something nobody can do.</p>

<p>The only way to address such an assertion is via logic.  I have laid out exactly why the assertion is rather far fetched.</p>

<ol>
<li>The 38th Parallel is where the DMZ is located.</li>
<li>People who run the CIA don&#39;t put clues that operations or businesses are CIA fronts in the name.</li>
<li>You have asserted that these people are very competent, and incompetent at the same time which is illogical.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>But I can&#39;t disprove your assertion that it has a double meaning because if it doesn&#39;t have that double meaning there would by definition be no evidence, since nobody is gonna write down that a name definitely doesn&#39;t have a double meaning.</p>

<p>What do you want?  What could possibly dissuade you from the notion?  You have made up your mind.  Tell me what kind of evidence I would need to provide to prove that the name doesn&#39;t have a double meaning and I&#39;ll see what I can do.</p>

When someone purges spies, they are almost always majority State Department employees. Yet again, you keep going back to the name, which you still haven&#39;t provided any other argument other than &quot;it&#39;s dumb&quot;.

Glad you&#39;re trying to stir discussion but it is absolutely coming across as nit-picking over a tangential detail, which is only relevant in terms of abstract symbolism. If you&#39;re not familiar with the idea of displaying your hidden allegiances in plain sight, then I guess it explains why you&#39;re stuck at &quot;it is so blatant nobody would ever do it&quot;. There&#39;s an insane amount of blatant symbolism in the world, I mean let&#39;s take a tiny example - the Google Play Store logo is the <a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iur/?f=1&amp;amp;image_host=https%3A%2F%2Fs-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com%2F736x%2Fb4%2Fd5%2Fa6%2Fb4d5a69337e6dde5c47cae6fadd8bdb5.jpg&amp;amp;u=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/b4/d5/a6/b4d5a69337e6dde5c47cae6fadd8bdb5.jpg">Sigil of Lucifer</a>. Very obvious and blatant. But they aren&#39;t worried about that, since most people like you will just dismiss all of that as &quot;illogical speculation&quot; and &quot;mere coincidence&quot;. </p>

<p>Again, if you&#39;re going to make arguments on the level of &quot;no way they&#39;d do that, it&#39;s too obvious&quot;, then you&#39;re just falling into the pitfall of exactly why they make it that blatant in the first place. </p>

<p>I am pointing out how a wild, logically inconsistent assertion on your part makes your whole argument weaker.  I am certainly not mad.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not disputing that the North Korean threat has been exaggerated.  I agree with you on that.  I&#39;m attempting to point out to you that when you use a piece of spurious logic (38 refers to CIA HQ) it discredits your entire argument.</p>
