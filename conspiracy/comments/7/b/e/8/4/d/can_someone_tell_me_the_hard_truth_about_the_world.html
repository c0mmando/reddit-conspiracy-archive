<p>This works the same way with religion. Exactly the same way. It&#39;s the only way I have ever seen a Jehovahs Witness leave their religion. Small truths over time. Too much at once would have them get scared and in turn reinforce their  faith. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The world is designed to confuse, allure, and dissappoint.  This is Maya.  Happiness cannont be found in the world, only through discovering one&#39;s true inner Self.  Through the course of life we become exhausted by the world and naturally turn inward; our priorities shift. Our path becomes oriented towards the realization of our eternal, changeless, divisionless Being.  The &quot;reality&quot; of delusion is dispelled in the light of awakened Self.  The ego dies on its crucifix of time and space as the soul is liberated.  We are in a sense born into the new reality, call it what you like: Nirvana, the Kingdom Of God, Moksah, Salvation, Liberation, Self-Realization.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The general population does not know much about science, but the more educated you get on physics and the universe it becomes easier to paint the picture. If you look at the earth on a timeline, and what history we have about ancient civilizations there are many patterns that arise. The pyramids are what drove my curiosity over the years, and the timespan between their creation, location and history raise more questions about who we are as human beings as well as what caused civilization to change with our growth. </p>

<p>The history of the earth&#39;s geography/topography/weather helps in understanding where people flourished and what they did to survive and organize into a civilized structure. Religion is where things become hard to explain, it&#39;s a touchy subject and I thank my parents for leaving me a blank slate to make my own decisions. Patterns throughout the oldest religion / tribes tell basically the same story, that there was influence from an outside source whom came to earth to create man/woman. This is where religion and science collide and the understanding of DNA as well as the tales of many religious books helps to connect some dots. Personally I think that the Ancient Greeks had it as close to a digestible story line as the ~2500 year old human could understand. The destruction of the Alexandria library is probably the saddest thing that could&#39;ve happened.</p>

<p>The timeline is long, as humans have thrived and perished multiple times across the history of the earth. As civilization becomes more advanced humans become more intelligent with some seeking power over others, if not as many as they can. Whether or not there were hybrid god/humans among us in the past/present doesn&#39;t really matter, mankind as a whole has chosen to focus on other things/ been distracted completely from our mysterious origin. In this day and age the flow of information is vast, and it is hard to separate the fact from the fiction. What does seem abundantly clear to me at least, is that humans are easily manipulated as a populous and TPTB are just the family lines of some of the oldest/luckiest  ancient civilizations who have amassed such power that they are able to collude/blackmail any of the good guys into where we are today. The jump from year &quot;0&quot; to &quot;2017&quot; is crazy enough, but when you think about where we were 100 years ago it becomes even crazier. There are a lot of details that you can get lost in, especially the time table, but our advancement in technology is probably the most important thing to consider. Considering what the average Joe has the ability to do, the private sectors must have an unthinkable amount of information. </p>

<p>In a nutshell, I think that our solar system probably contains another star of some sorts, brown dwarf or whatever you wanna call it. Something that has the physics of which only a few people can understand. This star and its surrounding planets have the conditions possible to produce a life form that evolved far before humanoids. Given our current rate of population growth, the state of the economy and international affairs it is hard not to think that TPTB are merely buying time until the creators get back. The comet called C/2017 K2 PANSTARRS (K2) recently discovered by NASA sparked my interest into this theory and I understand that I provide pretty much zero evidence to support these claims. If such a thing was to actually happen then theres no telling what it&#39;ll be like on earth, volcanoes and pole shifts and comets, it would be a shit storm. I think thats the hard truth. Probably have to build some new pyramids, hit the reset button with the top of the genome and then hopefully no one is having to ask this question in another ~3400 years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone&#39;s world view is shaped by their culture. Culture is shaped by the decisions we make. The problem is a small group of bastards have usurped power (long ago) through coercion and force after the creation of human identity. They dictate and control. They build the narratives, the wars, the history, the world view... and most importantly the systems used to keep everything in place. Why? Simply to maintain their power and wealth while finding ways to increase it.</p>

<p>So how can people let this happen? How can no one wake up? Why aren&#39;t people blowing the whistle? The thing is... millions of people are already awake (or close to it) and blowing the whistle is very very dangerous for those in power though some have done it. Those who do blow the whistle see very little reward or change. But that&#39;s not enough. </p>

<p>The structure of our culture is built in such a way that the people simply cannot overthrow it. Every piece of the system has been built in such a way that it supports the overlords power while keeping the people as docile and brainwashed as possible in the process. One example is that nearly all societies today are built on a hierarchical framework. This is 100% key to keeping those people in power. </p>

<p>So, you may find someone who knows about false flags, psyops, coverups... all manners of conspiracy... which are often legit...  but you will have a MUCH harder time finding someone who understand the core framework of society is rigged. As long as we continue to yearn for power and wealth ourselves we will consciously and subconsciously accept what our overlords do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote this for another post, but the post was mysteriously deleted, so here:</p>

<p>The CIA is a subversive group. One of many government agencies that make up the deepstate. The deep state contains people that are on government payroll but often you and I could never prove that they are..  Contractors working civilian jobs and receiving government paychecks. </p>

<p>Since 9/11, nearly every single terror attack committed in America (and most in Europe) have actually been hoaxes perpetrated by the powers that be.  For example, the Boston bombing brothers were CIA assets working back and forth between America and Chechnya.  The CIA uses any means necessary to enact regime change in whichever country they choose, including the staging of hoax terror attacks.  The CIA knew exactly where the brothers were during the entire Boston bombing play.  That didn&#39;t stop them from entering peoples houses, forcing the owners out with their hands on their heads while the swat teams (((searched))) for the brothers. The brothers are both alive and in Chechnya.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s important to note that these events are very very real acts of terrorism. These events are special made to terrorize.  When people are terrified they are easier to control. They will be more willing to gobble up any comfortable narrative reported to them.  </p>

<p>Since 9/11 the Zionists/Freemasons/corporatists have lied about Muslim terrorism to terrorize us into paying for wars in the Middle East.  The list of these hoax attacks is so long I will not share the entire list as it would turn many people away before they even researched one.  It&#39;s common to hear, &quot;that&#39;s why I can&#39;t believe conspiracy theorists. They can&#39;t ALL be fake!&quot;</p>

<p>I am here to tell you that yes, they can all be fake. People do not go on random killing sprees of strangers for no reason.  Autistic kids to not kill random classrooms full of kids.  Millionaires do not randomly kill county music fans, Muslims do not blow themselves up for Isis. The demand for terrorists was much greater than the supply, so the CIA and legally protected media stepped in..  </p>

<p>Hoaxes = sandy hook, Boston bombing, pulse night club, Charlottesville, Barcelona, NYC etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could also have your friend start watching some of the following films, which I consider entry-level &quot;something&#39;s not right with the world&quot; content. They&#39;re easily digestible and aren&#39;t so shocking that &quot;normal&quot; folks are repulsed by the ideas/truth being explained. This is a short list to get you started.
*The Untold History of the United States by Oliver Stone
*The Corporation
*Confessions of an Economic Hitman
*Century of Enslavement: History of the Federal Reserve
*Talks/Debates given by Noam Chomsky - Chomsky isn&#39;t perfect, but he shines a light on a lot of the nonsense around the US engagement in war around the globe</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a good explanation of Fractional Reserve Banking out there, but I can&#39;t remember the name. I do recall being flabbergasted after watching it and thinking &quot;This is how they &#39;make&#39; money? What in the actual hell...&quot;. Maybe someone else remembers the name and will post it here.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
