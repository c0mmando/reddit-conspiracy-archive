<p>Couple questions for those who know. 
1. If Antarctica is a 200ft cliff then miles of ice until dome or shield, what’s beyond it?
2. Why educate people after the population knew it was flat to think we live on a sphere?
3. Are the powers at b afraid of what’s on the outside of the dome?
4. Will the public ever know the truth?</p>

<p>Plus the Antarctica treaty is the only treaty on earth that has yet to be broken. Also why aren’t other countries signed into it yet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes...he is. Neil pulled that argument out of his ass when people starting going out and doing the measurements for themselves and confronting TPTB about the results, as described in my links. The problem with it is that TPTB told us for decades, and still do most of the time,  exact dimensions for a sphere earth and even doctored up some &quot;photos&quot; of it, as seen <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CvkgL_NWAAENmFE.jpg">here</a>...notice the differences? They also fail to mention that even if the earth was an &quot;oblate spheroid&quot;, there would still be math to determine the rate of the curvature...of course I haven&#39;t seen any of them go and do those new calculations yet...probably because they know that people would just go out and, test their new math and prove again that the curvature is not present....</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="https://imgur.com/a/suwNz">these diagrams</a>. </p>

<p>On each picture, the top part represent the location of the observer next to a sphere where a red circle is drawn. The bottom part represents what the camera see.  The red zone would take a greater proportion of the disc on the first picture (when the camera is close) than on the last one (when the camera is far). The red area could represent the US on a globe.</p>

<p>So, I disagree. The ratio between the size of the continents and the size of the apparent disc would change. Just like the nose seems to take a bigger part of the face in the last picture than on the first one. </p>

<p>If something is unclear in my diagrams, please tell me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s just not how it works man... take any ball that you have in your house that has markings on it. Now hold it up close to your eye.

<p>What the NASA pictures are suggesting is that the globe shrank, or the NA continent got much bigger, because in both pictures the circumstance of the entirety is the same.</p>

<p>The ball is getting smaller. The markings are getting smaller. But not exactly at the same rate. </p>

<p>What about <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C00fv_dWEAIr8tS.jpg">these pictures</a> ? Are they also fake ?</p>

<p>I honestly didn&#39;t think that this was difficult to understand ...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is a single picture, that is simply zoomed out and rotated for dramatic effect. It doesn&#39;t demonstrate what it would look like if we were getting physically closer to earth. Zooming and getting closer are not the same thing. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Notice how everything is getting bigger and taking up more of the screen as it zoomed in?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, because it&#39;s simply zoomed. There is no difference in the distance at which the picture was taken. What I&#39;m saying is that when you change the distance, then the ratio will change.</p>

<p>Seriously, what was unclear in the diagrams that I provided ?</p>

<p>Yeah I have seen this image used as an example before. Its a trick. We simply know too little about these 3 different images to make a fair assessment.

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. I&#39;m really curious to see how far your denying of reality goes ...</p>

<p>First of all, I would like to point out that this has absolutely nothing to do with the actual shape of the Earth or the fact that NASA is faking its images. What I&#39;m trying to show you is a simple fact about what happens when you take pictures of a sphere from different distances. It&#39;s a simple geometric situation, and you can ask on <a href="/r/photography">/r/photography</a> if you want a simple answer from people that have no reason to lie to you. </p>

<p>So I just took three pictures from home, because I have a globe mini-bar. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/CyS6r">Here they are</a> </p>

<p>What are you going to say now ? That I own three different globes in my home ?</p>

<p>It&#39;s okay to be wrong sometimes, there is nothing to be ashamed of. The situation is slightly counter-intuitive at first sight. But if you actually do the experiment yourself, you&#39;ll see that I&#39;m not faking anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your photos clearly show that you are taking the shots from different points of view not just distance, using different lighting, and that you are using zoom... you manipulated the variables to try and get a different result..but you did it much worst than the first globe pictures showed...    </p>

<p>If you want to do a fair test. take a picture of the globe using the same zoom setting at all times, as well as maintaining the angle of the shot( degree plain from which you take the shots), and same constant light source, preferably one that you at no time block....and simply move your camera back in increments of whatever length you want.     </p>

<p>If you do this you will see that the globe and its continents get smaller, taking up less and less space of the frame and keeping their ratio...as they should,  because they are the same object.       </p>

<p>Again, what the NASA &quot;photos&quot; show is that the circumference of the globe shrank independently from NA continent, or that the NA Continent grew independently from the globe. Their photos imply that they are taken from the same distance because the circumference of the 2002 and 2012 globes are equal. </p>

<p>Did I take three pictures of the same globe ? Do the ratio between the size of the note and the size of the globe change ?</p>

<p>Of course I manipulated the variables. But I didn&#39;t manipulate the globe, and I didn&#39;t CGI my pictures ! I&#39;m telling you that you can take two real pictures of the SAME real sphere and have the impression that the US is taking more space in one picture than in the other.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Okay. Let&#39;s do this !</p>

<p>I took the same zoom setting on the camera. I put the camera on a small chair to be sure that I am always at the same height. I maintained the angle of the shot to the best of my effort. Same constant light source and I didn&#39;t block it. I took four shots moving the camera back away from the globe.</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/6zE22">Here are the pictures</a></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So what do we notice ? Both the globe and the note are getting smaller. Yes, we already agreed on that ! </p>

<p>What about the ratio ? Let&#39;s measure the size of the globe and the size of the note on each picture. If the ratio stays the same then I was wrong. If the ratio are different then you were wrong.  Does that seem fair ?</p>

<ul>
<li>On the first picture, the globe is approximatively 3000 pixels wide, and the note is 1500 pixels wide. ratio = 2<br/></li>
<li>On the second picture, the globe is approximatively 1400 pixels wide, and the note is 560 pixels wide. ratio = 2.5<br/></li>
<li>On the third picture, the globe is approximatively 560 pixels wide, and the note is 200 pixels wide. ratio = 2.8<br/></li>
<li>On the last picture, the globe is approximatively 360 pixels wide and the note is 120 pixels wide. So the ratio is 3</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not the same ratio. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>But the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/CyS6r">first three pictures</a> that I showed had similar circumferences ...</p>

<p>So, when I&#39;m showing three pictures of a globe in my house with equal circumference, you seem to infer that the three pictures are taken from different distances and with a different zoom/lighting/settings. But when it comes to NASA&#39;s pictures showing the exact same phenomenon, then you don&#39;t understand that it could be caused by the same thing ? That&#39;s some heavy cognitive dissonance ...</p>

<p>so not equal? and honestly...&quot;similar&quot; is even a stretching it...     </p>

<p>This round of pictures is far more fair...not perfect, but it shows pretty much what I have been describing. Your angles are slightly off. You are using a pink piece of paper, which is indentation of the globe, instead of using the fixed images on the globe to take your measurements. (if you maintained variables, ratio would remain the same as well...it has to because nothing is changing in physical reality)     </p>

<p>But again, this round of photos is illustrating my argument well enough for most people to understand what I am getting at.      </p>

<p>How dishonest are you ?</p>

<p>The apparent diameter of the Globe in the first picture and the last picture have a difference of less than 2%. That&#39;s not equal, but I would say that the difference is sufficiently small to be able to say &quot;similar&quot;. </p>

<p>If I changed just very slightly the distance or the zoom, I would be able to get exactly the same circumference.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I was expecting this ...</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/6eh9Z">Here</a> are three new pictures without the note. I centered things on Africa because it&#39;s slightly easier to see and measure. Same phenomenon the ratio between the apparent diameter of the globe and the apparent width of Africa changes from 1.34 to 1.75.</p>

<p>What new excuse will you find now ? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(if you maintained variables, ratio would remain the same as well...it has to because nothing is changing in physical reality)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I explained to you why it&#39;s not the case. The part of the sphere that is directly in front of you is closer from your eye than the part that you see close to the edge. When you are far away from the sphere, this is not really affecting the relative apparent sizes, when you are close to the sphere it is affecting the relative apparent size in a more dramatic way.</p>

<p>Numerical application :</p>

<p>If you are 100m away from the center of a 1m radius sphere. Then the part that is directly facing you is 99m away from you and the part that is close to the edge is almost 100m away from you. Ratio of distances very close to 1. </p>

<p>Now if you are just 2m away from the center, the part that is directly facing you is 1m away from you and the part that is close to the edge is almost 2m away from you. Ratio of distances very close to 2.</p>

<p>Now my turn. Show me two pictures of the same sphere (a ball or whatever) with a marking on it, taken from two different distances (one from very close, and one from far enough). And show me that the ratio would remain the same. </p>

<p>First remark, you didn&#39;t even double the distance between the first picture (3&quot;) and the last one (5&quot;). I multiplied the distance by 24 in my example (between 25cm and 3m). So of course, if you are changing the distance by a smaller amount, you will have less variation.</p>

<p>If I find that the ratio between the size of the &quot;chukit!&quot; marking and the apparent diameter of the ball is changing between the three photos, would it satisfy you ? How much change in the ratio would be significant ?</p>

<p>That&#39;s true, but it really shouldn&#39;t matter as long as the variables are constant, and my variables were much more constant than yours. And i feel that the differences in the 3 equally spaced positions is apparent enough to notice with the naked eye. And honestly, I would have taken some more at greater/shorter distances but I just ran out of room with my setup. It would have been short of the 6&quot; mark and I wanted to keep distance increments constant. And I didn&#39;t want to do one any closer than 3 because it would have been so close to the camera that the ball/stand wouldn&#39;t have fit into the frame.        </p>

<p>Well, i didn&#39;t measure them myself. I thought I would give you the pleasure :)   </p>

<p>I mean...as long as you are measuring the same thing in each picture.... As I wrote in the photo description, the yogurt container is pretty sharp and has a curved face as well. So see what you get at multiple points. Like For the ball I would measure the width and or height of the exclamation point decimal and the space between the open end of the capital C....and on the yogurt container...say the distance between the top points of the y, the diameter of the O, and maybe the distance between either ends of those indentations at the top of the container. Just keep the point A to point B measurement constant for each picture...just keep it fair. ;)</p>

<p>And honestly man, I would just be happy if you would acknowledge that the differences in the earth photos from NASA are just too great to simply be a matter of perspective. Not necessarily the colors, because that could be adequately explained easy enough, but the glaring difference in size of the NA continent without the same glaring difference in size of the sphere.    </p>

<p>Anyways, lemme know what you did and what you found and then I will give it a look. o/    </p>

<p>Is it ok if I take an horizontal line just below the &quot;yoplait&quot; text and measure the distance between the lower left point of the Y and the lower right point of the t in &quot;Yoplait&quot; and compare it to the diameter of the yogurt taken on that same horizontal line ?</p>

<p>I used a ruler on my screen. I tried to be as precise as possible, so I don&#39;t think that my measurements are off by more than 1mm. But I will be generous and give 2mm of margin in my measurements and report it in the computations. Here is what I found :</p>

<ul>
<li>First picture : Yogurt = 29.9cm ±2cm, Yoplait = 17.6cm±2cm, Ratio = 1.699 ±0.031<br/></li>
<li>Second picture : Yougurt = 26.4cm, Yoplait = 14.7cm, Ratio = 1.796 ± 0.032<br/></li>
<li>Last picture : Yogurt=23.1cm, Yoplait = 12.6cm, Ratio = 1.833 ± 0.044<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>A significant change in the ratio. Much higher than the potential errors that I made in the measurements.</p>

<p>So either you didn&#39;t control for some &quot;variables&quot; or the ratio did indeed change.</p>

<p>Not sure if following the grid-lines and eyeballing it is gonna be good enough, as the grid lines are constant throughout all the pictures(23x41) and the images will be in different grids in each picture.

<p>Your math seems correct (I only checked the first and last picture for the horizontal measurements). However, I took the &quot;yoplait&quot; sign for a reason . It&#39;s quite close from the middle of the screen, and hence the distance between the yoplait sign and the camera is as small as possible in the first shot. That&#39;s also why I asked for the 2&quot; shot. The effect is much more pronounced at small distances (typically distances that are smaller than the radius of the sphere/cylinder)</p>

<p>But do we at least agree that the ratio did change between the 2&quot; shot and the 5&quot; shot ?</p>

<p>I think it may have something to do with the camera lens focusing at that close of a distance. But yeah, definitely a noticeable change.     </p>

<p>I will do some measurements on the yoplait as well. I just completely spaced it cuz I was tired.     </p>

<p>I am also going to do another round of shots just so I can see how much of a variation we can get at distances similar to your pics. I got to dig out an ~ 6 foot folding table and rig up a center line, but I should be able to get a good amount of shots with a larger scale of distances.     </p>

<p>I think simple lack of precision <strong>could</strong> explain for some of the variation in measurements in my shots, so I just wanna be thorough. Basically, I wanna see if the ratio is kept approximately at 1.85 as distance continues to increase.      </p>

<p>This will take a bit more time.       </p>

<p>Good idea. </p>

<p>If I may give you some advice, try to use the biggest possible ball you have at your disposal (to avoid focusing effects). A basketball would be a good idea for example. And the closest pictures are the most important one. So start your shots at the closest possible distance (that allows you to see the entire diameter of the ball)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s fair. You should do other tests.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically, I wanna see if the ratio is kept approximately at 1.85 as distance continues to increase.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is not really going to work very well in your setting.</p>

<p>Geometry tells us that as you keep increasing the distance, the ratio will converge to a given value, which will be the actual physical ratio of distances measured directly on the sphere. (This is a simple geometric situation, I will try to show you some diagrams if I have time). So at some point, the variations will be much smaller than the possible errors. The distance at which the variations become too small to be noticeable depends on the dimensions of the sphere. </p>

<p>A rough estimation tells me that when the camera is at a distances of more than 10 times the radius of the ball, then the variations are almost negligeable. </p>

<p>What you need to do to change the ratio in a more drastic way is to decrease the distance a litlle bit. It will not be easy in your initial setting. So as I said, you should take a bigger ball, and take a shot from the closest distance you can. And then decrease the distance step by step. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So what did you think of the ratio change difference in the 2 NASA photos? Something has got to be screwy there don&#39;t you think?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I can do the computations. The width of the US (taken from South California to North FLorida, as in your picture) is roughly 3300km. The Earth diameter is allegedly 6400km.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s do a little bit of geometry shall we ? </p>

<p>If a camera is located at a distance of H above the ground, then the apparent diameter of the Earth will be given by D (H) = 2* arcsin(6400/(6400+H)). </p>

<p>The apparent diameter of the US is given approximatively by d(H)= 2<em>arctan(3300/(2</em>H)).  (If you know a little bit of trigonometry, this is not complicated. )</p>

<p>Is it possible for the ratio of apparent diameters to go from 1.9 to 3.4 ? Well, we just have to plot the function  D(H)/d(H) and see if it can take these values. I found that for H = 5000km, the value is close to 1.9 and for H = 45000km the value is close to 3.4.</p>

<p>Which means that theoretically, if you took a picture of Earth from an altitude of 5000km the ratio would correspond to the 2012 pictures. And if you took a picture from an altitude of 45000km, the ratio would correspond to the 2002 pictures. So according to math, the difference in the pictures are perfectly reasonable. </p>

<p>In that first diagram, Can the theoretical observer see the &quot;entire&quot; diameter of the globe ? No. </p>

<p>He can only see the part of the globe that is visible to him.

<p>Because the line from A to B is not at the same distance from the camera than the outer circle of the globe. Just to be sure that we agree on something  : Zooming is not equivalent as getting closer. Any photographer can tell you that ...</p>

<p>Very approximate numerical application.  </p>

<p>Setting 1 : The Camera is 10000km from the center of the Earth, just above the middle point of the line AB. Then the camera is at 3600 km from the surface of the Earth. Correct ?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that in this setting the apparent size of Earth is E and the apparent size of the line AB is L. </p>

<p>Setting 2 : The camera is now at 20000km from the center of the globe, same zoom as setting 1. The globe appears 2 times smaller on the picture, right ? So the apparent size of the Earth is now E/2</p>

<p>But now it is also 13600km from the surface of the Earth.  So while the distance to the center of the Earth was multiplied by 2, the distance to the surface was multiplied by 3.77. So the apparent size of the line AB is L/3.77. </p>

<p>Setting 3 . Camera at 20000km but with a 2x zoom. The Earth has now an apparent size of (E/2)x2 = E. The same apparent size as in setting 1. The line has now an apparent size of (L/3.77)x2 = 1.88xL</p>

<p>Hence between setting 1 and setting 3, the Earth looks the same size, the line AB does not. I don&#39;t know how to make it  simpler.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, in the theoretical computations, the line AB has a much smaller size on the picture with setting 3 than on the picture with setting 1. </p>

<p>So Setting 1 would give a photo like the 2012 one and Setting 3 would give a photo like to the 2002 one.</p>

<p>(Note that the simple settings that I chose to illustrate my computations are not the settings required to obtain NASA photos. The actual settings would be Setting 1 : 11687km from the center of the Earth, no zoom. Setting 2 : 80562km, zoom 7.28x, as described <a href="https://imgur.com/a/qp6CQ">here</a> )</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok lemme see If I got this straight.....     </p>

<p>You are saying that the <a href="https://imgur.com/Esa57jB">2012 photo</a> was taken with no zoom, and taken from a distance great enough to capture the entire circumference of the globe in the frame.      </p>

<p>And you are also saying that the 2002 photo was taken at a much greater distance than that of the 2012 photo, and that the camera was zoomed in great enough to make the circumference of the globe in the 2002 photo match that of the circumference of the globe in the 2012 photo.      </p>

<p>And you are also saying that the same zoom used in the 2002 photo did not increase the size of the NA continent in the 2002 photo to match that of the NA continent in the 2012 photo, because the NA continent is at a lesser distance from the camera than the circumference of the globe is from the camera.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, I would like to note that I&#39;m not claiming anything about the reality of the actual pictures (I cannot prove in any way that these pictures are &quot;real&quot;, and they probably aren&#39;t). I&#39;m saying that the settings for a theoretical globe Earth would produce pictures similar to the ones released by NASA. </p>

<p>That being said, I will answer your questions precisely.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes. </p>

<p>Yes. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Your sentence is slightly ambiguous and I&#39;m not exactly sure that you got it right. So let me reformulate and precise your sentence a little bit, and you can tell me if that was what you meant. </p>

<p>The zoom used in the 2002 photo did not increase the size of the NA continent in the 2002 photo <strong>enough</strong> to match that of the NA continent in the 2012 photo. The reason is that between the 2002 location and the 2012 location, the distance to the NA continent was multiplied by a bigger amount than the distance to the circumference of the globe, because the the NA continent is at a lesser distance from the camera than the circumference of the globe is from the camera.</p>

<p>To be more precise, if a 7.2X zoom was used on the 2002 photo, then the size of the circumference was multiplied by 7.2 and the size of the NA continent was also multiplied by 7.2 (that&#39;s what a zoom does).  However, between the 2012 location and the 2002 location, the distance to the NA continent was multiplied by 13 and not by 7.2. So a 13X zoom would have been necessary to increase the size of the NA continent in the 2002 photo to match that of the 2012 photo. </p>

<p>Is that what you meant ?</p>

<p>Yes, but if you multiply the size of the circumference by 13 on the 2002 photo, then the size of the circumference in the 2002 photo would not match the size of the circumference in the 2012 photo.</p>

<p>Let me reformulate the same argument once again in yet another way :</p>

<p>Zooming increase the size of everything in a picture by a common ratio (7.2 for example). We seem to agree on that, and that&#39;s good. </p>

<p>Getting further decreases the size of everything in a picture by a ratio <strong>depending on the initial distance between the camera and the object</strong>. The initial distance between the camera and the NA continent is not the same as the initial distance between the camera and the circumference, so the ratios are different for NA and for the circumference. In my exemple, it is 13 for the NA continent and 7.2 for the circumference. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>When the camera got from the 2012 to the 2002 location, the distance from the camera to the circumference was multiplied by 7.2. So the size of the circumference on the two pictures do match thanks to the 7.2x zoom that was used on the 2002 picture. </p>

<p>However, the distance from the camera to the NA continent was multiplied by 13. If a 13x zoom had been used from the same location, the size of the NA continent would match, but the size of the circumference would not match anymore. </p>

<p>so if the 2002 camera was at the same distance as the 2012 camera, and didn&#39;t use zoom, the photos would be identical...          </p>

<p>That&#39;s like telling me that you could take a picture of some guys head and face at distance x, then move back to distance y, use zoom to make the size of the guys head identical in both photos, but the dudes eyes and mouth are way smaller compared to his head in photo y? Do you actually think this happens in reality? I mean unless you are right up on someone, and using a fish eye..that isn&#39;t going to happen...and I dare say that it will never happen to the degree in which we see in the 2002/2012 nasa &quot;photos&quot;...so i see no reason why it should happen in &quot;space&quot; when viewing the &quot;globe&quot; earth       </p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s the counter-intuitive part. </p>

<p>Yes. That&#39;s why the very first comment that I posted to answer you was <a href="https://bakerdh.wordpress.com/2012/05/05/face-distortion-is-not-due-to-lens-distortion/">this</a>. Remember ? </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The link above is clearly saying that the lens used are NOT fish-eye lenses. This is a photographer&#39;s blog, he has absolutely no reason to lie about this. It&#39;s his job to understand the effect of moving forward/backward and zooming. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>and I dare say that it will never happen to the degree in which we see in the 2002/2012 nasa &quot;photos&quot;...</p>

<p>Well, you can measure the size of his nose in the first and last picture. Tell me what you think.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But Honestly man...I think I&#39;m done going around in circles with you, at least on this point.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So after I demonstrated the effect in real life, with faces from a photographer&#39;s blog, with an actual globe in my home, with pictures that you took yourself, with a diagram, with precise mathematical computations, you still don&#39;t believe me ? You prefer to use your intuition instead a professional photographer&#39;s blog ? </p>

<p>Honestly, it seems to me that you are so afraid of admitting that you simply didn&#39;t know about this effect, that you will avoid looking at the problem in a neutral way, or perform the experiments that I told you (with a basketball and not a small 1&quot; ball).</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What I do in the rest of my life has absolutely no relation to the correctness of my arguments in this thread. </p>

<p>What you are doing is called an &quot;ad hominem&quot; attack. It&#39;s usually used when you cannot refute the arguments of your &quot;opponent&quot; ...  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>or you are just so deeply entrenched in the theoretical dogma, that you honestly believe that a math equation could make anything a physical, observable reality...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s dishonest of you to reduce my arguments to a theoretical math equation.</p>

<p>I started showing you the physical observable reality with a globe in my home. You believed that I didn&#39;t control the variables. I also gave you precise diagrams to explain the situation. You didn&#39;t understand the diagram. That&#39;s why I used math. I genuinely thought that you were intelligent enough to understand the simple maths that I used. </p>

<p>I was wrong obviously.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regardless...its been an experience talking with you. Take care.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the same. But I really thought you were capable to understand this ... otherwise I would not have wasted so much time on this. </p>

<p>Last advice : Ask a professional photographer.</p>

<p>I gave you possible settings where the only changes are the distance and the zoom. I don&#39;t claim that these were the actual settings. I don&#39;t claim that NASA didn&#39;t use different lens, and once again it does not prove that the NASA picture are fake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That shadow you see on the moon in this picture and what you saw today is NOT caused by the earth. That shadow is caused by the sun only. During all LUNAR eclipses the moon is 100% FULL. While the sun is DIRECTLY behind the earth it casts a shadow on the moon.

If what admiral Byrd said is true there might be volcanic activity to justify such claims to keep areas some what habitable. Weird shit could be true. Earth is not flat tho, it’s more oval like a cosmic egg.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You wrote that what appears to our eyes as objects dipping below the horizon is really the &quot;vanishing point&quot;. That doesn&#39;t make sense. There&#39;s no reason why the top of an object should still be visible when the bottom is not; they&#39;re the same distance from the viewer.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if ships on the horizon disappear because of the limitations of optics and not because of the curvature of the earth, then we can make a simple prediction: if there are two observers watching a distant ship, then the more-distant observer should always see the ship disappear first. So, for example, if you had one observer on the shore, and the other observer on the rooftop of a hotel by the shore, then the rooftop observer should see the ship disappear first. On a globe earth, we would make the opposite prediction: the observer at lower elevation, even though they&#39;re closer to the ship, will see it disappear below the horizon before the observer at high elevation. And that&#39;s exactly what happens.</p>

<p>I know from reading your linked threads that flat earth is an idea that you cling to pretty hard, but these things I&#39;ve written are true. I hope you&#39;re still able to challenge your own convictions enough to recognize that your theory has some major holes.</p>

<p>Not necessarily...     </p>

<p>If the two people in question are at the same elevation, then the more distant viewer will always lose sight first...i mean, assuming their vision/optics/field of view are equal.     </p>

<p>But you also have to consider the advantages/disadvantages of a birdseye/wormseye view...</p>

<p>As elevation increases so does your field of view, and as your elevation decreases, so does your field of view. We live in 3d space.      </p>

<p>Its also important to remember that the horizon will raise to the height of the viewer, regardless of the elevation....that fact alone proves that their is no curvature.       </p>

<p>IDK if you read the part already, but I included a rather simple experiment that pretty much anyone can do, that proves that their is no curvature....in case you are interested. </p>

<p>I would like to point out that you can actually see the horizon getting lower as the balloon is getting higher, <strong>in the video you provided</strong>.</p>

<p>An explicit example : Just watch closely the horizon between 4:14 and 4:52. You can put a mark on your screen (or your mouse, or a ruler) if you want, and see that between 4:14 and 4:33, the camera is pretty stable and the horizon always stays above a certain point. At 4:33 there is a small edit in the video to skip to a point where the balloon is higher. And then from 4:34 to 4:52, the camera is still quite stable and the horizon is always 3mm below the mark.</p>

<p>This seems to be in complete contradiction with what you said. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>do you honestly believe you would still have a flat 360 degree horizon at 100k feet at eye level?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I honestly can do the computation to see where the horizon should be compared to eye-level. And then I can honestly measure the video you provided to see if it fits. </p>

<p>If you are at 100k feet above a 3959 miles sphere, then the horizon is at a distance of 387 miles. So the angle at which I should look down is arcsin(200k feet / 3959 miles) = 5.6° (do a diagram if you need)</p>

<p>The typical wide-angle camera has a vertical Field of View of roughly 50°. (I don&#39;t have the specifics for the camera used in this footage, so I&#39;m using a relatively neutral value). If the eye-level is in the middle of the shot, then 5.6° below is roughly 10% of the total height below the center of the shot. </p>

<p>I actually measured with a ruler the video. The height of the video on my screen is 13.3cm, so the center is at 6.66cm. Theoretically, the horizon should be 1.33cm below the 6.65cm mark. Which is around 5.33 cm from the bottom of the screen. </p>

<p>Between 4:35 and 4:50 (it&#39;s almost at its highest point and the camera is stable), the horizon appears between 5.2 and 5.5 cm from the bottom. Honestly, it&#39;s almost too good to be true, I didn&#39;t expect it to fit so well. </p>

<p>Put another way: you said objects disappear on the horizon because optics are limited by distance. You referred to the vanishing point.

<p>Correct...again, because I assumed people understood that a birds eye /worms eye (elevation) view changed ones perspective, and hence, changed ones vanishing point.     </p>

<p>It is the factor, but two people at different elevations have different points of perspective, and a different vanishing point. We live in 3D...so there are 3 dimensions to consider when determining the vanishing point...    </p>

<p>You&#39;re using terms like &quot;points of perspective&quot; and &quot;vanishing point&quot;, and I think this is obscuring a very simple concept: if objects disappear due to our visual limitations over distance, then a more distant observer should not see an object that is too far for a nearer observer.

A round earth does not preclude the existence of a supreme being. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve made my case, you have made yours. If you are correct you should be able to get the opposite results from the experiment as so many others have got. if you are so confident, then go do the experiment for yourself. Just keep it an honest and objective experiment and I have no doubt that you will get the results that you would expect if the earth was &quot;flat&quot; (not a globe).      </p>

<p>Reread what i wrote about the experiment.     </p>

<p>And for the record, MANY people have done and recorded said experiment on land and sea...all those who kept the experiment fair proved there was no curvature...but there are many who use cheats to get the results that they want and they are quite easy to spot, as they usually have wildly different result because they cheat in a multitude of ways.     </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I get that...and even though i will offer people videos showing fair experiments I always tell them to go do it for themselves because if you control the experiment, you know or should know, if its kept objective...so there is no doubt left in your mind.    </p>

Flat Earth truth seekers tend to be like that while explaining, while those questioning are always mocking uncontrollably. I&#39;m not a flat earther persay, but I do believe we are not taught the truth and my mind is open to all of the possibilities...not just in the shape of the earth. Cheers and Godspeed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some musings about flat earthism.
In a flat earth model, when asteroids hit earth, where do they come from? How do they get through the &quot;firmament&quot; If they can go through it, why can&#39;t rockets or spaceships or satellites?</p>

<p>In a flat earth, what is at the &quot;edge&quot; of the world? What woudl you see if you were there? Why aren&#39;t there photographs?</p>

<p>Pursuant to the previous question, If there <em>were</em> such photographs under what pretenses would flat earthers expect anyone to believe them, when flat earthers flatly reject all of the numerous videos and photos of earth taken from space?</p>

<p>How can flat earthers explain the travel distance of flights that take place at the far ends of the south pole? (Only response I have ever seen is that there are no intercontinental flights that far south, which was proven totally false.)</p>

<p>To any flat earthers, who wish to respond, please ignore for a moment that you <em>believe</em> we can&#39;t go to space and there is no space flight and answer, if you were taken there by some means and could see, with your own eyes from space, that the earth was in fact round, would you believe it, and accept it? If so, please express what sort of personal beliefs (besides flat earthism) that this would impact for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that’s there space, space travel, infinite universe and etc. I not saying I believe flat earth is real but it’s pretty convincing. Think about this besides the guided tours of Antarctica why can’t we simply go there ourselves and explore? Why do we need permission from several different countries to go there? Regardless of flat earth or sphere model the Antarctica continent plays a big role regardless. </p>

<p>ok, I took some measurements...think they are pretty close...within a few pixels anyways. I have no idea how to calculate margin for error, so I&#39;ll let you do that. Check my math too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your math seems correct (I only checked the first and last picture for the horizontal measurements). However, I took the &quot;yoplait&quot; sign for a reason . It&#39;s quite close from the middle of the screen, and hence the distance between the yoplait sign and the camera is as small as possible in the first shot. That&#39;s also why I asked for the 2&quot; shot. The effect is much more pronounced at small distances (typically distances that are smaller than the radius of the sphere/cylinder)</p>

<p>But do we at least agree that the ratio did change between the 2&quot; shot and the 5&quot; shot ?</p>
