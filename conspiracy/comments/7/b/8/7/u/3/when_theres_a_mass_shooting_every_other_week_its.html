       I guess you are missing my point . The point is they never talk about gun laws does the NRA run the Republican party?

       57 comments in 1 hour lol wow. I'm not saying I'm for gun control but has no one else noticed it's never a good time for gun laws because it's " too soon " after a terror attack and when we have these attacks every couple weeks it will never be a time for that talk because it will always be too soon because there's always shootings

       I'm Canadian, I couldn't tell you how to get a gun. I did once have someone tell me he could get me one, but also I was smoking outside of a bar and chatting with a street musician, and let me tell you I racked my soul over whether to report him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess you can take that example as "typical lib doesn't know where to buy anything except fancy cheese and avocados" or whatever but I quite honestly have no idea where you would purchase a gun. And it's not like we can't have longarms, I shot BB rifles all the time at camp, I'm even a decent shot. The whole culture behind guns is just markedly different here.

       18 more people. My point was that there will still continue to be attacks, gun regulation or not. Itâ€™s not the problem. But while weâ€™re having some fun with numbers, 60 more people were killed by a truck in France than people killed in Texas and 28 more people than Vegas.

       Could've been more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the ease of access argument may be true in your typical kinda "heated argument gone bad and someone goes for a gun" situation (which probably does account for most gun deaths); but with these mass shootings, it's hard to imagine these guys who are willing to plan it all out wouldn't go through the little extra effort to get a gun off the black market/make one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, at this point if you have a 3D printer, you can have an illegal gun.   If you have a YouTube connection and some power tools, you can probably make a gun from a diy video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hypothetically, if we could banish all guns from existence, I'd say let's do it.  But if we can't, we need to be able to defend ourselves from others with guns.

       Dude, you (and every other citizen) are hugely out gunned by a long shot. Your puny little hand guns and a few rifles aren't going to ptotect you from the government. If/when they want you either disarmed or dead then you
       <strong>
        will
       </strong>
       be taken out. You have nothing to say about it. If you want to have a "John Wayne" play time, fine, but the reality is that the government has the most, and best, guns. To directly answer your question: It would be the same.

       It's tired because dimwits continue to think that they have way more power then they actually have. The people are
       <em>
        afraid
       </em>
       of the government which defines tyranny. These dimwits need to understand that they can beat there chests and talk tough all they want. But at the end of the day they are
       <strong>
        powerless
       </strong>
       .

       Not exactly. I see the government for what they are and what they are capable of. I see their motives and methods. You are implying that I am being defeatist. Far from it. The trick to surviving in this world is
       <em>
        education
       </em>
       and I am
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       referring to the lame government "education (read: indoctrination) system". I refer to personal learning that aids survival. Recognizing the problem is the first step to survive the system.

       LOL what an awful point. That is because there aren't enough people outraged. The plan is to disarm us before everyone is aware so that a peaceful agreement is unattainable. once that happens and we no longer have guns we will have no way to truly rebel.

       So it isn't like people are trying to strip you of your rights. It just fuckin blows that this keeps happening over and over and over again. I know it's probably fun to shoot an AR 15 in the woods, but people keep using them to mass murder people. If y'all are gonna keep fighting any new regulations, it would be nice to see you come up with some other answers to this. Whether it's more funding for mental health or whatever.  It would just be cool at least try something. Because this shit blows.

       I think that depends on exactly what the gun control is. Obviously most peoole aren't for banning them all together. But things like bump stocks, and other regulations, most people would be cool with those.

       Ok how's this.   Natural law,  the only one that matters,  says you have a right to defend yourself and your family.   "But just use a shotgun" like old pedo Joe says.   Yeah maybe,  butt wouldn't you want to give yourself the best opportunity to survive?   So fine bursts through your back door at 3 am, who is better prepared for a gun fight?   You,  being woke from a dead sleep putt someone who has been waiting for the right opportunity?  You don't want it to be a fair fight,  you want to win, so you want to use overwhelming force

       Yeah, except the First Amendment has repeatedly been interpreted in a way that doesn't protect things like incitement, criminal threats, or defamation. So as of right now, it doesn't protect those things

       No you are misunderstanding the constitution, these things were meant to never be infringed as it's someone's personal right to say as they wish in a truly free country. But because "as of right now" you and many others have been "brainwashed" for a lack of better terms to believe that it isn't the case. In what free society would be saying "I want to kill you" be a crime? just because you find something offensive doesn't mean you can take someone's freedoms away.

      <blockquote>

        Individual rights should only be guaranteed to the degree that they don't infringe on the rights of other individuals.

      <p>
       This is the same sentiment as the popular phrase "your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins."

      <p>
       Depending on context, that might not be considered a crime. But saying "I am going to kill you" absolutely is a crime, as it should be in any civilized society

       The Judicial Branch was literally created to interpret laws. Whether or not you think that they do a good job these days is your opinion, but when you say "the constitution is the constitution and shall NOT be infringedv," that just means that you don't think the Judicial Branch has a purpose. Which is strange, because the Constitution literally created it.

       We talk about gun control non stop. Just go ahead and talk about it. The passive aggressive "Why is it always too soon to talk about gun control" thing is almost enough to make me not want to talk about it. Is that the point? Are you trying to create the dysfunctional situation you are bemoaning?

       Most "mass shootings" are fucking gang related, stemming from the war on drugs. Most shootings in general are done with handguns. Im more likely to die in a car accident every day than I am of ever being shot.

       Legalize and regulate drugs. That would stop a majority of the "mass shootings" in the US. Its not the legal gun owners doing 99% of the gun crime. Its CRIMINALS that dont give a fuck about laws. Eliminate the black market and the criminals that thrive from it will disappear.

       To say there is no violence in other nations is absurd. The Nice France truck attack is still higher numbers than the vegas shooting. When people want to hurt people, nothing will stop them.

       I don't accept violence at all, perpetrated with a gun or perpetrated with a truck.  It'd be nice to work to erduce it as much as possible to the point where it doesn't happen every fucking day, rather than train yourself and our kids to accept it.

       You keep ascribing to be positions I don't advocate, so I don't think I need to keep this going.  I never said I want utopia, and I was careful not to.  I said "as much as possible", which is a lot less violence than we have now.  But, you hear what you want to hear.

       But, the bottom line is we disagree.  You're not going to convince me that our level of gun violence or violence in general is acceptable or necessary, and I'm not going to change your mind either.

       Violent crime rates are down across the board. Crime rates in general have gone down a ton in my lifetime alone. Stopping the one in a million event isnt something you can do through laws. Laws are reactionary, its how the system works. Cant charge someone with a crime they havent committed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the people I argue with around reddit are 100% no guns for anyone but cops. How would you propose rounding up all the guns? 320000000 people, 119000000 homes, 235000000 cars, in 3.8 million square miles. Thats a big search, especially if we only have the 1100000 police officers in the country to do the search.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets ignore just how absurd the cost would be for that, and say you managed to round up literally every gun in the country. Hooray. You forget how open our border is. There is an unending stream of smugglers going in and out. We search less than 5% of vehicular traffic across the mexican border, even less from canada. There would be truckloads of guns bound for the US before the ink was dry on the order to take all the guns. Now we have a population of sitting ducks and armed criminals.

       Well, we do have nukes now.  And you'll notice on the world stage, any country that doesn't have nukes get bullied and abused.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did we attack Afghanistan for harboring Osama bin laden but left Pakistan alone when we literally found him chilling in a fortress there?  Nukes.  Why do Russia and Israel get to do whatever they want to the lands surrounding them?  Nukes.  Which countries can America not bully into submission?  The ones with/trying to get nukes.
