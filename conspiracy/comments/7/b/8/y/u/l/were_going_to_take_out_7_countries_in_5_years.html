    <div class="md"><p>The Middle East is the home of Islamic civilization and divided into three major fractions, which have great historical pasts:</p>

<ul>
<li>osman and it’s successor turkey </li>
<li>Persian aka Iran </li>
<li>Arabic aka Saudi Arabia and UAE</li>
</ul>

<p>So all of them dream of reviving the lost empires.</p>

<p>This three regional powers are involved in the Syrian civil war and Iran and Saudi Arabia are fighting a proxy war in Yemen. Lebanon is an Ally for Iran and common enemy of Israel (think of Hezbollah) and Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>In a global scale we have as major powers Russia and USA on different sides, so this is going to be a very interesting and ugly escalation, which will shape the geopolitical landscape.</p>

<p>I’m personally more focused on the geopolitical landscape, but you guys may have an idea that’s happening behind the scenes. I’m curious to hear your take on the situation.</p>

<p>You’re not even close. Are these three from memory or did you read an article, post or book that categorizes it this way?</p>

<p>What we call the Middle East today is made up from so many warring tribes, attempting to say the power is being pushed between 3 major factions is what got us into this mess after WW2.</p>

<p>You have families and blood line issues, you have Sunni and Shi’a. Don’t forget the Kurds,  Turks or Armenians.</p>

<p>There are so many major factions there, all they need is a Big Brother country to provide arms and military type materiel and they will massacre their opposing groups.</p>

<p>Of course, you divided these groups into smaller ones, but all these smaller groups can be allocated to the major groups and will feel like they belong due to common history, shared customs and similar language.</p>

<p>Just labeling millions of people from Egypt to Yemen, basically all of these regions as Arabic, Persian or Ottoman/Osman/Turks is not only culturally inaccurate but also insensitive.</p>
