       According to the Lebanese constitution, Saad Hariri is still in charge, despite his "resignation" from Saudi Arabia. That is, until a successor is named. He informed of his resignation the President Aoun by telephone, but didn't provide a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       The president Aoun is reportedly not accepting the resignation, as he is waiting for Hariri to tell him in person when he comes back.
      </p>
      <p>
       The head of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah (leader of the coalition opposed to his party) has defended Hariri, saying he was victim of Saudi interference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saad Hariri is bi-national Saudi/Lebanese, so he doesn't enjoy diplomatic immunity in Saudi Arabia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Meyssan">
        Thierry Meyssan
       </a>
       is
       <a href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article198635.html">
        reporting
       </a>
       that Hariri is being held at the Ritz and that France has asked for his release.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saad Hariri's speech was staunchly iranophobic, and quite out of character. It is not preposterous to suggest it was fed verbatim by the Saudis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7b56hn/saudi_prince_abdul_aziz_bin_fahd_a_business/">
        Saudi Prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd, a business partner of Lebanese PM Hariri, was killed during his arrest this week.

       Whatever is happening in Saudi Arabia is going to have a massive ripple effect throughout the world. I read earlier today that one of the Saudi higher ups had called this Phase 1. So....whatâ€™s Phase 2...and how many Phases are there? This shit beats going to the movies hands down.:)
