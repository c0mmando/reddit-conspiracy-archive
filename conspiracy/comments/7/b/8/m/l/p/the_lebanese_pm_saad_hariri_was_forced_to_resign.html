        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>According to the Lebanese constitution, Saad Hariri is still in charge, despite his &quot;resignation&quot; from Saudi Arabia. That is, until a successor is named. He informed of his resignation the President Aoun by telephone, but didn&#39;t provide a reason.</p>

<p>The president Aoun is reportedly not accepting the resignation, as he is waiting for Hariri to tell him in person when he comes back.</p>

<p>The head of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah (leader of the coalition opposed to his party) has defended Hariri, saying he was victim of Saudi interference.</p>

<p>Saad Hariri is bi-national Saudi/Lebanese, so he doesn&#39;t enjoy diplomatic immunity in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Meyssan">Thierry Meyssan</a> is <a href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article198635.html">reporting</a> that Hariri is being held at the Ritz and that France has asked for his release.</p>

<p>Saad Hariri&#39;s speech was staunchly iranophobic, and quite out of character. It is not preposterous to suggest it was fed verbatim by the Saudis.</p>

<p>Remember <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7b56hn/saudi_prince_abdul_aziz_bin_fahd_a_business/">Saudi Prince Abdul Aziz bin Fahd, a business partner of Lebanese PM Hariri, was killed during his arrest this week.</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whatever is happening in Saudi Arabia is going to have a massive ripple effect throughout the world. I read earlier today that one of the Saudi higher ups had called this Phase 1. So....whatâ€™s Phase 2...and how many Phases are there? This shit beats going to the movies hands down.:)</p>
