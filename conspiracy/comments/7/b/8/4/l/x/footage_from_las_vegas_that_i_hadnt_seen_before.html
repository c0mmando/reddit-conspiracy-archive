<blockquote>
<p>We hit the floor and I noticed my phone was on camera mode I hit record not realizing what was happening. This is the beginning of our nightmare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks like they ran on the inside of the venue along the Las Vegas Blvd. side then exited and continued north up to Tropicana Ave. and then finally went inside the Tropicana (the side that&#39;s closest to the strip).  It shows them walking down a long hallway in the Tropicana and when they get to a more public area the video ends.  You can hear lots of the gunshot volleys in this one.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bc4Ajd9atXE">Route 91 Shooting Bodies carried out</a></strong></p>

<p>This is from Giles Street.  I hear no gunshots and I think it was after the shooting was over.  At onne point you can hear a helicopter overhead.  People still escaping and many carrying victims in wheelbarrows, on metal barriers and at least one being drug down the sidewalk on what appears to be a tarp.</p>

<p>Starts with Jason Aldean singing, then the first shots.  This one is a lot more sharp and clear of what happens on the stage than some of the other ones I&#39;ve seen.  Contains the first four volley of gunshots.</p>

<p>This one has actually been posted before, but a shorter version.  The first minute and a half or so is the part that is new to me. It clearly shows some of the concert-goers trying to help a woman who is down.  It&#39;s also a sharp and clear video.</p>

<p>So I just thought I&#39;d post these in case some of the you haven&#39;t seen them.  Y&#39;all are good on picking up on sounds and seeing things that I miss. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where is evidence of thousands of rounds worth of damage?  No footage of the aftermath at all. A guy goes around painting the ground but you can tell there is no bullet damage.  Las Vegas was a  hoax like Sandy Hook, Boston Bombing and the Pulse night club.  If you are unaware of how those three hoax events were accomplished, please make sure to check them out before diving into Las Vegas too deeply.  It is the same group of conspirators.  They are all hoaxes.  Watch Boston Umbombing if want to investigate something.  </p>

<p>Where is evidence of thousands of rounds worth of damage?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being withheld by the LVMPD and the FBI.  We&#39;ve seen very little photographic up close evidence of the aftermath.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Las Vegas was a hoax</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think it was a &quot;hoax.&quot;  I do think that people died.  I think it could have been a false flag, though.  And the two are different.</p>

<p>A hoax - to me - would mean that none of it really happened.</p>

<p>A false flag describes covert operations that are designed to deceive in such a way that activities appear as though they are being carried out by individual entities, groups, or nations <strong>other than those who actually planned and executed them.</strong></p>

<p>I think the activities were planned and executed i.e. they actually happened.  I just don&#39;t think Paddock alone was responsible for them and I don&#39;t even know if he was responsible at all.</p>

<p>All this is just my opinion, though and you are certainly entitled to your own opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What was there to even damage? And if there was damage how are you about to see bullet holes in the stage or wherever else. It was pretty much all concrete. So if this was all a hoax, where are the gun shot noises coming from? Wouldn&#39;t every single person in Vegas just be like yo, not one bullet was fired. People wouldn&#39;t of been running if there were no bullets coming at them. Why were people freaking out then? If nobody was getting shot around them and no billets whizzing around, nobody would run. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is how I would go about proving it to you. Step one, watch Boston Unbombing. It is 4 hours long but nobody said exposing a fake bombing would be short or easy. </p>

<p>After you have watched that video, make sure you&#39;ve researched sandy Hook for several hours as well.  Once both of those conditions have been met, approach the Las Vegas terror attack with an open mind and see where the evidence leads you. If you know about sandy hook, and you have watched Boston Unbombing to understand the logistics of a hoax, all the evidence given for Las Vegas proves one thing..It was a hoax.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;d just be me finding shit out on my own, not you proving anything. I&#39;ve researched them. Doesn&#39;t mean they are related. Those instances seem much more likely to be hoaxes, at least sandy hook and Orlando. They weren&#39;t out in the open in front of thousands of people.

<p>every single person from that concert assumes someone else got shot, except the actors faking their injuries of course. They know nobody got shot.</p>

<p>Do you understand why the burden of proof rests o the people claiming gunshots? We could argue all fucking day about “no shots fired” and there will always be room for doubt. What about this guy? What about that area? There is an infinite amount of speculation. Nobody can ever prove that “no shots were fired”.</p>

<p>However, if shots <em>were</em> fired then it should be simple enough to verify that claim. So why hasn’t anybody done it yet, without resorting to the same tired old crisis actors sitting up in hospital beds laughing and joking?</p>

<p>*facepalm* Reading comprehension not so good huh? Re-read what I write about <em>burden of proof</em> and how it is —literally— impossible to prove “nobody got shot”.</p>

<p>If you are making the claim someone was shot, the <strong>you need to prove that claim</strong> or <strong>show me someone else who already proved it</strong>. You won’t do that, because you can’t do that. Such proof doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>You don’t get to ride on the coattails of the media narrative and claim authority, correctness or virtue without <em>evidence</em>. Why is this simple, fundamental and logical concept so hard for so many people on this so-called conspiracy sub to understand?</p>

<p>Why do you believe people died? You do realise that this is the <em>only part that stays consistent among all the noise</em> right?</p>

<p>That’s not because it’s true. It’s because this is the core of the narrative. Yet it’s still completely unproven, save for some bleeding-heart unverifiable anecdotes in the media, the same place all the other bullshit gets aired.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Bull-fucking-shit. None of the reported facts are true. It’s all part of the same performance. All of the things you’ve cited can be faked, and have been faked by government agencies in the past in order to sell a narrative. None of those things constitute proof.</p>

<p>Why selectively choose what to believe without evidence? Is there anything verifiable at all except for the media‘s <del>propaganda</del> reporting?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I misunderstand but here is the way I see it. </p>

<p>1- there is a shooting reported. Mass casualties. </p>

<p>2- a bunch of hoaxers ACCUSE “it was fake.” </p>

<p>In a court of law, whether civil or criminal.  the burden of proof lies with the accuser. In this scenario that would be YOU. All you present is circumstantial evidence... no PROOF which you say is what is required. </p>

<p>I truly expect some kind of BS  reply, but this all makes me so angry. Not just at you and your ilk, but at the whole mess, as I do believe there is a larger agenda, I just don’t know what it is. </p>

<p>Anyway, I’m not even sure I know why I engage with you guys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You boiled it down into just two parts but still managed to get it backwards. That takes talent.</p>

<p>Look up Russell’s Teapot. That explains how burden of proof works.</p>

<p>If you can’t wrap your head around that, try to prove a negative claim with as many variables as the event in Vegas (e.g people did NOT get shot). It isn’t possible to definitively prove it, ever. There will always be room for doubt that, just perhaps, we overlooked <em>something</em>. This is why the burden always, always rests on the positive claim (e.g. people WERE shot) and anyone who refuses to accept it is within the boundaries of logic and reason, and indeed the law, until sufficient evidence emerges to <strong>prove beyond a reasonable doubt</strong> otherwise.</p>

<p>There is no physical, irrefutable proof of the original claim, which is that people got shot. Stories and anecdotes don’t count as proof. Testimonials from actors don’t count as proof. A bandage doesn’t count as proof. There. Is. None.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feel free to imagine me as whatever helps you sleep at night, unfortunately for you though, the ad hominem doesn’t make the argument or your position any stronger, because your position requires assumptions that have not been proven.</p>

<p>Riddle me this: is it <strong>possible</strong> or <strong>impossible</strong> to prove that “nobody was shot” or even that “no shots were fired”?</p>

<p>If it is impossible to prove either of those statements (hint: both are negative claims), how would anyone go about proving them?</p>

<p>Clearly, then, we are forced to approach the question from the opposite direction, by reverting to that which can be <em>proven</em>.  To wade in the philosophical quagmire of the unprovable is an interesting mental exercise but it doesn’t help us establish what happened.</p>

<p>In summary: it’s impossible to falsify all the claims of this event, so we must instead ask what evidence exists to support them.</p>

<p>Is it theoretically possible to prove claims of a shooting are true?</p>

<p>How would we do that?</p>

<p>To what extent is that proof independently verifiable along an unbroken evidence chain?</p>

<p>At what point can we go no further and must rely on trusted assertions? Were we at that point as soon as the shooting happened? What about now?</p>

<p>Has anyone double-checked any of the assertions made by victims and eyewitnesses to the extent necessary to declare “proof” or are we relying on trust a little too early?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here you go: Look at <a href="http://freeimage.host/image/zy4Yv">this photo</a>. That is not a real injury, it is quite clearly a moulage application, aka fake gore. </p>

<p>That picture was taken at the scene of the pyrotechnics show at the Boston Marathon. If fake gore was ready and waiting, and photographers happened to focus on it, and newspapers and tv ran stories with that picture with no retractions... then what makes you think any of it was real?</p>

<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. Watch “Boston Unbombing” to see a lot more, or find Peekay Boston’s many videos unravelling this particular hoax.</p>

<p>Then, when you are done with Boston Marathon, look into the many, many others media phoney fake shows with a similar quality and quantity of doubt cast over their authenticity.</p>

<p>Of course cognitive dissonance will kick in and you’ll be tempted to assume that even in the face of overwhelming fakery, surely <em>somebody</em> got hurt, surely <em>some people</em> died, it must have been a <em>mixture of fake and real</em>.</p>

<p>During my own research I’ve found no evidence that any media-hysteria mass shootings, bombings, car attacks, van attacks etc are real. They are all staged, just like Boston. I’m sure some such events do happen for real every now and again, but those aren’t the ones we read about because they have complex motives or inconvenient details that don’t further the narrative as desired.</p>

<p>Just think about it a while longer and keep researching the evidence, until you finally accept the crushing realisation that it’s <strong>all fake</strong>.</p>

<p>So these various police officers who radioed in that they were at a certain location with a gunshot victim must have been in on the hoax, too.  Right?  And I guess the doctors and nurses and the spokespersons from the various hospitals who would give daily updates on the death toll and injuries being treated at their facilities were in on the hoax too, right?</p>

<p>And all those obituaries that were publisheded?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>this is the part I don&#39;t understand about the fake claims. Unless a person is a trained EMT, combat medic, ER doctor or something with a history of dealing with combat/gun related injuries how do they know what looks fake or not in the first place? Expecting some sort of movie like damage out put with people getting hit and then thrown backwards 20 feet? 
Days after the event people who claimed to be EMT and so on were saying it clearly looked real to them but of course being it&#39;s online it&#39;s easy to claim they were not EMT or whatever. </p>

<p>but I still wonder just what someone expects to see in the videos? I think we are so use to movie violence and thankfully for most people their lives are devoid of violence to the point we don&#39;t know what real gun violence looks like anymore. </p>

<p>but claims of the entire event being fake are just foolish. At some point it&#39;s just not possible to fake an event of a certain size. I&#39;ve said this before but your average cop/EMT and even federal agent is just a family man/women doing their job. This strange idea people have that law enforcement is all hive mind and ready to be &quot;in on it&quot; at a moments notice is just false. 50+ EMT show up, all in on? All the ambulances and ER trips? In on it? Doctors at the hospitals? In on it? No one has come forward saying it was fake? Entire city emergency response, in on it? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So how in your mind did the Boston bombing hoax play out? The marathon is a public event. How did the conspirators keep people from catching them setting up? Did they pay all the attendees off? Did Jeff Bauman have his legs amputated in a secret lab the day before the race so a team could dress him up in gore and zombie makeup and sneak him up a sewer grate under cover of a fake explosion? Or has he been without legs for years, and everyone who has ever known him or claimed to know him is in on the lie? Why bother with something so complex and risky? Did the government with all its resources really do a terrible job faking a massacre, or is it possible you just aren&#39;t actually all that familiar with extreme real-life violence and it doesn&#39;t look how you might have imagined?</p>

<p>You&#39;re the gullible one.</p>

<p>Let me make this claim... you are a far pimply loser who has nothing to do but stir the shit. You sit in front of your computer all Dayana have nothing better to do. That’s my positive claim. Prove me wrong.</p>

<p>You&#39;re responding to the initial post and you seem like you&#39;re answering a question.  But i didn&#39;t ask any questions in the initial post.   All I did was post links to five videos with a description of each.</p>

<p>Are you sure you&#39;re replying to the right person?</p>

<p>No. It’s always on the original claim. The claim that a shooting happened. Prove that first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember that.  It&#39;s the one where the guy was filming himself stumbling through the crowd and he came across a girl.  He pressed his hand on her chest and fresh blood came out of her mouth.  It did not look faked at all.   Its look and feel matches these videos here.  I believe that video came from LiveLeak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a shill, like at all. I&#39;ve looked into it lmao. But one would think if you had all these answers and everything figured out, you would share with those who doubt you. That&#39;s why ur phony. Once again I don&#39;t believe a single thing the media has said other than people died. I am a man of no party who just wants happiness and good place to live for his family.  I believe in most conspiracies in this sub. So to call me a shill just isn&#39;t true, and furthers my point as to how dumb you are. Because rather than just show me why you think this, you call me names and have nothing. </p>
