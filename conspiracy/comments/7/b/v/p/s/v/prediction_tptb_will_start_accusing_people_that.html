       This would serve two functions:
      </p>
      <p>
       1 Destroy the credibility of the innocent person being accused, and have them fall out of favor with the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       2 Muddy the waters of all the current and future allegations that will come out, by having some of the falsely accused people be vindicated and proven innocent. That way, when someone they DON'T want to lose gets accused, they can then point to all the other "false accusations".
      </p>
      <p>
       If this all just turns into a he said/she said kind of thing, eventually all claims will start to just get swept under the rug again, because nobody knows who to trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: To anyone here trying to make this political, please kindly fuck off. Left or right, I hope anyone who is guilty goes down. Don't try to rope me into that bread and circus bullshit you've clearly fallen for.

       Oh look. The left is coming in here trying to pretend that we think like them.  Yeah, Most of us regulars here dont buy into the fake left right bs so...nice try.  If roy is guilty...then hell face the consequences just like weinstein, spacey, cobsy...oh wait.

       I don't think this play would help them. It could work to take people down, but if you look at Spacey and Weinstein, you can see how serious it is because of the open police investigations happening. Simply slandering someone and then they themselves get named only would make them look more guilty in jurors eyes.

       Trump’s settled a lawsuit for sexual harassment in the past, he was also a personal friend of Jeffrey Epstein, said numerous time he’d date girls when they were 12/13, he said he could grab women by the oussy and they wouldn’t say a thing cause he’s famous (IOW : Has power).

       Donald J. Trump: You know and ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Unknown: She used to be great. She’s still very beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: I moved on her, actually. You know, she was down on Palm Beach. I moved on her, and I failed. I’ll admit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unknown: Whoa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: I did try and fuck her. She was married.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unknown: That’s huge news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: No, no, Nancy. No, this was [unintelligible] — and I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping.
      </p>
      <p>
       She wanted to get some furniture. I said, “I’ll show you where they have some nice furniture.” I took her out furniture —
      </p>
      <p>
       I moved on her like a bitch. But I couldn’t get there. And she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything. She’s totally changed her look.
      </p>
      <p>
       Billy Bush: Sheesh, your girl’s hot as shit. In the purple.
      </p>

       Trump: Maybe it’s a different one.

       Bush: It better not be the publicist. No, it’s, it’s her, it’s —
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: Yeah, that’s her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.
      </p>
      <p>

       Bush: Oof, get out of the way, honey. Oh, that’s good legs. Go ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: It’s always good if you don’t fall out of the bus. Like Ford, Gerald Ford, remember?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Down below, pull the handle.

      </p>

       Zucker: Doing very well, thank you. Are you ready to be a soap star?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: We’re ready, let’s go. Make me a soap star.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: How about a little hug for the Donald? He just got off the bus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: Would you like a little hug, darling?
      </p>

       Trump: O.K., absolutely. Melania said this was O.K.
      </p>

       Bush: How about a little hug for the Bushy? I just got off the bus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: Bushy, Bushy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Here we go. Excellent. Well, you’ve got a nice co-star here.

       Bush: Let the little guy in here, come on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: Yeah, let the little guy in. How you feel now? Better? I should actually be in the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: It’s hard to walk next to a guy like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: Here, wait, hold on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Yeah, you get in the middle, there we go.

      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: That’s some pressure right there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Seriously, if you had — if you had to take one of us as a date.

       Where's the part where he says he forces himself on women? The Tic Tac kiss comment is the only thing close to implying that. The rest is literally how guys talk when women aren't around. But he does make oddball comments about his daughters beauty, saying he would date her as an adult if she wasn't his daughter. This conversation comes off as him trying to impress Billy Bush or to seem like a ladies man to him. Still key word here is
       <strong>
        let.

       You kind of have to say No or be in visible discomfort for it to be rape yes. But that's not what he's saying, he's saying women let him like groupies do for rock stars. Are groupies victims of rape when they willingly let famous musicians sleep with them? Intimidation is different and you make a point there, but I don't believe in the whole context of the conversation they are speaking about forced groping. Just regular immoral behavior with willing women. I mean Zucker is a female and hasn't spoke up about feeling uncomfortable about this conversation.

       Us guys? Are you fucking high? I said nothing about Trump, I was talking about Assange. If Trump went down for sexual misconduct of some kind I wouldn't care. Didn't realize I wasn't allowed to point out Assange being accused of being a Pedo without supporting Trump simultaneously. Jesus Christ.

       The_Donald, one of Donald Trump’s biggest online spaces, has been peddling that narrative HARD for over a year now.

      <p>
       Their crossover brigaders have been flooding THIS subreddit with that garbage for just as long.
      </p>
      <p>
       /pol/, another HUGE pro-trump space, has been instrumental in the creating and propagation of the whole PizzaGate conspiracy witch-hunt. Same with 4chan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Major online trumpers pushing these narratives include Michael Flynn Jr. and Michael Flynn himself, Mike Cernovich, Jake Posobiec,
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there are the pro trump publications like Infowars and Breitbart, zerohedge and others.

       Donald J. Trump: You know and ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Unknown: She used to be great. She’s still very beautiful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: I moved on her, actually. You know, she was down on Palm Beach. I moved on her, and I failed. I’ll admit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unknown: Whoa.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: I did try and fuck her. She was married.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unknown: That’s huge news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: No, no, Nancy. No, this was [unintelligible] — and I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping.
      </p>
      <p>
       She wanted to get some furniture. I said, “I’ll show you where they have some nice furniture.” I took her out furniture —
      </p>
      <p>
       I moved on her like a bitch. But I couldn’t get there. And she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything. She’s totally changed her look.
      </p>
      <p>
       Billy Bush: Sheesh, your girl’s hot as shit. In the purple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: Whoa! Whoa!
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Yes! The Donald has scored. Whoa, my man!
      </p>
      <p>
       [Crosstalk]
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: Look at you, you are a pussy.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Crosstalk]
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: All right, you and I will walk out.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Silence]
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: Maybe it’s a different one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: It better not be the publicist. No, it’s, it’s her, it’s —
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: Yeah, that’s her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Whatever you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Uh, yeah, those legs, all I can see is the legs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: Oh, it looks good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Come on shorty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: Ooh, nice legs, huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Oof, get out of the way, honey. Oh, that’s good legs. Go ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: It’s always good if you don’t fall out of the bus. Like Ford, Gerald Ford, remember?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Down below, pull the handle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: Hello, how are you? Hi!
      </p>
      <p>
       Arianne Zucker: Hi, Mr. Trump. How are you? Pleasure to meet you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: Nice seeing you. Terrific, terrific. You know Billy Bush?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Hello, nice to see you. How you doing, Arianne?
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: Doing very well, thank you. Are you ready to be a soap star?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: We’re ready, let’s go. Make me a soap star.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: How about a little hug for the Donald? He just got off the bus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: Would you like a little hug, darling?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: O.K., absolutely. Melania said this was O.K.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: How about a little hug for the Bushy? I just got off the bus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: Bushy, Bushy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Here we go. Excellent. Well, you’ve got a nice co-star here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: Yes, absolutely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: Good. After you.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Break in video]
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: Come on, Billy, don’t be shy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Soon as a beautiful woman shows up, he just, he takes off. This always happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: Get over here, Billy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: I’m sorry, come here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Let the little guy in here, come on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: Yeah, let the little guy in. How you feel now? Better? I should actually be in the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: It’s hard to walk next to a guy like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: Here, wait, hold on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Yeah, you get in the middle, there we go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: Good, that’s better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: This is much better. This is —
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: That’s better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: [Sighs]
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Now, if you had to choose honestly between one of us. Me or the Donald?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: I don’t know, that’s tough competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: That’s some pressure right there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Seriously, if you had — if you had to take one of us as a date.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: I have to take the Fifth on that one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Really?
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: Yup — I’ll take both.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: Which way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: Make a right. Here we go. [inaudible]
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Here he goes. I’m gonna leave you here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: O.K.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: Give me my microphone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: O.K. Oh, you’re finished?
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: You’re my man, yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump: Oh, good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush: I’m gonna go do our show.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zucker: Oh, you wanna reset? O.K.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where's the part where he says he forces himself on women? The Tic Tac kiss comment is the only thing close to implying that. The rest is literally how guys talk when women aren't around. But he does make oddball comments about his daughters beauty, saying he would date her as an adult if she wasn't his daughter. This conversation comes off as him trying to impress Billy Bush or to seem like a ladies man to him. Still key word here is
       <strong>
        let.

       Us guys? Are you fucking high? I said nothing about Trump, I was talking about Assange. If Trump went down for sexual misconduct of some kind I wouldn't care. Didn't realize I wasn't allowed to point out Assange being accused of being a Pedo without supporting Trump simultaneously. Jesus Christ.
