        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First of all, here is the video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niBgnjtMSsg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niBgnjtMSsg</a>   </p>

<p>You’re gonna need to keep watching it over and over as you read this because the screen caps are, as usual, crappy compared to the original video.  </p>

<p>Why is this video important?  Because it plays a central part in my theory.  That the Vegas shooting was a failed assassination attempt of a Saudi royal, maybe even the crown prince himself.  If you haven’t yet, you should read my whole theory here: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7b9r6m/im_resubmitting_this_because_another_user/?st=j9su797m&amp;amp;sh=e9d2c1f4">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7b9r6m/im_resubmitting_this_because_another_user/?st=j9su797m&amp;amp;sh=e9d2c1f4</a>  </p>

<p>It’s extremely long, but I guarantee you it’ll be worth it.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve got that out of the way, let’s dig in.</p>

<p>Please open this picture:  <a href="https://imgur.com/a/34efW">https://imgur.com/a/34efW</a>     And keep it open while you follow the rest of this post.  </p>

<p>I made the case that the guy being escorted out of the Tropicana (no. 1 in the picture) may be a Saudi prince.  I was told that he is not.   I was told that he’s some guy named Jason Buff, a security guard, and that either he was transporting lots of chips or that it was an exercise drill.   People said he posted on his facebook some softball game pics or something to confirm it was him.  Okay, fine.  Let’s take a real close look at the picture.</p>

<p>Person Number 4:  Look at the picture carefully.  He is carrying a stretcher.  Specifically, an emergency e-vac stretcher.  Right there, the theory of transporting casino chips go out the window.  Why, oh, why the fuck would you need a stretcher to transport chips?  Hmm.  So, that leaves only the &quot;emergency drill&quot; scenario as an explanation for this video.  This would make sense, right?  I mean, emergencies would require a stretcher.  But wait, you’re gonna giggle at my next point.</p>

<p>Person Number 8:  Look at the video from start to finish concentrating on person number 8.  Now, I’m no military person, but I know a helicopter pilot when I see one.  And it looks like he’s even wearing a parachute.  At the least, he looks airborne infantry.  So tell me, in what kind of emergency drill would you need a fricken paratrooper/attack chopper pilot?  </p>

<p>Person Number 5:  Look at his bullet proof vest.  That’s no swat or police issue.  On every law enforcement uniform the words “POLICE” or “SHERIFF” or “FBI” or some other identifying label is CLEARLY marked.  His uniform along with the others, have no labels at all, which would mean it could be only one of two things.  A: he’s a private security force (like Black Water) or B: he’s military.  Now, I’m no gun expert so I could be wrong, but it looks like he’s carrying an M4.  It could be a ar-15 but, like I said, I’m not an expert.  </p>

<p>Person Number 6:  The guy in the yellow is literally pointing his rifle at unarmed civilians and shouting “Hands up!”.  And from the reactions of the people in the casino, it’s clear that they have no idea what’s going on.   Are you telling me that during a drill, you’re going to scare your customer by pointing a fricken automatic rifle at them and shouting at them?  For real?  You only do this if there is immediate real threat to you or your escort. </p>

<p>Person Number 4 and 7:  Look at the decal on their uniforms.  At first, I thought it was US Marshall.  But upon repeated viewing, I’m not so sure.  Maybe someone can ID it.  Regardless, here’s what wrong.  Persons 4 and 7 have complete different decals from the rest.  In fact, it looks like almost everyone has completely different decal except these two.   Person number 3 looks to be a standard police uniform, but the rest?  They are definitely something else.  What kind of fricken drill is this then?</p>

<p>SO!  <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, time to put on your thinking cap.  Forget person number 1 for the moment.  We’ll never be able to ID him what that crappy video.  But instead, please answer a few questions for me:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Is person number 8 in fact wearing a pilot uniform?  And is that a parachute on his back?</p></li>
<li><p>What agency decal are persons 4 and 7 wearing?</p></li>
<li><p>What exact model of rifle is person number 5 wielding?  </p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Look, if you’ve read my theory, then a helicopter pilot being there would absolutely cement it.  And this video, regardless of whether the person number 1 is a prince or not, does not make sense.  Maybe deciphering it will get us somewhere.  Thank you for reading.</p>

What casino employs a licensed to carry pilot on its staff?  Why would the pilot be part of the escort?  Wouldn&#39;t the pilot just go on ahead to the chopper and prepare it for take off?

<p>except that it is a very strange situation for any day of the year. A group of heavily armed individuals, with fingers on triggers, walking through a casino while pointing automatic rifles at the innocent patrons? Are you saying that&#39;s a common occurrence in Vegas?</p>

<p>The only time for this type of situation to make sense is during the madness following the shooting. I don&#39;t see why they would be sweeping a casino floor (while breaking every rule in the book in terms of gun safety) in many other contexts.</p>

<p>Also, the guy claiming to be the head of security said they were a SWAT team that was responding to the reports of shootings at 9 different hotels at once. Even if the guy is who he says it is, it confirms that there were multiple shooters in multiple locations.</p>

<p>No, it confirms police <em>gasp</em> respond to reports of shootings. The fact that they already had an shooter at the MGM just made that response much more forceful. I mean go watch the body cam footage of the Vegas police and NFL player Michael Bennett running out of the hotel from August 26, 2017.  The night of the big Mayweather vs McGregor fight. That was a report of a gun at a casino. It was just a couple of average street cops telling people to get down and then of course Michael Bennett running out of there. 
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2017/09/30/michael-bennett-arrest-video-paul-newday-weekend.cnn">http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2017/09/30/michael-bennett-arrest-video-paul-newday-weekend.cnn</a></p>

<p>and there was nothing to the report (as far as I know) and the response in the video of everyone hitting the ground, panic, freaking out etc was x10 more than anything we see in the video of a random police team walking across a casino floor. Yet some how people still think there was &quot;active&quot; shooters at other locations during/after the MGM shooting and yet we have no reports of total panic etc. Really?</p>

<p>as for this video, I never thought it was an escort of a guest being they all go their own direction near the end. The idea of it being someone connected to the casino makes more sense than some of the other ideas being pitched around. If he is head of security I&#39;m guessing the little case he has is some sort of firearm he doesn&#39;t wear but maybe brings with him to his back room work location. Could also be anything about shoe box size really. Might an an ipad or even just his lunch for all really know. </p>

<p>The Mandalay shooting can only spread so far. This is strong evidence there was more happening than just the hotel room.</p>

<p>What evidence are you basing your stuff on? Has Vegas PD released all the reports and responses? Do you know for sure what you say is true or are you speculating?</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s strong evidence a concert with 20k people got shot at, with those shot being heard more or less up and down the strip. So here comes the panic plus fog of war issues as people run off all over the place. You can hear it from the average beat cops as they call out all sort of stuff they think they are hearing as far as shots. </p>

<p>I refuse to believe for even one second that we had active shootings or even gun men at other locations with thousands and thousands of witness. Tourists from all over the entire USA or even the world but yet no one highly creditable says anything? Did these phantom shooter just not shoot at anyone or did they miss the wall to wall weekend crowd of people packed into every single Vegas casino at the time? </p>

<p>Some high roller doctor got his wife shot but is scared of local PD even when he can get a high level lawyer and so on with one phone call? Rich people are not scared of the police, they would be coming forward like crazy if they had been shot/shot at/seen shooter. We don&#39;t have any of that, we get pure hearsay of they heard someone else say or it&#39;s at best a vague fog of war like statement. </p>

<p>to be fair and to keep in mind where I&#39;m posting right now I can understand a conspiracy of other shooters in hidden locations. The roof of MGM, two shooters in the room etc. I&#39;m skeptical but it still can pass a basic test of logic that shooters at 5+ other casinos with no one shot, no one coming forward and no pics/vids just doesn&#39;t IMO. </p>

<p>&quot;but.. but police responded so........&quot;, yeah and police responded to my home once on a domestic abuse call being my dog killed a baby bird. I live near a school, my mother was over, baby bird falls out of nest and my Akita pounces on it. Mother tries to pull dog off bird, but he is 120 pounds so he doesn&#39;t care and she is screaming &quot;Noooooooo stop!! No!!&quot; like he is killing a baby. So 20 min later, here comes the local PD. Police responding to X doesn&#39;t even remotely mean X happened, it&#39;s just their job to respond. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but conspiracy theories need to hold up to at least a basic shaking of the box. If there were active shooter at 8 other locations then there would be some sort of fall out from that due to 1000s and 1000s of witnesses. I mean 10k-15k+ witnesses easy and........... nothing. Not even 1% coming forward. </p>

<p>because what I&#39;m saying is the sort of logical progression of a well established common base line of both the location and the reactions of reasonable people. You really want to claim it&#39;s just speculation when I say a Vegas casino is packed with thousands of people at 10pm on a weekend? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a reasonable reaction of those thousands of people to have either come under fire or been under threat of other shooters but not even 1% says anything? It&#39;s pure speculation to claim that if there was shooters and most of all active shooters at locations with 1000s and 1000s of people that someone out of those thousands of people would of been hit by the gun fire? Where these 8 casino location shooters just firing up in the air? They just missed everyone? Yet again, no one says anything. </p>

<p>Sure.. Ok. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy fuck, I thought <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> had a higher IQ than this.   MantisGr33n, sorry, but I&#39;m gonna hijack your top comment.</p>

<p>People are asking the dumbest questions I&#39;ve ever seen.  I thought I&#39;d be coy and suggest things and let people come up with the obvious questions, but no, people are attacking me saying &quot;Yo dude, the guy on facebook already said it was me.  This post is stupid&quot;... My god.  Did it ever occur to these people that maybe that was just a distraction?  That ... wait for it....  it was a cover-up?</p>

<p>Ok, since I have to spoon feed everyone, I&#39;ll do it.  Let&#39;s assume the official narrative is right.  Let&#39;s assume that the guy numbered 1 is in fact a high roller.  There was shooting that night at Mandalay.  The casino and local authorities offer him escort out of the casino and offer to put him on a chopper because he&#39;s a VIP.  Ok.  That&#39;s the narrative, right?</p>

<p>Now ask yourself this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Who carries a medic stretcher to an escort? </p></li>
<li><p>What medic, outside of marine medics, are allowed to carry assault rifles?  What civilian medic would want to wield one?  None, right?  If so, what the hell are the marines doing there?  Are the marines in the business of escorting VIP out of casinos?  </p></li>
<li><p>Why would a helicopter pilot be involved in escorting a VIP?  Don&#39;t they usually just go to the chopper, fire it up, and wait for the party to arrive?  Why is he there with the escort?  BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHY THE HELL IS A PILOT CARRYING AN ASSAULT RIFLE?</p></li>
<li><p>If this was a simple VIP escort, why do 3 or 4 different agencies need to get involved?  Wouldn&#39;t casino security be enough?  But look at the decals!  They&#39;re all different with a couple of them being same. </p></li>
<li><p>Who is this guy?  Who the fuck he is that he gets an escort of 7 armed guards, waving their guns at unarmed civilians?  Are you telling me that regular rich guy would get this treatment?  If this guy is Bill Gates or Elon Musk, then ya, I agree.  But are you saying a guy who plays with millions gets this???  Really?   Think!!!!</p></li>

<p>This is not a protective escort. When protecting someone they do NOT let them walk behind the entire detail completely exposed from the rear. The protected parties would be in the middle of the group. Letting them walk behind them is a good way to let them get dead real quick-like</p>

<p>Tactical Medics are armed. Most tactical medics are operators with extra training for trauma triage. </p>

<p>Those are NOT Marines. At all. </p>

<p>That is not a pilot. It is not a parachute. THAT is your tactical medic. His backpack is a trauma kit. </p>

<p>It is not a VIP escort. It looks like a combination of LVMPD uniforms. The strip &quot;yellow&quot; uniform, the tan road uniform, and the swat team.</p>

<p>Idk who it is. But I find it highly likely that the two in back are employees. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1 could be anyone.
2,5 looks like either ATF, DCIS patch and kit. Either fits your narrative.
3 is LV Sheriff, she is smooth.
4 and 7 have US Marshall badges, are known for high profile transport/prisoner transport/WITSEC.
8 kit looks like a PJ, no insignia, cans and mic helmet combo; which would account for the stretcher. USAF equivalent of Navy Seal. Specialize in hot extractions and are combat medics. Interestingly he sees the camera and hides his face, if this were a PJ operating on US soil the implications are huge. 
9 is the floor manager. 
6 is LVPD and needs to be fired immediately for lack of trigger discipline and flagging a fucking civ.<br/>
All in all this is too many different agencies coordinating in a real-life location to be an exercise. &quot;Hands up&quot; with no identifier reeks military action and not police. &quot;It&#39;s good they&#39;re here&quot; around :10 also seems to be real life scenario. With the exception of 6, everyone is a smooth operator, has good trigger discipline; female Sheriff training must have stuck more than most police. Seeing that they came with a stretcher and (possibly) a combat medic that means whatever was happening they anticipated the VIP to be a casualty, and again if that is a PJ he is violating the Posse Comitatus Act (Amended 1956 to include USAF). Basically Federal Armed Force operating on US soil. Fishy shit even if this is an exercise, most likely isn&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched this vid a dozen times, but I was focused on the dude in the jersey.</p>

<p>I didn’t notice the multiple agency thing, the large backpack, or the stretcher.</p>

<p>I did notice the guy in yellow though. He was obviously pointing his weapon at people despite what the supposed security guard in the jersey said on the Facebook post.</p>

<p>An intermixed agency team like this could only be the result of a hastily made decision. </p>

<p>Maybe there’s something else entirely to this story. </p>

<p>I wonder where Paddock was during all of this. Was he gambling on another floor somewhere? Another casino or hotel? The only evidence of him being in that room is that sketchy photo.....</p>

<p>and then there is the fact that his check in date was changed from the 28th to the 25th. </p>

<p>Maybe Paddock was one of the shooting victims, and they had to transport a conveniently placed cadaver up to the shooters room to cover up the real culprits. </p>

<p>So much sketchy shit here.</p>

<p>And if it was real, with real weapons, one of the other guys would have said ‘hey moron finger off the trigger and stop pointing it at people’. No one with any level of training would walk next to someone using a gun like that. That is a great way to accidentally kill someone. Finger on the trigger, you stop quickly. Guy behind you bumps into you, gun goes off. And pointing it at people? No way, no how. He was a retard with a toy gun if you ask me. 0 chance fbi/cia, abd no way elite hotel security, you’re not suppose to draw attention or alarm people, which the guy in the front was doing both of. </p>

<p>I love your story and think it&#39;s somewhat believable  but this sentence kind of kills any credibility in your work.   Not only would an M4 vs AR15 be 100% indistinguishable from this distance (there is literally only one 1/8&quot; - ish hole difference when viewing the external bits, but it also wouldn&#39;t make a difference if it was full auto or semi auto as there would be no tactical advantage to clicking a happy switch in a crowded casino like this.  </p>

<p>That guy has patches on his shoulders, as do most LEOs. The fact that you can’t see a police placard doesn’t mean he’s military. There’s also absolutely no way you can tell the difference between an M4 and an AR in this photo, as it’s basically the fire selection. Also, I’m a LEO and carry an M4 at work. </p>

<li><p>2, 4, 5, &amp; 7 are SWAT. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/UtYRzCI.jpg">Here</a> is a picture of LV SWAT. They&#39;re all not wearing the same helmets and vests. I don&#39;t know how it works there but different departments throughout the country have different rules. Some issue standard equipment and require them to wear only that. Some allow the SWAT operators to purchase their own equipment, even weapons, so long as they meet their requirements. They may or may not be reimbursed depending on the department. Some even require their operators to buy all their own gear out of pocket with no reimbursement.</p></li>
<li><p>3 is wearing the same uniform as Sheriff Joe Lombardo has wore in the press conferences. </p></li>
<li><p>6 is wearing the uniform that they wear on the strip. Yellow shirt black pants. <a href="http://www.fox5vegas.com/story/22979863/police-worker-falls-100-feet-near-mgm-grand">Here</a> is an article that has a picture of what they look like.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>8 is possibly FBI. <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2017/oct/03/many-survived-carnage-tropicana-became-safe-haven/">Here</a> are <a href="http://www.newsindiatimes.com/at-least-50-dead-200-injured-at-shooting-on-las-vegas-strip-police-say">two</a> articles, showing guys in camo, saying that they&#39;re FBI. Also definitely not wearing a parachute, no leg straps, plus they&#39;re practically useless for a helicopter.</p>

<p>People were running from the concert to the Tropicana, some wounded. People were incorrectly reporting shots fired at several different hotels surrounding shooting, Tropicana being one of them. So they&#39;re carrying a stretcher in case the come upon a casualty inside the Tropicana that needs to be carried out.</p>

<p>If the Facebook post is accurate this would have to be after the firing would have ended since the security manager would have needed time to receive the call and head into work.</p>

<p>What they are doing is moving fast, throwing caution to the wind sort of, with a stretcher, and two unarmed guys, one of whom is carrying a mysterious bag.</p>

<p>So they have an objective. They are headed there with haste. The two guys in back are not VIP’s, but their destination could have a VIP there in need of medical attention. Hence the stretcher. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but conspiracy theories need to hold up to at least a basic shaking of the box. If there were active shooter at 8 other locations then there would be some sort of fall out from that due to 1000s and 1000s of witnesses. I mean 10k-15k+ witnesses easy and........... nothing. Not even 1% coming forward. </p>

<p>because what I&#39;m saying is the sort of logical progression of a well established common base line of both the location and the reactions of reasonable people. You really want to claim it&#39;s just speculation when I say a Vegas casino is packed with thousands of people at 10pm on a weekend? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a reasonable reaction of those thousands of people to have either come under fire or been under threat of other shooters but not even 1% says anything? It&#39;s pure speculation to claim that if there was shooters and most of all active shooters at locations with 1000s and 1000s of people that someone out of those thousands of people would of been hit by the gun fire? Where these 8 casino location shooters just firing up in the air? They just missed everyone? Yet again, no one says anything. </p>

<p>Sure.. Ok. </p>
