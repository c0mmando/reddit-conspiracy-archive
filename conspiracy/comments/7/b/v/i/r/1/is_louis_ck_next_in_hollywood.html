       I just got a text from my buddy who works in Hollywood:
      </p>
      <p>
       Him: Just got word through the Hollywood grapevine. Louis CK is about to lose his career.
      </p>
      <p>
       Me: Why? Is he a part of this sex ring?
      </p>
      <p>
       H: He's a part of something, but he's hours away from going down like Weinstein, Spacey, etc. Evidently some story is about to hit the NY Times today or tomorrow and he got word so he canceled literally every media event he had for the rest of the week.
      </p>
      <p>
       M: What all do you know?
      </p>
      <p>
       H: I heard rumors sometimes he just randomly whips his dick out. But it's probably something worse that no one knows about.
      </p>
      <p>
       M: It's getting wild out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       H: Right now everyone's going crazy in Hollywood. Careers are dropping like flies, rumors are swirling, agents are losing money and clients... and it's every day. He canceled his entire premiere for a movie he wrote, directed, and stars in. This ain't gonna be good.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also just sent a tweet to me by someone with the handle of @AisleSeat who is talking about it.

       Seems like they're just rehashing old stories for social justice points. Of course we know female predators like lena dunham, hope solo, and britney griner are untouchable along with most female child molesters in general in our communities.

       the only name i recognized was lena dunham who in her book wrote extensively on how she used to molest her younger sister when she was a kid. This continued into Lena's teen years with her masturbating next to her sleeping sister and what not.

       that seems likely, not particulary a fan but as far as i know he is not really system is he? I thought he dumped the whole thing a while ago to be his own boss on the internets? Maybe it didn't work, or maybe it worked too well... :D

       Yeah I heard that at least a few years ago if not longer. It seems like the kind of thing he'd do. Not sexual nature of it to be personally gratifying like Weinstein and others, but the trolling and making someone VERY uncomfortable part to be an asshole.

       The interesting thing is that all of these allegations are just people talking. No evidence, really. You could get five women to say the same thing about any politician, any famous person, actor, comedian... and no more career.  It doesn't matter if it's true or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Louis' case, man... I really liked his work. If it's true, it's too bad for his career, his family... and of course for the women he was inappropriate with.

      <p>
       I wonder if Hollywood is picking the low fruit on the trees and throwing them under the bus intentionally. To keep our attention away from... what?

       It's called a "limited hangout". They're getting rid of the low fruit as you said, busting them with sex related crimes, hoping to either appease us and make us stop pursuing them, or take our attention off of pedophiilia being prevalent in politics, royal family, former presidents and social leaders; the "big fish".

       And my guess is one or two of the low hanging fruit will be falsely accused, and be able to prove it.  When they do and start talking about how these allegations ruined their life when the "big fish" scandal comes out there will be terror in the ranks of the media to report it.  They will also sue, and win hefty settlements.  This will further quell any revelations, true or not, and the story dies.  It is brilliant. Sick but brilliant.

       I wasn't really talking about Weinstein. I was talking about Kevin Spacey. I think Weinstein really pissed someone powerful off, and they decided to throw him to the sharks.  It happened
       <em>
        fast
       </em>
       .  One day "everybody knew" and the next day the media was actively attacking him. Almost as if they had marching orders. It looked coordinated. After listening to the morning news hitpiece on the car radio on the way to work, I said to myself "That guy really pissed someone off."  Watching the MSM over the next 48 hours was amazing. It was totally coordinated.

       How is it different than any other big story of this type. When so many people in an industry knows, then its a huge story very quickly. I don't see how this has to be coordinated. In fact it would be extremely hard to coordinate.

       Because when it breaks, there is a rush for your organization to have their own reporting. And once someone that powerful has people speaking out, all the other victims now have cover where they didn't before. This is pretty normal for this stuff. Given what we have learned about his targeting of his victims with former Mossad agents for investigation and harassment when they didn't speak out, it's completely understandable.

       You just explained it yourself.. people are terrified of being sued or repercussions. So all you have to do is control the people at the top and everyone follows suit.

       Not hard at all when you control the media. The media is controlled by a few powerful entities.

       No it isn't. There is more variety of media available to people than at any time in human history. The notion that some small group controls all info is ridiculous. Think about just 30 years ago. There were four channels that had news. That's it. So we are to believe that somehow now its more consolidated? Bullshit. That's a belief to fit a story, not reality.

       Do you realize if people come out and report on things alone or without the big media groups breaking ground they get sued? There is protection if other big companies report on something. And a couple rich groups control the big companies.

       You are very naive to think the way you do. Here's a way to find out.. try it... try to make a claim like this against someone powerful and see what happens...

       It's more centralized.. the people in power have gained more power and they can bully people more financially because there is nothing to stop them.

       The dude talks about masturbation constantly in his stand up, and stands there on stage "fake masturbating" infront of his audience for 30 unbearable seconds. He totally did it. Now why the media is focusing so much on this and not on Vegas is still a point. But Louis CK was totally a pervert just like all the rest of them coming down.

       They were travelling comics, this isn't a typical professional work environment. He's not employing them, they're not working for the same company. They would have an agency but otherwise they're independent entertainers.

       Comedians on the road are drinking and fucking as they go. Professional conduct? There's no HR department.. There's comedy clubs, bars and they're performing in front of drunk people.

       If you read the article, you'll find that this happened to two female comedians. They were professionals that thought they were spending time with another professional, this wasn't a 'do you want to come back to my plan for sex' kind of thing. He asked them if he could masturbate in front of them and they thought it was a joke and laughed. You ask any woman in that situation, you would not be comfortable to say the least. Unsolicited exposure is illegal.

       No most people do not. Especially after hours when you are partying. I do not know what fanasty world you are living in but that's not how the world works. Im not saying I like it but that's what people expect when you invite them to a hotel room after the bars close.

       And this wasn't people meeting strangers in a bar. These were people who thought they were spending time with another professional in their field. There was nothing indicating his intentions.

       I was just listening to a podcast with Bert Kreisher where he mentioned being drunk late at night with a female comedian who was in a relationship and asked him if he'd masturbate in the same room with her because I guess that wasn't cheating in her eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       She tells him not to tell another comedian (I think Rich Vos) and the next time he sees Rich he asks Bert if that girl asked him to masturbate in front of her, so apparently this is a common thing for her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comedians are on the road all the time, drinking, probably fucking each other from time to time. We don't know the whole story as far as these allegations go. If Louis is a confirmed sexual predator I'll write him off, but the jury is still out in my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also do we really need to ask permission before any kind of sexual escalation? You flirt, women basically give you signals if they're into you, and the guy tries his luck. Most women I know would be instantly turned off if you asked for permission to kiss her, but you also have to be able the read the situation and realize if it's a good idea or not. Sometimes you get turned down, just don't be a dick and back off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had girls kiss me seemingly out of nowhere a couple times, I wasn't attracted and was just trying to be friendly. I simply turned them down kindly and respectfully, realizing that they must have misread me.

       Let's take this scenario - you're out having fun with your friend. You meet someone out, enjoying each other's company. Bars have closed but you want to keep having fun so you go back to the new guys place. You're chatting and he asks if he can masturbate in front of you. Obviously he is having a laugh? Nothing else has been said that would indicate that he had any inclination that you were here for anything sexual. Then he gets undressed and starts masturbating in front of you.

       Snippet from the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       '"As soon as they sat down in his room, still wrapped in their winter jackets and hats, Louis C.K. asked if he could take out his penis, the women said.
      </p>
      <p>
       They thought it was a joke and laughed it off. “And then he really did it,” Ms. Goodman said in an interview with The New York Times. “He proceeded to take all of his clothes off, and get completely naked, and started masturbating.”'
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody says that out of the blue, either. I'd be inclined to think it was a joke. The other option is the man has a screw loose because why would he have the audacity to come straight out and say that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus he makes masturbation jokes often in his skits. Not out of the realm of possibility, is it?

       If he asked for permission you don't think he somehow thought they were into it? Like if he didn't care if they consented why would he even ask? Why not just drop his pants immediately?

      <p>
       He probably misread them. Also there's not a ton of detail, how long were they in his room? Were they flirting? Did they object or express any discomfort with what he was doing?

       Dude, they didn't say yes. They thought it was a joke. Imagine yourself in a room with another man and he asks you this. He's a comedian. Would you take him seriously? How would you feel better f he started masturbating in front of you?

       It's a bit more than miscommunication. Whipping your dick out is coming on hella strong. Like, test the waters! Even if I was on a date with a guy and we ended up somewhere private and he asked me this, I would think it's a joke. Who would be that brash? And if he started then I'd be super uncomfortable. If there was no prior indication that he wanted to do something sexual, and there was no relationship or expectation from both parties, this is not miscommunication. This is a guy who decided he would like to masturbate and did not take into consideration that he did not indicate to the other parties involved that this was what he wanted them there for.

       Actually, they went back to his before that was mentioned. He gave no indication that he wanted anything sexual from them until they were at his place. If he had of been up front, things would have turned out differently. Actually give someone a choice.

       Snippet from the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       'As soon as they sat down in his room, still wrapped in their winter jackets and hats, Louis C.K. asked if he could take out his penis, the women said.
      </p>
      <p>
       They thought it was a joke and laughed it off. “And then he really did it,” Ms. Goodman said in an interview with The New York Times. “He proceeded to take all of his clothes off, and get completely naked, and started masturbating.”'
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't know about you, but I see no indication of them saying yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, they weren't forced to, but shock does weird things. Like I said in another comment, when my aunt told my mum their gran had died they both started laughing hysterically. Emotions are not plain and simple and when you are shocked or uncomfortable, sometimes you can't take yourself out of the situation. Heard the term deer in the headlights? You have fight, you have flight and you have freeze.

       Your fucked up mom and aunt's reactions to unexpected bad news really don't compare to this situation at all though. He asked before he did it and they thought he was joking but it turned out he wasn't. How is that his fault??? 
Since we're sharing dumb family anecdotes for some reason now, I once asked my dad if I could paint my room matte black when I was a teenager and he said "yeah sure, that sounds like a great idea" and then I got in trouble when I did it a few weeks later because he maintained that he was "so clearly being sarcastic". I'm telling you, it wasn't that long ago that "not saying no" basically WAS consent.
      </p>

       Based on your posts in this thread I can only guess that you're a virgin and fresh out of countless school/church/progressive-parent discussions about the crucially important concept of "consent", but that whole thing (which is definitely important!) just flat out didn't exist until relatively recently. As a woman born in the seventies I have to tell you that this "scandal" these women are describing make him seem almost chivalrous for asking if they minded if he indulged his personal kink in the first place, though I'm sure in your mind I'm just another rapist apologist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this attack on Louis CK is kinda bullshit. It's clearly either a couple nobodies jumping on the bandwagon, or, more likely imo, is actually a calculated character assassination of an awkward guy with an embarrassing kink all to water-down the WAY WAY WAY worse accusations about others much more powerful than him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't enjoy his last couple shows personally, and idgaf how people get off as long as nobody gets hurt, but this mob attacking him for masturbating after asking women if they minded reminds me SO MUCH of the time my entire jr high school seemed to join in relentlessly mocking the weird fat kid for abruptly kissing one of the popular girls (on the mouth, and in the crowded school hallway) when she put her hand on his shoulder and said "thank you" while returning a book she had borrowed in the last period.  It was brutal and is one of those things I hate myself for not speaking up about, especially since in retrospect this poor kid was so clearly "on the spectrum" that he probably shouldn't have been left to fend for himself in mainstream classes :(
      </p>
      <p>
       Asking if he can jerk off in front of other adults is NOTHING like the rapes and coercion and abuse we've been talking about. Anyone who argues it is, really isn't capable of reason.

       He should be exposed even if he didn't touch them, what he was doing isn't right and he shouldn't do it, it isn't normal, do you understand this?

       Just because there was no rape involved, doesn't mean we should just ignore it and not tell everyone that this dude has issues.

       So, that time he started telling a woman is his sexual fantasies over the phone and masturbating, did he ask that time?

       Did anyone ever say yes to him? I'd be flabbergasted in that situation and find it difficult to probably say anything.

       I'll give you that, but the chances are pretty high. The two comedians never said yes to him. And as for the laughing, have you never heard of hysterics? Sometimes when people are shocked or extremely uncomfortable they don't react emotionally the way you would expect them to. For example, my aunt tuned up at our house one day and told my mum that their grandmother had died. They both burst out laughing. They laughed for ages until they cried. Emotions are a weird thing. This is not unbelievable to me. They said they were in shock.

       The article very specifically dances around not saying what their response is, but judging by all the context clues, and the fact that had he had done it without their consent this would be a whole different, bigger story, I think it's pretty clear they consented. "We didn't think he'd actually do it" sounds like they said yes, but didn't expect him to actually do it.

       C'mon now, they themselves talked about how they were laughing when he asked, and during it. They weren't both laughing like someone just died and they had a weird emotional response, they laughed because some doughy, then no-name comedian was whacking it in front of them.

       Snippet from the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       'As soon as they sat down in his room, still wrapped in their winter jackets and hats, Louis C.K. asked if he could take out his penis, the women said.
      </p>
      <p>
       They thought it was a joke and laughed it off. “And then he really did it,” Ms. Goodman said in an interview with The New York Times. “He proceeded to take all of his clothes off, and get completely naked, and started masturbating.”'
      </p>
      <p>
       They thought it was a joke and laughed it off. You are reading into things and attempting to put words into people's mouths. Make all the excuses you want, this was unsolicited behaviour. If you think otherwise, good luck with your future law suits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shock is shock. They stated they were in shock. Many women would find being in that situation to be traumatic. If you can't empathise, that's fine, but it's not fair of you to tell someone what is and isn't a legitimate emotional response. We all function differently.

       It wasn't unsolicited, he literally asked them first. And they never said they said no, they very specifically danced around what their response was, but judging by literally all of the context clues, it seems like it was in the affirmative.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the other stories make it pretty clear he always asked first, and only went through with it when given consent.

       I can empathize, but to say they were only laughing because they were in hysterics over having him jerk off in front of them is you putting words in people's mouths.

       You can be shocked and laughing because something is funny. To take "they were shocked and laughing" and making it akin to the hysterical laughing someone might experience when having an abnormal emotional response like someone in your family just died, is absolutely putting words in peoples' mouths. You're hearing hoof beats and thinking zebras.

       Okay, let's say they were shocked and found it funny. Why would they feel they need to report it? Because they did not consent. It's possible to find something humorous and disgusting at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       However they felt about it, they did not say okay. Like I have said before, not saying no doesn't not elicit consent. Saying it sounds like this, or I think this does not mean that is what happened.

       I mean there's a part of you that's right, but he is a comedian and vulgar at times, if the worst thing Louis C.K. does is whip out his dick to a few WOMEN who just didn't think he would do it, I think he should be fine these other actors and people are raping kids. It seems to me like these women are just hoping on a bandwagon. I think if these call outs weren't happening not only would no one know about this because it wouldn't be reported.

       True but if I read the articles right it would seem like consent was given in most cases, and when it wasn't he didn't. And of course this part is speculation on my part, but the 2 women didn't say they turned him down and instead said they thought he wasn't serious so it sounds, to me at least, that they might have said something along the lines of consent maybe even jokingly them selves and realized that no he was serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're very right that just cause its not as bad as the other things happening doesn't mean it shouldn't matter. I guess I meant we as a subreddit shouldn't focus on C.K. more than the other things happening.

       Hanging out with a woman over a drink doesn't mean you can whip your dick out and start masturbating. Either you're a troll, a fucking moron, or a product of the way our current society grooms "men" on how it's okay to be fucking pigs. Whatever it is, it's disgusting and I can't wait for the fall.

       There's a real problem here with wanting to believe all sorts of awful things about people you hate and disagree with and punish them accordingly, based on whatever flimsy evidence, but when its public figures that tend to be popular on here, THAT's when people/comments like this show up to defend and excuse the behavior or the accused, to claim we should wait for more details or evidence, or to even say the accusations are a lie or the behavior is okay.

       It's interesting to read comments in threads like this versus threads about 'Pizzagate', just saying.

       Also it's not like Louis told them they'll get a role in a movie but only if they do what he says.
      </p>
      <p>
       He asked for permission, apparently he misread them, for some reason they didn't object and actually stayed. It's conceivable that he was just a dope who misread the situation, he might not have even known until later that it wasn't ok if they didn't leave or object.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weinstein was calculated. He abused his powerful position. He went as far as hiring private investigators to stalk his victims and disrupt their attempts at seeking help.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are drastically different scenarios, unless there's more information about Louis that we're not seeing yet.

       I loved Louie but his entire comedy routine revolves around sexual shame so we all knew that was coming from somewhere.

       He put out a couple excellent specials, although I thought his most recent was mediocre.
      </p>
      <p>
       His whole delivery was kind of unique in that he came off like he was telling a story just to you. It wasn't the typical slick, canned delivery. Also his work ethic  pushed other comedians to keep working hard and coming up with new material every year instead of rehashing the same act for years on end. He raised the standard. I know for sure he pushed Bill Burr in that regard, having in hand in Bill Burrs success means he's important.

       I couldn't blame a guy for trying to just make some money if they've been in comedy for 20+ years. Sometimes you just need to make sure you can retire or support your family.

       Two jokes that immediately come to mind are the one where he's with a girl from a comedy club all night, every time he tries to escalate things she denies him. Eventually she leaves and the next day she's upset that he didn't just go for it. The joke is that she basically wants him to just go for it, essentially risking raping her on the off chance that she's into it. That doesn't seem rapey, it's the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another one was how when he sees a hot young woman now that he's older he just wants to give her a safe ride home rather than fuck her, and then he jokes that he'd rather just jack off to the thought of her anyway. Definitely not rapey, but he does mention jacking off.

       He works at a production company so I'm sure there has been a ton of inside chatter about it. I actually didn't realize it was so prevalent at the moment or I wouldn't have posted it. I don't really frequent Twitter and haven't been looking at news today.

       i love when people swarm and bully a guy for not knowing an article existed, probably because he posted befoe it was released and forgot about the comment. holy fuck, it's reddit, not a points game. remember the reason we're here, for discussion and gaining knowledge. not to assail people who made an unimportant mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
       if anything, the fact that you got such a happy hard-on for downvoting this poor guy is the saddest thing here. OP is a good person and you fucked him over with your downvotes. you call him ignorant, when funnily enough you're the ignorant one not paying attention to time of comment and time of article.

       A lot! I've been reading it for 9-10 years. In the beginning there were a few blinds a week and more posting other celeb stories and commenting on it. It seemed more like it was written by a lawyer. As it got more popular, more and more blinds started coming every day. Then there was a format switch (which most readers suspected was an ownership switch) and the blinds became silly. It seems more like the original lately.

       Another one of those widely known stories. The funny thing is the timing. Lots of interesting child related accusations are popping up and every time it does they throw a mainstream figure under the bus for exposing themselves to adults, not children.

       Good. I don't get how people just idolize or become fans of these famous people all around. You got to be borderline brain dead to figure out when people like this touch risky subjects and him specifically as a comedian. Doesn't it make you wonder how fucked in the head they secretly are.

       I'd like to think there is still possible redemption if this was long ago, and he truly apologizes.  But if this is still a common thing, then I see the fall out being worse.  In cases like Spacey and Weinstein these were constant ongoing situations.

       He is known in the comedy industry as a sexual harasser and he is known for flashing his genitals and masturbating/fondling himself in front of the women he works with. i know this because i work in the same industry. Spoken to too many women (still wanting to keep it secret as they were worried about hurting their careers) with the same experiences about the same guy (Louie).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was hard to hear about these things because i am/was a huge Louie CK fan. But at a certain point, there was just no denying the legitimacy of these claims from so many women who did not know each other, all wanting me to promise secrecy, all saying the same stuff.

       I've been beating this drum for years. However, he seems more like a lone pervert than anything organized. Weinstein was organized, but it was more like his own personal intelligence network. Spacey is plugged into Epstein's Island, Geffen's Yacht, and Singer's "Digital Entertainment Network" parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine a lot of lone perverts are going to go down to help cover up Spacey and the ones who do this in a connected and organized fashion. Especially when that connects to Washington and Silicon Valley.

       they're trying to confuse the issue.  Louis CK is just a pervy comedian using his fame to get his rocks off.  It's completely different than an employer or hollywood producer threatening a young actor's career if they don't have sex with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Louis isn't preying on underage girls, and he doesn't have the power to blackball female comedians from the industry.  If they chose to watch him jerk off because they thought it would be good for their career, that's on them.

       Louis CK's downfall has been coming for a while. 8 months ago, reports were starting to trickle out about him forcing women to watch him masturbate. Roseanne Barr even talking about it on Twitter. I noticed on Youtube that Louis was no longer promoted as "the comedian's comedian," with Doug Stanhope now occupying that position.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shadow has been quietly closing over Louis for a long time.

        Footnote: He confirms to the stereotype. All the celebrities who became hysterical and unhinged about Trump are now being exposed as pedophiles and perverts. As I quoted before: "If the fucking bastard wins, we all hang" --Hillary Clinton (So basically: If you want to see a list of the people set to fall, pay attention to the ones becoming unhinged about Trump. They know that, with his ascendancy, their protection has been withdrawn.)

       what's the worst thing he did? jerk off on the phone without informing the girl he was talking to? who even cares? some girl i was talking to started masturbating and didn't bother to ask if i was okay with that. im as much of a victim as any of these people are.

       I hate Louis C.K., but i don't think he has shown any signs of misconduct (sexual or otherwise) to assume he is a creep.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he does randomly whip his dick out to the public, then he is just...weird, or mentally ill, but I wouldn't classify him as being a predator.

       Dude, they didn't say yes. They thought it was a joke. Imagine yourself in a room with another man and he asks you this. He's a comedian. Would you take him seriously? How would you feel better f he started masturbating in front of you?
