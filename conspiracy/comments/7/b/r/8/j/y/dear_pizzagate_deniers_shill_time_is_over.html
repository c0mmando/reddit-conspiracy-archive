       I agree with you that just because one bad thing is happening we should not care about other bad things happening. With that being said, why don't more people in the U.S. care about the thousands of people who die from guns? If your argument is that we should care about all the bad things happening, where is the outrage that the Columbine shooting isn't even in the top ten mass shootings in the U.S..

       Did the guns stand up, walk into that school and kill those kids? Or did those disturbed kids pick them up, load them, point them, and kill those kids?  The root of the problem isn't the tool, it's the user(s).  There are laws against speeding, people still speed.  There are laws against stealing, people still steal.  There are laws against murder, people still kill (with guns, knifes, baseball bats, crowbars, etc).  You can't legislate morality, you can't make anybody do a damn thing.  Just because guns are illegal, criminals will still get their hands on them.  Criminals don't follow laws already on the books, making up new ones won't make them start all of the sudden.

       I never said New laws need to be put in place. We have laws against terrorism so why do so many people claim that we need more immigration laws to stop the terrorists? Your own argument says bad people will do bad things.

       You didn't say anything about new laws, I felt as though it was implied. My fault if I misinterpreted you.  But yeah, bad people will do bad things. I'm not advocating anarchy, I was just trying to illustrate a point, laws don't stop people from being turds. I feel, as wild as it sounds, collectively we all need to look within ourselves, we are the progenitors of this chaos.  We allowed the negativity to swell, we have to eliminate it

       No offense taken here. I am with you 100%, I have known about the sleaze in Hollywood since I was kid, but no one seemed to make big deal of it at the time.  The "casting couch" has been talked about for years, why is it now a big deal. Were the young actors and actresses 30 years ago less deserving of our outrage then now?

       I think a lot of our problems are because very few of us are taught to think critically.  We are conditioned by society from a very young age. School is more about making us robots instead of teaching us to actually question and learn.

       The mentally ill are NOT able to acquire a gun.  Thus, the laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Showing that gun-control 'laws' don't work and people will acquire a gun even when they are legally not allowed to do so.

      <p>
       People shooting other people up en masse is by definition mentally ill.

       If the mentally ill are NOT able to acquire guns as you say, then a whole lot of people are either not doing their jobs, or maybe just maybe the definition of mentally ill is not what I think it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your last statement, there is almost one gun owned per person in this country (
       <a href="https://qz.com/1095899/gun-ownership-in-america-in-three-charts/">
        https://qz.com/1095899/gun-ownership-in-america-in-three-charts/
       </a>
       ).  These are just the guns owned by the private citizens, so now add in the number of guns that are government owned and its plausible to say that there is basically one gun per person in this country. There is about 252 million religious followers in the U.S.

       That is a lot of "good" guys with guns and a prayer, seems to me mass shootings should be non existent with that going for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       This last church shooting easily could have never happened if people (USAF)did their jobs. I think we have to use the gun controls that are already on the books , and use them consistently before we go around  saying gun control does not work.

       Well, when you find a magic pill to get people to do their jobs, let me know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, that does not change the fact that the laws are on the books.   And simply 'writing a law' DOES NOT WORK if it is not enforced.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the main problem at the end of the day is not even enforcement: it is the heart and mind of the shooter.   Which gets right back to better mental health treatment which is needed.  And even to prayer, which the shooter probably should be engaging in for his mental health.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also gets to corruption in our government -- because too often rogue elements in the government actually use mentally ill people as patsies for false flags.

       No I am a regular to the sub, I just don't comment as much as some. Also I have never fully subscribed to the patsie false flag theory as much as many others have. I think we need to take a good hard look at ourselves in the mirror as a country and realize that we are are all accountable for what happens. We need to have the hard conversations respectfully, not just throwing insults at each other. We have to have open minds when having those discussions. We can't come to discussion with bias in thoughts. That's why I don't immediately think every shooting is a false flag government patsie.

       I believe Pizzagate affects all of us because the people who are in charge of the big decisions in the world, who are responsible for war and hunger when it need not be that way are the very same people who are indulging in sex with underage victims. They are being blackmailed and corrupted by the use of child sex slaves. I truly believe this to be the case, and even if you don't care about children for whatever reason, the fact that this mechanism for ultimate control over a person is in place has an effect on how our tax money is spent, etc.

        Over a dozen women have accused Trump of rape, he bragged about walking in on naked teenager models, bragged about sexual assault, and was friends with Epstein. Sounds like he fits right in with his political/Hollywood pals.

       In what way are you explaining any of the questions mentioned by OP?  Yea so trump acts immature sometimes but guess what Timmy, so do you with the “But..but...somebody said something about trump doing some bad things to”  Sounds like a 2nd grader level comment.  By the way many of us don’t trust trump either and if he is involved then we need to get him to.. but like him or not you should have saved that ignorant comment because it is very revealing as to your intelligence level and/or your motive here.  Is it because you have no response to OP questions that you make an Absolutely absurd and childish response about accusations against Trump that wether true or not are dwarfed by terrible facts in reference to kidnapping kids in Haiti and the terrifying evil content on alefantis IG.  That man should be investigated for the IG content alone!  How is it that you are so easily convinced Trump is guilty of so called accusations or anything else close to the level of kidnapping, trafficking, raping children but no matter how many facts, pictures, or dots that connect in relation to pizzagate you people refuse even consider it true.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had never seen those IG pictures, podestas art, or heard the facts surrounding silsbys arrest and someone sat me down showed it to me,  the last thing that i would say in reference to this post is “but... but.. president trump said you can “grab a woman by the Pu$$y”.  (Which btw is not bragging about sexual assault as you exaggerated.  What he actually said was the if you have a lot of money you can grab a woman by the pus and she doesn’t care which nowadays is sadly true).  But, regardless of that trump comment It does not make it pizzagate okay or irrelevant and it makes no sense for someone to respond to those facts in that manner.  I hope you are a shill because if not something is wrong with you and your sidekick happyog.  It’s almost as if your trying to defend pizzagate suspects or somehow trying to distract.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the record idgaf about Trump or trust him.  But tell me this how are you so matter of fact on trumps guilt but not pizzagate when the comparison of actual evidence for pizzagate crimes far outweigh your exaggerated claims of trumps crimes.  Further, if There was half of the amount of evidence out there for trumps guilt as there is pizzagate evidence and you pointed it out in a post the last effing thing I would say is “but.. but... Cruz watches porn on Twitter”

       What kind of friend gets banned for life from Mar A Lago? What kind of friend doesn't even fly on Epstein's airplane, despite Clinton and Spacey flying multiple times.

       Trump was, at best, an associate of Epstein, who realized what he was all about and ceased all connection.

       Trump did fly on Epstein's plane.

       Trump's nominee for labor secretary is the reason that Epstein got a BS sentence of 13 months.

       Epstein had 14 different phone numbers for Trump in his personal book, including Trump's wife, houseman, and daughter.

       Trump and Epstein are both named in a lawsuit regarding the rape of a 13 year old in New York City in the 80's.

       When Epstein was asked under oath if he'd ever "socialized" with underaged girls with Donald Trump, he plead the fifth, sixth, and fourteenth amendments.

       Trump once said “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm assuming Trump banned Epstein to save his own ass. But Epstein being banned in the first place is still disputed.

       Looks like Trump and Epstein have been scratching each other backs for a while. Trump appointing Acosta proves that in my opinion.

       Trump is the perfect candidate to be dragged through the mud for pizzagate in my opinion.

       You linked to an 800 page deposition. You might want to actually quote what page you're talking about.

       The actual quote is on page 73. All it says is that he shared a plane trip from florida to NY. Not that he went to lolita island. And it's sourced to a claim made by Epstein's brother.

       The same reason any number of people aren't on the flight logs. There are plenty of individuals who have outright claimed themselves they've flown on Epstein's plane in the 90's and 2000's, but don't appear in the flight logs.
      </p>

       The brother claimed he only flew once because he was only present for one flight that Trump was on. How could the brother know the passenger manifest for flights he wasn't aboard?

       Most likely because they flew dozens of times. Also you're assuming that the passenger manifest on flight logs are 100% accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know that none of the logs show Clinton flying to Lolita Island aboard Epstein's plane? They flew together to Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, China, Brunei, London, New York, Azores, Belgium, Norway, Russia and Africa. But never to the infamous island, according to the logs.
      </p>
      <p>
       That alone leads me to question  their validity, because I'd wager Clinton has most likely been to that island before. I'll bet you'd wager that too.
      </p>
      <p>
       And like I said above, plenty of people have claimed themselves they flew on Epstein's plane but don't appear in the logs.

       It truly is. When I was Christian, it was really hard confronting the fact that lots of churches harbor pedophile priests. When I was a democrat, it was hard confronting the fact that people who were part of my party were committing rapes and pedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are really difficult discussions to have, but they still need to happen if we're going to end this problem.

       I think a lot of people trying to expose this are getting a lot of flack for it, I do hope one day that all their work will be justified. I can only think about all the posts in years past that exposed something dark in Hollywood and were only met with down votes and people calling them liars. 
This one is a big one, so big that people have a hard time wrapping their heads around it. For me I have no problem believing this, From the things I've read over the years and the research I've conducted it really does sound plausible. This is real and hopefully the one that blows everything up and finally convinces people of the truth.

       It's useless to respond unless one builds up some kind of copy-pasta bullshit the same way Pizzagaters do. But if we do, then we're called shills for putting effort into calling out your bullshit. It's a lose-lose situation. It happens to me all the time (I don't delete my comments and sometimes copy and paste previous comments).
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been called a "pedo", "shill", told to kill myself, etc. All because I looked at the evidence, just like Pizzagaters asked, and think it's complete bullshit.

         Nevermind the 100% complete and total lack of evidence of a (pedo) crime. No witnesses, no victims, no paper trail, no crime scene. Literally, nothing.

         Nevermind the fact that every email Pizzagaters cling to are easily explained (the $65k email posted by OP is a classic example: Written by some blowhard Obama-hating Republican that calls Obama "Hobama" with no connection to the White House. Yet, it's somehow used as evidence of a crime against the accused.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's been debunked hundreds of times, but Pizzagaters are still lying and posting about it. But you accuse anyone who points this out to be a shill.
        </p>
       </li>

        <p>
         Nevermind the fact that I get called names every time I point out the
         <strong>
          constant lies
         </strong>
         told by Pizzagaters.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It's a shit theory, with shit proponents who call everyone who see through their bullshit names. Trying to argue against Pizzagaters' bullshit is next to impossible when a bunch of PG circle-jerkers copy-paste all their shit, and call anyone who does the same, but disagrees, a "shill". Again, it's lose-lose.

       Not arguing either side, say Obama did actually spend 65k on a hotdog party or whatever it was called. Even if that's completely genuine and literal, doesn't that seem too far fetched to be the reality?

       I have no idea who's children they are... that's a major point of concern. This man, with no children of his own, for some reason has many pictures of children on his Instagram page, with tags such as #chickenlovers and #cumpanda. Excuse my language but one would have to be fucking retarded to not understand the significance of this anomaly.

       I believe these children are victims of child sex trafficking. "Chickenlover" is well known slang in the gay community for someone who preys on underage males and cumpanda... well if you think there is any reasonable explanation for writing "cumpanda" as a comment on pictures (not just one picture) of children, there is probably something wrong with you. It may have something to do with bruising as in punching in the eye but I honestly don't know, but what I do know is that it's creepy as fuck to write as a comment on photos of children, and that's what you wanted me to give you examples of, so mission accomplished.

       Could you show me a source on that that isn't pizzagate related? I did a google search on the term and most results brought back the episode of South Park, but I did see an open-source online dictionary use that definition (although i don't particularly put much stock into that).

       So your answer is that you have no idea, the phrase does not appear to be linked to any actual thing, and you're not even sure if the phrase actually is "cum panda" like you're assuming.

Once again, Comet Ping Pong is officially under investigation for child pornography found on their website. Have fun protecting elite pedophiles.

       Bravo. You drove me to the point where I said have fun protecting elite pedophiles so now you can finally say you had me pegged correctly for SOMETHING, albeit something rather trivial. You ARE protecting elite pedophiles. To say that this stuff isn't happening at the highest levels of power is so willfully ignorant that I have no more words for you. Have a nice life.

       has been unfairly subjecting you to the elite ivory tower methods called Lo-Gek. Lo-Gek is a mind control technique where people who make claims are BURDENED with the responsibility to back them up with credible evidence. You stay woke internet detective because elite pedos will continue to prosper until wild and baseless accusations aren't obstructed by evil Lo-Gek.

       Regular humans produce offspring or know others who have produced offspring. Regular modern humans often share photos of their offspring, especially when they do cute stuff.

      <p>
       For some reason, when you see regular humans doing this regular human behavior, you accuse them of being pedophiles. I hope that reason is because you're blinded by partisanship, and desire to blame democrats for everything, as petty as that is. However, I
       <em>

       You get caught up in the whole pizza parlor aspect of it.  That entire aspect of it was/is a limited hangout.  It was pushed that way to discredit all future investigations into anything to do with elite pedophilia, and human trafficking.  So when the shit really hits the fan, they can push it off as some half-cocked conspiracy.  I'm not saying there are actual kids being raped and murdered in that stupid pizza place, but the individuals being accused, they are most certainly up to something.

       The claim is absolute BS. Presidents can bring in outside food. I started doing a bit of research on Presidents bringing in food, and funny enough I discovered I like my McDonald's burgers the same way Trump does (assuming his former bodyguard isn't lying)

       "Common knowledge". I couldn't find a single source corroborating that claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did, however, find proof of several presidents having food brought in from outside the White House. Trump likes McDonald's and KFC, and has had those brought in. Obama and Michelle have had food from Ben's Chilli Bowl, Good Stuff Eatery, and Five Guys brought into the White House. Bush Jr. and Sr. have had food brought in from Equinox.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where are you getting your claim that food cannot be brought in from outside the White House?

         Which ones are pedophilic exactly? You linked to a large pastebin so it might behoove you to specifiy since you're making a stronger claim than most (that they are weird and inappropirate to be associated with a kid friendly place)

         Clinton didn't help silsby, he helped everyone else. There's no evidence silsby was anything but a religious fundie with a white savior complex misguidedly trying to help people. An idiot, sure, but the parents knew she had the kids and thought they'd get a better life rather than starve to death in haiti. Do you have any connection of silsby to her church to the clintons/global pedo conspiracy before the haiti incident? She's from a church in idaho.

         My favorite one, do you know anything about the guy who sent that email, or why he would know about obama's taxpayer funded pedo parties? He's just a conservative who hates obama and shits on him all the time in his emails, that line sounds like a fox news chyron, people just take it literally because it was in a wikileaks document even though the guy isn't connected to that political machine. (stratfor is a shitty "private intelligence agency" not any arm of the democrats or government, it was laughable they ever got a wikileaks release to begin with)

       To add to 3), the stratfor guy is probably talking about when Obama flew a pizza chef to the Whitehouse for a party. It happened about a month before the date on the email.

       Clinton absolutely did help Silsby... he literally had to fly to Haiti just to get Laura Silsby out of jail- Laura Silsby, convicted child trafficker, who now has a cushy job as the Marketing VP for Alert Sense, a company directly connected to our Amber Alert System, and that isn't suspicious to you?

I think Obama spent about $65,000 of the tax-payers money flying in
pizza/dogs from Chicago for a private party at the White House not long
ago, assume we are using the same channels?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is "waitresses" in quotation marks in the e-mail and "what does assume we are using the same channels" mean?

       Waitresses is some joke we don't have much context for. Imagine this same email was sent by your boss, would you take it to mean your boss was part of a pedo ring with Obama? Because that's how close this stratfor guy is.

       Why should I look at pictures of kids doing normal kid things, babies eating pizza, and the Obamas playing ping pong and think pedophilia, exactly? Seriously man, one of those images is a reality show screen of a kid demanding pizza. You know pizza is still a food that people enjoy, right?

       To anyone who actually is going to take the time to explain or debunk any of these:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) They're just going to ignore any explanations you provide that don't result in the conclusion that pizzagate is real and that hot dogs means raping kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) You're going to get called a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) If you manage to argue someone into a corner they're just going to say "HOW CAN YOU DEFEND THESE PEDOPHILES???? THINK OF THE CHILDREN!!!" and possible call you a pedophile yourself.

       Our focus on the same out come must remain the same:
      </p>
      <p>
       Help those who cannot fight or speak for themselves
      </p>
      <p>
       Empower the current administration to take action
      </p>
      <p>
       Rid our society of this stain so that we can move forward
      </p>
      <p>
       Enact justice across the board
      </p>
      <p>
       Speak only when asked about this, be ready to state factual information
      </p>
      <p>
       Ignore shills and trolls, we've had this information on hand for a year, the connections and material have been proven over and over- current and recent events also point to this being true
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't lose faith (coming from a man who does not confess a fate to any god, just the good in the world) we can manifest the good in this world just like others have manifested pure evil

       None of those things are evidence of the crimes pizzagate alleges.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find a victim to give testimony, or a former participant. That would be evidence. All anyone brings up is innuendo and speculation. You'll never go mainstream without real evidence that a crime was committed.

         Well, "finding a dead body in a room full of weapons where the shots originated" is a bit more than suspicious. Any reasonable person in that situation would probably jump to the obvious conclusion. I think it's also safe to assume that forensics showed both that the guns (which had been legally purchased by Paddock) were recently fired, and that Paddock had gunpowder residue showing that he had recently fired guns. (I don't recall reading those specific details, but I'd guess they're considered too obvious to report.)

       I have to say I don't understand about half of what you wrote, but I think it's interesting that you bring up my response to the Vegas shooting, because that's a case where a crime indisputably happened. There were dozens of dead bodies in the street, and many more injured. No rational person would say "well we're not sure there was a shooter at all."
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate alleges that specific politicians committed acts of pedophilia and child trafficking, without ever showing evidence that those crimes even happened. If you dig into my history and find a post where I talk about how much I want to steal the Mona Lisa (presumably using a secret code that you figured out with help from 4chan), it's not going to mean much as long as the Mona Lisa is still hanging there in the Louvre.

       I'm just curious how often you're instructed to switch the topics you post to. You contradict even yourself if you compare las vegas to this on the basis that it's been a crowd sourced investigation with publicly available information.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's plenty to be suspicious about here. So either your definition of suspicious is very very defined to the cases you deem fit or your suspicion is targeted either on purpose or not. You can't logically look at the evidence posted and say "nah nothing to see here".
      </p>
      <p>
       But this message you're pumping of "it won't go mainstream lol guy cause you have no evidence" serves to undermine the power behind putting in the public eye for scrutiny. No one here who stands behind this investigation, theory, suspicion has any fear of it being scrutinized publicly the correct way.

       I do have one question for you tho, very direct. Are you or is someone near you wearing a blue vest?

       smoking guns, overlooking a concert venue full of people who just got shot to death, is comparable to...what exactly? Some emails you don't understand?

       A real crime has real victims. Paddock killed exactly 58 actual people, with names and identities. How many victims does pizzagate have? Can you name any? OP is alleging that no less than President Obama was involved in a conspiracy to rape children. That's a very serious allegation. Where's the evidence that the crime even occurred? A jokey email from some guy who has nothing to do with it?

       Is the blue vest different than your mona lisa tactic? The only difference is your mind is going to be blown later when you see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you're still trying to discredit pizzagate by trying to paint its believers as people who simply "assume too much" when there is literally thousands of well thought out posts displaying evidence that is publicly available. This thread alone has enough information to bring you to the completely sound and logical conclusion that we should be suspicious and that some action has been taken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please kind sir who questions everything yet offers nothing of substance take one of the logic strings used to verify pizzagate and offer contradictory information. President Obama drop in your response is some gold level baiting to splinter this discussion even  more. Asking for an exact number of verified victims to say that this at least deserves some suspicion and attention is flat out just insane and never used when investigating.

       Last line is also bait to personal insult when were discussing a topic .

      <p>
       Can you offer a contradictory explanation for those oh so silly emails about having minors in a pool? and if you can't why do you push the message that this cant and wont go public? Your answer is "no real evidence" "not really suspicious" "please give me accurate victim counts and living victims with experiences"- all you have to do to recognize how real this is, is look at Hollywood. And they've always said: DC is just like Hollywood you know, expect for ugly powerful people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I won't personally insult you, what I've started in your life will unravel much faster than you can control. Much like the Mona Lisa, your smile will change, the background will fade and you will find yourself before your gods. Come to your senses stop what you're doing.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That email actually gives the names and ages of three children: "Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto." Since you've known for over a year the identities of three real-life victims, surely by now you've located those children and gotten their testimony against their evil, child-prostituting grandmother, right? I mean you wouldn't just sit around for a year while these very specific kids are being passed around as party favors.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...unless they're not victims at all, and that email was just a mundane party invitation that you and others have misinterpreted to fit a patently ridiculous political agenda. You tell me which.

       I don't think I need to tell you which. Either way time will tell. Given what's happened in Hollywood recently and what's very very clearly unfolding there- wouldn't you like to revisit your assumption?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you genuinely believe people who followed pizzagate went for a casual look at one link or a video and said "man I'm sold". Then came here to post in defense of shilling tactics, in essence making themselves targets for ridicule and possibly putting them in danger (depending how tinfoil you are).
      </p>
      <p>
       Misinterpretation is another logical fallacy. You're saying "you just read it wrong" its a party invite either way- but giving ages and outlining the email the way they did seems very very specific almost like something you wouldn't say for a normal party? I've never done that with any invite.
      </p>
      <p>
       The effort you guys put in to coming here to "debunk" by insulting and using logical fallacies to draw away from the issue are highly suspicious. The rules of the board prohibit me taking my comment further than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       "surely by now you've located victims to testify". Same exact line as before. And you're attacking my person again by saying I'm illegible now. You're literally just spouting stuff from a list and offering nothing of value. Shame on you Charlie.

       Why can't you answer a simple question? I just want to know what you or anyone else has done to protect these specific victims. Certainly if you and the other pizzagaters believe these named children are being abused, and if you care about it, then you've done something! So what did you do, and what did you find?

       In what way are you explaining any of the questions mentioned by OP?  Yea so trump acts immature sometimes but guess what Timmy, so do you with the “But..but...somebody said something about trump doing some bad things to”  Sounds like a 2nd grader level comment.  By the way many of us don’t trust trump either and if he is involved then we need to get him to.. but like him or not you should have saved that ignorant comment because it is very revealing as to your intelligence level and/or your motive here.  Is it because you have no response to OP questions that you make an Absolutely absurd and childish response about accusations against Trump that wether true or not are dwarfed by terrible facts in reference to kidnapping kids in Haiti and the terrifying evil content on alefantis IG.  That man should be investigated for the IG content alone!  How is it that you are so easily convinced Trump is guilty of so called accusations or anything else close to the level of kidnapping, trafficking, raping children but no matter how many facts, pictures, or dots that connect in relation to pizzagate you people refuse even consider it true.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I had never seen those IG pictures, podestas art, or heard the facts surrounding silsbys arrest and someone sat me down showed it to me,  the last thing that i would say in reference to this post is “but... but.. president trump said you can “grab a woman by the Pu$$y”.  (Which btw is not bragging about sexual assault as you exaggerated.  What he actually said was the if you have a lot of money you can grab a woman by the pus and she doesn’t care which nowadays is sadly true).  But, regardless of that trump comment It does not make it pizzagate okay or irrelevant and it makes no sense for someone to respond to those facts in that manner.  I hope you are a shill because if not something is wrong with you and your sidekick happyog.  It’s almost as if your trying to defend pizzagate suspects or somehow trying to distract.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the record idgaf about Trump or trust him.  But tell me this how are you so matter of fact on trumps guilt but not pizzagate when the comparison of actual evidence for pizzagate crimes far outweigh your exaggerated claims of trumps crimes.  Further, if There was half of the amount of evidence out there for trumps guilt as there is pizzagate evidence and you pointed it out in a post the last effing thing I would say is “but.. but... Cruz watches porn on Twitter”

       Trump was, at best, an associate of Epstein, who realized what he was all about and ceased all connection.

       It's useless to respond unless one builds up some kind of copy-pasta bullshit the same way Pizzagaters do. But if we do, then we're called shills for putting effort into calling out your bullshit. It's a lose-lose situation. It happens to me all the time (I don't delete my comments and sometimes copy and paste previous comments).
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been called a "pedo", "shill", told to kill myself, etc. All because I looked at the evidence, just like Pizzagaters asked, and think it's complete bullshit.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Nevermind the 100% complete and total lack of evidence of a (pedo) crime. No witnesses, no victims, no paper trail, no crime scene. Literally, nothing.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Nevermind the fact that
         <strong>
          all
         </strong>
         the code words used in the emails were made up by some 4chan post
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Nevermind the fact that every email Pizzagaters cling to are easily explained (the $65k email posted by OP is a classic example: Written by some blowhard Obama-hating Republican that calls Obama "Hobama" with no connection to the White House. Yet, it's somehow used as evidence of a crime against the accused.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's been debunked hundreds of times, but Pizzagaters are still lying and posting about it. But you accuse anyone who points this out to be a shill.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Nevermind the fact that I get called names every time I point out the
         <strong>
          constant lies
         </strong>
         told by Pizzagaters.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It's a shit theory, with shit proponents who call everyone who see through their bullshit names. Trying to argue against Pizzagaters' bullshit is next to impossible when a bunch of PG circle-jerkers copy-paste all their shit, and call anyone who does the same, but disagrees, a "shill". Again, it's lose-lose.

       I think a lot of our problems are because very few of us are taught to think critically.  We are conditioned by society from a very young age. School is more about making us robots instead of teaching us to actually question and learn.

       Most of what you wrote is illegible nonsense, so I'll focus on this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Can you offer a contradictory explanation for those oh so silly emails about having minors in a pool?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That email actually gives the names and ages of three children: "Ruby, Emerson, and Maeve Luzzatto." Since you've known for over a year the identities of three real-life victims, surely by now you've located those children and gotten their testimony against their evil, child-prostituting grandmother, right? I mean you wouldn't just sit around for a year while these very specific kids are being passed around as party favors.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...unless they're not victims at all, and that email was just a mundane party invitation that you and others have misinterpreted to fit a patently ridiculous political agenda. You tell me which.

       No I can't, sorry. I've wasted enough time with you. If you want more info you can look for it yourself. I have better things to do with my day. Once again, Comet Ping Pong is officially under investigation for child pornography found on their website. Have fun protecting elite pedophiles. The tide is turning, you can continue to advocate for plausible deniability but it will be a losing battle from here on out.

       has been unfairly subjecting you to the elite ivory tower methods called Lo-Gek. Lo-Gek is a mind control technique where people who make claims are BURDENED with the responsibility to back them up with credible evidence. You stay woke internet detective because elite pedos will continue to prosper until wild and baseless accusations aren't obstructed by evil Lo-Gek.
