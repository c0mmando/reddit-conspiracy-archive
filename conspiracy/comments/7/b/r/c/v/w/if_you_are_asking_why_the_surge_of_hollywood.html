       <em>
        June 14 2017
       </em>
       - 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions prepped 1500 members of law enforcement officers for the fight against sex trafficking during a motivational speech on June 6 at the National Law Enforcement Training on Child Exploitation in Atlanta.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sessions said that through Trump’s executive orders, he’s directed the Department of Justice to reduce crimes especially on young people. “We will make the fight against child exploitation and human trafficking a top priority,” Sessions said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite critics who claim the unprecedented increase in sex trafficking arrests aren’t due to Trump’s efforts, nothing could be further from the truth. I reported in February that during Trump’s first month in office there were a staggering 1500 plus pedophile arrests made. Since then, there have been well over 3000 arrests. Meanwhile, as I reported in March, the Russian conspiracy theory the left and globalists have pushed so hard is nothing more than a manufactured lie to distract from sex trafficking. The sex trafficking epidemic in the elite circles – dubbed Pedogate — is rampant. “This is so massive of a scandal it’s like Watergate on steroids,” the source said. “Everyone is distracted by fake news but this is the biggest scandal of the century and the truth will come out.”
      </p>
      <p>
       On June 10, there is a 50 state demonstration to draw attention to the elite pedophilia problem. Our Children Matter – an organization created after the Podesta e-mails revealed the use of pedophile code words and terms according to their site — organized the nationwide march.
      </p>
      <p>
       Navy Seal Craig Sawyer started the nonprofit Veterans for Child Rescue to go after the elite pedophile rings. Sawyer said he went independent since gatekeepers in the media aren’t interested in shining a light on this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       “One aspect of this, some of them are actually into Satanic rituals and torturing them to death…little infants and toddlers. It’s really hard to digest but I’m getting high-level information about it from federal law enforcement and the intelligence community.”
      </p>
      <p>
       When the truth comes out about how rampant child sex trafficking is in this country, particularly among the elites, the public will remember the who had the courage to address this horrendous issue and who chose to turn a blind eye to the rape and torture of infants and kids. As Sawyer pointed out, thankfully we now have a President dedicated to stopping this evil that’s plagued our great nation for too long. “We’ve got a President now who’s not OK with children being raped and tortured to death so thank God,” Sawyer said.

       It's prosecution. Until child rape becomes uniformly actionable and conviction = jailtime and/or an unavoidable label. Print and online publications of convicted abusers. Shame on prosecutor.

       So you're telling me out of 1,810 billionaires that 900 of them are Israeli?

       And you're convinced that it is all coincidence, despite bilderberg meetings, wikileaks cables, the un's acknowledgment of Israel's treachery, and states denying emergency services to those who condemn Israel (13 states.) Also, bizarre political connections between ghw bush, the saudi royals, the clintons, mccain, huma, mossad and the cia. Bizarre how ISIS leaves Israel alone despite the religious divide, despite the persecution of Muslims, despite apartheid. You may have also noticed that they are sacrificing saudi ties, but not israeli. All coincidence, nothing to do with power over us, right?

       Here's something to think about - Trump was on the Apprentice for 15 seasons (some seasons had 2 in one year).  Even though he certainly knew Hollywood prior to the Apprentice, It's a good probability that he learned much more about what goes on in Hollywood during the Apprentice.  His chance to try to fix it.

       It is not directly connected to pedophilia. But with the emerging Hollywood crisis and the preditorial behaviour evrybody seams to be shoked by I think this should be mentioned as well. This is the same shit Weinstein did. Trump is a creep and his contacts to Epstein are also well known

       Be wary of the disinformation trolls deployed to try and equalize the guy taking down the network with the monsters
       <em>
        in
       </em>
       the network.
      </p>
      <h1>
       1) Though there's 100% documented proof that Bill Clinton flew on the Lolita Express with business partner and Clinton Foundation co-founder Jeffrey Epstein, and that Hillary went 6 times, there is NO documented proof that Trump ever went. There IS documented proof, however, that Trump banned Epstein from his club after he was hitting on underaged girls.
      </h1>
      <p>
       2) The Trump "locker room" tape reveals two things: 1) That Trump liked age-appropriate women. In the recording, he talks about having a crush on a married woman; and how he bought her furniture to try and woo her. When she became aware of his feelings, she rebuffed him and he went away. He at no time attacked her, or forced himself on her. 2) In the second part of the recording, he talks about fame and how groupies throw themselves as celebrities. "They'd even let you grab them by the pussy". LET? But the media tole me it was "non-consensual" and that he was advocating FORCING himself on women?
      </p>
      <p>
       No, Trump was talking about the existence of groupies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The existence of groupies is NOT controversial . . . unless you're what? Amish?
      </p>
      <p>
       Who doesn't believe that groupies exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's why we have a term for it: star-fuckers. Women who want to sleep with celebrities so that they can brag about it later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul McCartney: "Groupies exist."
      </p>
      <p>
       Media: "Oh, my God! Beatle Paul is exactly like Harvey Weinstein!"
      </p>
      <p>
       No, that's why we have TWO separate terms: Groupies and "the casting couch".
      </p>
      <p>
       No one in the history of the world has ever confused the two.
      </p>
      <p>
       Groupies = consensual
      </p>
      <p>
       Casting couch = non-consensual
      </p>
      <p>
       Groupies WANT to sleep with the celebrity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Casting couch victims do NOT want to sleep with the non-celebrity moguls who force themselves on the women.
      </p>
      <p>
       That Paul McCartney slept with groupies in no way, shape or form implies that he's Weinstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this pathetic attempt at equalization by disinformation trolls is telling.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason why all these celebrities were unhinged, angry and sweaty when Trump got in. Why they took a Presidential election WAYYYyyyy too seriously. Why it seems personal for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       "If that bastard gets in, we all hang". --Hillary Clinton
      </p>
      <p>
       So now the people targeted for exposure are sending out trolls to try and discredit the man taking down the network.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nice try, trolls.
      </p>
      <p>
       See you in jail.

       You're attacking the man who's issued executive orders to target pedophile networks.

      <p>
       That implies that you don't want the networks touched.

       You want to discredit the man exposing child trafficking and arresting pedophiles.

       Guys please, my mind can only be blown so much before it gets put in jail for a sexual offense.   But really though, your post is incredible.  You put into words what i was feeling but wasn't sure how to phrase it.  Not sure if I would call the other guy a disinfo troll, but there is a tangible effort to lump Trump into the negative pedo press.

       Similarly, I never read much into Trump's single flight on Epstein's plane. It's as though he went expecting one thing, discovered it was way more depraved than even he was into, and never went again.

       To be honest I don´t understand this way of thinking. If you are downplaying Trumps behavior I have to ask how low is the bar actually for you? Don´t you think the president should be an example and someone the people can look up to? And to bring up Bill is also kind of a strange choice. So yes he is also an asshole. Does that make Trump better?

       I would say Bill is probably the most morally corrupt president in the history of presidents. So yes, Trump is better than Bill lol. Bill just so happened to be the husband of Trump's opponent, Hillary. While Bill may hold the record for most morally corrupt president, Hillary is by far and away the most morally corrupt presidential candidate. So the reason people "downplay" Trump's mean words, is because they realize his egotistical rants are far less dangerous than the Clintons carefully crafted lies.

       I agree with that. And I certainly don't think Trump is perfect. But this election wasn't about Trump. It was about defeating the establishment Clinton crime family. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. And the Clinton's are an enemy to America in my eyes.

       You are assuming he wants less controversy. I’d like to see evidence of that. Trump says contradictory things every week.

       People always seem to misrepresent trumps “grab em by the pussy” quote IMO.
      </p>
      <p>
       What he actually said was more along the lines of “when you’re famous they let you do anything even grab them by the pussy”.
      </p>
      <p>
       The important part for me is the “they let you but”. It implies consent. And from my knowledge of celebrity types it seems to be a statement of fact. Is anybody going deny that celebrities get more sex than normal people because of their celebrity status.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consensual pussy grabbing between adults is nothing when compared to moloch worshipping pedophiles.

       Because Bill and Hillary's actions have been objectively worse than anything Trump has done. The worst thing you can point to is Trump saying something in private conversation that's more of an indictment of the women he's speaking about than it is of himself.

       Well, there are a couple of things. I haven´t ranked them for me so there is no particular order here:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Picking people for important positions who incredibly unqualified
       </li>
       <li>
        leaving the Paris climate deal
       </li>
       <li>
        His Tweet policy in general (with that I mean that he is using Twitter for topics that are way to important)
       </li>
       <li>
        his handling of the terror attacks compares to each other
       </li>
       <li>
        him being a racist
       </li>
       <li>
        his constant verbal diarrhea
       </li>
       <li>
        His constant lying  (especially when it comes to situations where it is unnecessary)
       </li>
       <li>
        his behavior towards the press and his love for FOX News as the main source of information
       </li>
      </ul>

       Man, you're so smart, what would we do without you to remind us trump said grab her by the pussy? I mean I don't think any of us ever wouldve remembered that, because with all that is going on in politics right now that's gotta be about #1 still in terms of importance. I bet you think trumps taxes are bigger than HRC rigging the primaries and paying for the fake dossier

       Sure. How about his 2002 interview with NY Magazine:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I've known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life."
      </p>
      <p>
       That's an actual child sex ring leader he's talking about. One that's connected to princes, celebrities and presidents both past and current.

       So because one quote didn't say he was his best friend it's spun?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's easy to prove. When Epstein's house was raided he had all of his dozen or so numbers in his Rolodex. When Trump played tennis tournaments at Mar-A-Lago he picked him as his partner.

       Listen, CNN, if you present a quote as evidence of your statement, that quote then has to actually provide evidence of your statement. That's how evidence works.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to your second point, I have over 200 names just in my phone and probably half of them are business associates/vendors that I've worked with. I'm close enough with half of those that I would invite them to play golf. I guess that makes us best friends?

       That wasn't your claim; I agree with you that Trump definitely knew about it. I think most of Hollywood, DC and most high level business people probably knew about it. Your claim was that Trump and Epstein are best friends and you presented evidence to prove that claim but it did not.

       What did you just say to me? Do you know who I am? lol, The fact that you think I didn't spend countless hours myself looking at the wikileaks emails and doing my own research is funny. We have countless of man hours on record of the top minds at work. Critical thinking. Mt Dew. Doritos. PC gaming. We have it all at our disposal.  But.. ok.. go back to watching Pedowood movies. It's all good.

       No one else in the article mentions the age of Epstein’s girls.

       Not a fan of Trump as a person but I do think his quote can be interpreted both as praise for Epstein or slyly exposing him. No way of knowing for sure.

       Yes. Slyly exposing him vs going to the cops and continuing his friendship and picking him as his tennis partner is the smart move.

       Ok well in my day Wikipedia was not considered a reliable source but I think it has since changed because it has links at the bottom.

       Basically any professor of college writing has to keep you up to date with all the latest little tiny rules on citations and it's a pretty big deal. You aren't missing out really.

       But all you have to do is type something like this at the bottom:

       He wasn't "best friends" with him but he did know him and I believe he flew on his jet. However, He also kicked Epstein out of his club. So perhaps he found out about the shady shit and wasn't down with it.

       you can be friends with someone who keeps secrets from you dumb-fuck. when it became knowledge that he was a creep Trump gave him the boot. In what part of that logic do you not follow? You're seriously such a lazy scumbag for doing that. I was wondering who would bring it up "but but but but Trump and Epstein!" yeah how about how he didn't fly on the Lolita Express and had him removed from his property. Oh wait you didn't mention that part. Just owned your sorry ass again so please fuck off. Trump is getting rid of the pedos not involved with them. Watch more cnn

        On September 27, 2007 — a few weeks before the New York Post reported that Epstein was banned from Mar-A-Lago — Epstein acknowledged guilt in "knowingly and willfully conspiring with others known and unknown to… persuade, induce, or entice minor females to engage in prostitution."

       Replace the vilains by "hollywood leftist pedophiles" and the protagonist name by "Trump" on any Grimm's fairy tales, and you'll get the closest from those stupid posts driven by partisanship.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that Hollywood doesn't even represent 1% of US GDP won't stop those moronic celebrities from being the most malevolent entity Trump's proselytes claim them to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's take individual cases whom are not even AUTHENTICATED and are still allegations, to back up this story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, while we're focused on those unimportant celebrities, we'll forget about those in power ; Steven Mnuchin, former Skull &amp; Bones, Wilbur R. Ross, former CEO of Rothschild's Investment Fund, Rex Tillerson, Former CEO of Exxon, etc.

       We need to call out every MSM outlet who buried their head in the sand when this thing explodes.
So many news outlets will jump on the band wagon once it's out in the open, because it's "safe to do so and everyone is doing it now".. And claim to be "reporting the tough truths" and patting themselves on the back from bringing it to light..
Msm are spineless twats. 
Every news anchor on CNN or nbc will think they are doing such a fabulous rewarding job reporting this stuff, and will expect a thank you.
We won't let them be thanked!! They avoided the truth for a long time, and KNEW this as going down and did nothing about it because of "career suicide"..

       You actually think that Trump got elected, stepped into the DOJ offices and told them that from now on pedophiles should be arrested, and that resulted in 1500 arrests
       <em>
        a month
       </em>
       later? How long do you think it takes to collect evidence on 1500 people? two weeks?
      </p>
      <p>
       The President has an important job but it's not like he's actually doing everything the government is doing. The President gets to allocate resources, in very broad terms, not to dictate how and when arrests happen. That's why I don't attribute these arrests to Obama either, even though work on this operation probably started during his term.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, pedophiles and human traffickers getting arrested - and who the President is - has nothing to do with whether or not Weinstein has the power to keep his face off the NYT front page. There's literally nothing in common between an FBI crackdown on pedophiles or human traffickers and a powerful Hollywood figure being a sexual predator.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, I'm known for having good memory. Very good memory. The best memory, really. That's why I remember there used to be a sticky in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       about how the FBI is arresting operators of child pornography websites and then using the websites as traps to catch pedophiles. Everyone was going off about how everyone in the government is a pedophile, pizzagate confirmed. Several months later, 1500 pedophilia arrests. Pizzagate confirmed again. Some people have it coming and going.

       Excellent points, yes these arrests would have taken time to put together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course trump isn't personally responsible for everything that's happening, but the head of the executive has a huge influence over military and law enforcement policy, and can create a sea change.  As chummy as the clintons were with spacey, Weinstein, etc, you don't think there would be a chilling influence against pursuing those kind of allegations in the media or law enforcement if Clinton were in the white house?  Media, political,  and law enforcement cooperation are essential to sexual predators as we have seen from the catholic church or scandals like Franklin S&amp;L.   Often times there are years-long investigations that go nowhere, and the executive has a huge influence on that. For example, Obama was beholden to powerful banking interests, and Holder's  do-nothing justice dept that continually refused to prosecute  was a direct result of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's why I said I would like to see a comparison between previous sex related arrests and those since trump took office.  I think it is possible that crimes were overlooked or not pursued aggressively during the interconnected Clinton, bush, and Obama administrations.  They are all connected to a lot of creepy events and sexual predators.  I understand that trump was friends with Epstein, and I assume that it's never mentioned only because Epstein is an even bigger liability to the Clintons.  But with the non-stop media assault on trump, I would think if he had other predator friends they would be uncovered by now.  It's very possible that trump and his political opponents aren't connected to the same group of predators and therefore pressure on law enforcement could be different now.

       I see no reason to assume that Trump is fewer friends in Hollywood than the Clintons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both Trump and Bill Clinton are sexual predators of the kind that's now being purged from Hollywood. I'll remind you that Trump had like 20 women accuse him of sexual harassment, had an ex-wife accuse him of rape, and admitted pussy grabbing and going in dressing rooms. So I view this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I would think if [Trump] had other predator friends they would be uncovered by now
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As a little funny.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bigger issue, though, is that stuff happens without the government's involvement all the time. Both the Weinstein expose and the pedophile arrests are examples. Most things about the economy, too. The healthcare market is a pile of poop not because of Trump, or Obama, but because of things that happened in the last 50 years or so.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I would like to see a comparison between previous sex related arrests and those since trump took office.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This would be less than informative. If Trump were a monster, and 2 months after his inauguration he strolled into the DOJ and told them not to start any more investigations into pedophilia, when would the effect be measurable? In 3 years? 5? I suspect that if less than 1500 pedophile arrests a day were made during Obama's tenure you'll see this as evidence of something about Trump, when in fact it's mostly evidence that a particularly successful FBI operation was started under Obama and was culminated under Trump, and nothing more.

       I dunno, some of the people being exposed are staunch supporters and intimate acquaintances of the Clintons, and other nasty events such as silsby's two attempts to traffic children from Haiti (and her defense by an attorney also accused of child sex trafficking) is also connected to the Clintons. Hillary also shut down an

       I do think that arrests and prosecutions are influenced by the executive, but yes, these investigations already existed.  We will have to see if they continue.  I'm sure that a stronger border enforcement would also help reduce human trafficking.  We'll just have to see how things turn out over the next few years, but I honestly think that a Clinton presidency would have had a stifling effect on accussations against their friends weinstein and spacey, as well as enforcement against sex traffickers.

       Lol you had to go to someone else's comment in a separate child thread to come up with that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Try to stay on topic. The person who replied to me in the thread you're in now said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And you're convinced that it is all coincidence, despite bilderberg meetings, wikileaks cables, the un's acknowledgment of Israel's treachery
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Etc etc. Which you're now contradicting in each reply. Hmm.

       You're right. One guy's opinion saying this billionaire Trump totally isn't a pedophile like his friend is indicative of a standup dude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why my friends always tell everyone how much I'm not a pedophile. I even typed that up on my resume.

      <p>
       We better not look into this again.

       Oh but your lie still stands as a lie though. And this guy named Colonel_Chestbridge1 said the same exact talking points yesterday. And another guy before that.
