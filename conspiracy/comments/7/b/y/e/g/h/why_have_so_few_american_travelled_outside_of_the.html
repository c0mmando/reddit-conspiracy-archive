    <div class="md"><p>And the wage suppression and wage reduction that started officially as policy with the E.I.T.C. in 1976 where they said instead of raising the minimum wage, let&#39;s pay the lowest paid workers with tax money, it saved the employers billions and billions and cut both the employee and employer contribution to Social Security, so a double gift to the employer and a double whammy to the workers. </p>

<p>That was wage suppression.  </p>

<p>Here are some of thee wage reduction successes. </p>

<p>Privatization of government services where the tax money goes to a contractor instead of to the workers and he pays the workers less, provides no or much fewer benefits and pockets a big fat profit, from tax money.  Only the profit is private. 
And it not only didn&#39;t save any tax money, it took money from every community where the better paid workers had been direct government employees. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is this:</p>

<p>If you feel the need to travel, get a horse.
This materialistic behaviour of going somewhere on a whim, wasting resources better used otherwise, is a horrible idea.
It is like my friend who went to the Netherlands for grad studies this past year.
Amazed by the architecture of Italy, bedazzled by the art museums of Germany.
Who the fuck cares.
You just used a shitload of energy at the expense of some poor farmer and his livelihood.
This is fact.
Don&#39;t travel.
Create something amazing, where you live.
Being truly conservative, in western culture, is a farce, at least if you want to be popular....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that it needs to be tempered. Travel is an excellent thing, it exposes one to different people and cultures, and shows you that the world is oh so much bigger than your home town, your state, or your country. I don&#39;t believe people should take student loans out to travel (of which I have known a few, unfortunately) but if you can, you should IMO. It broadens horizons and makes you realize you&#39;re part of a larger family, the <em>human</em> family. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cost. Airline tickets outside the US are extremely expensive for just one person let alone a family. Americans can afford it but we choose to spend money elsewhere—‘toys’ (boats, guns, jet skis etc.), cabins, upgrades on their houses, travels within the US, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the recent news about how many people are living from paycheck to paycheck explains why that majority aren&#39;t going anywhere fast in more ways than one.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a general and erroneous impression that no other countries can match or compare to the US so why would anyone want to visit or spend time somewhere outside of the US where life isn&#39;t believed to be as good or probably doesn&#39;t have as many frills and thrills as you can more easily find in the US?</p>

<p>You also have the winter weather across the northern states and snowbirds who&#39;s annual vacation is a much needed break away from it in Florida or the Islands who won&#39;t give that ritual up to go somewhere else at some other time of the year because it really does give them the shivers to think about it.</p>

<p>But apart from all that I think we need to recognise that not a lot of people travel outside of the country they were born and live in no matter what country it is, not just the US, but is that really what the issue here is? </p>

<p>Or isn&#39;t it more that Americans don&#39;t really know a whole lot about the rest of the world whether they travel to it or not, while the rest of the world knows just as much about the US as many Americans themselves do without ever visiting in addition to their own countries and countless other ones, too? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s expensive, the logistics are a pain, and, personally, the places I would want to visit are generally so restrictive in their policies that I don&#39;t see the point.</p>

<p>Why would I want to go visit, for example, the Pyramids, when I&#39;m going to be restricted to the same guided tour I can capture 90% the experience of in video footage seen on television.</p>

<p>Of course, I don&#39;t think my interest in historical sites is tremendously representative of others. As far as I know, most travelers just want to visit a nice beach, or something I find equally unrelatable.</p>
