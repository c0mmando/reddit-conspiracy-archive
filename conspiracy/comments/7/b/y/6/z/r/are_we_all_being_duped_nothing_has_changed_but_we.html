       I was thinking earlier today that I have been hyper-focused on everything happening individually. I decided to take a step back and look at everything together, and I kinda don't like what I see.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I look at everything individually I see actors going down, I see Clinton, Podestas, Huma, etc going down, I see Saudi Arabia going down, Israel and Saudi Arabia aren't trying to start a war with Syria. Jfk files are released. Sandy Hook files released. Bin Laden files are released.Tesla files are released.  Netanyahu's are in hella legal trouble. Las Vegas Shooting is a smoking gun.  We are winning!
      </p>
      <p>
       Then when I take a step back and look at everything I realize nothing has really changed. The actors "going down" aren't in any legal trouble, none are in jail. Neither Clinton, Podestas, Huma aren't doing anything different before they were supposedly going down. None are in jail.  Ffs the "arrested" Saudis are in a freakin Ritz Carloton Hotel! Saudi Arabia now trying to start a different war and you know Israel is right there pushing it.  We are still having False Flag Attacks. Hell its worse we don't even get motives any more. Netanyahu is still Prime Minister, still the man behind the curtain.  Three or four of the biggest conspiries ever have NEW UNREDACTED Documents!  Yet NOTHING has came out of any of them. A freaking ex President groped like 5 women and NOTHING happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is ANYTHING actually EVER going to happen? Or is this the same song and dance we only see at a slightly different angle?

       I believe there will be retaliation at some point.  The Cabal will not go down quietly.  We could be duped at this point, but I believe people will keep pushing and building momentum.

       We still need to take down the Federal Reserve and the international bankers.  These have not been touched yet.

       Interesting.  I was not aware of any of that.  It is a great sign that Trump met with her and brought her on.  These fuckers need to be in prison, and they need to disgorge the money they have been stealing from the US taxpayers for over 100 years now.
      </p>
      <p>
       8 1/2 years in prison is pretty harsh for a Rothschild, especially one that old.  I wonder why he even needed the money?

       I was thinking the same thing. I was like damn, buncha crazy shit going on right now, and there is nothing, no change or real outrage. Or maybe

       . In the grand scheme of things, things don't happen immediately. Corruption and just plain terribleness didn't happen in a few days, or years. It took decades to happen. It will take years for people to really understand it. And longer for them to act on it. or maybe not, idk. been drinking. cheers.

       First of all I agree with you. Looking at the big picture is showing a lot of smaller events that are marketed as large, but in the interim, are nothing of substance after the fact. All of this 'bombshell' 'game changing' shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Las Vegas doesn't add up at all. It seems like the clearest way to out some actual truth. Yet, MSM is still somewhat covering it. So is it another planned part of this puzzle?
      </p>
      <p>
       It feels like a game being played. It looks like a game being played. Dangling that carrot in front of our eyes. Think of it from the top. Would it be entertaining to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they giving us outs on purpose just to watch how pathetic our attempts to respond to them are? "Want a civil war? Here's the date. We've got MSM covering it for you. Go on. Do something!" - "Want to prove a false flag? We'll botch all the evidence of this situation just to watch your reaction."
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe as a people we've become complacent and defeated? People spending countless hours studying shit from HRC to Pizzagate to Podesta to Las Vegas to the Illuminati.. is there someone on the other end encouraging these trips down the rabbit hole? For what purpose?
      </p>
      <p>
       You think about shit posted on here.. FEMA camps, and martial law, and all of that.. if we can't as a people demand answers for major events against OUR people.. why would they trouble themselves with the extra hassle?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a very cynical take on this, so remain optimistic despite my cynicism. However, with each day that passes being stuck in reverse from a cultural standpoint.. where are we headed and perhaps more importantly, where are we already?
