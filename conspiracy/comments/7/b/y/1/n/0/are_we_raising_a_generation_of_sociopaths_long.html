<p><strong>The Sociopath Next Door: Introduction</strong></p>

<p><em>“The man who knows how to split the atom but has no love in his heart becomes a monster.” – Krishamurti</em></p>

<p>In “The Sociopath Next Door” Martha Stout states that about 4% of the people in this world are sociopaths, which is about 1/25 people. I recently downloaded this book, and it will be central to my post. You may know a sociopath in real life, and I certainly know a few, or maybe, you have never even really thought about it until this moment. </p>

<p>My ex nearly murdered me, and I still expected him to say sorry to me one day. Even to this day, I have difficulty comprehending what he did to me, and that is where the problem lies. I fell into an abusive relationship with a sociopath because I could not comprehend that level of evil at the time, and even now I still have difficulty doing so. </p>

<p>Most reading this have the ability to empathize and feel for others. There are those in this world who do not have this ability, and that is difficult for many to comprehend. A sociopath does NOT have to be a serial killer or physically abusive like my ex, and that is a misconception that I feel is harmful, and perhaps it is a potential portrayal by the media to misguide us. A sociopath can be a friend, a colleague, or somebody you are chatting with online. It can even be your mom and dad.</p>

<p>The problem with the word ‘evil’ is that what comes to mind for most is murder, stealing, or other similar crimes. Many, living in a middle-class suburban community, for example, may not recognize evil on a different level. Further, some cannot even relate to that type of evil, maybe because they have never experienced it firsthand. Most reading this post feel things, have a conscience that makes them feel guilt, and try to live decent lives (most!). This is not to say that all bad people are sociopaths – that is certainly not the case. There are clearly a multitude of circumstances where people do bad things but may not necessarily be bad people.</p>

<p>A sociopath never feels responsible, neglectful, or even embarrassed when it comes to actions they commit (Stout, p. 5). For most of us, this is difficult to imagine or even contemplate, and for most of us, it probably is even nearly impossible to imagine.</p>

<p>But, again, according to the book (and other research…) 1/25 or about 4% of people are sociopaths:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/08/as-many-as-12-million-americans-are-sociopaths.html">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/08/as-many-as-12-million-americans-are-sociopaths.html</a></p>

<p>That may not seem like a lot, but if you work in a building with about 30 people, it is statistically likely one of them is a sociopath.</p>

<p>So, what’s the conspiracy? Well, I think there are few key points I would like to make with this post:</p>

<p>• Society (and pop culture) is promoting sociopathy on many levels
• People ignore evil because they do not understand how evil can manifest psychologically; therefore, they may assume evil does not exist because they do not see people going around killing others
• A lack of foundational and consistent morals (or moral relativism) is preventing children from the ability to learn to empathize, and that may have dire consequences in the future. </p>

<p>In general, even if not all will become sociopaths, our society (United States), in general, is becoming more isolated, less empathetic, and more distracted than ever, and this is the world our children are growing up in – a breeding ground for future sociopaths. </p>

<p><strong>Promotion of Sociopathy</strong></p>

<p>Now, the book gets into discussions about definitions of sociopathy, but for the sake of length, I want to generalize. In this post, when I say sociopathy, I am basically saying: the inability to feel/have concern for others, the lack of a conscience, and the inability to ‘feel’ emotions are all traits of a sociopath. I am NOT saying everybody is going to become a sociopath. I am saying that our society is promoting sociopathic qualities. </p>

<p><strong>Humor</strong></p>

<p>Humor is a normalization tool. When I think of humor and sociopathy, the television show that comes to mind is <em>Family Guy</em>. There is not joke that is off limits in Family Guy, and shock, desensitization, and humor all work together to normalize sociopathic behavior. There is nothing that is NOT laughed about on this show, whether it be pedophilia, abuse, or murder. I am not even sure what I should link, but the most shocking video that comes to mind is this episode about abortion, which I can now note find a clip for (but I am sure there is much worse):</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_Terms_of_Endearment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_Terms_of_Endearment</a></p>

<p>I could do this all day with most television shows, but the point is that humor is being used a path to normalize and desensitize us to a variety of things. It is important to note that I am not saying all humor is ‘bad’. Humor has many purposes, and it can help people cope with issues and even fear:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11506052">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11506052</a></p>

<p>However, the problem lies in the increase of shocking humor and the access to it everywhere, which leads into my next point. Further, if you criticize these shows, you are often accused of being too uptight or not having a sense of humor. This is just another way to justify sociopathic behavior. </p>

<p>It is important to note that humor does not have to be shocking to promote sociopathy. Shows like Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm promote a cold, calculated way of dealing with others through humor. Even if it is not the full-blown promotion of sociopathy, it is definitely the promotion of sociopathic qualities.</p>

<p><strong>Glorification of Sociopathy</strong></p>

<p>There are endless of amounts of programming that promote sociopathic behavior such as “Dexter”, which actually inspired a teenager to murder his brother:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1312182/Teenager-inspired-TV-Dexter-murder-brother.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1312182/Teenager-inspired-TV-Dexter-murder-brother.html</a></p>

<p>Further there are movies that promote the glorification of “getting revenge” or “getting back” as the justified things to do, and movies like “Saw’ have inspired copy-cat crimes:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2101206/real-life-crimes-inspired-by-films-and-tv-shows-including-scream-copycat-murders-and-a-foiled-saw-torture-plot/">https://www.thesun.co.uk/living/2101206/real-life-crimes-inspired-by-films-and-tv-shows-including-scream-copycat-murders-and-a-foiled-saw-torture-plot/</a></p>

<p>It is not just movies and TV shows that glorify sociopathy. Children have endless hours of access to movies and music on YouTube that often glorify sociopathic behavior. </p>

<p>There is a youtube channel I particularly find humor in, where people dress up as killer clowns (amongst other things) and chase real people down. It <em>is</em> funny, but is it right? Is it something I should be laughing about? <strong>Would it be funny if it happened to me?</strong></p>

<p>The last question I asked is really the issue. It is not to say we can never laugh or enjoy humor, but we are becoming disconnected from the people we are laughing at. In movies and TV, at least the characters are mostly fictional. YouTube has changed things, though, and much of our humor is based off of real people.  We become disconnected, and this article asks, “Have we become a society of detached voyeurs?”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/02/18/small.vorgan.internet.empathy/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/02/18/small.vorgan.internet.empathy/index.html</a></p>

<p>As long as it makes us laugh, it is okay right? </p>

<p>Well, that is what we are teaching our children, and I am most concerned about children because children learn empathy, essentially, from observing others:</p>

<p><a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/understanding-how-children-develop-empathy/">https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/10/understanding-how-children-develop-empathy/</a></p>

<p>More and more, children are exposed to ideas and concepts before they even have the capacity to understand them. My parents did not monitor anything I watched growing up, and it had a big impact on me that I would not learn until later on in my life. I now see the importance of two things: being aware of what our children are observing, and further, modeling the behavior we want our children to exhibit. The problem is, do children even really have healthy role models anymore? </p>

<p><strong>Going Beyond Viewing</strong></p>

<p>It is no surprise that many children today are lacking parental role models, with many parents working too much or neglecting their children. Some have even resorted to calling celebrities like Beyonce mom, which I feel is indicative of where our society is:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristinharris/teens-calling-celebs-mom?utm_term=.dk2lgo6NMQ#.uoz6Y0ezAr">https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristinharris/teens-calling-celebs-mom?utm_term=.dk2lgo6NMQ#.uoz6Y0ezAr</a></p>

<p>In the meantime, children may not be learning empathy because, quite simply, they do not have many around them modeling it, and the things they are watching on social media are further contributing to the problem. </p>

<p>I am sure you have heard at least one of the many cases about teens recording somebody as they drown or die:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/us/video-drowning-teens-florida.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/us/video-drowning-teens-florida.html</a></p>

<p>Many are becoming disconnected from reality because of the screen they view everything through. When the instinct is to film somebody dying rather than helping them, we know something is wrong with us.</p>

<p>Are our smart phones the scrying mirrors of today? </p>

<ul>
<li>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.*
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now before I get attacked, I am NOT saying that our cell phones are ‘magic’, but I am saying that in at least a metaphorical way, it as if our screens our casting spells on us. Again, as noted above, people were more concerned about recording something on a screen than they were actually helping somebody survive.</p>

<p>This is sociopathic, but it even goes beyond it. It is as if people are completely detached – as if they are not even viewing reality properly.</p>

<p>Reality is becoming so distorted that people are not making good choices. Let’s not forget about all the people who died playing Pokémon Go. There is literally a death tracker for this:</p>

<p><a href="http://pokemongodeathtracker.com/">http://pokemongodeathtracker.com/</a> </p>

<p>Even that death tracker shows how people’s lives become just numbers and statistics, perhaps for people to mock in an effort to cope with an insane reality. </p>

<p><strong>We are too busy to care…</strong></p>

<p>It is not just entertainment that is promoting sociopathy. Quite simply, people may be too exhausted, too distracted, too busy, or too overwhelmed to care. Stout writes,</p>

<p>“The truth is that even a normal person’s conscience does not operate on the same level all the time. One of the simplest reasons for this is the changeability is the fundamental circumstances of living inside a fallible, need-driven human body. When our bodies are exhausted, sick, or inured, all or our emotional functions, including conscience, can be temporarily compromised (p. 52).”</p>

<p>Maybe you are working too much, especially if you are in the US:</p>

<p><a href="https://20somethingfinance.com/american-hours-worked-productivity-vacation/">https://20somethingfinance.com/american-hours-worked-productivity-vacation/</a></p>

<p>Or maybe you are affected by information overload:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload</a></p>

<p>Maybe you are too distracted or too busy to even notice what is going around you (as, for example, many are too even being injured just from being too distracted by their phones).:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.governing.com/topics/transportation-infrastructure/too-many-pedestrians-injured-by-looking-at-their-phones.html">http://www.governing.com/topics/transportation-infrastructure/too-many-pedestrians-injured-by-looking-at-their-phones.html</a></p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, we all fall victims to this at least once in a while, and maybe that’s human nature to an extent. The problem lies in when we do not have time to think. Maybe all some can manage is to think about themselves and their worries, and ultimately, thinking about others is just too exhausting. </p>

<p>Whatever the case, it is not too shocking that empathy has decreased in college students by 40% since 2000:

<p><strong>Who or What is Evil?</strong></p>

<p>As the lines between reality and our screens become murkier and murkier, it becomes difficult to know who or what is evil anymore. I am sure you can relate to this – When I have discussed conspiracy theories with people in real life, they just are NOT convinced that somebody or something could be that evil. They cannot comprehend evil on that level.</p>

<p>That is dangerous, and that is why people are so shocked about the emerging cases of pedophilia from Hollywood. Many may ask themselves how an actor could do something so atrocious, but I would argue that many higher level people are sociopaths, and that is where lies the problem.</p>

<p>People put their trust into leaders, authority figures, and other high profile people without considering how they got to the top in the first place. While I am not here to claim that ‘they’ are all evil, I am saying that studies show that wealthy people tend to be more unethical:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.economicpopulist.org/content/new-study-wealthy-are-more-unethical">http://www.economicpopulist.org/content/new-study-wealthy-are-more-unethical</a></p>

<p>The problem is, there is not a foolproof way to determine who to trust. We do our best to make decisions about who is trustworthy, and many of us fail in that endeavor. </p>

<p>Further, is it possible that just 4% of the world are the ones who are in charge of all the evil that occurs? I’m not sure there is an answer to that question, but I am sure you have heard this famous Albert Einstein quote:</p>

<p>“The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don&#39;t do anything about it.”</p>

<p>While there may be no perfect way to identify sociopaths, we can decide to start standing up for the injustices in the world, which leads me to another point.</p>

<p><strong>You Have Power</strong></p>

<p>I was going to make it this a separate post, but I feel it fits in here. Whether you believe it or not, you do have power to change things. You may not be able to change the entire world in one night, but you can certainly shape your world, and the worlds of those around you.</p>

<p>They want you to feel powerless, but I have proof that we are not. We are just individuals on a conspiracy forum, talking about questions we have on life. Yet, there are paid shills here. If our words were not powerful, they would not be here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/year-zero-series-wikileaks-cia-9988504">http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/year-zero-series-wikileaks-cia-9988504</a></p>

<p>If we did not have power, there would not be the censorship that we see online. There would be no purpose for it.</p>

<p>It is no surprise that as technology use increases, we are living more isolated lives, away from others. Technology is seen as the epitome of progress, yet there are many downfalls. It makes us more isolated, more alone, and less social:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/social-technologies-are-making-us-less-social/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/social-technologies-are-making-us-less-social/</a></p>

<p>The less we connect with people, the less we learn and grow. Again, we do have power, and there is power in numbers. They want us to remain as divided as possible, which is why there are so many forum sliding tactics used on websites such as Reddit.
You are not powerless, and you are only alone if you want to be (for the most part!)</p>

<p>Finally, they want you to believe that we cannot help others. They want you to live your life selfishly, and they want you to be so absorbed in your own world that you fail to think of others around you. Today, one of my students said, “It is sad how people really do not even think of other people anymore.”</p>

<p>I agree with her.  Now, please do not confuse this with the idea that we should be walked all over or help every person even when it is a detriment to us. However, it does mean that we should at times think outside of ourselves, and at times we can sacrifice for others. Small gestures are just as important as big gestures.
You do not have to be a celebrity or rich or famous to help somebody else, which is another illusion. You just have to have good intentions and truly care for the well-being for others. In some contexts, just your words can be helpful. In other context, bigger gestures will do.</p>

<p>I’ve said this before, and I’ll say it again – the secret to happiness is helping others:</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/4070299/secret-to-happiness/">http://time.com/4070299/secret-to-happiness/</a></p>

<p><strong>Calculated Relationships</strong></p>

<p>We live in a time where people are more self-absorbed than they have ever been. This will be our downfall. This is the type of evil people are NOT concerned about – that they dismiss.
Stout writes, “Sociopathy is an aberration in the ability to have and to appreciate real (noncalculated) emotional experience, and therefore connect with other people within real (noncalculated) relationships. To state the situation concisely, and maybe a little too clearly for comfort: Not to have a moral sense flags an even more profound condition, as does the possession of conscience, because conscience never exists without the ability to love, and sociopathy is ultimately base din lifelessness” (p. 125 – 127).</p>

<p>We live in a time where many of our actions are calculated, and even at times, manipulative. Think about the specific posts people make on Facebook to garner a reaction or anger others. Think about texting and how words are carefully chosen to play mind games in relationships. Think about the illusion many put up on social media, trying to convince others they are happy and doing well. We appear as though we are living, but when everything becomes cold and calculated, are we that different from robots?</p>

<p>And maybe this is really the ultimate conspiracy. As our world becomes more connected throughout technology, it seems that we become more disconnected through love and morality. We feel separated from other people, behind our screens, where we feel safe and judgmental. We feel we are on a higher ground, and we take delight in those who are failing. There are entire subreddits, for example, devoted to how “cringeworthy” some people’s lives are. There are entire websites, videos, and forums devoted to mocking others.</p>

<p>We sit there in our throne, feeling high and mighty, but it is all an illusion. Deep down we are disconnected and lonelier than ever. In some ways, we are no different that robots, and maybe that’s what they want for us ultimately. </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to end with some quotes about the importance of having compassion for others and not losing our humanity:</p>

<p>Matthew 22: 37 - 40 – “37 Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’[a] 38 This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[b]All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.</p>

<p>“A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.” 
― Albert Einstein</p>

<p>I think Albert Einstein’s quote summarizes this entire post. There is a quote “Other people are hell”, which is pretty true, but it is important to remember that our lives would lose all meaning without others. It is become ‘cool’ to say that you hate people and claim that you just want to be alone, but I feel that is just a symptom of something larger.</p>

<p>I am not sure if we can change how fast the world is moving through technology, but I am begging anybody reading this, especially if you have a child, to start teaching and encouraging empathy to those around you. Of course, actions always speak louder than words.</p>

<p>Are we raising a generation of sociopathic people-like robots, or do we still have time to change things?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand, </p>

<p>A psychopath is concerned with their reputation. Whether that reputation is innocence, fear, pity, etc, everything they do or say is a calculated decision designed to elicit the desired response from their prey. I don&#39;t mean prey as in murder victim. (Although it can be). I mean it as in the person whom they are engaging. Their prey could just be someone they want on their good side or something as simple as to get them to put extra ketchup in the bag. A psychopath knows how to feign empathy. But, identifies with the apathy of a sociopath. </p>

<p>I cautioned that humor can be good or bad. It is a tool - nothing else. I have a very dark sense of humor.</p>

<p>The problem that you may not see is there are many who do not know. Source? I work with children.</p>

<p>This is especially true in areas where parental involvement is low.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not against reading the rest. I just needed to come to an understanding regarding what I had already read and needed further feedback from you. </p>

<p>Based on this comment, I agree that a lot of parents let the television raise their kids. </p>

<p>Bad parenting has always been an issue and always will be. It&#39;s too easy for any asshole to accidentally have kids and fuck them up. </p>

<p>I think entertainment is geared toward what is &quot;interesting&quot;. In most cases if not, characters with problems are what makes something &quot;interesting&quot;.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t sacrifice entertainment or comedy for the random people out there who can&#39;t control their children or refuse to raise them right. </p>

<p>Otherwise, we might as well watch Barney on a 24/7 loop. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many, living in a middle-class suburban community, for example, may not recognize evil on a different level. Further, some cannot even relate to that type of evil, maybe because they have never experienced it firsthand.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was actually something I was thinking about just the other day. I have recently moved into a living situation far higher on the socio-economic status than I was born or raised within, and I feel like an outsider. That being said, I was thinking just the other day that in an incredibly affluent suburban community that hasn&#39;t seen a murder since the 70&#39;s, I am <em>positive</em> that evil, and sociopathy, lies within. It hides here because it can, because it is safe in the unsuspecting populace of affluence, and because it merely mimics the emotions and behaviors of those surrounding it, in order to hide. No one would ever expect to find such evil in a place like this, which convinces me it most definitely hides here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is important to note that humor does not have to be shocking to promote sociopathy. Shows like Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm promote a cold, calculated way of dealing with others through humor. Even if it is not the full-blown promotion of sociopathy, it is definitely the promotion of sociopathic qualities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I felt that was the most relevant section on Humor to quote. The problem you raise- about our laughing at others suffering, is not a new one. The Roman poet Lucretius had something to say about this:</p>

<p>Suave mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis
e terra magnum alterius spectare laborem;
non quia vexari quemquamst jucunda voluptas,
sed quibus ipse malis careas quia cernere suave est.</p>

<p>Translation (not my own)- Pleasant it is, when over a great sea the winds trouble the waters, to gaze from shore upon another&#39;s great tribulation: not because any man&#39;s troubles are a delectable joy, but because to perceive from what ills you are free yourself is pleasant.</p>

<p>I think this is an important distinction to note. We find humor in many different things and while it may seem that some laugh at others suffering, it is humor in not <em>experiencing</em> that suffering that is found. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You Have Power</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely agree. Too often people think too big when trying to conceive their own power. Real change starts at the personal level. Get involved with your community, share your feelings with other human beings, know how you fit into not only your community but your society as a whole. That is where real change begins.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We live in a time where many of our actions are calculated, and even at times, manipulative. Think about the specific posts people make on Facebook to garner a reaction or anger others. Think about texting and how words are carefully chosen to play mind games in relationships.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder if this is not simply an outgrowth of the human condition, or need to fit into a group. If everyone else seems happy, we feel the need to lie and say/show that we are happy too. This may ultimately be born from the group nature of human beings.</p>

<p>Some final thoughts- I believe that there is a difference between true sociopathy and learned sociopathy. Some people are born without the ability to feel, others are taught not to feel. Those who are taught not to feel can also be taught <em>how</em> to feel, if they encounter the proper stimuli. I think it is important to note that, because it shows that we can still change things, because the majority of the issue is a learned form of sociopathy, and not a biological form.</p>

<p>I see this as cyclical, the romans had the arena, the puritans had witch burnings. Children have been exposed to horrors in every society &amp; told how to feel about it. Throughout it all, it&#39;s them who put a stop to the insanity &amp; incrementally better humanity. </p>

<p>The two factors have been found by those following this theory to display different correlates. Factor 1 has been correlated with narcissistic personality disorder,[12] low anxiety,[12] low empathy,[13] low stress reaction[14] and low suicide risk[14] but high scores on scales of achievement[14] and social potency.[14] In addition, the use of item response theory analysis of <strong>female offender PCL-R scores indicates factor 1 items are more important in measuring and generalizing the construct of psychopathy in women than factor-2 items.</strong>[15]</p>

They prefer to work at the very highest levels of their organizations, allowing them to control the greatest number of people. Psychopaths who are political leaders, managers, and CEOs fall into this category.[5]</p>

<p>Organizational psychopaths generally appear to be intelligent, sincere, powerful, charming, witty, and entertaining communicators. They quickly assess what people want to hear and then create stories that fit those expectations. They will con people into doing their work for them, take credit for other people&#39;s work and even assign their work to junior staff members. They have low patience when dealing with others, display shallow emotions, are unpredictable, undependable and fail to take responsibility if something goes wrong that is their fault.[5]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not if you want rationality to include making decisions that help and do not harm. It&#39;s true that there are certain traits of the psychopath that can be useful, for things such as surgery for example, or being a pilot and remaining calm and collected in an emergency landing situation or whatever. But those are just traits, you can have one or more sociopathic traits without being a full blown sociopath, just as you can have autistic traits without being autistic. The issue is ensuring that people aren&#39;t desensitized to the pain of others. You can feel and understand and empathize with another&#39;s pain and then maintain your composure and &#39;put those feelings away&#39; for as long as it takes to make a rational decision about how to act to protect those people (e.g. in an emergency situation). But you need to have that empathetic impulse to begin with, otherwise the &#39;rational&#39; decisions you make are not going to have a starting point or a context of doing what is morally right and helpful for others.</p>

Since most of us have the capacity for empathy, maybe the massive sociopathic tendencies our culture perpetrates creates an apathetic society.

    <div class="md"><p>I did, the problems start from her glossing over her conflation of antisocial personality disorder, sociopathy and psychopathy.  She does this near the introduction in order to appeal to the pop-psychology culture that pervades American society, much like Gladwell and Dubner/Levitt appeal to the pop-statisticians/economists.</p>

<p>She does this in order to prey on the uninformed and paranoid and does so in order to promote something that is far more commonplace in American culture than sociopathy, the inability of people to accept responsibility for their actions.  Rather than addressing the root causes of bad actions, we can just point to buzzword pop-psychology analyses like &quot;4% of people are sociopaths&quot; and people will buy into it.</p>

<p>After her conflation of antisocial personality disorder and sociopathy (a fear-driving term which isn&#39;t even used by the APA), she continues to do so throughout the book in order to dramatize her thesis.</p>

<p>This is without even dealing with the fact that much of the book is presented as a dramatization, again, this is to appeal to pop-psychologists as an actual rigorous study into the nature of antisocial personality disorder and its consequences wouldn&#39;t sell books.</p>

<p>But, fortunately the book has now been recognized to be old and wildly out of date by people in the field, so it doesn&#39;t hold much clout with people actually trying to address the issues she brings up.</p>

<p>Um, have you read the study?  Don&#39;t you think that the author manipulates the results of the study in order to resonate with pop-psychology enthusiasts through a pseudo plot-driven, fear-driving narrative rather than actually properly communicating the results of the study?  Do you believe that all people with antisocial personality disorder should be described as sociopaths?</p>

<p>Do you think that this biased and outdated narrative is something that should be used to formulate a thesis about the current state of sociopathy in society?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my youth, I also was in a relationship with a sociopath. Thankfully, I got out of that relationship, too. We tend to think others are like us and when you&#39;re a good person, you tend to think others are basically good, too. But sociopaths are a different breed, altogether. They can mimic some emotions but they don&#39;t have them for others. The only love they&#39;d have is for themselves. Everyone else is just there to be manipulated. And therapy doesn&#39;t help, either. They just learn how to manipulate others more easily. I swear, there&#39;s a coldness to them. Reptilian, even, once you see through the acting. Since they only mimic an emotional connection for their own benefit, they tend to not have long-term relationships. Not every one will become violent, though. The thing that bothered me was learning there were some Fortune 500 companies who were actually looking for sales people with those tendencies. Even using a test developed to pinpoint them so they&#39;d know who to hire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know, I actually think most kids will be okay. Look up the Homeland Generation. It might make you feel better about the future. There are a lot of 20-somethings around our house, and they are good people. But you&#39;re right that kids need to be taught to think of other people&#39;s feelings. You can start young showing them how to be kind to others, too. When my son started preschool, he was only 3, but his teachers told me it was unusual for one so young to think of other&#39;s feelings at that age, since little kids are pretty ego-centric. All he saw was us helping the elderly neighbors or people who needed a hand. And we&#39;d talk to him about thinking of other people and how they feel. Nothing really major or a big production. He&#39;s grown now, but he&#39;s still a kind person. And he studies brain function with the hope of curing diseases. There is one book I think might be helpful to people with young ones. It&#39;s called &quot;The Narcissism Epidemic: Living in the Age of Entitlement.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty convinced of the exact opposite actually. This is based off of real experience working with kids ranging from elementary to high schoolers over the last two decades.</p>

<p>A major difference recently I&#39;ve been noticing is that the younger generations are sensitive/intuitive, are more emotionally complex/mature and are unusually creative and curious. At least compared to how I felt kids were 8-10 years ago. They&#39;ve got their own weaknesses too super super insecure/vain, emotionally needy and unnecessarily (?) depressed. The internet and age of apps have been wrecking hell and havoc on social relationships among kids and parents are checking out of parenting (because everyone has to be a workaholic these days in order to survive) and outsourcing it to ipads&amp;phones.</p>

<p>There are definitely trends, but to say we are raising a generation of sociopaths--while admittedly a great way to sensationalizing and getting people to read your post--is interesting but not consistent at least with me or my colleagues experiences.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for an alternative viewpoint.</p>

<p>I do feel like there are some good things emerging out of this generation. For example, bullying still exists, but you really do not see the classic archetypal bully anymore.</p>

<p>At the same time, it seems everything is more subtle and discreet. The type of bullying that now exists is very silent and indirect and...just different.</p>

<p>All kids have potential, and I am not trying to attack an entire generation.</p>

<p>But in my experience even with that natural senstivity and intuitiveness, the environment of narcissism and self obsession in this country seems to be the winner.</p>

<p>It feels like everybody is talking about equality and kindness and all that...but it feels off. It feels artificial.</p>

<p>There was a peak of this sort of trend with the baby boomers this trend in the 60s (Y&#39;know, tune and drop out/peace n&#39; love). The elder generation called us spoiled brats who&#39;d gone soft...I remember at the beginning of the Vietnam war when there was some support, some of the older conservative demographics felt that the war might even straighten some of the hippies out.</p>

<p>The anxieties you feel about generational shifts are natural. I&#39;d highly suggest checking out the books:</p>

<p>I just re-read these articles a couple days ago. They are very well-sourced and relevant to your point. </p>

<p>I think you will enjoy reading these and definitely benefit from doing so.</p>

<p>If I were to offer one critique of your post (for lack of a better word ATM), I would say that you left out drugs and Big Pharma. For example, studies have shown that widespread drugs such as alcohol and [acetaminophen],(<a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/07/06/484894653/researchers-examine-why-tylenol-affects-empathy">https://www.npr.org/2016/07/06/484894653/researchers-examine-why-tylenol-affects-empathy</a>) along with widely prescribed drugs like SSRI anti-depressants, have been shown to have a negative effect on people&#39;s ability to feel empathy. But to be fair, the topic you tackled  does have more than one book written on  the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this - this is exactly the conclusion I have come to as a research psychologist and it&#39;s my hope to make empathy research a much bigger thing than it is now, because I truly believe it is empathy that is the best weapon we have against all the ills of this world, and it is lack of empathy that has corrupted all our institutions. As you say, one of the difficulties is that people cannot cmprehend the mindset of a sociopath, not until you have experienced one of these people yourself. And when you have, and when you understand that the majority of powerful people in this world have that same mindset, you begin to understand why sociopathy is the biggest threat our species faces.</p>

<p>However, there is hope in the fact that most people cannot comprehend the dark heart of sociopathy. Most people are not like that, most people ARE empathetic, and even if our consciences can get warped or distracted or worn down by the trials of life, empathy is a core trait of what it is to be human. The key is waking people up to this fact, and the fact of the sociopathic enemy &#39;at the top.&#39;</p>

<p>I love that there is someone else thinking along these lines! Are you a psychologist or researcher or anything? Maybe we could get together and write a book or formulate a plan!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some good ideas here and there, but I have to disagree with the general notion. Sociopaths are the people who had serious problems during childhood, most of the time lonely or alienated. Such heavy trauma makes you less sensitive about a lot of things. Cause of such traumas? Uneducated in a very specfic sense parenting. Most people are shit parents: don&#39;t talk to their children, aren&#39;t good role models, don&#39;t understand the upbringing process with regards to what&#39;s important at what age. A lot of times a kid is just a result of an unfortunate accident, instead of a planned parenting. So you get more and more troubled people generation after generation as a result. </p>

<p>We have to promote education through being educated ourselves, because only through knowledge we can effectively understand the world around us, have sane mind and strong critical thinking. So it all comes together from the ability to analyse why bad stuff happens around us and make sure our kinds know how to deal with that bad stuff in the future. </p>

<p>I share your concerns, but the vast majority of our problems in life are results of parenting. When you establish yourself as a person (and parents play the most vital role here) is when you&#39;re most vulnerable to parenting mistakes. The better you are raised, the more successful you become, the more stable and emphatic. So by being a good parent yourself you can change the world. That&#39;s my ideology. </p>

<p>I think many children are growing up in harder environments. They may be eating and getting basic needs, but many are not getting proper social and emotional needs. I have an anecdote regarding this if you are interested.</p>

<p>Yes which is why I write a lot about the breakdown of family structure.</p>

<p>This sociopathy is a symptom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My parents abused me emotionally.</p>

<p>But they always fed and clothed me and made sure I was safe and at school.</p>

<p>When I became an adult they denied any abuse with the justification that they always took care of me - not being able to comprehend that there is more to care than just physical needs.</p>

<p>In a world that may be safer, I feel there are more psycholigical issues that people are dismissing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry to hear that. It sucks when the closest people to you don&#39;t recognise when they hurt you. On the bright side, you&#39;re now very aware of other problems and needs a child might have, so that you can avoid your parents&#39; mistakes. </p>

<p>If we&#39;re sharing personal stuff, I can say that I was very distressed when my dad stopped living with us and was seing other women. I&#39;d been very nervous for quite a few years as a result, until I managed to understand what went wrong in my parents&#39; relationship that caused the collapse. I&#39;ve got good relationship with my dad, so it&#39;s nothing grave, but I&#39;ve been scarred and now wanna avoid breaking up a family at all costs. Hence I&#39;m super careful now with commitment, because my dad married super early (he wasn&#39;t even 18, the authorities had to make an exception to allow my parents to marry) without fully realising what the family life required in terms of maturity and commitment. So yeah, gotta extract valuable lessons out of previous generation&#39;s mistakes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think should all be intrested in what&#39;s happening to our younger generations and to ourselves. At the same time this kind of discussion has been going on for years with the violence on TV and the media, yet crime rates are dropping. Violence in society can be directly tied to the abortion rate 20 years prior and lead exposure, not TV or video games. It seems logicical that sociopaths can be programed though, in corporate enviroments those type of minds will perform better, or in war, any task that has to do with exploitation they excell. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a eye opening piece on the subject of programing at a young age using youtube videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, I do have a counter argument.</p>

<p>Kids may be more safe and have more of their basic needs met, but social and emotional needs are not being fulfilled.</p>

<p>Many of my teens come from broken homes. They still have somewhere to sleep and eat, but they have no solid role models or consistency in family structure. Many are not being raised with values.</p>

<p>I feel that psychological needs are not being fulfilled. Many are not receiving the love and care of consistent role models and parents. Many are being raised by social media.</p>

<p>There are great parents out there whicj gives me hope. But there is also a breakdown in family structure, and I feel that is the foundation of this problem.</p>

<p>This is obviously much more complex than my post would allow for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Once again, a clearly thought out post that offers many aspects of the problem to focus on. Well done. </p>

<p>I believe the former president of Facebook Sean Parker was interviewed recently and said they knew full well what they were doing from the onset with the emergence of social media. If you have not read it, I suggest you do. </p>

<p>Social media I feel like is an inevitable cancer. It could not have been prevented. With the invention of the internet, social media was bound to happen. 
That being said I feel like the negatives outweigh the positives. 
I actually know someone who I suspect social media has made them socio-path like. And I didn&#39;t know them for more than 3 years but in 3 years I see such a change... And not for the better. </p>

<p>I&#39;m really frustrated with the amount of apathy social media has brought. Everyone is connected but there is no connection. I feel like the love is gone...there&#39;s some good people still but its less than what it can be, in my opinion.
It is definitely worth the research and I hope you continue with this topic. 
Thank you.  </p>

<p>Based on this comment, I agree that a lot of parents let the television raise their kids. </p>

<p>Bad parenting has always been an issue and always will be. It&#39;s too easy for any asshole to accidentally have kids and fuck them up. </p>

<p>I think entertainment is geared toward what is &quot;interesting&quot;. In most cases if not, characters with problems are what makes something &quot;interesting&quot;.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t sacrifice entertainment or comedy for the random people out there who can&#39;t control their children or refuse to raise them right. </p>

<p>Otherwise, we might as well watch Barney on a 24/7 loop. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The two factors have been found by those following this theory to display different correlates. Factor 1 has been correlated with narcissistic personality disorder,[12] low anxiety,[12] low empathy,[13] low stress reaction[14] and low suicide risk[14] but high scores on scales of achievement[14] and social potency.[14] In addition, the use of item response theory analysis of <strong>female offender PCL-R scores indicates factor 1 items are more important in measuring and generalizing the construct of psychopathy in women than factor-2 items.</strong>[15]</p>

<p>In practice:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>

<p>Oliver James identifies psychopathy as one of the dark triadic personality traits in the workplace, the others being narcissism and Machiavellianism.[7]</p>

<p>Workplace psychopaths are often charming to staff above their level in the workplace hierarchy but abusive to staff below their level.[8]</p>

<p>Workplace psychopaths maintain multiple personas throughout the office, presenting each colleague with a different version of themselves.[9]</p>

<p>Hare considers newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell to have been a strong candidate as a corporate psychopath.[10]</p>

<p>Differentiation is made between:[2][11]</p>

<ul>
<li>successful psychopaths – corporate climbers involved in irregular crime who tend to have had more privileged background, high IQ, and little risk of legal penalties.</li>
<li>unsuccessful psychopaths – involved in regular crime who tend to have had less privileged backgrounds, low IQ, and much higher risk of legal penalties.</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p><strong>The organizational psychopath</strong></p>

<p>The organizational psychopath craves a god-like feeling of power and control over other people. They prefer to work at the very highest levels of their organizations, allowing them to control the greatest number of people. Psychopaths who are political leaders, managers, and CEOs fall into this category.[5]</p>

<p>Organizational psychopaths generally appear to be intelligent, sincere, powerful, charming, witty, and entertaining communicators. They quickly assess what people want to hear and then create stories that fit those expectations. They will con people into doing their work for them, take credit for other people&#39;s work and even assign their work to junior staff members. They have low patience when dealing with others, display shallow emotions, are unpredictable, undependable and fail to take responsibility if something goes wrong that is their fault.[5]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did, the problems start from her glossing over her conflation of antisocial personality disorder, sociopathy and psychopathy.  She does this near the introduction in order to appeal to the pop-psychology culture that pervades American society, much like Gladwell and Dubner/Levitt appeal to the pop-statisticians/economists.</p>

<p>She does this in order to prey on the uninformed and paranoid and does so in order to promote something that is far more commonplace in American culture than sociopathy, the inability of people to accept responsibility for their actions.  Rather than addressing the root causes of bad actions, we can just point to buzzword pop-psychology analyses like &quot;4% of people are sociopaths&quot; and people will buy into it.</p>

<p>After her conflation of antisocial personality disorder and sociopathy (a fear-driving term which isn&#39;t even used by the APA), she continues to do so throughout the book in order to dramatize her thesis.</p>

<p>This is without even dealing with the fact that much of the book is presented as a dramatization, again, this is to appeal to pop-psychologists as an actual rigorous study into the nature of antisocial personality disorder and its consequences wouldn&#39;t sell books.</p>

<p>But, fortunately the book has now been recognized to be old and wildly out of date by people in the field, so it doesn&#39;t hold much clout with people actually trying to address the issues she brings up.</p>

<p>I used to post on social media a lot and something about it was just making me depressed. When I asked my self who or what I was posting for...the answers revealed it was not for good reasons.</p>

<p>The problem is I do not think teens have developed that capacity to self reflect...and so it may not be until later in their lives that they realize the issues with social media.</p>

<p>You post hundreds of times per day, I comment on lots of posts ... never insulted your intelligence either.  I actually think you&#39;re very intelligent, just unfortunately falling for the wrong &#39;information&#39; because it already suits your biases.</p>

<p>I really see no need to post cultural critiques in echo chambers for myself.</p>
