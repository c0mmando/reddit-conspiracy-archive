<p>I don&#39;t mind because whatever they could possibly be up to, and I&#39;m not convinced they&#39;re &quot;up to&quot; anything or that their connections are particularly deep, it&#39;s one or more orders of magnitude less than whatever Hillary had already promised to dole out after her victory, let alone all the corruption she would have engaged in after repaying all the big money donors who supported her.</p>

<p>To me, they&#39;re all corrupt, but he really is/was the lesser of two evils.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not happy about it, but I personally have no agency to make real change, and understand that lasting change is more likely to come by slowly walking back the corruption than it is likely to come by some sort of definitive &quot;revolution,&quot; not in the least because revolutions are relatively easy to hijack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But the conspiracy community has always doubted the system. We&#39;ve been trying to wake the world up to this fact for a long time. I&#39;m not saying I think Trump is a trustworthy president but I don&#39;t understand what the plan is if we remove him. Hillary needs to be exposed. The second that happens, I&#39;ll hop right on board with removing the rest of the scum. I trust seems like we need to focus on the big fish that&#39;s catchable right now so this community can gain credibility. I would love to tell my mother in law that the shit I said about Hillary is true and that she can watch her go to jail on tv. It would bring the country together because people would take us more serious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The organized crime syndicate that runs out of Moscow is Zionist. Putin does not represent Russia; he represents this crime syndicate. </p>

<p>The Russian (Zionist) goal of getting Trump elected was to put an Israel-friendly, war-mongering leader in power. Trump is a lot closer to Israel than Hillary is, so they went with Trump.</p>

<p>All of the Russian mobsters tied to Trump: Felix Sater, Semion Mogilevich, Alex Sapir are Jewish Zionists. Russia, in other words, is an Israeli proxy.</p>

<p>This is what the left gets wrong (deliberately). They know Russia is involved with Jewish organized crime, but they won&#39;t talk about it. Instead, they just talk about Putin as an oppressive white male, the usual Cultural Marxist narrative. The truth gets lost in this fog. The alt right then steps in and fuels the false opposition left. It&#39;s just a big mess. That&#39;s why we should stay non-partisan and see through all the BS. </p>

<p>To sum it up: the key to understanding what&#39;s going on with Putin, Trump, and the world in general, is organized crime, on an international level.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just hard to believe that Trump is closer to Zionism then Hillary. Zionist have ran the US for a long time and some of the families that work with them are the Clintons and the Bushes. That&#39;s one of the reasons I want to see Hillary in jail. It&#39;s the reason I want to see the Bush&#39;s in jail. We&#39;ve know the Zionist have owned the US media including Hollywood. We know they conspired with Bush to commit 9/11. If people see Hillary go to jail, they will take the Zionist threat more serious. </p>
