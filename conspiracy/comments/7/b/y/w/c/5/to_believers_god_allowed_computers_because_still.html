<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>
For this challenge I&#39;m asking for the DIRECT link to the final act in the satanic illuminati&#39;s script. It&#39;s part of the End Times big picture.</p>

<p>Computers aren&#39;t terribly mysterious.<br/>
They&#39;re just big machines with billions of tiny off-and-on switches that route electricity.</p>

<p>If you had a huge building with eight billion windows and people who could stand by their doorways and turn lights off and on by command, you could get the same kinds of output from a building and people that you could from a computer.</p>

<p>To emulate a computer you need:<br/>
- the ability to signal &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot;;<br/>
- a way of moving electricity.<br/>
The fact that in computers there&#39;s nothing but zeros and ones is part of the right path.</p>

<p><strong>God ALLOWED computers because ...</strong><br/>
For Believers, God is the perfect creator of all forms of life.<br/>
No grain of sand is moved by a wave, no leaf of a shrub by the breeze ... unless it&#39;s part of God&#39;s plan.  </p>

<p>Part of that plan is people&#39;s Free Will.<br/>
Yet anything people have done with it, all the way to the atomic bomb, is just another piece in God&#39;s plan.<br/>
<strong>Allowed</strong> by God.</p>

<p>As everyone knows, computers and the atomic bomb play the key roles in the satanic illuminati&#39;s plan of nuclear holocaust, planned to come to your neighborhood.</p>

<p>For Believers, have your say: God allowed computers because ...<br/>
Now, if you are not a Believer, please don&#39;t post here.</p>

<p>I will explain my opinion later, in case nobody else does it before.  </p>

<p><strong>Hints:</strong><br/>
- Daniel 12:4 - &quot;But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.&quot;<br/>
- The ultimate usage of software in End Times: When you push the button and you don&#39;t know what was programmed to be the real target.<br/>
- So that man, out of Free Will, will either use it in Service to God, spreading the Gospel, exhorting the Brethren to continue, for Fellowship with other like minded Believers, etc or to use it for selfish gain/interests, which either way, exposes man&#39;s heart to what the true nature of that man is.<br/>
- That the Brethren may come together, even though they may be thousands of miles apart, for Fellowship.<br/>
- To reveal how truly wicked this world is, how mens hearts have waxed cold, and that this knowledge may be available to all.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s wrong, because you have to distinguish the writings of the bible and other religions with actual scientific methods, theories, physical laws, and etc. Things that have evidence are the things people should believe in, and I&#39;m not sure what you mean by no evidence prior to the oldest person. Plenty of people have documented things about all kinds of fields of science, math, religion, culture and everything else throughout the world, and the reasons we know they tell the truth is because their stories are corroborated by many other people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do we know that all of those structures and writings weren’t just created in the Big Bang?</p>

<p>And science! That is an interesting thing isn’t it. The world is flat, the universe revolves around the earth.... </p>

<p>Joking aside</p>

<p>Science is just what we currently understand about the universe. It doesn’t mean there isn’t a God.  </p>

<p>The problem I think most people have is that they don’t understand the nature of God.  In fact, I would wager that if you don’t believe in God you don’t really believe in science. Using stem cells, we can grow organs. Weather prediction is getting more and more accurate. I’m sure at some point we’ll figure out how to control it. Why can’t there be a being that understands all of the fields of science. Using His superior knowledge he can create a planet that has the perfect amount of water, land mass etc to cause it to be inhabitable.  That can bring the moon into orbit at just the right place. Isn’t that what we already do on a smaller scale with houses, computers etc? Why can’t God just be the ultimate scientist?  Why can’t he just be a super advanced human life form?</p>

<p>There are some other religious aspects to it, but just because we don’t understand something doesn’t mean it isn’t real.  “For behold, this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man” God is an exalted/super advanced man and he is trying to get us to a point where we can become like him. </p>

<p>Just like everything else there are laws that even God has to adhere to. There are requirements for exaltation but that is probably a discussion for another time if you are interested.</p>

<p>You have every right to think that, just know that in doing so you&#39;re believing in something that has no base in reality or with any evidence. You keep saying why can&#39;t god be real, and because I can&#39;t prove otherwise he is real or might be. That&#39;s fundamentally wrong if you believe in the scientific method or any form of critical thinking. You don&#39;t start believing in something because of the lack of evidence <strong><em>against</em></strong> it, you believe in something because of the evidence <strong><em>for</em></strong> it, which there is none in the case of religion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of science does exactly what I am suggesting. Science comes up with a theory and then goes out to prove it. I approached religion in the same way. The irony is that science is so political right now that it is just as bad as most religions. Are eggs good or bad for you? What about the Mediterranean diet? What about saturated fat? So much “science” has an agenda that it ignores facts and evidence in favor for pushing the narrative.  Try reading “The big fat surprise” for how science has been pushing a nutrition narrative for the last 60 years contrary to what the evidence is suggesting.</p>

<p>I don’t think that religion has a lack of evidence. I think that people aren’t willing to accept it because it means that they actually have some accountability for their actions. I’m Mormon and have a lot more evidence for my belief in God than against it.    Book Of Mormon, modern prophets and apostles, etc. </p>

<p>But honestly, I can understand how many people reject the concept of a God. If I wasn’t Mormon, I’d have a hard time belonging to any other religion because there are too many inconsistencies in other religions doctrine and their understanding of God doesn’t make sense to me.</p>

<p>And finally, my theory about the creation of the earth is much more plausible than the “Big Bang” which also hasn’t been proven and there is very little if any evidence for it. In fact I think that it was disproven as a possibility a year or so ago but I don’t remember.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an incredible heap of theories that try to conform limited knowledge about the universe into explaining how the universe came into existence.  I don’t see how that is any different than someone believing that a supreme being created the universe. The only difference is that one person accepts a lack of knowledge of how it was done and the other forces the laws of the universe to conform to their limited understanding.</p>

<p>With respect to the Big Bang, even scientist don’t agree that the Big Bang happened because laws of physics would have to break down for it to happen. Not that I claim to be an expert on the subject of the Big Bang.</p>

<p><a href="https://m.phys.org/news/2015-02-big-quantum-equation-universe.html">https://m.phys.org/news/2015-02-big-quantum-equation-universe.html</a></p>

<p>I think the biggest irony is that science proclaims the need to be open-minded but like many other groups, those that profess the need to do something are typically the most against doing it. But that applies to religion too, not just science/political groups etc. </p>

<p>I do appreciate your comments. They are definitely something to consider especially with respect to my perspective on evidence.  I don’t think God will ever come out and say “Here I am” until the hour has passed for it to do anyone any good.  But I do know that regardless of whether or not he exists, Mormonism has changed my life for the better and that is enough evidence for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only implication with the Big Bang is that we have no evidence of a time before it, or even a thing called &#39;time&#39;. You keep equivocating scientific research with religious explanations and that&#39;s absolutely wrong. We have very explicit reasons why we believe in the widely supported scientific areas. Please name one piece of evidence any religion has. A person, place, or thing that I can visit, or talk to, or hear, that would single handedly prove to me that a physical interpretation and representation of a all-powerful man in the sky exists. There is none. Science uses cause and effect to determine the workings of our world and universe, and to determine the physical and other laws we abide by as people. Religion on the other hand, attempts to understand the unknown about science, people, our history, and the creation of our universe. The fatal flaw with religion though is they are not evidence based claims, nor are they backed up in any way shape or form. All religions are different which proves that it&#39;s horseshit. If there is one god, and he spoke to a famous disciple of your religion, then what about the god that spoke to Muhammad, or the god that spoke to &quot;*<strong><em>&quot;, or the god that spoke to &quot;</em></strong>*&quot;. All with different names, morals, intentions, and beliefs. It is when you realize this that the meaning of religion begins to make sense. Religion&#39;s silly side (imo) is thinking there is something more, something higher, and something more important in the world, something that created us and watches over us. It&#39;s silly because it is ridiculous that people can think that without any shred of evidence beyond the spoken word of a guy who heard something.  </p>

<p>God will never come out and say here I am, because there <strong><em>probably</em></strong>. Why do you have to put faith in a higher being, and worship one, and dedicate your life to one, and credit one for all of your achievements. (&quot;I thank god&quot;.... etc). At the heart of religion, beyond all of the names, stories and texts, is a core of morals that is embodied by the population and people who support that religion. Religion, to me, is a fundamental moral base for people. The bad part that comes with it is the irrational belief in something without evidence, because of &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;heaven at the end if I believe&quot;. <a href="/u/TheProfessor_2987">/u/TheProfessor_2987</a>, why can&#39;t YOU be the highest power in this world. We are the aliens, we are the higher beings of this planet amongst animals. What right does religion have to surrender our psychological and physical power and control? Go out in the world and take shit for yourself, be successful, and have morals and be kind to others. At the end of it all when you&#39;re done, DONT THANK GOD, you know why? YOU DID IT</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry I feel the need to bring this to your attention, but I&#39;ve watched you for a while and your tone has grown more harsh over time. </p>

<p>Not saying your response condescends me, but I&#39;ve watched you call some attempting to understand your point of view &quot;cattle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;God allows computer to exist because End Times is cyclical to bring about awareness.&quot;</p>

<p>Computers process probability as spelled out by you. End times plays a part in this as spelled out by you. 
We have lived through end times through every decade of man and it always brings the fringes closer to enlightenment with god.  </p>

<p>It is the eternal struggle.</p>

<p>Computers have helped us ascend through immaterial experimentation and as such we can use the greater good to process information to bring about the apocalypse or &quot;great revealing.&quot;</p>

<p>False, as previously mentioned End Times only occurs ONCE in God&#39;s timeline.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>You said it yourself.  God allowed computers to be built.  He allowed it because He has given us free will.  He set before us life and death (Deuteronomy) and wants us to choose life.  However, without the opportunity to choose darkness..sin...death...we don&#39;t actually have a choice.</p>

<p>God created good and evil...darkness and light.  </p>

<p>I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things. (Isaiah 45:7)</p>

<p>Just because God allows something doesn&#39;t mean He prefers it to be that.  In His sovereignty though He is able to use it for His purposes.  </p>

<p>And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. (Romans 8:28)</p>

<p>In the system God has set up on this earth to resolve the situation with the devil, He has allowed the devil to be the god of this physical world.  We can choose the fleeting pleasures of this physical world (follow the devil) or we can choose the lasting pleasures of the spiritual (following God).</p>

<p>In regards to computers specifically, God allowed them to be created because he allows free will.  We have the freedom to use them for His purposes or for the devil&#39;s.</p>

<p>God has offered us an eternal existence in Heaven.  Heaven isn&#39;t some place in the sky.  Heaven is an existence with God in the spiritual.  We can participate in the Kingdom of Heaven on this earth by abiding in God and God abiding in us.  The spiritual is all around us even on this earth (Angels and demons).  They just operate in a different frequency.</p>

<p>God has set forth on this earth to accomplish His plan by working through His people by us allowing His Spirit to live and operate in us.  We have a relationship with Him...trust Him...listen to Him...and carry out His commands.  He can communicate with us...we talk...we listen.  We also work together with other people operating in the Spirit as one collective Body...with God...Jesus...as the Head.  In this way, we have a collective consciousness.</p>

<p>The devil always tries to mimic what God is doing, but he&#39;s bound by this earth.  He wants to offer us things that attempt to rival God.  He offers us these things to rule over us...the image of God.  Of course, what he&#39;s offering is fraudulent, but he fools us into willingly taking it.</p>

<p>He wants to offer us eternal life (earthly), a collective consciousness, and he wants to have the ability to understand our every thought and control our every action.</p>

<p>This is where computers come in.  The devil will use technology...the combining of man and machine...to try and offer us eternal life.  People, part computer, will join together with the devil in a network.  He will sell it in a way that is appealing to people.  When people are susceptible to being hacked (for lack of a better word based on the current understanding of technology), he, the devil, the antichrist, will step in to offer us security in his network.  </p>

<p>The devil will use this time to enslave us.  People will go through a period of enslavement (think of the Israelites).  People will suffer like never before (that&#39;s Biblical).  People will cry out (like the Israelites under the rule of Egypt).  God will then come again and deliver His church to the promise land.</p>

<p>This was a very quick writing, so I apologize for the formatting and not taking the time to source everything from the Bible.  I&#39;m at work.</p>
