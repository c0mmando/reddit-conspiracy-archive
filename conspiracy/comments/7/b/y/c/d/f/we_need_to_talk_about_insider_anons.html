Then there was Fbi Anon and he failed. Then there was Cia Anon and he failed. Then there was Mega Anon then he failed. Now we have Q Anon and apparently he failed. </p>

<p>The point is for about the last 3 or 4 months there has been a (Insert official sounding prefix here) Anon telling us everything was going as planned, don&#39;t worry, this is about to happen. Then it didn&#39;t happen. Then comes a different insider Anon with a different prefix +Anon telling us something else we believed til it was wrong then a different anon, and another and another all giving us the great news that ultimately failed to pan out. </p>

<p>In a few days there will be ANOTHER new Anon telling us its almost complete the last dominoe is about to fall, so and so are now in custody and they are rolling over on bigger fish. Will we believe it again until it fails again and wait for the next anon to come out with our new wishful thinking? </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be honest for me I guess it was just wanting to believe. Just wishful thinking. </p>

<p>And before the comments come, I know SOME people never believed in the anons. I seen your posts and comments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just take the cynical view of all of it. As far as I&#39;m concerned, the last legit Anon was the <em>first</em> FBI Anon, who talked about how HRC would be let off and to focus on the Clinton Foundation and follow the money, among other things. Every Anon after that hasn&#39;t said anything that can truly be seen as reliable. </p>

<p>I want it to come true, I want the Cabal to come crashing down, but I don&#39;t think the current people in power, in either Congressional Party or the WH, are going to bring that about. We, as The People, have to organize and take the parties from the grassroots and implement our own people/politicians if we want change. </p>

<p>Consider the situation is more complex than &quot;good guy gets the bad guy.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s rather strange when a &quot;mafia&quot; group gets busted and a few get pegged but the leadership maintains their position or they ignore a long history to peg them on a single incident (Al Capone tax evasion), peanut gallery will call it out and blame government and the system, or some merely recognize the way the world works. Yet when a &quot;mafia&quot; which has control of the government is operating the gallery assumes any action should be quick, comprehensive removal of every actor and every crime exposed.</p>

<p>Think about it for a moment and re-evaluate what the world you live in really is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your order is wrong. FBI Anon was first and predicted the Hillary e-mail investigation. Then it was White house Anon and the others. Before all those folks though was the anon that dropped knowledge bombs, and a lot of the credibility people give to new insiders is because of the legitimate knowledge bombs anon dropped, and FBI anon correctly predicting the craziness of our past election. The Clinton foundation investigation (still ongoing and people forget this detail A LOT) and all that spawned from that.. Podesta e-mails etc. I haven&#39;t really trusted any insiders since then, but this Q guy might have access to tidbits of some compartmentalized info maybe... In my opinion.</p>

<p>People are digging and working together like never before and it may be the foothold needed publicly to have fuel to fire at the beast.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s all about the subconscious mind and they are tearing at the fabric of normalcy with memes and info dumps.  </p>

<p>There is so much strewn out information from good sources to build support for the narrative that it will have a lasting effect on the label of conspiracy theorist yet.  </p>

<p>It is a good thing even if a few hairs end up being dead ends.  The game is played through mixture of truth and lies for strategy from people in very aware situations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FBIAnon seemed to be quite on point as far as his knowledge of DOJ/FBI procedures and did seems to nail a few things... he kept his LARP believable and didn&#39;t profess to be some all seeing eye that knew every detail of the world... he kept it ambiguous and made no promises as to the future. Whether he was real or not... he was grounded and believable... The next big LARP after him seemed to fall flat... then the rest were all shitshows. </p>

<p>If any of the LARPs was real it was FBIAnon... This screenshot is pretty decent to read thru 16 months later and see how close he was on some things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t follow these anons religiously but redditors will post when an anon is correct and the fact that the anon was correct should lead to some credibility. </p>

<p>I think what happens with false flag attacks is that the operation is so huge that the operatives are bound to fuck up.  A false flag attack like Las Vegas cannot be practiced before they actually execute the operation and just like everything in life, practice makes perfect.   So maybe some of things reported by the Anons were supposed to happen but got aborted at the last second due to some operatives fucking up.  </p>

<p>If the hive mind thinks of it enough, it will become so.  </p>

<p>We start to see the shit happen. If anyone hasn&#39;t noticed each and every anons plans seemingly through media outlets were started and we can get excited about the instantaneous synchronicity of it all.  </p>

<p>But I am fairly certain it is the negative nancys, the shills and the naysayers that are actually causing the processes to hault or get de-railed.  </p>

<p>If everyone thinks I am full of shit with the law of attraction why don&#39;t we put it to a test? </p>

<p>We should setup a time a day and try to mentally coordinate an event or something to happen all together. </p>

<p>If we fill out descriptions of said event and every individual can visualize in its entirety the event while meditating and can get the illustration perfectly tuned into the third eye. I can almost guarantee we will be unstoppable. </p>
