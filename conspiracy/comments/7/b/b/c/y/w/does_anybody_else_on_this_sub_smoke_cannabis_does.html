       Are you aware of the fact that there is actually a "cannabinoid system" we are all neurologically equipped with? Our brains are already prepared to receive and utilize thc and the benefits of marijuana. Rejoice in this! We were meant to use this incredible resource! Fuck the elites who try to keep it down.

       No more bullshit. I wanna be able to light up a cone whilst waking in the park. I want the single mother who's son has epilepsy to be able to utilize CBD oil to help alleviate their symptoms so they can live a normal life. I want people with AIDS and Cancer to be able to use cannabis for its appetite stimulating properties.

       We need to get out of the closet and demand our rights as marijuana users. Fuck TPTB.

       Same here. My husbands ex wife successfully used the corrupt court system to have his visitation (child support increased) in Arizona, and he had his medical marijuana license. We moved here in hopes of fighting it over state lines. Also, I am in recovery for alcohol addiction. Legal cannabis and cbd everything is honestly helping save my life.

       Seems pretty obvious that the only reason weed is illegal at this point is because of the strong hold alcohol has on our society. They don't want the competition. Look at Colorado man. They are doin great. Raised millions to invest in their school system. It's really fuckin absurd that it's still illegal. We have doctors prescribing pills left and right that get people so hooked that they turn to heroin so they don't have to spend 90 bucks a day on pills. And this fuckin plant that you could grow in your house is still a legal. It's fuckin ridiculous and I hope we get ahead of this in the next few years.

       Smoking pot was not compatible with other things I wished to do in my life, you know, like being gainfully employed and spreading awareness of the injustices and conspiracies that exist in the world. So I gave it up. For every person who manages to kick arse while being a regular pot smoker I would wager there are a dozen or more who were like me who found use of the substance significantly blunted their edge and ability function in the world. What is the point of all the insight I got using pot if it made me unable to effect change in the world? Sober, I haven't lost that much insight, but I have gained a 1000 times the ability to achieve my goals.

       It did the same for me, but that was because I was smoking every day all day. I think if i could just have smoked at night that I would not have become so lazy. But im an allin or nothing kind of guy, so i choose nothing.

       I used to smoke back in college but never truly experimented with pot.  I was away from it for decades when I finally wanted to experiment with it and see what would happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I started buying enough so that I could smoke as much as I wanted, as often as I wanted and I would just see what effects it had on my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed the following:
       <br/>
       1) Life became increasingly enjoyable.  I didn't worry about shit as much, I just enjoyed people and life.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) My compassion for the struggles of my friends and family and event people I didn't know SKYROCKETED.  I literally wept at news stories because I could see and connect with actual people suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Dramatic TV shows like Sons of Anarchy became incredibly fascinating and intense.  I would have to literally pause episodes because I was so into them.  I liked the show before but it became fucking bad ass to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) I could detect people bullshitting me almost instantaneously.  I had worked with my boss for many years and thought I knew him.  After smoking pot I had kind of a "burning bush" experience with him where he was telling me something and I immediately knew he was lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was almost as if I could hear music and a big spotlight shined down on him and I thought "He's fucking lying to me."  So I asked clarifying questions and started noticing his body language....all of which confirmed my suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I even went off topic and the indicators dropped.  Then back on topic, the lies and body language started again and I was stunned.  I couldn't believe it was so fucking obvious to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       This BS detection engine spread outward and I could see clearly, like never before, why was being genuine and who wasn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       5) My attitude at work improved dramatically and yes, sometimes I was high as a motherfucker at work. But instead of being dangerous or moody like when on alcohol, I was fun, happy, charming and people started coming around more often wanting to spend time with me and commenting on my improved attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       6) I was much more loving in my personal relationships and felt much more connected to life and love and all my friends.  It was bad ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this happened after I began smoking and went away when I quit.  It returned when I went back to smoking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I wasn't expecting anything to happen when I began experimenting except to have more fun in life, laugh more and maybe get a bit fatter because of the munchies.  I had no idea all this stuff would happen and it was cool to see these things show up.

       Toledo, Ohio currently. It's completely decriminalized and the cops are really cool about. Mainly because there is a big heroin epidemic going on in toledo. So they just don't give a shit. Michigan has medical and Toledo is right on the border so there is always good stuff. I bet most of the elite smoke weed.

       I smoke a lot. And really.. If I'm in the right social situation it helps me expand my thoughts a bit better. However I noticed that when I'm smoking alone I just want distractions. Helps put my mind off things. Keep it up tho

       I've been a heavy smoker for around 15 years and I believe it has influenced my critical thinking, emotional sensitivity and perception of personal space both physically and pscologically. These changes can form negative and positive outcomes and it's upto the individual to learn how to adapt to these changes for the positive. - there's always 3 sides to every story, yours, theirs and the truth.

       In a book about mind control it says that marijuana is the one drug that does nothing to help hypnosis. Actually it turns out that pot did the exact opposite so take it for what it’s worth. I can’t remember the exact name of the book.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whatever form of hypnosis we encounter it’s more than likely that pot limits it or erases it.

       Reality is very hypnotizing. Cannabis disrupts the hypnosis. I think it was Daniel Amen who pointed out that stubborn people with calcified ideas can only be given new information after a) weed b) heavy exercise c) sex d) a decent rest.

       I honestly believe that if The United Nations made the prohibition of cannabis illegal worldwide, we could use existing technologies and infrastructures to create self sustaining plant based energy sources that could completely re-haul the way the world depends on petroleum and fossil fuels. We could completely rehabilitate the economy and explore new technologies and lifestyles that humanity hasn’t had the ability or the freedom to explore.
