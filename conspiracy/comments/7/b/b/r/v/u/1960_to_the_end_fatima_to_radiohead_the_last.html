<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>
Tipton, Oklahoma - Days after an EF4 giant tornado destroyed the State University agronomy research station, a massive sinkhole appears overnight. [1]  </p>

<p>Reminder of Last Prophet&#39;s words about the Last Trumpets:<br/>
Last Trumpets and Sinkholes are signals of transition between this world and the next and they both echo sounds of the soul.<br/>
But that is where the similarities end.</p>

<h3>Last Trumpets, the ultimate End Times Paradox, solved by Last Prophet: as simple as 1+1</h3>

<p><strong>The sound of the Last Trumpets</strong><br/>
The sound of the Last Trumpets echoes the human soul. It is a sound without corruption, the raw sound of the neshama.<br/>
The bend of the shofar echoes the transition between this world and the next.<br/>
The sound of the last shofars is also unique because it is heard only ONCE in the History of Mankind for ALL of Mankind: during End Times.<br/>
The first trumpet echoed 1914, the Last Trumpet echoed 2004.  </p>

<p><strong>The ultimate End Times Paradox</strong><br/>
The ultimate End Times Paradox: trumpet after trumpet, it was more and more impossible to ignore their unique sound that echoes only ONCE in the History of Mankind ... yet fewer and fewer were able to listen to them.</p>

<p><strong>Ultimate End Times Paradox explained</strong><br/>
To solve this paradox all you need is to add two basic facts:<br/>
1&amp;#46; Illuminati pushed brainwashing of people to the utter limits during End Times, finally reducing them to beasts.<br/>
2&amp;#46; Beasts, unlike children, are no longer able to REPENT.  </p>

<p>So as the LAST TRUMPETS echoed fewer and fewer were able to listen.<br/>
No wonder that apparently Radiohead&#39;s Creep was the only hit song to state &quot;I REPENT&quot; since 1960, the latest deadline to reveal the REAL third message of Fatima.<br/>
Reminder: a creep can <strong>still</strong> CONFESS WHO HE IS. A beast can <strong>no longer</strong> CONFESS what IT IS.</p>

<p><strong>The ultimate End Times Paradox - Consequences of the answer</strong><br/>
&quot;Coincidentally&quot; sinkholes are ALSO signals of transition between this world and the next.<br/>
&quot;Coincidentally&quot; sinkholes appear also only ONCE in the History of Mankind for ALL of Mankind: during End Times.<br/>
&quot;Coincidentally&quot; sinkholes also echo the raw sound of the neshama.<br/>
&quot;Coincidentally&quot; the sound of sinkholes is heard as chorus in a song also by Radiohead, NO SURPRISES (in HELL): &quot;take me out of here&quot;.</p>

<p><strong><em>Notes</em></strong><br/>

<p>To know why July 1914 to April 1915 were the first days of End Times... helps understand the last days.</p>

<p>July 1914 - <strong>Dancing on top of the volcano</strong>, staged harmony before the Austrian (German) ultimatum to Serbia, the illuminati move to begin the First World War.
The Ottoman Empire prepares the <strong>genocide of</strong> the Armenians, the <strong>first Christian nation in History</strong>.</p>

<p>November 1914 - The <strong>genocidal illuminati-muslim alliance</strong> enters the scene, as the Ottoman Empire enters the war, attacking Russian naval bases and shipping in the Black Sea. Nearly 90% of the Ottoman Third Army is destroyed by Russian forces in the Battle of Sarikamis.</p>

<p>Christmas 1914 - The miracle of the Christmas Truce, the soldiers <strong>refusal to continue to follow the illuminati script</strong>, as the horrors of World War became clear. End of the Christmas Truce by successful implementation of German and French illuminati orders for mass executions of soldiers who refused to continue to take part in the illuminati slaughter.</p>

<p>April 1915 - The illuminati use for the first time <strong>weapons of mass destruction</strong>, at the Second Battle of Ypres: within seconds of inhaling the vapor of chlorine the victim&#39;s respiratory organs were destroyed. The <strong>genocide</strong> of the Armenians <strong>begins</strong>.</p>

<p>No. Nostradamus has been an illuminati favorite icon marketed to human cattle for almost 500 years. Anyone not brainwashed should be able to figure out the deception after spending 10 minutes perusing his material. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not uncommon that people currently suffering from various forms of mental illness end up here. So i&#39;d like to ask, are you feeling okay? If you honestly are and you feel that there&#39;s something to this, then please, slow down, level with people, and explain yourself point by point.

<p>No, rather End Times aka the Last Days of Evil are coming to an end.<br/>

<p>The article is formatted into logical sections, each containing information concerning what&#39;s relevant to that section.<br/>

<p>As previously explained, the article is already in its most reduced state or as user friendly as possible.<br/>
Despite being in the simplest form possible, you still refuse to specify the first &quot;ramble&quot; line that you don&#39;t get which is apparently causing you to be confused.<br/>
If you are unable to even precise what it is that you don&#39;t understand than it&#39;s highly probable your conclusion that you&#39;re &quot;just not smart enough&quot; is accurate, especially since others have commented explicitly stating the article is coherent.</p>

<p>No, they are not. Your total loss of capacity to build any logical reasoning is not a good &quot;argument&quot;.
You either refuse to get the words a child can understand or you&#39;re just incapable of understanding anything unless it&#39;s been fed by the illuminati and dumbed down for your digestion.<br/>
The evidence: you can&#39;t even begin to state the first word of the first line that&#39;s supposedly confusing to you.</p>

<p>You misunderstand what&#39;s written.<br/>
The article mentions the lyrics &quot;take me out of here&quot; in context with &quot;the sound of sinkholes&quot;, as a reference to the final descent alias path to HELL.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‘Creep’ mentions the phrase ‘I REPENT’ exactly zero times</p>

<p>&quot;I REPENT&quot; is implicitly stated in the song&#39;s lyrics.<br/>
The subsequent line in the article explains that &quot;a creep can still CONFESS WHO HE IS&quot;.</p>
