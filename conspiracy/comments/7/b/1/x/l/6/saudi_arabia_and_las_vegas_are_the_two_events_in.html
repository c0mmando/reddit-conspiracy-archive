       With everything going on, it's been a bit difficult following everything and keeping attention to the details.  From what I'm starting to piece together, I really do think we are seeing an implosion of what we think is the deep state, or this global cabal of jack-off's who are fucking up everyone else's good times.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the reports on Saudi Arabia are true and the likes of
       <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/detained-saudi-businessmen-171105095103488.html">
        Bakr Bin Laden, Saleh Abdullah Kamel and Ibrahim al-Assaf
       </a>
       .  Well shit, that's terror group if you ask me, aka the bush/clinton/israeli cabal right there.  If they are going down, i doubt they, the saudi's, care about saving the bush's or the Clinton's asses.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did see somewhere that there was a report of a helicopter that crashed killed a SA royal member however i have not had a chance to look into it.  Perhaps it's their attempt to eliminate anyone in custody or anyone that has ties to the obvious coup taking place?  I don't know, but with the new shooting in texas and now the paradise papers, i feel they just data dumped everyone to keep them off what the fuck is really going on, like the massive false flag in vegas that even my grandma questions what really happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       ok, thanks - I think my rant is over now.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT:  Also we should not turn our focus away from the election fraud and what clinton did, put the whole left and right party behind their own prison bars they locked us all in for so long.  haha, ok, rant now really over.
EDIT 2: Paradise not panama.  whatev's

       Exactly, this shit is equivalent to the maddow tax leaks; nothing will come from it. The fact that the headline is how many pages it is and not who it implicates with really incriminating behaviour shows how insignifcant it is.

       time will only tell but I think it's more about the people taking the reigns, not just one person.  In actuality, giving the president power is allowing us to be ruled by a king, not the republic we intended.

       There was an image from the turkish riot's that has stuck with me for some time now.  It was an image of the police fully dressed in riot gear.  maybe 50-100 blocking off a street.  Down the other end of the street there was literally thousands of people, held back by this little group.  It was a powerful image and if the people could see that we are the strength, non of this shit would matter.  we would just take it back no questions asked.  I think george bush said it best when he said, "if the people ever foudn out what we did they would hang us from the tree," or something like that.

       I disagree and when I say a president or a ruler I say that because our society is set up to solely give that level of power to one person. I don't agree with it, but unfortunately that is the reality. Obviously, we need to change too. For instance, and I always use this, global warming is caused by our individual choices as consumers, so are in some ways the powers of the banking cartel e.g. our reliance on them and our desire to just give our money to already insanely powerful companies. We'll obviously need to take individual responsibility, but in the mean time it would be nice to get a president in there who has so much power to actually fuck some shit up.

       i think we are saying the same thing, just taking different paths to get there.  You are suggesting we need a strong leader to eliminate the process and I just don't think any man or woman can resist the temptation of the ring of power and eventually it turns you.

       I am stunned at the ho hum reaction to Saudi Arabia. Miss ole from Yemen, Princes jailed, helicopter goes down, and it is buried under a Houston quaterback knee injury and Vin Scully saying he quit watching football. You don’t have to be a conspiracy theorist to see there is some serious shit going down on the Peninsula. I have heard more people talking about Long Island Medium today than I will hear talking about the Saud in the next month. Fuck me.
