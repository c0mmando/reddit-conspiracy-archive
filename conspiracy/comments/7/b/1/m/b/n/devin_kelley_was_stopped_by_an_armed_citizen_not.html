    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s blatanly false, too...</p>

<p>&quot;Beginning January 1, 2016, Texans with a handgun license will be allowed to openly carry their handguns. Churches in Texas may prevent handgun license holders from carrying handguns inside church buildings as long as the church gives proper notice. Each church may decide for itself whether to allow:</p>

<p>Both open and concealed carry of handguns
Concealed carry of handguns but not open carry
Open carry of handguns and not concealed carry
No handguns regardless of whether they are carried openly or concealed</p>

<p>A church does not need to take any action if it wishes to allow handgun license holders to conceal carry or open carry in church buildings. If permitting handgun license holders to conceal carry or open carry on church premises is a cause of concern to your church, Texas Penal Code Sections 30.006 and 30.007 provide clear rules for notifying handgun license holders that your church is a gun-free zone or concealed carry only.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an absurdly stupid talking point that borders on Godwin&#39;s Law levels of uselessness and functional idiocy. A truck has a varied abundance of utility that does not involve intentional violence. Some people live in their truck and never even move it. Guns have comparatively few utilities that do not involve intentional violence. You can be killed by almost any physical object. A person could be murdered with a clothes pin, an envelope, a stuffed animal, a rubber boot, a tennis ball, a ham sandwich, a deck of cards. But all of these things have significantly more utilities that do not involve intentional violence.</p>

<p>I think people ought to be able to own guns. The notion that, &quot;DURRRR WE BETTER BAN TRUCKS DEN&quot; is a reasonably convincing or useful argument is flat dumb. It makes you look like you coif your mullet with a curl and watch Jesse Ventura conspiracy specials on a TubeTV from the rental store. The world has matured past this stupid talking point. It is resolved. Catch up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ban trucks argument is as stupid as saying we should ban apples because they can be used as Marijuana utensils (you can make a cone out of one or anything) , just because you can use a truck to kill someone doesn&#39;t mean that is it&#39;s primary purpose.</p>

<p>An assault rifle is designed to do nothing but kill. I&#39;m not saying you guys shouldn&#39;t have guns, shotguns etc... but assault rifles that can take 100 round mags is fucking ridiculous. If you can&#39;t see that your just dumb as shit, plain and simple..  And i fucking love guns, i spent 3 days in cambodia just shooting off cheap ammo with every type of gun imaginable but i understand that assault rifle for personal use is idiotic..</p>

<p>Shotgun,pistol whatever sweet as...  The problem for you guys in the States is its been legal for so long that banning it now would do nothing, the guns are out there..  So no point whinging about banning them now, we have a saying here  &quot;You made you bed, now you can lie in it&quot;</p>

We will never know if this was the root cause of his rampage, because even if it was, that would expose the women as whores and cheaters, and society can&#39;t accept that truth</p>
