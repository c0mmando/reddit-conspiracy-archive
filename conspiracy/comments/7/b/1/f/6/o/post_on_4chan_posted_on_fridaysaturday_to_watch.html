In this thread it says that the comment was made Saturday not Friday BUT.</p>

<p>This one says Saturday.

<p>Click here which is shown in the search and it comes back as being posted on Friday not Saturday.

<p>If you look at these posts it says that the comment was placed on Friday not Saturday but none the less it mentions Texas. Can anyone identify that flag?</p>

<p>---Edit: Thanks to you u/disgruntledfuck in case his comment get buried.</p>

<p>&quot;I just posted this in another thread.... when you visit the image it is dependent on the timezone of the person that took the screenshot.</p>

<p>If you are in a different timezone than the person that took the screenshot it will give you a different time when you visit the page yourself.</p>

<p>Screenshot is not edited... this post was made some time late Friday/early Saturday depending on where you live.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The comment is real in the posts yes. They are archived BUT it says the comment itself was Friday NOT Saturday in the posts.</p>

<p>In the picture provided it says Saturday and NOT Friday so the one who claims the comment was posted on Saturday could easily be fake while the one Posted on Friday cannot be faked. </p>

<p>But what I am getting at here is that even if it was posted Friday and not Saturday the post itself mentioning Texas in the news is very weird. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) If true does anyone think the shooter could have posted that on 4 Chan. 2) about 4 weeks ago someone posted here and it was taken down by the mod IntellisaurDinoAlien for good reasons, a users post stated a what if theory. It said what if someone created a future date on 4 Chan and on this sub saying there could be a big event (mass shooting). And the actual person carry that shooting out.
I remember this post and thought to myself someone could actually do that and make it seem like the government created a false flag that way</p>

<p>Its worth noting that the OP of that comment could have just been using that image because OP wanted to, not necessarily because OP was a member of this group. And honestly, I think its very unlikely that the OP was a member of this group or that this group was responsible for the shooting. And if they were, that the group is anything more than a creation of a 3 letter agency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) If true does anyone think the shooter could have posted that on 4 Chan. 2) about 4 weeks ago someone posted here and it was taken down by the mod IntellisaurDinoAlien for good reasons, a users post stated a what if theory. It said what if someone created a future date on 4 Chan and on this sub saying there could be a big event (mass shooting). And the actual person carry that shooting out.
I remember this post and thought to myself someone could actually do that and make it seem like the government created a false flag that way</p>
