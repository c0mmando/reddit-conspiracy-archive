       I was just joking around with him about the types of procrastinators there were and 10 minutes later he sees this article titled "Use This Flowchart to Identify What Type of Procrastinator You Are" on his Facebook feed.
      </p>
      <p>
       This hasn't been the only time, it's happened many times now.  For instance, last week I told him I was going to Chipotle and if he wanted anything (verbally, not through text/FB messenger), and he sees an ad on FB about Chipotle.
      </p>
      <p>
       So disturbing.

       It’s not just Facebook. Pandora and other apps do it as well. I can speak a little Spanish and one day I was trying to have a conversation with someone in Spanish. The next day my Pandora was playing Spanish ads. It did that for a couple weeks.

       We give mic and other permissions when we download the app but in my experience it’s FB messenger app that’s the worst...when this started happening (seeing ads about things I talked about) I deleted the fb app and kept messenger and it kept happening...when I deleted messenger it stopped...then I added FB again without messenger it still happened but not as often....now I’ve deleted both and deactivated my account and life is so much better in general!

       Apple uses a cookies system that when allowed uses microphone gathered information to force advertising down ur poopshoot. U could take about diapers all day and by the time you go to bed youll see advertising for diapers. Instagram pulls my amazon deals and tells me “new deals related to my searches” usually they are behind the curve as of ive already searched all the current deals so its no help to me. Also apple tracks your phone if locations is enabled. Most likely only useful to the gov. If ur a terrorist or visit places in a red flag like fashion. CIA IS watching. But only to the bad guys. So stay on the right side and itll be ok. :)

       I'll give you folks some more… I listen to Pandora a lot. And when I say a lot, I mean all the fucking time. Especially at work. Couple of months ago, had a big job, hired a bunch of hispanics from the corner store, and had them on the job all day as my phone plays Pandora to a Bluetooth wireless speaker. Now of course these guys spoke to each other in Spanish most of the day and for the next three days I got nothing but Spanish ads on Pandora. Make of that whatever you will…

       Here's a tip if you may not know for androids (not sure for apple):
      </p>
      <p>
       You can actually download patched Pandora apk. It's ad free with unlimited skips. I have the patched 8.6 version with no ads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, don't ever sign up with Pandora. If you use a random email &amp; password, it'll still let you sign in. You'll lose your stations but it's worth not giving out your email.

       Facebook is utilizing what's already there. Google is an ad company, Apple also makes billions on ads. They're using the system that was put in place by the engineers of those operating systems. I believe there's a data file that these apps call up to get your ad preferences. Each app doesn't specifically spy on you, Google and Apple have the done the job for them.

       Google apps do this also. the "Listen" option was buried under some prefernces. I really dislike it, and I refuse to use Facebook out of principle, because it's not a social networking app, it's a corporate /govt spy app, and you and your data are the product. Unfortunately the only honest provider I've heard of is Lavabit, and look at what happened to them.
