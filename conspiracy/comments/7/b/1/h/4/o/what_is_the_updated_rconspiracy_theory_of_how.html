       Part of the deal... Trump gets to be president... FBI gets to take down anyone that was guilty but too politically connected to actually get charged... if they get too close to someone Trump cares about he can pardon them. Win-win as far as they are concerned.

       You think Trump made a deal with the FBI to become elected so they could charge people after he got elected? Why then was Comey fired, investigating the exact same thing as the Mueller?

       There are plenty of benefits for the FBI... they get to do their job for realsies and actually make arrests on cases they worked hard developing. You get a president that doesn't give a fuck about either political party and a whole lot of hands suddenly become untied...
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you really just call him "the Mueller"? I think Trump fired Comey for the same reason Comey sidestepped Lynch... lack of public trust.

       Still, why would doing their job be a benefit? You think they have to fabricate their own work? If Hillary would have won they would've been working overtime with all the shit that would go down. Why didn't the make a deal with her?

       Cause HRC would wanna blanket protect political allies and donors... Trump's lack of allegiance to party give the FBI open season on corruption.

      <p>
       Contrary to popular belief the FBI is mostly made up of some of the best investigators and cops in the country and do the job not for the money or the fame or power, but because they wanna do what is right for their country and protect the innocent...

       I mean, I admire your thinking acrobatics but this just sounds sooooo far fetched to me. Over complicated. There is a much less complicated theory here: no deal with FBI, deal with Russia, comey getting fired for not cooperating with Trump, new head investigator the Mueller doing his job, Russia doing everything it can to mislead from the truth.

       A lot of far fetched shit happens in the real world... this all just some head-cannon I have cooked up... but there aren't really too many holes to be poked into the theory. Trump has connections to the FBI going way back... that is the simple explanation for his "4D chess"... he's had someone leaking him info from inside an intelligence agency...
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean the real answer is probably super boring... the dems ran a super shitty candidate that a lot of people didn't want so they didn't vote for her so the other guy won... but this ain't the board for that kinda rational thought.

       Nope... but I can open up my mind wide enough to know that most folks have a very narrow point of view that they blindly adhere to in an attempt to avoid the uncomfortable feelings associated with cognitive dissonance... I can step back far enough to see a little bit of bigger picture. Nothing is black and white... it is all shades of grey.

       . Just cause yer in the majority doesn't mean you are right... and if you think Russia literally changed the outcome of the election then ya gotta stap on the ol' fisheye lens and look at the big picture. I'm not saying he's a good president... he's just a tool, but I hope he will be wielded well.

       And while that is a shitty argument I can through get it back to you. You can't prove Russia did not influence the election.

       Anyway I'm afraid you will be proven wrong. But then what I think is good does not seem to align with what you think is good, so...

       I don't fear the dissonance... I'll fess up if I'm wrong... I think both of us are right to a certain degree... but my theory is a whole hell of a lot more original and impactful... it give us hope for a beautiful future... whereas yours is just plain old boring and depressing. No one can prove a negative... but I bet we are right... the Russians and other nations worked to cause unrest during the elections... and the FBI is gonna take down a whole slew of corrupt politicians and lobbyists. Mine certainly has the most upsides if it is true... best case scenario with yours is that we get 3 years of President Pence. Yawn.

       Maybe if he's dirty enough... but I think they will look the other way on any minor details just to keep the wheels of justice greased and running smoothly... the impeachment process is so complicated and time consuming that at this point it is all hopeless dreaming that makes people believe it will actually happen with the amount of control "his" party has now. Look into the impeachment process... it's not some simple little affair... it ain't gonna happen.

       Eh... he doesn't seem like the guy to go out without a fight... it would take a couple years just to get the ball rolling. He'll ride it out unless he already got everything he wanted... then I could see him just going "Peaceout!".
      </p>

       Him resigning is 100x times more likely than him getting impeached while the GOP controls the house, senate and executive branch...

       Nah, obviously you can talk here... but it sounds like your mind is already made up and you have accepted the mainstream media's narrative, so I don't see what this board would have to offer.

       No, seems like you're quite fooling yourself there. To me it seems like you have an impressive ability to ignore the evidence and instead fabricate your own narrative. But that's OK, this sub is just the place for unsubstantiated theories :)

       It sure is... I'm not saying your little conspiracy theory is wrong... I'm sure certain elements are true... I'm just saying your theory is played out, mainstream pablum... it's easy to just follow the official narrative when it is spoonfed to you in little bite sized tidbits.

       My theory is way more fun and wholesome and original... and the best part is I made it up myself instead of stealing a conspiracy theory that someone at MSNBC made up.

       There you go again, ignoring the evidence and making up a narrative it's all fabricated and made up.

       You know there is no proof to your theory and admit you made it up all by yourself. And that's cool but, I find it more interesting to discuss the current
       <em>
        real

       Well the real situation is kinda boring... they are like 3 no name lobbyists that are only getting the spotlight cause they have some sort of connection to Trump. It wouldn't be news at all aside from people are hoping this gets them a little closer to Trump... when really they should realize that these guys are prolly the concession prize. But I'm glad these dudes are arrested... I hope there are 100s more from both sides of the aisle that go down hard.

       He was elevated by the Clinton/globalist camp for a pied piper victory. They thought he would fail horrendously in the general. Another theory is he was chosen by Marine and military elites in order to save the republic. Notice how he surrounds himself with tons of 4 star marine generals? Did you know
Marines have a special allegiance to the president specifically? Interestingly enough mueller has a marine background as well.

       The first part of the answer presumes there was an unexpected result. Things are not left to chance... On the second part, I see the military as an arm of TPTB, not the decision makers, could it be that they call the shots?

       You assume it all was a plan, but was it? Why was every celebrity and politician trying to denounce trump? Why did kasich and Cruz team up and tell voters in specific states to vote a certain way to ensure trump wasn't nominated? Why was trump the 1st topic at the bilderburg meeting? Why did 200 billionaires and elites meet off the coast of Africa to discuss how to put an end to Trump? Do you really think Trump was (their) desire? Do you think it's good for the elite to have a president that called Obama the founder of ISIS, global warming a hoax, vaccine skeptic, and touted by Alex Jones? You think it's all decided well it seems that "decision" was that it was Hillary's "turn" given she conceded to Obama in 08 after thinking she had it in the bag then too.

       Continuing my analogy with the WWE, you see story lines where a heel, like Vince McMahon, gets away with being terrible and everyone hates him.  Meanwhile, WWE ratings skyrocket...  Yes, all those things you mention make sense to me as part of the plan.  Also, I'm not convinced the actual elections matter at all; i.e. outcome pre-planned regardless of how people vote.  There's enough confusion in the American voting system to control the outcome with just a few control points.

       gave up on their candidates and put their people in Trumps campaign.  This was part of, not the deciding factor, in how Trump became president.  Conservative media earlier in the campaign season had headlines questioning whether Christians could vote for someone like Trump, then after the shift the articles became lists of reasons for evangelicals to support Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, more known members of the Christian Mafia are in positions of power in all three branches of government than ever before.  They are not the only group in charge of things, but definitely a major player on the world stage.

       Nothing in the last 12 months, mainly the repugnant response to Trump by nearly everyone except for the average citizen, leads me to believe that Trump was supposed to be president. I truly believe he was supposed to lose and lose badly.

       Hillary wanted to run against Trump

       While screwing our boy Bernie, they made sure Trump would win the GOP.
      </p>
      <p>
       They had that phony Russian dossier a long time ago but didn't use it bc Hillary's people all told her she was a lock to win. Every news media gave her at least 70/30 chances and it was 93% certain election day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump just was a blue collar guy with a story to tell that resonated with more people. They wanted a change from the 8 years of Obama and most young people could care less about Hillary bc they loved Bernie.

       Trump said what people wanted to hear. He was brash and rude and gave zero fucks, which Americans tired of empty pleasing words found delightful, even if he was gruff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people supported Bernie but as far back as the primaries we knew Bernie was getting hosed. At the democratic convention everyone was pissed HRC got the nomination. Everyone knew she stole it. Half the DNC walked out and they paid people to come in and fill up the seats.
      </p>
      <p>
       HRC's "rallies" were pathetically small and we saw evidence that the crowds were being edited in digitally (cut paste in photos, cell phones being held up in videos that didnt have the same content on the screens, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       When it came down to it, more people in more counties voted Trump, which tipped the scale for the Electoral College and he was elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       The democrats then spent the next year throwing a fit and trying to make us all believe the Russians had staged a coup. And now the real criminals are being routed and are about to get rounded up like the dogs they are.

       Trump won the Republican Primary, because the average Republican Voter was angry with the Whole Government and the Candidates that were running against Trump did not say anything about change and that they were going to go after those who wrecked the Country, Trump did.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the Other side: Many voters quit after Bernie {Lost/Was Robbed} and of those that remained, many switched sides because of Various Reasons: Hillary is Satan, Hillary is a Woman, and the Spite Vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Swing Voters: The main Reason was Change vs. Status Quo.  Many wanted to see a Change in Washington.  They Voted For Trump.

       It sure is... I'm not saying your little conspiracy theory is wrong... I'm sure certain elements are true... I'm just saying your theory is played out, mainstream pablum... it's easy to just follow the official narrative when it is spoonfed to you in little bite sized tidbits.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is way more fun and wholesome and original... and the best part is I made it up myself instead of stealing a conspiracy theory that someone at MSNBC made up.
