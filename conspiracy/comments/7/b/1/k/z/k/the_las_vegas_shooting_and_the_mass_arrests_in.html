        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><em>People of Interest:</em></p>

<p>(This list is a bit hard to follow because of the long names.  This chart : <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/a-whos-who-of-the-saudi-royal-family-2015-2">http://www.businessinsider.com/a-whos-who-of-the-saudi-royal-family-2015-2</a> will help you clarify who is who.)</p>

<p>King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud (King Saud.  Deceased) :  King of Saudi Arabia (1932-1953)</p>

<p>King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Deceased) :  5th son of King Saud.  King of Saudi Arabia until his death in 2015. Successor is King Salman</p>

<p>Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Henceforth King Salman):  Current King of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA).  8th son of deceased King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.</p>

<p>Mohammad bin Salman (Henceforth Crown Prince Mohammad):  Son of King Salman.  Currently next in line to be king after King Salman.</p>

<p>Muqrin bin Abdulaziz (Former Deputy Crown Prince.  Henceforth Muqrin) :  9th son of deceased King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud.  Was next in line to be king if King Salman had died before being crowned king.  IS THE FATHER OF Mansour bin Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud!  THE MAN KILLED IN THE HELICOPTOR CRASH ON 11/5/2017.</p>

<p>Mansour bin Muqrin bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (Henceforth Mansour) :  Son of Muqrin bin Abdulaziz.  Died 11/5/2017, the day of the failed coup on the throne of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  </p>

<p>Alwaleed bin Talal (Henceforth Talal) :  Billionaire businessmen.  Grandson of King Saud.  Has ties to DNC, Clinton, Podesta.  Arrested 11/4/2017 for corruption.  Owns The Four Seasons at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas (Four Seasons occupy the top floors of Mandalay Bay)   Owns shares in Twitter as well as other high-tech silicon valley companies. Has had spats with Trump in the past.</p>

<p>I know that&#39;s a mouthful of names, but bear with me.  Just remember 4 names: Salman, Mohammad, Muqrin, and Mansour.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Do you remember how President Trump visited Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017?  Do you remember how warmly he was greeted by King Salman?  I do.  It was a spectacle.  Why was he greeted so welcomingly?  After all, President Obama&#39;s reception was... shall we say, less than grand.  Do you remember how after Trump&#39;s visit, Saudi Arabia started becoming more open in their policies?  Women can drive there now.  Did you notice how the Syrian rebellion became quiet?  Did you notice how quickly ISIS was crushed after the visit?  Why did Saudi Arabia suddenly want to get their oil companies listed on the NYSE?   What could have caused this? </p>

<p>To answer this, we have to look a little further back.  Back to around 2010.</p>

<p>It all goes back to fracking.  You see, the Kindom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has always relied heavily on its vast petrol reserves for wealth and prosperity.  And they were ruthless.  OPEC.  The cartel of gasoline.  You can&#39;t count the number of times throughout history that OPEC used its power to crush governments, manipulate prices, control supplies, and fund activities.  If there ever was a international group of bullies, OPEC was it.  And at the head of this organization was the mighty KSA.  </p>

<p>Then came the fracking boom.  Suddenly, the world was no longer at the mercy of OPEC.  This made them nervous.  So, they did what they always do.  They pumped out more petroleum, driving the price of gas to lowest in decades.  What was their objective?  To bankrupt these fracking businesses.  KSA is rich.  Very rich.  They figured, we&#39;ll just drive gas prices unbelievably low and take the loss until all these fracking business startups crumble.  Do you remember how cheap gas got between 2013-2016?  It was ridiculous, wasn&#39;t it?  But what they didn&#39;t count on was just how cheap fracking had become.  So many of these business didn&#39;t go bankrupt.  So they took another step.  To convince the world that fracking was bad for the environment.  So they lobbied and supplied funds to the Democratic party.  Why?  Because the leftist are usually the ones who support ANY and ALL environmental regulations.  Do you remember all the legal battles that fracking had to go through?  Hell, it&#39;s still illegal in most blue states.  Do you now understand why the Saudis donated so much money to the Clinton campaign?  She was HEAVILY favored to win and if she did, you can bet your ass that illegalizing fracking would have been on the top of her list, returning us to dependence on arab oil.   But... this didn&#39;t work either.  Fracking continued.  And then, a shitstorm of reality hit them hard.  </p>

<p>You see, KSA had vastly underestimated the amount of total shale reserves in North America.  They had no idea that so much of this stuff exists.  They thought maybe they could ride it out if the reserves would dry up in a decade or so.  But nope.  We have enough shale to supply us for at least 50 years.   Hmmm... big problem.</p>

<p>So, if you&#39;re King Salman, what do you do?  Well, there&#39;s only one thing you can do.  Give up the reliance on oil production and try to use existing wealth to stay wealthy.  To modernize its trade to include more than just exports of oil.  They would need to build an entire industrial country from scratch.  To do that, he needed the help of the USA.  And that&#39;s where President Trump comes in.</p>

<p>You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting.  It was a business meeting.  King Salman asked Trump for help.  Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price.  Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding.  No more contributions to American politics.  No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups.  King Salman took the deal.  All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive.  ISIS was retreating.  Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition.  Yay.  All good up to this point.</p>

<p>Now comes the bad </p>

<p>Not all the royalties in KSA are into this.  They don&#39;t like losing the power they once had.  What&#39;s worse, they don&#39;t want to become liberal.  They now start resenting King Salmon.  They start plotting against him.  At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).  </p>

<p>October 1, 2017.  The top floors of Mandalay Bay isn&#39;t Mandalay Bay, but is Four Seasons, owned by billionaire Talal.  Who was occupying that whole floor that night?  I can&#39;t remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week.  Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty.  We don&#39;t know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad.  We know it wasn&#39;t King Salman, because he was in Russia at the time. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east</a></p>

<p>The plan is to take out the crown prince.  Then kill King Salman.  With the King and the Crown Prince dead, who is next in line?  Yup.  The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin.  So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad.  Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them.  This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor.  They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing.  Now, here&#39;s what happened that night:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns.</p></li>
<li><p>We don&#39;t know exactly, but either Paddock found out that the guns were going to be used that night or the CIA/FBI (or Trump&#39;s own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place.  Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins.  This is why the guns aren&#39;t loaded.  This is why it takes so long between bursts of fire.</p></li>
<li><p>The royalty in the floors above are notified of the assassination plot, and the prince is e-vac&#39;d out.  This accounts for all the helicopter flight reports that can be found on the net.  It also explains the gun fires that supposedly took place on runways.  It was literally a scene from a movie.  The bad guys were trying to gun down the helicopter and the good guys were fighting back.</p></li>
<li><p>The couple of assassins that made it to Paddock&#39;s room immediately kill Paddock.  Now, to disguise the assassination attempt, they open fire on the crowd below to make it look like a lone gunman terror attack.  They don&#39;t want concrete evidence that an assassination attempt was made.  They try to escape after the shooting, but are gunned down by the teams that were sweeping the casinos looking for the assassins.  Remember the final two shots?  I would guess that they were the shots that hit the assassins.  The bodies are immediately covered up and shipped to a black site.</p></li>
<li><p>Paddock is made the patsy.  Why?  Because if a failed Saudi assassination attempt was responsible for the deaths, if the FBI/CIA had supplied the guns that killed 58 innocent people (not counting Paddock since he&#39;s an asset), then two things would happen.  One, we would demand that we go to war with Saudi Arabia.  And two, which ever organization that Paddock worked for would be utterly dismantled.  </p></li>
<li><p>Do you remember President Trump saying, &quot;it could have been a lot worse&quot;?  Yeah, no kidding.  We could have had war or have had lots more people die if the death squad had all gotten their hands on the guns.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Wew lads, I know.  Quite a story.  Now, let&#39;s fast forward to one month later.</p>

<p>We know a missile was intercepted by the Saudi military on November 3 or 4th.  This was probably the final effort by the anti King Salman group.  This was their last ditch effort to kill him.  OR, it was staged to give King Salman the excuse to round everyone up in retaliation of the assassination attempt.  We know that MASSIVE raids and the rounding of Saudi princes took place on the 5th.  I will guarantee you that all these people are anti Salman/Mohammad.  And who was just killed?  Yes.  The son of Muqrin, Mansour.  Mansour&#39;s death was retaliation.  I have no doubt of it.  He was executed.</p>

<p>Ok, now that this has happened, what&#39;s next?  Well, my guess will be that we will learn all of the funding that has been coming out of Saudi Arabia for the past decade.  It will expose their connections to the DNC.  We will learn that they have been at the root of all the turmoil in the Middle East.  Then, they&#39;ll all be executed.   </p>

<p>Do I win the award for the longest post ever at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>?  Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>P.S.  The story works just fine with Paddock as a private illegal guns dealer, meaning the FBI/CIA only helped to foil the assassination attempt.  He doesn&#39;t have to be working for an alphabet agency.  However, given the clues from his life style (or the utter lack of it), I&#39;m betting that he was an asset.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good post. Almost exactly what I would post if I didn&#39;t already know what a huge waste of time it would be. No offense to you OP, but people here doesn&#39;t give a shit about reality. They just want to believe whatever it us they want to believe. Fuck the truth, right?  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe President Trump is doing what he is doing for all these ungreatful people that just want to bash him. </p>

<p>Anyway, it makes me feel a little better there is someone else out there that knows whats really going on. We are few. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Frankly, <em>some</em> tie with the Saudis is the most logical explanation for the utter lack of information coming out about the shooting. </p>

<p>It fits together awfully well, and though we may never know what alphabet agencies were involved, the likelihood is that someone was going to be embarrassed by it, and it failed miserably, so there&#39;s that to possibly take some level of comfort from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the post! Maybe I&#39;m a little behind, but why did Saudi Arabia fund groups like ISIS to begin with? It seem like violent fundamentalism would be against their monarchy as well, right?</p>

<p>And why did we allow them to fund ISIS while we wasting blood and treasure fighting them? How did this not put our countries at odds with each other?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a great read, and a very interesting theory.  I think there are a few weaknesses to it, for example, Stephen Paddock had booked rooms <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-las-vegas-gunman-lollapalooza-20171005-story.html">in Chicago during Lollapalooza</a>, and they overlooked the event.  This is evidence (circumstantial evidence, yes) that he had considered a rampage there before actually going through with it in LV.</p>

<p>Are we to think that the bookings in Chicago were a false story to lead to misdirection, or just completely unrelated (maybe he considered going to the concert himself), or is there a better explanation that I&#39;m not thinking of?</p>

<p>Well, my guess will be that we will learn all of the funding that has been coming out of Saudi Arabia for the past decade. It will expose their connections to the DNC. We will learn that they have been at the root of all the turmoil in the Middle East. Then, they&#39;ll all be executed.</p>

<p>I think this is far bigger, and goes much farther back, than you&#39;ve outlined here.</p>

<p>Huma Abedin with Bill &amp; Hillary Clinton. </p>

<p>Bandar bin Sultan Al Saud, aka Bandar Bush, with George I &amp; II. </p>

<p>What deal did Kissinger make to resolve the OPEC sanctions that have seen such close ties between the USA and KSA ever since? What deals did Poppy make while head of the CIA, when America lost it&#39;s puppet in Iran, during the same timeframe? What is the petrodollar, really?</p>

<p>If Hillary Clinton goes down it won&#39;t just be her - this could potentially do tremendous damage to <em>at least</em> the last five administrations.</p>

<p>Which House is being cleaned here? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt they&#39;d ever disclose the connection between the Saudis and the funding, they&#39;ll probably just quietly execute anyone responsible. Apparently there was an Al-Quaeda guy that snitched on several prince&#39;s and a Pakistani that helped with 9/11 and basically every one he ratted on got quietly killed.</p>

<p>Also let&#39;s not pretend that Trump and Muhammad bin Salman are the good guys, they&#39;re both globalists. Look at what MbS has been doing in Yemen and how he&#39;s been trying to sell his country off to the banks. </p>

<p>As for the connection to the Vegas shooting, the reason I&#39;m even coming up with theories like this is because there&#39;s just too little believable facts coming out of the investigation.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your first point. It&#39;s a changing landscape and hopefully one for the good. Clean/renewable energy is the future whether oil producing countries want it to be or not. There&#39;s still a huge market for oil beyond cars and they need to recognize that. It may not be the massive goldrush that they&#39;ve enjoyed, but as a race, humans still need oil in many other areas beyond automobiles. Medicine, building materials, structures, clothing, and so on. The need isn&#39;t going away.</p>

<p>As for the Vegas shooting... I have no definitive answer. Personally I think it was just one guy who hated the world he created for himself and decided to take it out on others. His casing of other festival venues even helps prove that point. Maybe he REALLY didn&#39;t like country music. We don&#39;t know, and beyond concrete proof we never will. Why the story has gone away, well partly that&#39;s the blame of the 24/7 news cycle we are in. News isn&#39;t a public service, it&#39;s a business. Eyeballs to the screen pay the bills, story fatigue can end your run. Also, public perception plays a role. </p>

<p>The Mandalay Bay is a massive multibillion dollar property. People not booking rooms, playing in it&#39;s casinos, dancing in it&#39;s clubs, eating in it&#39;s restaurants is going to drive down profits. This was an awful tragedy that happened to them, but at the end of the day they are still a business. Casino/Hotels of that size have weight, they have pull. Any loss of revenue is money that their competitor receives. So they use that weight and pull to push this matter aside so that they can get back to business. I don&#39;t think things are intentionally being covered up, I just think the process is being fast-tracked so that the company can go back to making money and not worrying about anything else. Corporate whitewashing if you will. &quot;<strong><em>It&#39;s not that it didn&#39;t happen, it&#39;s just that we are over it and it&#39;s time to make our shareholders happy again</em></strong>&quot; VEGAS!!</p>

<p>Sticking points: The assassins (death squad) were buying guns from a government agency (CIA or FBI is an important distinction these days) for the sake of the hit? Doesn&#39;t make sense. There are many more subtle ways to kill someone – and it&#39;s not believable that they would &quot;open fire on the crowd below to make it look like a lone gunman terror attack&quot; to cover that they were there to kill Saudi royalty.

<p>Well, note that during the attacks in Mumbai, there were scattered attacks elsewhere in the city in order to confuse the police as to where to respond.
That seems to be part of the way such groups operate.</p>

<p>When some parts of the planned major attacks in Mumbai didn&#39;t come off, the attackers were told, in essence, to do what they could to continue the fight.</p>

<p>(See the book, &quot;The Siege&quot;, about how these kinds of attacks are carefully planned.)</p>

<p>If Prince Salman had been killed, would KSA have announced that he had died in Vegas? Or would that part have been covered up? (Maybe claim a helicopter crash instead?)  The attack on Vegas therefore could be disguised as an attack on the city, and the Saudis would never be told that Prince Salman had been taken out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love this theory u/psy_raven.  MrMarmot, you make great tents and your comment has me thinking as well.  You also raised an excellent point - &quot;why the hell would they draw any public attention to themselves at all, for that matter?&quot; </p>

<p>In my opinion the CIA was involved in the actual event - the FBI came in after the event to clean up.  The CIA is very compartmentalized and shady, some with anti-trump/deep state roots.  Here is what I think happened.</p>

<p>Paddock was supplied the guns and was coordinated by CIA (CIA was staying in the adjoining room next to Paddock&#39;s suite but had agents everywhere).  The CIA&#39;s role was to orchestrating the support, secure the environment, support the assassins with departure distraction and clean up evidence as well as play backup assassins if the 1st team failed.   </p>

<p>Military Intelligence or NSA caught wind of this event and they notified the good guys (not sure who that is).  This group of good guys notified the SA prince of the assassination attempt and scared off or took care of the assassins.  All of this was unknown to Paddock and CIA until later.  </p>

<p>Once CIA learned of the situation they had to react.  Knowing that another US intelligence agency was involved they had to react with a lot of distraction.  They killed Paddock and shot into the crowd of people making it seem like a mass shooting.  All of this was carefully planned before hand (why else have a hotel room facing concert and weird guy Paddock involved).  CIA was able to leave the scene undetected.  ISIS (CIA) took credit for the shooting and this allowed for FBI DC Field office (CIA clean up crew) to take over the investigation from Vegas FBI branch. </p>

<p>There could have been lots of little pursuits going on across the city (good guys chasing assassins and CIA).  This is why we have multiple shooter claims and gun shots heard across the city.  This could also explain the deaths of the Vegas concert go&#39;ers that survived but later died.  The whole event was messy and agents probably shot bystanders while fleeing.  The CIA had to silence them.  I think it is odd that 2 or 3 of them died in car crashes since we know CIA has remote control capability.</p>

<p>u/psy_raven thanks again for sharing your theory.  My version above is to connect all the various conspiracies floating around.    </p>

<p>If U.S. counterintelligence spoiled the assassination, the assassins would have to find some kind of way to justify the existence of the weapons cache and Paddock&#39;s body. If it got out that there was an assassination attempt on U.S. soil then you have to deal with war implications, so you open fire on the crowd to cover up for it</p>

<p>The videos of &quot;gunfire from helicopters&quot; don&#39;t help the silly official story much either: <a href="https://ruclip.com/video/87ggHaEFNU0/insane-footage-of-helicopter-firing-at-crowd-in-las-vegas.html">https://ruclip.com/video/87ggHaEFNU0/insane-footage-of-helicopter-firing-at-crowd-in-las-vegas.html</a></p>

<p>Is it possible that you are confusing this reservation with the Saudi Air Force reserving the entire W hotel in Las Vegas for the month of august? I&#39;m unable to locate information of any Saudi visits to Las Vegas for the last week of sept. Through oct. 1st.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s possible these people pulled off this huge heist, then climbed up to the Four Seasons to take private elevators down, get into cars, and drive to the airport, but with how soon the strip was closed down I find that hard to believe. </p>

Helicopters are heavy, and in generaly building roofs aren&#39;t meant for that much weight, which is why most helipads have numbers instead of the H, to tell you if you can safely land there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit.  You just clued me as to what may be more probable events that night.</p>

<p>So bear with me.  What if the Prince (not necessarily Mohammad but another VIP) disguised himself as a regular guy and decided to go out for the night?  He went over to the Tropicana to play some cards and be normal.  </p>

<p>Just then, the FBI is notified of the assassination plot so they scramble to find the prince and escort him out of the casino.  Did you see how that asshole in yellow was pointing his gun at unarmed citizens?  YOU DON&#39;T DO THAT UNLESS THERE&#39;S IMMEDIATE THREAT OF LIFE of a very very important person.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the 32nd floor, the 1 or 2 assassins already there are panicking because their informant from the entourage has told him that the prince is nowhere to be found.  So, they kill Paddock and to hide the evidence of the assassination attempt, they fire on the crowd.  Lone gunman.  Voila.  Explanation for the guns being there solved.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the prince is escorted to the nearest helipad to be e-vac&#39;d but the party encounters some resistance from the remaining assassins, hence the firefight near the airport.</p>

<p>Wow.  I think this fits perfectly.  I&#39;m gonna have to change the original theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was only that Saudi&#39;s do dress in American clothes.  its not a religious hang-up or anything.  Simply put- a prince in Vegas doesn&#39;t need to be dressed in traditional garb to be royalty.  they have been known to go out of &quot;uniform&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absurd! Why would they need so many guns to assassinate one person?  The largest mass shooting in US history was not just an afterthought or a coverup.  the CIA was not &quot;duped&quot; by the Saudis!  There was massive premeditation and occult significance to the time and location of this.  It was carried out like a ritual blood sacrifice in front of the great black mirror pyramid! It&#39;s the 32nd floor because of Freemasonry!  I&#39;m sure there was some kind of Saudi connection, &amp; you connect many important dots, but there was more to it than you&#39;re implying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair, but what about the bipods and scopes? If you are in a hotel at night and the only way out is by helicopter, why would you order so many automatic sniper rifles that were poorly modified? Guys that drive Lambos and Bentleys don&#39;t ask for double mags held by duct tape. I really like the post btw. I was just looking into yesterdays attack on Yemen. It would make sense that we would have a scramble of political news, shootings and leaks, when that happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, I think we&#39;re confusing a few issues.  The death squad sent to kill the Crown Prince are mercenaries, not royalty themselves.  It would have to be a team of at least 20 people all armed.  Remember, the prince travels with an army ready to defend him.  Getting a large mercenary team thru customs with weapons is out of the question.  The weapons would have to be procured in the USA.</p>

<p>As for bipods and scopes, who knows?  Maybe they were going to snipe him as he walked out of the hotel and all the extra guns were a backup plan in case they would have to go commando style.  Maybe there were no bipods and scopes at all and the FBI lied to us.  The point is, the official information provided to us by the authorities is hardly believable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m starting to wonder of it is at all possible that the gunfire directed at the crowd was purely incidental.</p>

<p>The thought is, would it be possible that there was a helicopter outside, maybe flying below the 32nd floor or top floors, possibly firing back at the hotel, and that this helicopter was targeted by one or more elements from the hotel firing downwards in a way that missed shots (which are almost always most in a firefight) struck the R91 concert?</p>

<p>Pure conjecture, but just something that popped into my head. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very compelling.  I have a few questions.  First, how do all of the people who survived the attack and have now suddenly died fit into the narrative?</p>

<ol>
<li>I am confused why the FBI/CIA et al, were selling guns to a hit squad if they knew what was going on?  It seems that if they were attempting to thwart the assassination, the guns would have been inoperable, which is what protocol is for a sting operation of this magnitude?</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Good read but the assassination angle doesn&#39;t jive for me. Even armed to the teeth, making your way up several flights of stairs to have a gun fight with a Saudi Vip protection team that has the high ground and the choke point advantage and the latest and greatest security systems and helo evac access, doesn&#39;t seem too smart. Not to mention, why did they go through all that trouble without hiring their own chopper to fly up and disable the escape chopper before the royal dudes escaped? I would think, they could have pinched him on the roof pretty easily. Why not just plant a bomb in or near Paddock&#39;s room and blow up the whole top of the Hotel?</p>

<p>Another conspiracy dwellers brought it up first, the idea Paddock was a spook gun dealer that was gonna do a gun-walk and it went bad. I think some high level Saudi terrorist types had info, via leaks or bribes, about who some of our agents were and set Paddock up from jump street. They hoped to send fear and shockwaves through our intelligence communities and our citizens and maybe even destabilize relations with the current administration. Tptb can&#39;t admit they were running a gun-walk op in a crowded casino endangering civilian lives or that we have terrorists with inside knowledge of who are agents are. But I think the bad guys over-estimated the psychological effect it would have.  Rather than getting paralyzed by fear and eating itself from the inside out, our guys in the know just took to task tracking them down and letting the more progressive Saudis know it&#39;s really time to get with life in the 21st century.  If things are going crazy in ksa, maybe the more progressive Saudis see the writing on the wall and finally decided to get with the program and give up the assholes who set this shit up and want to keep the Kingdom in the stone ages. </p>

<p>Idk, good post though Op.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is definitely conspiring going on in Saudi Arabia at the moment.</p>

<p>There is also clearly information being covered up at the Mandalay Bay shooting.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think fracking links the two.</p>

<p>What of the war in Yemen? ISIS? Lebanon? Qatar? Iran?</p>

<p>Vegas was a circuit breaker in tensions between the US and North Korea. Adelson met with Trump and the very next day the embassy in Jerusalem and Iran were back on the agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine how many movies a la Jason Bourne could have been made from these hidden incidents. It&#39;s a shame that many people actually died during the LV shooting. 
From my short stint working with the Special Friends of uncle Sam, I can only imagine what really happens at the masked depths of agents/handlers trying to make their careers off of one case. Like how Chelsea Manning apparently claims that some team tried to break her out and she denied. Had She gone, she would have walked into a bullet to the back of the head. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you people have such a need to connect every event to trump and spin it so (or rather lie) that trump is some kind of hero? It&#39;s getting ridiculous.</p>

<p>-US oil production almost doubled under Obama. I doubt hillary would go for a change in policy.</p>

<p>-Hillary pushed other countries to start fracking too. Clinton isnt left, she&#39;s pretty much centrist, pro coorporations.</p>

<p>-Those arrested/killed are more diverse from what I read. Couple of them are very liberal. Some argued it was more of the liberal faction that got removed. I&#39;d love to see your sources where you got that from?</p>

<p>-What&#39;s the source of the whole floor being reserved? and why do you think only royalty does that? Billionaires do that all the time. Even complete hotels.</p>

<p>-Why do you think muqrin would be next in line to be king? From what I read, it doesnt work like that at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hold on bro.  I could see you taking this as a Trump-pro theory, but it really isn&#39;t.  The only part Trump plays in this is offering KSA economic/technological help if they stop funding illegal activities.  That&#39;s all.</p>

<p>What&#39;s really driving the change at KSA is the lessening of the world&#39;s dependence on Arab oil.  With fracking and clean energy, it is without a doubt that OPEC members are hurting badly.  Look at Venezuela. They entirely depended on oil export to sustain their company.  Because oil prices plummeted during the early 2010&#39;s, they&#39;ve completely destroyed their country.  Arab countries are not far beyond I would imagine.  </p>

<p>As for oil production, you mention that it increased during Obama years.  Doesn&#39;t it make sense that KSA would give Hillary millions and millions for the promise that oil production would be decreased when she won?</p>

<p><em>If</em> OPs theory has some semblance of truth (of course that hinges on an answer to your first question, which I don&#39;t have), remember, this is a family that has the intelligence apparatus of a country at it&#39;s disposal. If they bought guns with intent ahead of time, they may get found out. If everything happens all at once, nobody has time to plan and prepare for it if they get found out early.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the details can be argued (as that is the entire point of this group), but the basic concept behind the theory is really interesting -especially the power struggle in KSA and possible ties to the Vegas shooting. Who the heck would even know if Saudi royalty were staying there? I bet they don’t advertise it. Remember all those Saudis that were secretly flown out of the country post-9/11? I know that I never guessed that so many of them love to hang out in the US. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting theory and good read. My only problem is that you seem to choose teams pretty hard. DNC is conspiring with Saudi because of their resistance to Fracking, but the RNC is not because of the resistance to clean energy (wind, solar, hydro). Boy fracking and renewables would erode our dependency on foreign oil so both ‘teams’ are equal suspect.</p>

<p>If any of this is true I believe it will end up being much less of a team sport and more like corruption on both sides pursuing different avenues to the same end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure it does.  The fire fights at other casinos was the FBI/CIA roundup of the assassins.  Remember, I&#39;m saying there were many as 20 assassins total.  Most of them would have been rounded up without a fight since they didn&#39;t get to Paddock&#39;s room to be armed yet.  But it is feasible that a couple of them had sidearms.  </p>

<p>Also, the firefight outside as the helicopter took off would account for the multigun/runway shots reports.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Saudi succession drama is basically unfolding as you would expect. as bin Salman prepares to inherit the throne, he&#39;s eliminating all of his major potential rivals. This will be the first time since the 40s that the House of Saud has passed authority to a new generation of leaders. In the absence of a principle of primogeniture, this tends to turn into a bloodbath pretty quick where you either have to kill (and end up as the last person with a claim to the throne) or else be killed...</p>

<p>hughesgeo [2:08 AM] 
bin Salman is promising everything to everyone in the West if they&#39;ll make him king: peace with Israel, selling off all of Saudi&#39;s oil in an IPO (nuts, right?) and moderating Saudi Islam.</p>

<p>Perhaps the craziest thing is he plans to cut out all of the subsidies and start making Saudis pay taxes.</p>

<p>If trying to float ARAMCO and Saudi Arabia&#39;s two trillion in oil doesn&#39;t scream &quot;political risk&quot;...</p>

<p>Aside from the fucking obvious (coup/war with Iran followed by new regime saying &quot;fuck off&quot; to investors), there&#39;s a lot of other crazy political dimensions to ARAMCO that makes this nuts:</p>

When they realized that the prince was getting away, the assassins could have started firing at the helicopter to knock it out of the air, consequently hitting many civilians at the concert.

    <div class="md"><p>The hammer was used to barricade the doors and the stairwell.  It was just convenient to use it to break the window as well since it was already there.  Why bring a hammer at all to a shooting when you can easily use the butt of a rifle or just shoot through the glass?  The hammer being there only strengthens the theory that barricading the entrances was important.</p>

<p>We have no idea if the mags are loaded or not.  My guess is that they are unloaded, and it&#39;s the only explanation that makes sense.  Tell me, why wouldn&#39;t they have been used if they were loaded?  Why would it take Paddock an average of 40 seconds between barrages if he had dozens and dozens of pre-loaded magazines?  Why are they untouched when the goal was to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time possible according to the official narrative. </p>

<p>Stacking 15+ empty mags in a neat pile next to the window makes the least amount of sense. You stack them in that spot in that way if you need to reach them quickly to reload. These aren&#39;t 223/556/308 mags either. These are too narrow, almost look like 22 mags: </p>

<p>What is the blue hose? Breathing apparatus? </p>

<p>Unloading a mag, dropping the rifle, going to the next room, reloading that rifle and shooting makes more sense. If we&#39;re talking about Paddock still, he&#39;s an old, out of shape man using bump stocks. He&#39;s exhausted less than 2 minutes into shooting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The political discussion is first rate. The linkage to the Vegas shooting is garbage.</p>

<p>1) Assume Paddock is a Gun Dealer.  Why would he hump guns all the way to a suite in the MGM?  If I am selling 50 guns, I meet someone at a storage unit, or the back of a small store, somewhere you can roll in 50 guns, load out of a loading dock.  Preferably out of town.  There are reasons gun dealers work at Gun Shows or out of stores.  Just less BS dealing the product.</p>

<p>2) Assume Paddock is a CIA/NDA/FBI asset.  Again. You don&#39;t want to meet at the MGM. You want to meet in a van, preferably slightly out of town.  Maybe at a closed freight terminal, or empty gas station...</p>

<p>3) you are some saudi assasination team, and you find out Salman is out on the town. You wait.  You don&#39;t start some shit. You just hang out, order some room service.  If Paddock sstarts some crap, you lock him in a closet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1)  The guns were for the assassination of the VIP in the floors above him.  Tell me how a team of Arab assassins are suppose to smuggle in 20+ rifles and tons of ammo into a casino hotel without raising alarm?  Doesn&#39;t it make sense for them to request that Paddock deliver the good to their idea location?   Why wouldn&#39;t Paddock do it?  After all, the rooms are free to him (big gambler getting comped) and it&#39;s a lot safer to deal in a crowded hotel than in some deserted warehouse where the buyer could just shoot him and take the guns.</p>

<p>2)  I don&#39;t understand your point here.  To the assassins, Paddock is just a gun dealer.  They think he&#39;s a high rolling gun runner.  To Paddock, he need to keep exactly that cover in place.  Getting free rooms from the Mandalay is pretty good proof to the buyers that Paddock is indeed what he says he is, a gun runner.</p>

<p>3)  Didn&#39;t you read the updated version?  Check my submissions and read the latter one.  They did do the research.  They timed the sale to coincide with the VIP stay.  But something happened that was unexpected and they had to abandon the plan and all the fire fights broke out because of it.</p>

<p>Thanks for the compliments tho :)   I appreciate it when people have enough patience to read such a long ass post. LOL.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very well thought out. Enjoyable to read. I have some questions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yup. The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t you mean Mohammed? Looking at that Business Insider chart, it says that Mohammed is the Deputy, and Murquin is the crown prince. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Why does the US gov (FBI, CIA, whatever) want to take out Salman and Murquin?</li>
<li>Why would the gov give them weapons for a &quot;terrorist attack&quot;, especially on US soil?</li>
<li>Why, if it&#39;s the gov idea to kill Salman, does the gov save him?</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why Paddock? Where did he come from? Why is the gov working with him? Why did he send his girlfriend away overseas?</p>

<p>For literally the last 10 years I have been railing on people (Democrats and Republicans) for talking about how the President sucks because high gas prices, or awesome because low gas prices. Bulllllllllshhhhhit. OPEC controls the price of oil. Oil is a global commodity. I knew they were trying to kill oil production here by increasing supply. I mean, sure, there&#39;s other influences, like futures markets, but really OPEC controls the price of oil. Tying it with natural gas, and fracking is interesting. The thing is, there is evidence of wells failing and them leaking chemicals into the water. I mean, flaming faucets, and shit like that. Is that just fuel (pun intended) for the liberal save-the-earth agenda and just coincidence that there&#39;s scientific evidence that fracking really actually can fuck up our water supply?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been saying for years that we always sell weapons to &quot;rebels&quot;, who end up becoming our enemies. It&#39;s all over the place. From the connections to Bin Laden from Reagan-era funding, to Eric Holder in Fast and Furious.</p>

<p>I also thought it was rather odd that Trump sold weapons to a country that is everything Republicans hate. Muslim, Sharia, terror funding, etc. Shady as fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Muqrin bin Abdulaziz was the crown prince from March 27, 2014 – 23 January 2015.  The was then replaced by Muhammad bin Nayef to allay the fears that King Salman may replace the line of succession with his own offspring instead of the traditional King Saud line of descent.</p>

<p>Sure enough, on June 21, 2017, Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS), son of King Salman and was made Crown Prince replacing Nayef.   Then all the purging started.</p>

<p>The U.S. Govt does not want Salman dead, Muqrin does.  The whole attempt was planned by Muqrin and his line of successor Nayef.  CIA/FBI and Paddock didn&#39;t know the whole thing was Saudi based plot.  They thought it was ISIS or Al Qaeda carrying out a random terror attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The democrats are the same ones who raise emission standards and create subsidies for renewable resources.  The republicans are the ones who spend trillions invading Iraq so that saudi arabia can control parts of it now.  The republicans lower emission standards so Americans buy more oil.  The republicans fight carbon taxes by legalizing unlimited bribery so that no politician can fight the cartel&#39;s threat of money.  Let&#39;s be clear, the reason we still buy so much foreign oil is because of the Republican policies.  if JFK had never been killed we would still be spending 4% of GDP on NASA and would have 100% renewable power by now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think I buy it. Much too elaborate a theory. Here are a few of my issues with the theory. First, the Saudis are in no real threat of losing their oil wealth, fracking or no fracking.  </p>

<p>Second, the Saudis give money to Democrats because they believe (perhaps rightly) that Democrats are more supportive of a global economy, whereas Republicans often have a protectionist slant. </p>

<p>Third, there&#39;s no evidence that the Crown Prince was in Vegas that night.  </p>

<p>Fourth, there&#39;s no evidence that the Saudis rented out the entire top floor of the hotel.  </p>

<p>Fifth, and most importantly, this would be about the worst assassination plot in history by a country that is really good at assassinating people and knows how to do it well. If the Saudis wanted to assassinate one of their own, they would do something like the Israelis did with Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. The Saudis would be in an even better position with one of their own though, since they would know what someone like the Crown Prince would do in Vegas to disguise himself. They would have no reason to storm the hotel. They could just send in one or two guys to follow the Crown Prince as he tried to blend in in Vegas, then either slip something into his drink if they wanted it to look quiet, or shoot him if they wanted it to be broadcast. In no scenario would sending in dozens of armed assassins (who bought guns from the CIA/FBI/Paddock for some unexplained reason) into a hotel make sense.  </p>

<p>All of that being said, there seem to be a lot of unanswered questions here. The video of the dude being led out of Tropicana is ridiculously bizarre. Has there been an explanation given for that? The U.S. military is not authorized to operate on U.S. soil, and no agency is allowed to go around pointing assault rifles at totally innocent people. It&#39;s completely insane! I really want to know what was happening there.  </p>

<p>Another question: what are you talking about with the firefight at an airport? Did that for sure happen? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your first point. It&#39;s a changing landscape and hopefully one for the good. Clean/renewable energy is the future whether oil producing countries want it to be or not. There&#39;s still a huge market for oil beyond cars and they need to recognize that. It may not be the massive goldrush that they&#39;ve enjoyed, but as a race, humans still need oil in many other areas beyond automobiles. Medicine, building materials, structures, clothing, and so on. The need isn&#39;t going away.</p>

<p>As for the Vegas shooting... I have no definitive answer. Personally I think it was just one guy who hated the world he created for himself and decided to take it out on others. His casing of other festival venues even helps prove that point. Maybe he REALLY didn&#39;t like country music. We don&#39;t know, and beyond concrete proof we never will. Why the story has gone away, well partly that&#39;s the blame of the 24/7 news cycle we are in. News isn&#39;t a public service, it&#39;s a business. Eyeballs to the screen pay the bills, story fatigue can end your run. Also, public perception plays a role. </p>

<p>The Mandalay Bay is a massive multibillion dollar property. People not booking rooms, playing in it&#39;s casinos, dancing in it&#39;s clubs, eating in it&#39;s restaurants is going to drive down profits. This was an awful tragedy that happened to them, but at the end of the day they are still a business. Casino/Hotels of that size have weight, they have pull. Any loss of revenue is money that their competitor receives. So they use that weight and pull to push this matter aside so that they can get back to business. I don&#39;t think things are intentionally being covered up, I just think the process is being fast-tracked so that the company can go back to making money and not worrying about anything else. Corporate whitewashing if you will. &quot;<strong><em>It&#39;s not that it didn&#39;t happen, it&#39;s just that we are over it and it&#39;s time to make our shareholders happy again</em></strong>&quot; VEGAS!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hammer was used to barricade the doors and the stairwell.  It was just convenient to use it to break the window as well since it was already there.  Why bring a hammer at all to a shooting when you can easily use the butt of a rifle or just shoot through the glass?  The hammer being there only strengthens the theory that barricading the entrances was important.</p>

<p>We have no idea if the mags are loaded or not.  My guess is that they are unloaded, and it&#39;s the only explanation that makes sense.  Tell me, why wouldn&#39;t they have been used if they were loaded?  Why would it take Paddock an average of 40 seconds between barrages if he had dozens and dozens of pre-loaded magazines?  Why are they untouched when the goal was to kill as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time possible according to the official narrative. </p>
