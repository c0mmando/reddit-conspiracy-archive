       Why should we pay Federal Income Tax when the wealthiest top earners cheat the system by using their power and influence to evade paying their share?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should we pay Federal Income Tax when 99% of it goes to paying the interest on our national debt because our money is borrowed from the Federal Reserve at interest?
      </p>
      <p>
       These are legitimate questions that deserve answers. They expect people that make less than $50,000 a year to pay a 25-30% tax rate while people that make as much in a month are evading taxes by hiding their earnings in offshore bank accounts. I’m sorry, but how can you ask us to play by the rules when the very people who are making the rules are breaking them at the same time?

       Ahuh. And how is that? No matter what way you look at it, infrastructure has to be funded through some kind of 'tax' weather it's local or federal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I think tax is way too high, but someone has to pay for the roads/emergency services/military. Say what you want about how you don't think cops or soldiers shouldnt exist, but they are a necessary evil.

       You're not going to get a real answer. Most people realize that taxes are necessary in a functional society.

       Your state and local taxes pay for most of the things you're thinking of. When Reagan inaugurated the Grace Commission to see where
       <em>
        federal
       </em>
       taxes went, they concluded that "not one nickel goes to the services that Americans have come to expect from their government".
100% of collected federal taxes went to pay off the debt to the private banking cartel, the Federal Reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it doesn't go to pave roads, or build libraries, or feed the poor. It goes to rich guys in yachts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Constitution, the federal layer of government is set up to pay for itself using tariffs, excise taxes and duties. It's how the entire city of Washington, DC was built--prior to the creation of a "federal income tax".
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the creation of the Petro-dollar, the Feds raise money not through your taxes, but through the issuance of Treasury bills. They print up trillions of dollars' worth. Because OPEC agreed to sell oil only in dollars, every nation on Earth needs dollars to run their energy grids or keep their cars on the road. The two main ways they get dollars [to buy oil] is through 1) selling us cheap stuff, at which point we trade dollars for Nintendos, or Rubik's cubes, or dollar-store doo-dads, and 2) By buying U.S. Treasuries, which they keep in their central banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the federal layer of the U.S. government knows that there will always be a market for Treasury bills [due to the petrodollar system] they print them up with abandon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obamacare is funded through that, costly social services and entitlement programs are funded through that.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't use a single dime of your collected federal income tax. 100% of it goes to the banksters.

       Now as I said, it is ONE, count it, ONE way to raise funds. Another way is to reduce spending.  Now if you want to advocate for taxes being a good thing then fine, go right ahead, but I sure as hell won't.  It's far too obvious that the money is wasted and evaporates heavily before it ever gets where it is supposed to go.

       They don't have the resources for that... or even any system to detect that kind of behaviour... IRS is immensely underfunded... they devote their manpower to cashing the checks and chasing down larger corporations... people just refraining from pay taxes is something the IRS has discussed in the past... and how they are worried that even more people would start doing it...

       I'm asking because some years I didn't file my taxes but I got letters from them about it. They knew. I find it hard to imagine that if I was on a mailing list, I wasn't on some other list.

       Yeah... the little guys are too unimportant to bother trying to squeeze. ... I wish I had the article I read about it. They already know from the math that like 6% of citizens don't pay their taxes... and the number is steadily growing... but they can't afford for the number of abstainers to rise any higher.

       Just my two cents here but my ex was caught up in this a few years ago. She had multiple jobs in the year and didn't report one because she didn't get a W2, but that employer paid taxes on her, and about 30-60 days after she filed, she got a big red and black bold print letter saying she owed more than reported and that they were automatically deducting the discrepancy from her refund. She was not audited, and it appeared to be automated based on employment taxes (they said so when she called to inquire about it?) but in this example, she did pay taxes and file a return, but they came after her for things she didn't report.

       Makes sense. I ran a business in college for beer money and went a few years without filing because my total income was below minimum filing requirements and never heard from them, but I don't reckon the fed necessarily had any way to tell what my income actually was. I had quarterly sales tax collections paid locally, but that only applied to materials and it was a service business. So I suppose I could have made $100k and left the same paper trail.

       It seems extremely unlikely to me that they never do a comparison of the W2's they have on file vs the tax returns they received. It's literally a 30 second database query.

       This is called the "tax gap"; the difference between what taxes the IRS should collect and what they actually collect. Its a lot money (billions per year), but the IRS collects over trillion in income taxes alone. Some of it eventually gets recovered, in some instances the IRS overestimates collectibles, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The IRS won't audit you for small sums of money because its a simple business proposition. If they think you owe $1000 but it may cost them $$800+ to collect it, they won't even bother.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority of the time people do not file returns and don't hear anything from the IRS its because they are actually owed a refund. And you only ave three years to request a refund or that money is gone forever.

       The IRS absolutely follows through. I got harassed by them recently including a letter threatening to seize my assets if I didn’t file my taxes. If they receive forms from your employer, they will come for the money sooner or later. I only owe about 4k, but they were chomping at the bit to garnish my wages if I didn’t file my taxes for those years and pay up. Trust me, they’ll come for you, even the small fish like me. It’s been a huge stress dealing with them.

       I sign all government paper work with either under duress as my name or I use the four corners rule. Since there is absolutely no code or statute that says I must pay income tax. I don't live in Washington DC and l am not working for the federal government. I'm not required to pay according to the income tax code. So either I sign a w9 that way or the other. If it's the other I claim as many as I need to to get the most back because even though it's fraud without my signiture they are gonna take it. If I had money I would sue them for it.

       This is not even close to accurate. The IRS gets loads of information from your ban, employer, mortgage company, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people who don't file don't hear from the IRS because they are due a refund. Your friend who hasn't filed in ten years may have given the government thousands of dollars more than necessary, which he is now legally unable to ever receive. He sure showed them!

       Fair questions but perhaps a more productive route is to ask: what could
       <strong>
        replace
       </strong>
       income tax as a chief source of income for the federal government? Yes, taxes may be theft; you can certainly make that argument. But where does that get us? Like it or not, funding for government operations and services must come from somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if we were to invest in constructing a massive infrastructure project that could deliver enough revenue to fund the federal government by itself? What could do that?

       Yes that's a great idea. A perfect example is solar energy from panels placed in space. Limitless exposure time and unimpeded from weather and atmosphere. The power generated could be transmitted back down to earth using cables. Now the problem becomes: how do we launch an array solar panels into lower earth orbit inexpensively and inefficiently? And how can we easily maintain them when they need work or replacement? Rocket launches would be cumbersome, inefficient, and outrageously expensive. Surely there has to be another way to get these panels into space.

       Not if they found services to perform that funded their operations. That would even eliminate pointless govt jobs and make them all of value. Also it would be publicly owned and every citizen would essentially own their percent of stock however evenly divided that may be and noo one can one more of a percentage than anyone else. That way it would be free of taxation, funded well, and baseline up be motivated differently. And since the stock holders are citizens any serious problem with systems can simply and quickly be voted on i  committee by vote and majority without the need of elected official representative, though would still be useful.

       It doesn't get rid of taxes entirely, but remove federal taxes and have the federal budget funded from GDP-proportional contributions to the treasury from the states that are party to the federal compact? Threat of over taxation would be incentive for most things to be handled at the state level versus a massive federal budget, and money could be better spent closer to the citizens contributing. As a result of states shouldering most of the budgetary responsibility, accountability to their constituents would be higher, and the overall tax burden might be lower

       Keep your income low enough that the feds owe you money at the end of the fiscal year. I'm not talking refund of your own money. I'm saying work the system to whatever extent you legally can. The rich do, why shouldn't the poor? Earned income tax credit alone pays over $5000/year for a family of four, for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bonus: if you have kids applying for FAFSA, there's no asset disclosure necessary if your income is low enough. I could be living in a million dollar house, own multiple properties even, with money in the bank and if my income is low enough, they don't even bother to look.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, health insurance isn't a problem anymore with the ACA. In fact, if your income is low enough, it's free. If you actually need medical care, like if you have a chronic condition or whatever, you have to shoot for that sweet spot where your insurance premiums are covered by ACA subsidies but your income isn't low enough to put you on medicaid. Medicaid reduces your choice about who you can see. Less plans to choose from and less physicians who accept those plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just got so disgusted with getting fucked right and left (health insurance and college tuition being the overpriced biggies) by being an "average income" family prior to 2007 (also, couldn't reasonably justify my money being used to drone brown kids halfway around the world), I planted a bigger garden, got some chickens, and noped the fuck out of the system.  Hubby works seasonally, so he has off four months over the winter and can spend time bringing home meat for the freezer and laying in firewood for next year. We do spend time staying healthy, eating well and exercising, but I'd bet the lack of chronic work-stress is probably doing our health the biggest favor.

       You need to get your facts straight. I live in US, make just over 50k a month, I'm single and non homeowner. My tax rate is just over 48 percent. My biggest tax break would be to buy a home and become a part of the system. I'd trade my $3500 rent for a 8K+ mortgage as a "decent" house in my area with tolerable commute starts at $1.2M.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your comment is exactly what the have conditioned you to believe. It's not the folks making 50k a monthly evading taxes but those making 50k+ a day... the 1% of the 1%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I have it better than most but all via hard work and 20+ years of grinding to get where I am. In no world do I feel it's fair what I pay nor have creative ways to evade tax legal or otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have many friends in same boat earning in similar tax bracket.  Many have left to lower paying jobs as it's no longer worth chasing upper middle class. This only widens gap between the middle and the folks you're really inferring here.

       It sucks that your tax rate is 48%, in fact it’s criminal. Especially considering your “20+ years of grinding”. Consider this though, if you make 50k a month, 52% of that is over $25,000, which is more than a lot of people make in a year.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the “middle class” don’t seem to care too much about those living in poverty in the first place. Everyone is too greedy. This is perpetuated by culture of material excess and worship of money.

       Couldn't you write off your mortgage interest for a while and be saving a shit load in taxes until you paid off the mortgage?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I was making half as much as you that's what I'd do but that's quite a bit more than I do :-) I'm sure I'm missing something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or just save up a few years and move.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or pay off your place, rent it out, move and use the rent to help cover the mortgage?
      </p>

       I definitely would have figured you'd be paying a lower tax rate than that though.

       <p>
        Why should we pay Federal Income Tax when 99% of it goes to paying the interest on our national debt
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's not even remotely true.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2015, income taxes collected were $1,855 billion (about $1.5 trillion in personal income taxes and $344 billion in corporate). (
       <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KH48NB5.png">
        Table 2.1
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't include FICA (Social Security, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
       Gross interest on the debt was $402 billion, but almost half of that went to government trust funds, like Social Security. Not including that, net interest was $223 billion. (
       <a href="http://imgur.com/YkZ0vtj">
        Table 3.2
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       So income taxes were 4.7 times as big as the gross interest, and 8.4 times as big as the net interest.

       Keep your income low enough that the feds owe you money at the end of the fiscal year. I'm not talking refund of your own money. I'm saying work the system to whatever extent you legally can. The rich do, why shouldn't the poor? Earned income tax credit alone pays over $5000/year for a family of four, for instance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bonus: if you have kids applying for FAFSA, there's no asset disclosure necessary if your income is low enough. I could be living in a million dollar house, own multiple properties even, with money in the bank and if my income is low enough, they don't even bother to look.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, health insurance isn't a problem anymore with the ACA. In fact, if your income is low enough, it's free. If you actually need medical care, like if you have a chronic condition or whatever, you have to shoot for that sweet spot where your insurance premiums are covered by ACA subsidies but your income isn't low enough to put you on medicaid. Medicaid reduces your choice about who you can see. Less plans to choose from and less physicians who accept those plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just got so disgusted with getting fucked right and left (health insurance and college tuition being the overpriced biggies) by being an "average income" family prior to 2007 (also, couldn't reasonably justify my money being used to drone brown kids halfway around the world), I planted a bigger garden, got some chickens, and noped the fuck out of the system.  Hubby works seasonally, so he has off four months over the winter and can spend time bringing home meat for the freezer and laying in firewood for next year. We do spend time staying healthy, eating well and exercising, but I'd bet the lack of chronic work-stress is probably doing our health the biggest favor.
