        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why should we pay Federal Income Tax when the wealthiest top earners cheat the system by using their power and influence to evade paying their share?</p>

<p>Why should we pay Federal Income Tax when 99% of it goes to paying the interest on our national debt because our money is borrowed from the Federal Reserve at interest?</p>

<p>These are legitimate questions that deserve answers. They expect people that make less than $50,000 a year to pay a 25-30% tax rate while people that make as much in a month are evading taxes by hiding their earnings in offshore bank accounts. I’m sorry, but how can you ask us to play by the rules when the very people who are making the rules are breaking them at the same time?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your state and local taxes pay for most of the things you&#39;re thinking of. When Reagan inaugurated the Grace Commission to see where <em>federal</em> taxes went, they concluded that &quot;not one nickel goes to the services that Americans have come to expect from their government&quot;.
100% of collected federal taxes went to pay off the debt to the private banking cartel, the Federal Reserve.</p>

<p>So it doesn&#39;t go to pave roads, or build libraries, or feed the poor. It goes to rich guys in yachts. </p>

<p>In the Constitution, the federal layer of government is set up to pay for itself using tariffs, excise taxes and duties. It&#39;s how the entire city of Washington, DC was built--prior to the creation of a &quot;federal income tax&quot;.</p>

<p>Since the creation of the Petro-dollar, the Feds raise money not through your taxes, but through the issuance of Treasury bills. They print up trillions of dollars&#39; worth. Because OPEC agreed to sell oil only in dollars, every nation on Earth needs dollars to run their energy grids or keep their cars on the road. The two main ways they get dollars [to buy oil] is through 1) selling us cheap stuff, at which point we trade dollars for Nintendos, or Rubik&#39;s cubes, or dollar-store doo-dads, and 2) By buying U.S. Treasuries, which they keep in their central banks.</p>

<p>Because the federal layer of the U.S. government knows that there will always be a market for Treasury bills [due to the petrodollar system] they print them up with abandon. </p>

<p>Obamacare is funded through that, costly social services and entitlement programs are funded through that.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t use a single dime of your collected federal income tax. 100% of it goes to the banksters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just my two cents here but my ex was caught up in this a few years ago. She had multiple jobs in the year and didn&#39;t report one because she didn&#39;t get a W2, but that employer paid taxes on her, and about 30-60 days after she filed, she got a big red and black bold print letter saying she owed more than reported and that they were automatically deducting the discrepancy from her refund. She was not audited, and it appeared to be automated based on employment taxes (they said so when she called to inquire about it?) but in this example, she did pay taxes and file a return, but they came after her for things she didn&#39;t report.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is called the &quot;tax gap&quot;; the difference between what taxes the IRS should collect and what they actually collect. Its a lot money (billions per year), but the IRS collects over trillion in income taxes alone. Some of it eventually gets recovered, in some instances the IRS overestimates collectibles, etc. </p>

<p>The IRS won&#39;t audit you for small sums of money because its a simple business proposition. If they think you owe $1000 but it may cost them $$800+ to collect it, they won&#39;t even bother.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the time people do not file returns and don&#39;t hear anything from the IRS its because they are actually owed a refund. And you only ave three years to request a refund or that money is gone forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes that&#39;s a great idea. A perfect example is solar energy from panels placed in space. Limitless exposure time and unimpeded from weather and atmosphere. The power generated could be transmitted back down to earth using cables. Now the problem becomes: how do we launch an array solar panels into lower earth orbit inexpensively and inefficiently? And how can we easily maintain them when they need work or replacement? Rocket launches would be cumbersome, inefficient, and outrageously expensive. Surely there has to be another way to get these panels into space.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t get rid of taxes entirely, but remove federal taxes and have the federal budget funded from GDP-proportional contributions to the treasury from the states that are party to the federal compact? Threat of over taxation would be incentive for most things to be handled at the state level versus a massive federal budget, and money could be better spent closer to the citizens contributing. As a result of states shouldering most of the budgetary responsibility, accountability to their constituents would be higher, and the overall tax burden might be lower</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep your income low enough that the feds owe you money at the end of the fiscal year. I&#39;m not talking refund of your own money. I&#39;m saying work the system to whatever extent you legally can. The rich do, why shouldn&#39;t the poor? Earned income tax credit alone pays over $5000/year for a family of four, for instance.  </p>

<p>Bonus: if you have kids applying for FAFSA, there&#39;s no asset disclosure necessary if your income is low enough. I could be living in a million dollar house, own multiple properties even, with money in the bank and if my income is low enough, they don&#39;t even bother to look.</p>

<p>Plus, health insurance isn&#39;t a problem anymore with the ACA. In fact, if your income is low enough, it&#39;s free. If you actually need medical care, like if you have a chronic condition or whatever, you have to shoot for that sweet spot where your insurance premiums are covered by ACA subsidies but your income isn&#39;t low enough to put you on medicaid. Medicaid reduces your choice about who you can see. Less plans to choose from and less physicians who accept those plans.</p>

<p>I just got so disgusted with getting fucked right and left (health insurance and college tuition being the overpriced biggies) by being an &quot;average income&quot; family prior to 2007 (also, couldn&#39;t reasonably justify my money being used to drone brown kids halfway around the world), I planted a bigger garden, got some chickens, and noped the fuck out of the system.  Hubby works seasonally, so he has off four months over the winter and can spend time bringing home meat for the freezer and laying in firewood for next year. We do spend time staying healthy, eating well and exercising, but I&#39;d bet the lack of chronic work-stress is probably doing our health the biggest favor. </p>

<p>We&#39;re far happier now than when we both worked 40 hours a week with only a couple-few weeks vacation a year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to get your facts straight. I live in US, make just over 50k a month, I&#39;m single and non homeowner. My tax rate is just over 48 percent.

I&#39;d trade my $3500 rent for a 8K+ mortgage as a &quot;decent&quot; house in my area with tolerable commute starts at $1.2M. </p>

<p>Your comment is exactly what the have conditioned you to believe. It&#39;s not the folks making 50k a monthly evading taxes but those making 50k+ a day... the 1% of the 1%.</p>

<p>Yes, I have it better than most but all via hard work and 20+ years of grinding to get where I am. In no world do I feel it&#39;s fair what I pay nor have creative ways to evade tax legal or otherwise. </p>

<p>I have many friends in same boat earning in similar tax bracket.  Many have left to lower paying jobs as it&#39;s no longer worth chasing upper middle class. This only widens gap between the middle and the folks you&#39;re really inferring here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sucks that your tax rate is 48%, in fact it’s criminal. Especially considering your “20+ years of grinding”. Consider this though, if you make 50k a month, 52% of that is over $25,000, which is more than a lot of people make in a year. </p>

<p>But the “middle class” don’t seem to care too much about those living in poverty in the first place. Everyone is too greedy. This is perpetuated by culture of material excess and worship of money. </p>

<p>Why should we pay Federal Income Tax when 99% of it goes to paying the interest on our national debt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not even remotely true.</p>

<p>In 2015, income taxes collected were $1,855 billion (about $1.5 trillion in personal income taxes and $344 billion in corporate). (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/KH48NB5.png">Table 2.1</a>)</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t include FICA (Social Security, etc.).</p>

<p>Gross interest on the debt was $402 billion, but almost half of that went to government trust funds, like Social Security. Not including that, net interest was $223 billion. (<a href="http://imgur.com/YkZ0vtj">Table 3.2</a>)</p>

<p>So income taxes were 4.7 times as big as the gross interest, and 8.4 times as big as the net interest.</p>

<p>Tables are from the 2017 federal budget, available <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?collectionCode=BUDGET&amp;amp;granuleId=&amp;amp;packageId=BUDGET-2017-TAB&amp;amp;fromBrowse=true">here</a> as <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BUDGET-2017-TAB/pdf/BUDGET-2017-TAB.pdf">one big PDF</a> or individual Excel files.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep your income low enough that the feds owe you money at the end of the fiscal year. I&#39;m not talking refund of your own money. I&#39;m saying work the system to whatever extent you legally can. The rich do, why shouldn&#39;t the poor? Earned income tax credit alone pays over $5000/year for a family of four, for instance.  </p>

<p>Bonus: if you have kids applying for FAFSA, there&#39;s no asset disclosure necessary if your income is low enough. I could be living in a million dollar house, own multiple properties even, with money in the bank and if my income is low enough, they don&#39;t even bother to look.</p>

<p>Plus, health insurance isn&#39;t a problem anymore with the ACA. In fact, if your income is low enough, it&#39;s free. If you actually need medical care, like if you have a chronic condition or whatever, you have to shoot for that sweet spot where your insurance premiums are covered by ACA subsidies but your income isn&#39;t low enough to put you on medicaid. Medicaid reduces your choice about who you can see. Less plans to choose from and less physicians who accept those plans.</p>

<p>I just got so disgusted with getting fucked right and left (health insurance and college tuition being the overpriced biggies) by being an &quot;average income&quot; family prior to 2007 (also, couldn&#39;t reasonably justify my money being used to drone brown kids halfway around the world), I planted a bigger garden, got some chickens, and noped the fuck out of the system.  Hubby works seasonally, so he has off four months over the winter and can spend time bringing home meat for the freezer and laying in firewood for next year. We do spend time staying healthy, eating well and exercising, but I&#39;d bet the lack of chronic work-stress is probably doing our health the biggest favor. </p>

<p>We&#39;re far happier now than when we both worked 40 hours a week with only a couple-few weeks vacation a year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh, maybe. I hear what you are saying to an extent, but I think most of us are more akin to indentured servants. It&#39;s not nice, but it is a scosh better than being tied to a whipping post....at least for most present day Americans.</p>
