       They'll either get prosecuted by the state or not at all. Don't bother pushing it, spend your time looking for what information it brings i.e. names, links, anything greater than just your regular tax fraud we all knew had been going on for decades. This shit doesn't end till we find the smoking gun.

       Well, let's make this clear.  Putting your assets in offshore havens is not illegal.  If you made the money in the USA, and paid the appropriate tax, you are free to do whatever you want with the money (barring transfers to enemies of the state, like North Korea).  The illegal part comes in when the money is made in another country and you don't report it to the IRS and pay taxes on that amount.  The amount depends on whether the US has a tax treaty with the country in question.  If a tax treaty exists, then you only have to pay the difference between the two countries should the US rate be higher than the country of origin.  If a tax treaty does not exist, then you would have to pay the foreign country it's tax, then pay the US the full tax due on the amount remaining after you paid the foreign country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the part in question here is interest and investment profits from the said assets parked in offshore accounts.  These would be considered income and would follow the rules I stipulated above.  However, most tax havens do not have a tax treaties with the USA.  So, any interest and investment income would be taxed at full value.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what I'm saying is that having offshore accounts does not immediately make you guilty.  It is not illegal in itself.  But if you don't pay taxes on any return from those accounts while it is parked there, then you have a problem.

       I’ve never seen as much “OMG I love hiding money offshore now” comments as I have in the past 24 hours. When the Panama Papers were released, these same people weren’t being so kind. But now that their “team” is implicated, “it’s not such a big deal guys!”

       Totally agree with you. Remember when the panama papers were released, WikiLeaks basically said they were fake.... Because Putin's friends and family were all over them. I'm worried people look at this, hear Trump, and think it's just a smear campaign

       Wikileak's philosophy is basically "if it didn't come from us, you shouldn't believe it." Mostly because they're curating/forging documents to fit the narrative Assange is trying to portray.

       Um, maybe we should be aware of both of these things. Obviously what is going on is a multi-faceted war with many fronts. Disarmament of Americans is a big part of this war. Its all funded by George Soros. 18 billion dollars goes a long way. I guarantee you no Soros entity will show up in these papers, as he is draining the swamp of his enemies. He also wants to remove the 2nd amendment, I assure you.

       They did a lot of legislation that made certain things more restrictive. For example I tried to get a suppressor and it would have taken me 1.5 years in order to actually receive the damn thing, thus deterring me from buying it. Amending the Constitution is extremely difficult, and the Republicans and NRA did the best they could to limit the damage to freedom to bear arms while Obama was in office.

       Most of this shit isn't illegal it's just shitty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately there isn't much you can do in a global economy to stop this other than offer a low/competitive corporate tax rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are of course perks outside of a low tax rate, economic and political stability, history of trustworthiness, relatively low national debt (in relation to GDP, highly skilled workforce, easily accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, the best corse of action is to have a 0% corporate tax rate and significantly increase taxes on investment income. This makes starting a business easier (more competition), running a small business easier (more opportunity), prevents tax dollars from being offshored... and ultimately the corporate tax rate is just a sales tax anyways... companies get taxed and so they increase prices to account for those costs.

       This idea has been proposed and modelled by economists. There is good reason to believe it would work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tax havens only work because you can set up companies in any country, you can't change your citizenship to Bermudian or Panamanian or Barbadian with the same ease, and if you do, you have a restricted ability to live in your real home country.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's nothing you could do if some rich millionaire/billionaire decides to denounce his home country and live the rest of his life k. some island in the Caribbean, but most people wouldn't do that.

       While I agree with you that PP is more important than another shooting for me. There may be others for whom the shooting is more important. The guy was in the military and I assume, trained to kill. He got kicked out the military for DV against his wife and kid. So, his life was going downhill.  He probably felt ignored or deceived by the US society. So, he tried to fight back a bit,  I imagine. While no one can condone his actions, one can try to understand them. For some, who have similar experiences, this story may be more important.
