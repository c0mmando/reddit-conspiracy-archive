    <div class="md"><p>Well, let&#39;s make this clear.  Putting your assets in offshore havens is not illegal.  If you made the money in the USA, and paid the appropriate tax, you are free to do whatever you want with the money (barring transfers to enemies of the state, like North Korea).  The illegal part comes in when the money is made in another country and you don&#39;t report it to the IRS and pay taxes on that amount.  The amount depends on whether the US has a tax treaty with the country in question.  If a tax treaty exists, then you only have to pay the difference between the two countries should the US rate be higher than the country of origin.  If a tax treaty does not exist, then you would have to pay the foreign country it&#39;s tax, then pay the US the full tax due on the amount remaining after you paid the foreign country.</p>

<p>Now, the part in question here is interest and investment profits from the said assets parked in offshore accounts.  These would be considered income and would follow the rules I stipulated above.  However, most tax havens do not have a tax treaties with the USA.  So, any interest and investment income would be taxed at full value.  </p>

<p>So what I&#39;m saying is that having offshore accounts does not immediately make you guilty.  It is not illegal in itself.  But if you don&#39;t pay taxes on any return from those accounts while it is parked there, then you have a problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of this shit isn&#39;t illegal it&#39;s just shitty. </p>

<p>Unfortunately there isn&#39;t much you can do in a global economy to stop this other than offer a low/competitive corporate tax rate. </p>

<p>There are of course perks outside of a low tax rate, economic and political stability, history of trustworthiness, relatively low national debt (in relation to GDP, highly skilled workforce, easily accessible.</p>

<p>Honestly, the best corse of action is to have a 0% corporate tax rate and significantly increase taxes on investment income. This makes starting a business easier (more competition), running a small business easier (more opportunity), prevents tax dollars from being offshored... and ultimately the corporate tax rate is just a sales tax anyways... companies get taxed and so they increase prices to account for those costs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This idea has been proposed and modelled by economists. There is good reason to believe it would work.</p>

<p>Tax havens only work because you can set up companies in any country, you can&#39;t change your citizenship to Bermudian or Panamanian or Barbadian with the same ease, and if you do, you have a restricted ability to live in your real home country.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with you that PP is more important than another shooting for me. There may be others for whom the shooting is more important. The guy was in the military and I assume, trained to kill. He got kicked out the military for DV against his wife and kid. So, his life was going downhill.  He probably felt ignored or deceived by the US society. So, he tried to fight back a bit,  I imagine. While no one can condone his actions, one can try to understand them. For some, who have similar experiences, this story may be more important.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>YouTube Video - can you just say what it said and what the objection is?</p>

<p>Wiki link - what&#39;s suspicious about this list?</p>

<p>Whats wrong with it coming out of MSM? It wasn&#39;t released alone through CNN or huffpost. This was directed by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the same people who released the Panama papers. </p>

<p>Not trying to dismiss your claims, would just love to read more about it. Thanks!</p>
