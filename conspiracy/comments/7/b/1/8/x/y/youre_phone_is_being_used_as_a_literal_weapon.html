       Cellphones have an enormous amount of power and one thing a cellphone can do is release radiation.
       <br/>
       Now normally, this electromagnetic radiation is not that dangerous since it uses a very low voltage, but just like with a microwave, phones can be told to release greater amounts.
       <br/>
       So the government can hack into your phone, increase how much radiation is getting released, and it would be almost impossible to know it.
       <br/>
       Symptoms of this are fatigue, cancer, and brain damage.
       <br/>
       The government is using this weapon to target people who speak the truth. If a key word is said, you will be added to the red list and you're phone will begin receiving commands to bombard you with radiation.
       <br/>
       They want a weak and sick opposition and people don't realize how dangerous this is.
       <br/>
       If a phone were to operate at it's maximum power, you would immediately start feeling sick.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: This is also why people claim we're entering a new 'frequency' or sound crazy but talk about Earth's ascension into a new dimension. Their phones are attacking them. They can 'feel it'. There's no ascension, no rapture, just phones damaging our bodies, but since people don't think their phones can hurt them, they explain 'their feeling' in other ways.

       Yeah, I actually learned this when I received a blank phone call. My phone started ringing and no one picked up. Immediately after I started feeling a lot of paranoia and really weird but it wasn't normal. I've had mental illness for 5 years and the symptoms were nothing normal, in fact I am really healthy right now so it was bizarre to have a flare up right there. Plus the symptoms were really different than my mental illness. I walked around for like 20 minutes and it didn't get better so I took my phone out of my pocket and held it away from me, now half my body on the side of the phone is feels all prickley, like I'm sweating but only on half that's near the phone. Ok but this isn't proof, I need a control. So I dropped my phone off and immediately went back for a walk, SO MUCH BETTER. All my symptoms were gone, immediately after dropping my phone off. I continued my walk for an hour and 30 minutes, but when I came back home, and was in proximity of my phone, my symptoms returned!
       <br/>
       Additionally, 3 years ago, I had a psychotic break and it was right after receiving a blank phone call! I ended up stabbing my phone's cameras with a knife and thinking back now, I'm absolutely sure my phone was jamming my brain or radiating me. I had an android then, now I'm using an iphone, both are compromise able.
       <br/>
       And what's even weirder is I received both blank phone calls after posting anti-Trump messages on the internet warning people not to trust him.
       <br/>
       Right now, I'm doing pretty good. I'm not scared, just kinda annoyed that I can't use my phone. My sleep is better actually sleeping 7-8 hours instead of 9-10. I might be wrong about how the phone works towards disrupting the brain but that was my best guess. My thighs also hurt a lot, I'm fatigued, but aside from that doing pretty well.

       I think when SHTF, they are going to active all the phones and everyone is going to go crazy, but might be helpful to experiment. Try going for a walk with your phone, then without your phone. I did that and there was a HUGE difference. These phones definitely have the capabilities to mess with your head.

       How can a phone be told to release greater levels of radiation? What mechanism would allow this?
