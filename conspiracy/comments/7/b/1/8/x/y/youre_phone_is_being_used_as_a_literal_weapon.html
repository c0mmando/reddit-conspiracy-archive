        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Cellphones have an enormous amount of power and one thing a cellphone can do is release radiation.<br/>
Now normally, this electromagnetic radiation is not that dangerous since it uses a very low voltage, but just like with a microwave, phones can be told to release greater amounts.<br/>
So the government can hack into your phone, increase how much radiation is getting released, and it would be almost impossible to know it.<br/>
Symptoms of this are fatigue, cancer, and brain damage.<br/>
The government is using this weapon to target people who speak the truth. If a key word is said, you will be added to the red list and you&#39;re phone will begin receiving commands to bombard you with radiation.<br/>
They want a weak and sick opposition and people don&#39;t realize how dangerous this is.<br/>
If a phone were to operate at it&#39;s maximum power, you would immediately start feeling sick.  </p>

<p>Edit: This is also why people claim we&#39;re entering a new &#39;frequency&#39; or sound crazy but talk about Earth&#39;s ascension into a new dimension. Their phones are attacking them. They can &#39;feel it&#39;. There&#39;s no ascension, no rapture, just phones damaging our bodies, but since people don&#39;t think their phones can hurt them, they explain &#39;their feeling&#39; in other ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I actually learned this when I received a blank phone call. My phone started ringing and no one picked up. Immediately after I started feeling a lot of paranoia and really weird but it wasn&#39;t normal. I&#39;ve had mental illness for 5 years and the symptoms were nothing normal, in fact I am really healthy right now so it was bizarre to have a flare up right there. Plus the symptoms were really different than my mental illness. I walked around for like 20 minutes and it didn&#39;t get better so I took my phone out of my pocket and held it away from me, now half my body on the side of the phone is feels all prickley, like I&#39;m sweating but only on half that&#39;s near the phone. Ok but this isn&#39;t proof, I need a control. So I dropped my phone off and immediately went back for a walk, SO MUCH BETTER. All my symptoms were gone, immediately after dropping my phone off. I continued my walk for an hour and 30 minutes, but when I came back home, and was in proximity of my phone, my symptoms returned!<br/>
Additionally, 3 years ago, I had a psychotic break and it was right after receiving a blank phone call! I ended up stabbing my phone&#39;s cameras with a knife and thinking back now, I&#39;m absolutely sure my phone was jamming my brain or radiating me. I had an android then, now I&#39;m using an iphone, both are compromise able.<br/>
And what&#39;s even weirder is I received both blank phone calls after posting anti-Trump messages on the internet warning people not to trust him.<br/>
Right now, I&#39;m doing pretty good. I&#39;m not scared, just kinda annoyed that I can&#39;t use my phone. My sleep is better actually sleeping 7-8 hours instead of 9-10. I might be wrong about how the phone works towards disrupting the brain but that was my best guess. My thighs also hurt a lot, I&#39;m fatigued, but aside from that doing pretty well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think when SHTF, they are going to active all the phones and everyone is going to go crazy, but might be helpful to experiment. Try going for a walk with your phone, then without your phone. I did that and there was a HUGE difference. These phones definitely have the capabilities to mess with your head.</p>
