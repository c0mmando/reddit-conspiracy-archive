      <p>
       Las Vegas being shot up with military weapons, and connections to Saudi Arabia, is the real story.

       Repost from another thread. I am not original poster:
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you remember how President Trump visited Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017? Do you remember how warmly he was greeted by King Salman? I do. It was a spectacle. Why was he greeted so welcomingly? After all, President Obama's reception was... shall we say, less than grand. Do you remember how after Trump's visit, Saudi Arabia started becoming more open in their policies? Women can drive there now. Did you notice how the Syrian rebellion became quiet? Did you notice how quickly ISIS was crushed after the visit? Why did Saudi Arabia suddenly want to get their oil companies listed on the NYSE? What could have caused this?
To answer this, we have to look a little further back. Back to around 2010.
It all goes back to fracking. You see, the Kindom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has always relied heavily on its vast petrol reserves for wealth and prosperity. And they were ruthless. OPEC. The cartel of gasoline. You can't count the number of times throughout history that OPEC used its power to crush governments, manipulate prices, control supplies, and fund activities. If there ever was a international group of bullies, OPEC was it. And at the head of this organization was the mighty KSA.
Then came the fracking boom. Suddenly, the world was no longer at the mercy of OPEC. This made them nervous. So, they did what they always do. They pumped out more petroleum, driving the price of gas to lowest in decades. What was their objective? To bankrupt these fracking businesses. KSA is rich. Very rich. They figured, we'll just drive gas prices unbelievably low and take the loss until all these fracking business startups crumble. Do you remember how cheap gas got between 2013-2016? It was ridiculous, wasn't it? But what they didn't count on was just how cheap fracking had become. So many of these business didn't go bankrupt. So they took another step. To convince the world that fracking was bad for the environment. So they lobbied and supplied funds to the Democratic party. Why? Because the leftist are usually the ones who support ANY and ALL environmental regulations. Do you remember all the legal battles that fracking had to go through? Hell, it's still illegal in most blue states. Do you now understand why the Saudis donated so much money to the Clinton campaign? She was HEAVILY favored to win and if she did, you can bet your ass that illegalizing fracking would have been on the top of her list, returning us to dependence on arab oil. But... this didn't work either. Fracking continued. And then, a shitstorm of reality hit them hard.
You see, KSA had vastly underestimated the amount of total shale reserves in North America. They had no idea that so much of this stuff exists. They thought maybe they could ride it out if the reserves would dry up in a decade or so. But nope. We have enough shale to supply us for at least 50 years. Hmmm... big problem.
So, if you're King Salman, what do you do? Well, there's only one thing you can do. Give up the reliance on oil production and try to use existing wealth to stay wealthy. To modernize its trade to include more than just exports of oil. They would need to build an entire industrial country from scratch. To do that, he needed the help of the USA. And that's where President Trump comes in.
You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting. It was a business meeting. King Salman asked Trump for help. Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price. Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding. No more contributions to American politics. No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups. King Salman took the deal. All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive. ISIS was retreating. Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition. Yay. All good up to this point.
Now comes the bad
Not all the royalties in KSA are into this. They don't like losing the power they once had. What's worse, they don't want to become liberal. They now start resenting King Salmon. They start plotting against him. At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).
October 1, 2017. The top floors of Mandalay Bay isn't Mandalay Bay, but is Four Seasons, owned by billionaire Talal. Who was occupying that whole floor that night? I can't remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week. Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty. We don't know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad. We know it wasn't King Salman, because he was in Russia at the time.
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/%E2%80%A6/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-%E2%80%A6">
        https://www.theguardian.com/…/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-…
       </a>
       The plan is to take out the crown prince. Then kill King Salman. With the King and the Crown Prince dead, who is next in line? Yup. The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin. So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad. Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them. This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor. They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing. Now, here's what happened that night:
Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns.
We don't know exactly, but either Paddock found out that the guns were going to be used that night or the CIA/FBI (or Trump's own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place. Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins. This is why the guns aren't loaded. This is why it takes so long between bursts of fire.
The royalty in the floors above are notified of the assassination plot, and the prince is e-vac'd out. This accounts for all the helicopter flight reports that can be found on the net. It also explains the gun fires that supposedly took place on runways. It was literally a scene from a movie. The bad guys were trying to gun down the helicopter and the good guys were fighting back.
The couple of assassins that made it to Paddock's room immediately kill Paddock. Now, to disguise the assassination attempt, they open fire on the crowd below to make it look like a lone gunman terror attack. They don't want concrete evidence that an assassination attempt was made. They try to escape after the shooting, but are gunned down by the teams that were sweeping the casinos looking for the assassins. Remember the final two shots? I would guess that they were the shots that hit the assassins. The bodies are immediately covered up and shipped to a black site.
Paddock is made the patsy. Why? Because if a failed Saudi assassination attempt was responsible for the deaths, if the FBI/CIA had supplied the guns that killed 58 innocent people (not counting Paddock since he's an asset), then two things would happen. One, we would demand that we go to war with Saudi Arabia. And two, which ever organization that Paddock worked for would be utterly dismantled.
Do you remember President Trump saying, "it could have been a lot worse"? Yeah, no kidding. We could have had war or have had lots more people die if the death squad had all gotten their hands on the guns.

         No, the entire floor was NOT rented out or occupied by them. What the story was and that has been twisted and regurgitated is this: Aug 2017 the Saudi army book the entire W Hotel.

       They were there to take part in an event at Nelli's AFB
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The helicopters in flight that night were tour choppers and police. Just like every single other night in Vegas. Good guys shooting at bad guys? Sorry, real life isn't like the damn movies. There is zero evidence to support this. Not a single bit.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why in the hell would anyone need Paddock to supply his mediocre, easily bought guns for anything? Makes zero sense.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       That entire wall of text that you posted doesn't hold up in even the most basic of facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saudis own shares in many businesses. There is zero connect to the Saudis other than they own shares...but so does Gates...was he in on?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't spread that fake movie script bs story. Fact check before you copy and paste someone else's convoluted ideas. It spreads misinformation.
