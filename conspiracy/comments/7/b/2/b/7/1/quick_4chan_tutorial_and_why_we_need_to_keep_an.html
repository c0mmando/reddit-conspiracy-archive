      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         A quick (very) tutorial on /pol/
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         4chan is an anonymous message board that’s been around for years. People can post there completely anonymously
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         4chan is separated into “boards” for different topics. /pol/ is the “politically incorrect” board
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Because of the anon component, there have been many times when people would post insider information.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There have also been many times when people have posted Bull. It’s hard to tell the difference sometimes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         When people post bull, it’s what’s known as a LARP or “Live Action Role Play” because the board gets involved trying to figure it out
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         People on /pol are crude and politically incorrect but VERY intelligent for the most part.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In any given thread, you can post and are assigned a unique ID for THAT thread. If you go to the site, you can highlight an ID on a thread
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Thay in turn will highlight all posts by that ID. What has struck the board so much about THIS particular anon
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Is the detailed information and method of delivering it. Questions will fool different bots who scan for info.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         That’s also the reason why you will see abbreviations and initials used. Say “McCain” and you may have eyes on you that are unwanted
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         This anon has been dropping information and dates. Many have checked out. Ie: Trump twitter going down
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Also all of the advanced foreshadowing into SA and what went down there
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are many things that can’t be coincidence. “Q” has begun signing his posts that way. IMPORTANT - ANYONE could say they are “Q”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         So, a deep understanding of the entire event is needed and lots of discernment. Language, writing style, information, etc
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The thread auto archives at 300 replies. The folks on /pol have had new threads opening as soon as old ones close IMMEDIATELY
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In all of my long days on /pol, this is the first time the people who post there have dedicated this much attention/manpower to an anon
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It’s confusing and it isn’t for the faint of heart. But in my last few posts, you’ll see “Q” posting coord. And codes
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Think of it as a very old fashioned Facebook thread where you don’t know anyone. Each post is assigned a number
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If you hover over a number in any reply you will see the post being replied to. I will be around for a bit and will try to answer any ?
        </p>
       </li>

       Real talk: if you were a non-LARP, actual source of important insider info, and you wanted that info to be public, why would you go to an anonymous message board that is drowning in LARPs? Wouldn't it be way more effective to talk to a journalist, who will protect your anonymity while also lending their credibility and granting you a much larger, more mainstream audience?
      </p>

       Is it just a cry for attention? Because hese supposed "leaks" aren't making any difference in the real world.

       I don’t buy that this isn’t a LARP, at least not yet, but I would argue that the nature of journalism, reporting, and dissemination of information has changed a great deal since the 70’s. This is in large part due to the Internet. So, what better way to reach the public? I would also argue that journalistic standards have changed quite a bit thanks to the 24 hour news cycle and the ticker on the bottom of the screen that most MSM employs on television. It’s far less common now for journalists to do thorough fact checking before reporting. Frankly, I don’t know that I’d want the middle man between my info and my audience.

       Even so, you indirectly admit that some cannot be trusted. Sure it's probably not everyone. But if you have truly sensitive information, is it worth taking the risk? Or might it not be better to prioritize getting the information out onto the internet?

       Well...there's no way I can say this without probably pissing you off, but please understand in advance that is not my intention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of that stuff you listed is real news, and does get reported on. Most of it is fiction targeted at American conservatives and Trump supporters. Real journalists don't report on the fictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, if there was, for example, a real source who had information proving, for example, that Seth Rich had something to do with the email leak, or that Podesta's emails contain a known code, and if that source could provide real evidence of their claims, journalists would listen. They want to break the big stories and change the world. But those sources don't exist. They're just people who want to manipulate your beliefs so you don't question your leadership. This is also why they hammer away at you that you mustn't trust the MSM. They don't want you to know what's really happening.

       Seymour Hirsch is a Pulitzer Prize winner for his work on Vietnam and WMDs in Iraq. In 2014, Hirsch published great investigative work on the real Syrian War, called "The Red Line and the Rat Line".
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I could tell at the time, no MSM in America covered this extraordinary work.
I mention Seymour Hirsch because this Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist had this to say about Seth Rich:
      </p>
      <p>
       'According to Mr. Hersh, his source told him that the FBI report states that, shortly after Seth Rich’s murder, the D.C. police obtained a warrant to search his home. When they arrived at the home, the D.C. police found Seth Rich’s computer, but were unable to access it.The computer was then provided to the D.C. police Cyber Unit, who also were unable to access the computer. At that point, the D.C. police contacted the Cyber Unit at the FBI’s Washington D.C. field office. Again, according to the supposed FBI report, the Washington D.C. field office was able to get into the computer and found that in “late spring early summer [2016], [Seth Rich][made] contact with Wikileaks.” “They found what he had done. He had submitted a series of documents, of emails. Some juicy emails from the DNC.” Mr. Hersh told Butowsky that Seth Rich “offered a sample [to WikiLeaks][,] an extensive sample, you know I’m sure dozens, of emails, and said I want money.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The article this was quoted from is not a MSM source, but it is well worth a read. There is enough corroboration in this article (Wikileaks published same info), you'd think a young MSM reporter would jump on the work of a Pulitzer Prize winner, and try to investigate this story. But alas, no one in MSM has investigated this yet.

       Even if you don't go the route of a journalist at least make it clear with specific facts that can be confirmed as opposed to "here are some bread crumbs." When you speak in hyperbole and vague statements anyone can assign events to them after the fact. If it is a story it's a larp.

       I think it's a brilliant way to leak info if you are an insider. You have a lot of people on these boards trying to out these conspiracies but unfortunately a ton of idit larpers. Luckily for a whistle blower this could provide you with some good cover.

       The argument from Q is that all of the information is already in the public domain. Getting the masses interested in finding the pieces and putting them together is far more effective from a believability standpoint than some random anon supposedly leaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course if this were true then Q could just provide all the various sources and be done with it, which means either he's just faking, or doesn't really know all the pieces that need to be put together. Perhaps he is trying to ensnare the 'weaponized autism' of /pol/ and direct it toward some end.

       The uranium one deal, Seth Rich and Wikileaks.  The 3 biggest stories of the last year were widely discussed on both the chans and on here and were widely mocked in Mainstream press.  In fact Wikileaks and Seth Rich were banned from being talked about at all.

       Its why Julian Assange only talks to Hannity.  Why would he go on CNN or something or talk to the NY Times when he knows they outright lie about him and WL's as an organization and their mission.

       Those aren't the three biggest stories of the last year, by a longshot. Wikileaks (assuming you're referring to the emails) was last year, and nobody in the MSM mocked that story; Seth Rich was last year and is a hoax; Uranium One actually is this year, but frankly it didn't go anywhere.

       Journalists are famously strict about protecting their sources. (Otherwise they wouldn't have any anymore.)
      </p>
      <p>
       And, like I said, on 4chan or whatever not enough people will see it or believe it. There's still at least a slight risk you'll get caught, but no reward of your info potentially making an impact. If you're not going to go to a journalist, it makes more sense to stay silent.

       Obama’s Twitter, much like Trump’s, is actually handled by a small group of people who sit and brainstorm about what to tweet.

       4chan is always UTC. Twitter shows your local time. That puts the 4chan post at 7:17 PST and the tweet at 7:51 PST.

       Obama Tweet was Nov 6, 00:51:32 UTC.

       4chan seems to display times in the visitor's timezone, but the UTC timestamp is visible in the HTML (however it's not archived on archive.is!) with the attribute "data-utc"
      </p>
      <p>
       In the this case the UTC timestamp is 1509929961 which is 00:59:21 Nov 6.

       My original post was in 12 hour format and for some reason I used 24 hour format for the 4chan time and 12 hour for the tweet time in the edit.

       Thanks for the info on the 4chan timestamp.

       A lot of websites embed UTC timestamp in code, then use Javascript to adjust to user timezone. Always worth doing a right-click -&gt; Inspect Element on time displays. Also, hovering over time on tweets shows the UTC time also.
