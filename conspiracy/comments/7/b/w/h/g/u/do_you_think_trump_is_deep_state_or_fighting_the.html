<p>Establishment.. deep state.. different faction than the one thats held control. Maybe a new corporate branch or an old one. I almost want to lean towards the tech security branches of govt when considering who&#39;s pulling his strings. He&#39;s just the face of whatever it is..</p>

When it comes to Zionist and all the other societies - I&#39;m not an expert and cannot figure out how each of these factions reside in the grand scheme of things.  I just want to get rid of cronyism, pedophiles, globalism and efforts to weaken USA. I&#39;m also tired of CIA killing whomever they want and creating false wars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with your sentiments, wish for the same, but I think believing Trump is fighting those things is wishful thinking. Other than getting rid of TPP, I don&#39;t see any of the things being fought by him as you do. Bringing in relatives as advisors is fairly &quot;crony&quot; and there&#39;s nothing being done about corruption. His products are not made in America, his properties hits immigrants, but he condemns anyone else doing those things. Seems like smoke and mirrors to play to populism, while samenold things continue.</p>

Someone suggested I view Trump as someone who was selected to be President by white hats in the IC.

<p>And he&#39;s essentially funneling taxpayer dollars into the Trump Organization via the Secret Service. When he stays or visits Trump properties (and he has spent at least 96 days of his presidency visiting Trump-branded clubs and hotels), he charges the Secret Service for use of the resources. So for example, the Secret Service has paid more than $137k so far to rent golf carts at Trump golf courses in 2017. He owns the damn golf carts, yet charges the Secret Service (via taxpayer dollars) to use them in order to protect him. </p>

<p>It&#39;s turning into the American monarchy. </p>

<p>He’s not heavily invested in Military Industrial Complex, Oil Companies and he’s probably not in the best standing with the Banking and Lending Industry due to his multiple uses of Bankruptcy Protection which has helped him avoid paying back Tens of Millions to his lenders and creditors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally agree with your last paragraph, but have doubts with your first two. His family money is only 50 years younger the Bush family&#39;s, your going back to the late 1800&#39;s for the Trump family fortunes. He has an Exxon CEO as Sec State, which I&#39;d assume was a concession to the Koch brothers. See my other post on military ties and EyeoftheBeast&#39;s Ross comment is dead on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m definitely not trying to downplay the long standing influence of the Bush family. I was attempting to show that new money would be more like Bill Gates, Mark Cuban, Clintons, as opposed to money handed down over multiple generations. We&#39;re on the same thought and it&#39;s probably more semantics than anything else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like the rest of this sub I&#39;m in the middle sort of but I do have a theory somewhat. He&#39;s placed in a position of power and no one is unless they&#39;re able to be controlled. Trump knows this and knows what they have on him so he&#39;s playing ball making TPTB think he&#39;s on their leash and wont lash out so he remains safe and not a target. So he puts the most truth worthy advisors beside him while they slowly fight TPTB slowly but secretly. Trump acts like a immature person online as a cover/distraction while secretly playing the MSM and the rest of his enemies. Trump is a master strategist  and making very calculated moves. </p>

<p>Now if my theory is close to truth, this means were in for a very long battle. But I&#39;m still skeptical of him because it hasn&#39;t been a year, but also optimistic. I understand we live in a world where the people running it are evil to the core, keeping people slaves to society. We will know if Trump is continuing this trend after 4-8 years. If people are put away or if major changes to the country occurs in the next few years I think it&#39;s safe to say Trump was on the side of the light, not dark. But the jumping to conclusions shit that some people do here is totally stupid. Its very close minded, cynical, and doesn&#39;t deserve a place on r/conspiracy. Time is needed to draw an accurate picture. We had 8 years of Obama and know he was shit and continued the same trend, but to say Trump is doing the same not even after a year just because you don&#39;t like him is just irrational. Eyes and mind open, question things, remain optimistic, keep cynicism at a distance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is clearly not deep state. Deep state are career politicians, or revolving door corporate/wall street cronies supported by the wealthy and powerful (banking, oil, tech, military, etc.) who pull the strings. Trump is an anomaly that the deep state is adjusting to and plotting to turn to their advantage. We can say he is a buffoon, or he is at war with the deep state (i don&#39;t think so), but he seems to clearly be calling bullshit on the accepted narrative while consolidating some power bases (banking and military). </p>
