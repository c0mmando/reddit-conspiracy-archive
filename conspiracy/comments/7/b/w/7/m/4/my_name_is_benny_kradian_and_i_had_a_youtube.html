       You still have your audience. The question is do you still have the videos backed up? If so, try an alternative outlet. Even if it's not as well known as YouTube, your followers will find you and you'll probably gain more because of the blatant censorship of your work

       Multiple people have pointed out you didn't give any explanation they provided for your channel being taken down. Everything I've seen says it takes multiple offenses before it reaches this point..
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't you make the case why shutting your channel down was wrong? You just cry censorship and give no info. There's all kinds of shit they have that is up that probably should be taken down.. how do we know this isn't the case?

       Don't act as if you have infinite time on earth.  I never heard of you before this post, but what I'm pretty sure about is that you spent a lot of time making these videos.  If you kept copies, without skipping a beat you could have made a torrent on TPB, messaged/emailed 100 sites to get the world out, and have a wave of people downloading your material.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get your audience is the most important thing (I would know.... I do a lot of marketing for my small biz), but my point is that all points in your plan must have contingencies.  Backup channels, make email lists, Facebook groups, subreddits for your channel, etc.

       Same with the Tropicana video of the armed unit walking in front of the guy in the jersey and the guy in the suit. Top comment was something like, "Saudi Royalty wouldn't stay at the Tropicana lol" and I'm like oh come on.

       I saw elsewhere that the guy in the jersey is "just a security guard" who was coming from a softball game (in the middle of the night)

       When I stayed at Disney years ago in the swan resort, the prince walleed rented the two top floors. That hotel was nothing special in my opinion. And he and his entourage looked just like that guy in the video. This was over 15 years ago, before camera phones were a thing. How times have changed.

       thank you for typing that. I saw elsewhere someone wrote "that guy doesn't look like a prince" and I was just sitting there thinking "how fucked up is it that this comment that should CLEARLY be ignored will be enough to convince others" like I could see those with less critical thinking ability read that and go "yeah he doesn't look like a prince.....fucking crazy conspiracy theorists"

       Three of my favorite channels were shoahed when jewtube recently brought on the ADL to help censor. Several others find their new videos immediately in “quarantine mode”.

       Everybody should already be uploading their content elsewhere (and downloading and rehosting whatever you value off of jt) to boost their competition.

       I had a video up about zionism and I think that's what did it. They pretend that it's because of anti-migrant or anti-muslim videos but that's not the case. Every time I made a video about Israel, I would get quarter of the views and I always knew there was something fishy going on.

       No thats's BS. I had 650 videos. If it was a copyright issue, I would've been banned a long time ago. I never got copyright strikes. They just didn't like my content because it was true!

       Probably because they don't consist of nothing but footage from other media outlets with next to zero commentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, I watched like 5 of this guy's videos.  They're an intro bumper,
       <em>
        MAYBE
       </em>
       a 5 second transition slide with a text opinion, then 1-2 minutes of news footage that maybe, MAYBE has a few subtitles added.  Then there's an exit bumper.

      <p>
       The only conspiracy theory here is how this guy managed to go so long without getting enough copyright strikes to shut him down sooner.

       I have some backed up but more importantly, I lost my audience and my channel that I've worked so hard on. YouTube is communist to the core. They made me do an "anonymous" survey, after which, they deleted my channel. I'd say about two hours after the survey. I guess they didn't like the radio buttons I selected.

       No I wish I could but it's a random survey that temporarily appears in your YouTube dashboard. You have once chance to complete it and you can't even go back to change your answer. It's a long survey with topics ranging from "Can you depends on YT as a source of income?", "Do you get harassed by racists, sexists etc." and EVEN "Which gender do you identify with" and that had a huge list to select from.

       Comments like this are why I'm probably going to spend the rest of my life arguing about communism.

       No,

       <em>
        privately operated

       YouTube is not "communist," unless by communist you lazily mean "authoritarian in a way I don't like." YouTube is capitalist owned, capitalist operated, and censoring you for capitalist benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a new phenomenon. Here's Albert Einstein talking about the dangers of capitalist ownership of media:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population.
        <strong>
         <em>
          Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.
         </em>

       Yes exactly. The point is monopolies like Google will buy out everything in their sector to be the only ones. Whether it's through a capitalist system or not, there will be only a few companies left that are above the law. When they reign, they can do whatever they please because nothing can oppose them. That's communism. It's also dictatorship.

       I agree with you, but that is not communism. Communism specifically refers to a stateless, classless, moneyless state of society thought to occur following the universal implementation of social ownership of the means of production. You're most likely thinking of the USSR/China/et al, and their ideological systems, but that is not "communism" but rather Marxism-Leninism(/Stalinism/Maoism- it changes over time and by state), a specific form of socialism, characterized by a single party state led by a revolutionary vanguard, with the means of production centralized under the authority of a state bureaucracy. They were called "communist" not because they achieved communism, but rather because communism was the ideological end goal of Marxism-Leninism-Etcism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, there is no similarity to even an MLM based system beyond the authoritarian manner of censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, I agree with everything else you've said, and it's incredibly shitty that you've been censored. I'm just trying to clarify on these terms because IMO definitions and political terminology have been muddied together so that we, the people, lack the proper vocabulary to define our existence. If we're unable to accurately describe our political and economic reality, then it is impossible for us to understand and change that reality.

       thanks for helping clear up these misconceptions about communism. I myself have repeated the same exact points many, many times because misunderstanding of the term is absolutely rampant. Cheers

       I feel it could be, at least in part, due to a long period of cold war where "communist" was mostly used as an insult.

       oh yeah, there's a lot contributing to it, really I think the layman's entire history with the term has been with the misappropriation of the term, there's really nothing common that a person would've run into where communism would've been described accurately unless he delved into it himself

       That's literally not communism in fact it's the pinnacle of capitalism where the most powerful and profitable model begins to swallow others. It's literally only possible in a capitalism system unless you are confusing the state for YouTube. Even then it's not really similar at all.

       You see, YouTube is owned by Google.  Google is setting records in money spent bribing politicians in Washington D.C..  In other words, it's not so easy to tell beyond superficial labels where the line is that separates Google and government. This is not capitalism, but something more akin to

       At least not based on its own business model. The same with google. These corporations are used to enforce agendas defined by groups who can influence the management either through personal "relationships", government pressure or shareholders.

       Surely you didn't think Youtube was a safe place for for long-term video storage? They're an aspect of one of the largest companies in the world, dedicated to advertising moreso than content creators, and well-known for removing content that espouses alternative ideas or criticizes the establishment. They've essentially  established a monopoly on internet video, which means they can make the rules, change the rules, or ignore the rules at a whim.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your channel didn't violate any policies and was removed on accident (or due to a rogue admin's decision) you might be able to get it restored, since they are still making money off of you. But I wouldn't count on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to start using and promoting alternatives like vid.me and Vimeo if we want our concerns to be taken seriously. Without competition, they have absolutely no incentive to accommodate their users.

       "If your channel didn't violate any policies" I think that's an important question, they didn't give us any info about that. They provided a link to their videos (60+) on another service, and it does look like stuff that belongs on a conspiracy sub, but it also looks like most of the shit that Russia is accused of pushing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, the issue I see is that the majority of replies to this post just accept that he was wronged without even asking for details. We shouldn't just accept something as true without thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless it was accidently removed, YouTube has reasons that he decided not to share, and I think that's important too.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I would
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       to see people use another video service, preferably one that doesn't pay. I'd like to see people that want to share truth, rather than get paid to maybe spread lies. He commented on someone criticizing him not having a local backup, by being upset at the loss of his viewers.. and I'm willing to bet his profits.

       This video is nothing but him adding an intro/outro, then taking the original video description and attributing it to himself.

       Yeah, I think it's pretty safe to say from even a small sampling of this guy's work, that the reason he got nuked was copyright infringement, not a grand conspiracy against certain opinions.

       Did you have an email list? Or were you relying on YT to keep in touch with your fans/subscribers/followers?
      </p>
      <p>
       Mailchimp has a free one. If you haven't done it yet, I would highly recommend setting up a mailing list so you can capture emails, then save them in comma separated values, download that list of emails, and guard that list.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can email the people on the list to let them know about new videos or any other info.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, even if they delete your videos, you still have your list of people and have the right to email them. That way you don't have to start over from scratch even if they do censor you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Best of luck to you!

       You probably used a lot of footage fron News channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes News channels file bogus take down requests and videos get taken down automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know that they are wrong (fair use) but they also know that very few people will challenge the takedown request because it can potentially cost them a lot of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I know that some channels did challenge take down requests successfully - when there was clear case of bogus (not valid) requsts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not advising you to do anything but to try to study in more detail your case and reason youtube gave for their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe check legaladvice or something like that here on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Youtube probably drives a lot of traffic to your site and its worth spending some time to see if you can get videos back up.

       How do you let Youtube be the only place where your videos are kept???    Why would you not keep your own local copy?   I don't get it.   I'm a software developer -- I never lose my work because I never let there be ONE COPY of it.

       My first thought as well. With cloud storage being easily accessible, mostly for free depending.. you can have a local copy that's also stored in the cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, using YouTube as a storage medium seems down right stupid.

       Every professional videographer needs a ton of storage space.  For my wife, we have a 6TB Raid 1 NAS drive that is backed up weekly onto another 6TB Raid 1 NAS drive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two layers of data security and we do not have to trust a 3rd party with our data.  Also we do not have to wait on (relatively) slow upload speeds to get transfers done.  The only weakness is we are vulnerable to house fire/theft loss if something happens to both NAS drives.  They are stored in different locations so that is extremely unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       When our data actually gets to the point where it would be an extreme loss to lose it, I'll probably add a weekly cloud backup cycle.  However for now it's perfect, and I'd recommend a similar setup to anyone with important data.

       That's a great question I've asked myself every time one of these youtube channels gets taken down. It literally just requires a few external hard drives or even a cloud storage service.

       Dude, you really gota invest in private data archiving. You can get a local RAID NAS Appliance for less than $500 or you can pay a remote service to store your data. I realize videos take up alot of space, but dont rely on compromised outlets to host all of your data. As you can see why.

       Short term, they're shooting themselves in both feet, long term, they're setting themselves up for a kamikaze flight against the concrete wall of public scrutiny and outrage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The momentum of the collapse of their filthy little schemes is picking up in speed every single day. Even every dunce out there is awake by now, even if they're still in full-on denial mode. It's gonna take more months and even years, but eventually they'll get the wrath of the (global) citizenry that'll be worse than the days of terror during the French Revolution. This time around, people are more educated and knowledgeable about what mistakes and pitfalls have to be avoided to not end up in the same or worse in the future. Technology isn't going to help them. People are fed up with the theatre, the puppets are worn to the thread and now it's pay-back time. It'll suck ass for all those involved, but that's the gamble they made and the price they'll have to pay for causing so much misery. Eventually, the mass-media will get punished even worse than the perps themselves. They're the ones who've covered the asses of completely psychotic maniacs, they've betrayed and lied to us hundreds of times over every single day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although it absolutely sucks to have so much time and work taken from you, your goal has been accomplished anyway and in more favourable times, you'll reap the benefits of your work.

       We were the resistance, now it's time for all of those other schmucks out there to move in and play their part.

       Sure, if you pay me to work as your legal assistant.  Get a fucking Lexisnexis account or something.  WTF?
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically in the US, you can't have a contract that allows you to act for "any reason at all."  There are protected classes in the US.  So, when Google deletes or cancels accounts and refuses to say the reason why, the judge can assume it's because they are black or retarded, and order Google to pay damages.  Happened many times before.

       So what you are saying is you want to make claims without backing them up? If you are making the claims, it shouldn't be up to others to go on a wild goose chase to find things that back up your claims, especially when it is starting to look like you are talking out of your ass.
      </p>
      <p>
       No reason you say? Look through the guys videos, it is just repostings of copyrighted material with an intro and an outro added to them. No transformation of the work, just plain taking other peoples material and posting them on OPs own channel.
      </p>
      <p>
       You shouldn't be giving legal advice when the implications are so huge. OP could stand to loose a lot of money if he/she follows your advice.

       That is really outrageous.  If they gave you no warning, perhaps you could pursue this as a legal matter.  You won copyright on your videos, and they have effectively destroyed them.  If they don't want to keep them posted, fine, but they need to give you warning.  If they do this to others, a class action is warranted.

       What's the deal with this sub and YouTube? It seems like time someone asks for a source, the response is a YouTube link. Putting aside the fact that it's YouTube, owned by Google, isn't it a bit silly to use videos as your primary channel for research? OP here is apparently a YouTube researcher?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have anything against videos in general, but usually I don't want to watch one and I'd rather read, especially when it's supposed to be the source for some claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any idea why this sub seems to have such a fixation on YouTube and videos in general?

       I feel for you, I really, really do.
      </p>
      <p>
       YouTube started to delete some of my videos, unlike yourself I only have around 30 videos and 80 subscribers and tens of thousands of views, however, after my video was first deleted I decided to backup my YouTube channel and have a copy of my videos and host them on other platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm facepalming a little, wondering why, oh why, did you not back up your videos to alternative sources, especially if your videos are controversial or go against the mainstream media's view/narrative? Surely you should have seen this coming?

       I was kind of just in sharpening mode waiting to see if he was going to defend against the allegations, but now that he posted again and is clearly just hoping that this one "goes away" yeah.. all evidence points to this guy just trying to milk a patreon/revenue stream.

       Hey everyone thank you for the support from most of you. The rest are likely trolls hired by YouTube. Follow me on Twitter where I’m tweeting YT every hour demanding answers. They wrote back twice with more BS. Feel free to express your thoughts on there. I encourage it

       They did the same thing to me. I had only a few dozen videos, of interest to almost nobody, but one day they terminated my account for literally no reason. Appeal denied. No reason given. I had no copyrighted content, nothing risque, absolutely nothing that could be construed as violating the terms of service.
      </p>
      <p>
       About a month or two before I'd received a notice that someone else had "claimed" a video of mine on copyright grounds. It was a video I'd shot myself, and it contained no music and no TV clips. Of course, I clicked whatever button I had to click to dispute the claim. Maybe that was related? I really have no idea. It's all I can come up with.

       When I stayed at Disney years ago in the swan resort, the prince walleed rented the two top floors. That hotel was nothing special in my opinion. And he and his entourage looked just like that guy in the video. This was over 15 years ago, before camera phones were a thing. How times have changed.
