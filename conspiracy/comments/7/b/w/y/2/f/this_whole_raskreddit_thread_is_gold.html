It would have taken out most of our electronics worldwide and taken us up to 10 years to recover. Bear in mind, electronics means everything from Reddit and TV to our power and water supplies.

<li>Penicillin and many anti bacterial treatments are losing much of their effectiveness and will eventually be completely ineffectual.</li>
<li>The potential for honey bee and other pollinator species going extinct. This has catastrophic implications for life as we know it. The warning signs have been there for decades. Human activity is suspected to be the main cause.</li>

<li>Madagascar is currently experiencing a plague. A proper &#39;black death&#39; plague.</li>
<li>Something that I personally think no one is really talking about is how in the states, the education system is woefully outdated. The modern education system doesn&#39;t do much to promote critical thinking skills. Standardized tests that decide funding are the norm, and teachers just teach to those tests, so students just memorize some things here and there. There needs to be a complete revamp of the system; the current one was designed in the 20th century, for the 20th century. But it needs to be designed in the 21st century, for the 21st century. Focus needs to be put on interpreting and processing massive amounts of information, understanding concepts and not formulas, basic logic classes to point out inherent flaws in arguments, basic programming should be a class offered in all high schools nowadays, and god dammit, a fucking basic journalism course to combat propaganda coming at us from all sides.
Navigating the wealth of information out there without these skills being taught is like trying find your way around the pacific ocean on a canoe without an oar. The way we think about education needs to change or society will begin to stagnate.
ETA: To the people blaming the problems with the education system on the side that you don&#39;t agree with: thanks for proving my point.</li>
<li>Farm murders in South Africa</li>
<li>It&#39;s the 1% who cause dissension in our ranks. While we are all calling each other names and protesting each other, they&#39;re laughing all the way to the bank, paying people to do their bidding, passing legislation that hurts all of us but fattens their pockets. And people like you and me, Republican &amp; Democrat, Black &amp; White, Conservative &amp; Liberal, Gay &amp; Straight, are getting fucked over repeatedly.
We need to stop fighting with each other and focus our frustrations where they can benefit all of us. This division is exactly what &quot;they&quot; want. There are 325 million angry people in this country and that terrifies the establishment, but our anger is misplaced. We are distracted.
The truth is - most Republicans aren&#39;t white supremacists, and most Democrats aren&#39;t ultra liberals who are so wrapped up in political correctness, that they say nothing of value for fear of insulting somebody. They&#39;re the outliers. Most of us just want to live and let live.
Can you imagine the change we could enact if 325 MILLION people said enough?
I&#39;m not talking armed revolution. I&#39;m talking about things like $12,000 insurance policies with $7,500 deductibles that still don&#39;t cover jack. If we all said fuck it, and refused to purchase health insurance, the system would collapse on itself and would force change. If we all ordered our medications from Canada for a fraction of what we pay here, the system would collapse. If we all refused Perdue drugs in protest of them flooding the market with oxycodone and decimating our population, Perdue would collapse.
I use health care as an example but it applies everywhere.
There are bigger things at play here than our personal feelings.
Edit: I had the phrase &quot;Wake up sheeple&quot; in here. People with sensitive proclivities took it VERY personal so I took it out so as not to distract the feeble minded from my overall sentiment.</li>
<li>Education and healthcare costs are spiraling out of reach of the common man.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t know if anyone else has mentioned it yet, but Elsagate. There&#39;s a subreddit dedicated to it, r/elsagate.
You know how really young kinds like those mindless videos? Think something in the style of Teletubbies: no plot, no dialogue really, just bright colours and characters bopping around.
There&#39;s a whole wealth of these kinds of videos on YouTube. Parents can use YouTube Kids, an app, to make sure their children are watching appropriate content. They load it up and let them go.
But someone, or some people, or something, is making these mysterious videos in the style of mindless children&#39;s entertainment, except the content is super dark. They usually feature popular kids characters (Spiderman, the Minions, Mickey Mouse, or Elsa - hence the &quot;Elsagate&quot; moniker). The cartoons will feature these characters doing all sorts of bizarre things, like getting drunk and cutting their heads open, or peeing in the bathtub. Other examples include having teeth pulled, having needles, being kidnapped.
Besides the cartoons, there are also really disturbing live action videos, including this one where a kid is subjected to needles in her bum. Warning, it&#39;s pretty disturbing. She clearly doesn&#39;t want this, and her parents are exploiting her for YouTube views.
So, what&#39;s it all about?
No one knows for sure. Could be a way to exploit algorithms, rack up views, and make money. Some people think it&#39;s some kind of coded child pornography catalogue, where the videos are some kind of preview for the actual content you&#39;ll see in the real video. Some people think it&#39;s some kind of way to groom children. Others think it&#39;s a 4chan-initiated prank.
Anyway, it&#39;s really disturbing and I&#39;m fascinated and confused.
TL;DR: read about Elsagate.</li>
<li>the US is actively aiding Saudi bombings of Yemen, and they target pretty indiscriminately, no one in the media wants to mention that.</li>
<li>Internet privacy. As in privacy in general.</li>
<li>The Australian government is seriously considering letting oil companies drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight.
This is a huge huge issue.
85% of the species found in the Bight are literally only found there. They exist no where else in the world
36 different types of whales and dolphins live in the bight, with their breeding grounds in the bight as well.
Its the heart of the Australian fishing industry, so byebye quite a bit of fish if there is an oil spill.
The Oil spill in Mexico which was the biggest in the world, happened in calm waters. The Bight is known for having some of the roughest waters in the world. If a spill occurs in the Bight, it will be almost impossible to contain, and will utterly fuck up the entire southern coast of Australia. From Western Australia to Tasmania.
So not only is Australia killing the Great Barrier Reef, but we are also very close (as in 2018 close) in letting huge oil companies come and try their luck in the Bight.</li>
<li>The economy is doing well, the job market is solid, we&#39;re statistically very safe, we continue to make good progress in medicine, we&#39;re making great progress towards renewable energy and electric vehicles, technology continues to make telecommuting easier, and benefiting the disabled, we continue to make progress on human rights, I could go on and on...
...and yet we don&#39;t feel safe, we&#39;re worried about jobs, we don&#39;t eat well, we don&#39;t get enough exercise, we worry about having the latest iPhone or console or car or house, we think the country that has been plodding along improving since inception is going to hell, and are killing ourselves directly or with drugs, medicine, food, alcohol, cigarettes, sedentary lifestyles, etc... and we can stop, but many of us don&#39;t.</li>
<li>The dumbing down of society and the hijacking of all media by the corporations.</li>
<li>The people of Flint, Michigan haven&#39;t had clean drinking water since April 24th, 2014</li>
<li>The student loan debt crisis
Jesus Christ this stuff needs to be taught in high school before children make decisions that could potentially ruin their lives just because they think going to college is the only option they have.
And, currently, the government is doing all it can to fuck students in the ass over student loan debt. For instance: even if you get your debt forgiven, it&#39;s treated as taxable income so it&#39;s not actually &quot;forgiven&quot; just reduced at best. Also, filing for bankruptcy does jack shit for student loan debt. It&#39;s true a lot of people successfully pay off their debt, but there are a lot more people than you&#39;d think that are absolutely drowning in it with no hopes of ever paying it off because of interest rates.
I get angry just thinking about it.....
Edit: “but if they take out loans why don’t they expect to pay them back???? Hurrrrdurrrrr” no shit. The issue is deeper than that.</li>
<li>The Great Barrier Reef has reached the point-of-no-return and will die off within the next 25 years. This cannot be undone.
27.The Troubled Teen Industry and the fact that as an American you can legally pay for the right to have your child kidnapped, taken away and abused until they&#39;re compliant.</li>
<li>New technology and innovations will continue reduce the amount of workers needed to produce goods, and thus jobs will start to dry up. Even new AI are beginning to replace intellectual jobs (AI Lawyer).
Job market is gonna go through a serious makeover in the next 30 years.</li>
<li>Saudi Arabia is planning to go to war with Iran soon. In most of the media coverage I see, the saudi crown prince is shown as a bold but good guy, and everyone is watching and waiting how his bets will pay off. Well, I have a guess: a lot of people will die.</li>
<li>Alcoholism can be easily treated with Naltrexone but because the patent is expired the drug companies make nearly no money from the drug, so there is no reason to tell people. It&#39;s $1 a pill. It also works on opioids. Also the war on drugs is a massive failure and the US desperately needs to fix it&#39;s prison system. Seems like what&#39;s most important is whether or not to give tax breaks to the rich currently :(.</li>
<li>The US retirement crisis.
If we think it&#39;s bad that baby boomers won&#39;t leave their jobs, imagine how bad it&#39;ll be when Gen-Xers won&#39;t either. It&#39;s not reasonable to expect every American adult to save hundreds of thousands for an undetermined later date. 1.) People have financial crises, such as medical bills or being unemployed, that must be addressed before any long-term saving, and 2.) It&#39;s totally against human nature for every single person to think and plan that far in advance. Like all other developed countries, we need a system that ensures retired persons can at least meet their basic food/shelter needs. Social security was intended to help with this, but we always hear that we can&#39;t count on SS to be around. And w desperately need people to retire so the younger generations can join the workforce. Our system of 401Ks, no pensions, and meager Social Security support is a failure.</li>
<li>Gay conversion therapy is still legal and happening in 41 U.S. states and is currently covered by Medicaid. AKA tax dollars you pay go to this. Source Trevor Project Still Trying to Stop This</li>
<li>All the plastic in the water supply seems like it&#39;s going to cause a lot of problems.</li>
<li>Some countries will not grow. Even if they do grow it will be far less than what is needed to achieve meaningful, sustainable development. The whole idea behind economic growth is that eventually poor countries will be rich and richer countries will be richer. This will not be the case for many, many countries. How do you deal with the reality that some places will be very poor indefinitely?</li>
<li>China&#39;s currency manipulation, at some point it will become a problem but they may fall under the to big to fail.</li>
<li>Overpopulation. There needs to be a stigma over having a gaggle of children. Our schools are underfunded and overstuffed, our ocean is a husk of its former cornucopia-like self, and drinkable water, as a commodity, is going to ascend several tiers in terms of scarcity in the coming decades.</li>
<li>Farmer Suicide.
In India over 100,000 farmers have committed suicide in the last decade due to corporate exploitation leading to a perpetual system of debt and neo-feudalism
Read:
The Patenting of Life, Limiting Liberty, and the Corporate Pursuit of Seeds for more info</li>
<li>With all this talk of mass shootings, I&#39;d like to say this: We need to realize that the vast majority of gun deaths are caused by handguns. The handgun deaths are mainly due to gang activity. Gangs generally have power because they sell illegal drugs. If we legalize the drugs they sell, we will be taking the power away from the gang, thus minimizing gun deaths.
Edit: I was wrong, the leading cause of gun deaths is suicide. That means we need to work to make our society more meaningful to the individual, rather than ban guns and expect everyone to stop killing themselves. My overall point is that we have to look at the cause of a problem in order to fix it.
Also, I was originally way off on the amount of gun deaths per day, sorry! However, there are still about 100 gun deaths per day. That&#39;s the equivalent of a major mass shooting every single day caused primarily by handguns.</li>
<li>The slow death of europe and it&#39;s culture. I&#39;m not one of those &#39;white genoicde&#39; people, but I do think we&#39;ll lose certain cultures and our way of life, it&#39;ll happen slowly over the next hundred years, the climate change refugee crisis will be the final nail in the coffin for europe.
People here aren&#39;t having enough children.
Mass migration from mainly muslim lands will mean they will replace us in several decades.
A lot of people are like &#39;ah good no more white power bla bla bla&#39;
I doubt they&#39;ll be happy when half of europe is under sharia law.
I guess we can kiss goodbye to LGBT rights, equality for women and a slow erosion in certain rights and freedoms that we take for granted.
I try to let people know it might be a risk to let people from MENA countries in, but nobody gives a sht. They say it&#39;s racist.
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s racist to say the majority of MENA countries have backwards views. That come from backwards cultures, where gay people are exectuted, there are regular forced marriages and stonings for things like adultery.
Why aren&#39;t more people worried, if this is what&#39;s replacing us ?
Muslims aren&#39;t shy about wanting a caliphate or sharia.
A lot of muslims hate our way of life, so once their the majority here, things will start to change unfortunately.
And our governments are determined to make that happen for them.
It&#39;s just sad. I love Europe. One of my favourite places. I hope I&#39;m dead by the time it becomes totally islamic.
There&#39;s a book called &#39;Submission&#39; set in France, read it, it&#39;ll inform people of what our future will be like.</li>
<li>Nestle drying up ground wells for their bottled water empire.</li>
<li>Fat isn&#39;t causing the obesity epidemic. Sugar is. I&#39;m at work, can&#39;t post my sources, but there is a lot of evidence showing fat is actually good for you (80% of your brain is fat and your cells need cholesterol to function) and sugar is killing us.
The food pyramid is complete backwards and doctors are pushing a high carb diet that is causing type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and so much more. Most doctors don&#39;t study nutrition more than a semester or 2! At the same time, the pharmacutical industry makes a lot more money pushing their medications and treatments than actually curing the disease with diet and exercise (which is possible and sustainable!)
Just browse r/keto for numerous success stories. Cutting carbs and increasing fat not only leads to weight loss but also increased mood, greater energy, decreased brain fog, and so much more.</li>
<li>Refugee crises around the world, Rohingya Muslims, Syrians, Afghanistan, Somalia, etc. These human beings are being treated worse than dogs and in some cases systemically murdered for their religion, skin color, etc. It is a huge problem that the US only fights about...meanwhile, (and I am sorry for being graphic and distasteful, but this is a horrific situation) babies are being gang-raped and thrown into bonfires in front of their mothers.</li>
<li>Species are dying off at a rate 10000 times background levels. We are in the middle of the 6th major extinction on this planet.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>We cant just wake up and &quot;demand change&quot; by asking the people fucking us to change. It won&#39;t work your request will fall on deaf ears and get misdirected by war or other bullshit.</p>

<p>The &quot;awakening&quot; has to come from the actions of each individual that becomes awake. </p>

<p><strong>If you think comcast is bad stop supporting comcast.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If acetaminophen is killing your liver stop buying tylenol.</strong></p>

<p>Basically what I am getting at is that all these bad things that are happening are a consequence of <strong>US. ALL OF US being lazy, demanding convenience, demanding cheap resources. WE ARE THE PROBLEM, our first world lifestyles are the problem, consumerism is the problem AND THERES TOO DAMN MANY OF US TO GET EVERYBODY WORKING TOGETHER AND ON THE SAME PAGE so stop having kids damnit!</strong></p>

<p>It is just a handful of companies that own most of the things you buy.
You swap one brand for another...makes no difference.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t scrap our first world lifestyle, we need it.
We need big pharma to keep producing our pills, they are not all bad, some are required daily to live.
We can&#39;t all live off the grid.</p>

<p>If we really want change, we need to elect the incorruptible and demand harsh penalties for those who are seen to betray the interest of the public</p>

<p>You could even go so far as to change the school curriculum to one where honest politics is heavily featured, and raise the next generation to wipe out the old guard and change the entire system to one that benefits all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not all europeans raped and plundered. The Vikings did, romans did, spanish, french, germans and of course the english. So that leaves switzerland, andora and ireland. Im irish so ill stay here thanks! Actually a lesser known fact about slavery is that the English kidnapped many irish people, particularly a man named Cromwell kidnapped many people from a place called drogheda and these people were sold as slaves in europe, america and the carribean islands. They were seen as being below black slaves. So when black people talk about slaves, slavery does actually include white people too. Its just kinda forgotten about in history these days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, apart from the dark irony that there are actual immigrants fleeing from genocide, as desperate as you would be in that situation to escape and hope you can get your family to Europe with you.
Look at the measures people take to do that. You don&#39;t need me to link to the photo of Aylan Kurdi, the little Syrian boy washed up, face down, on the shore of Turkey
Don&#39;t expect his parents did any better either.</p>

<p>You are part of the willful ignorance of generations of privilege
What part of our history have we needed to flee our lands?
How many wars have we directly paid for out of our taxes?
Since 9/11 we&#39;ve paid $23,000 each, it turns out
Which is the about the same as four Paveway bombs, the payload for an airstrike, at £22,000 each
So since 9/11, if you&#39;re an American citizen you&#39;ve contributed to the war enough for an airstrike and change</p>

<p>In a world of 7 billion, who are the real bad guys? The ones who pay $23,000 out of their salary to blow up parts of the middle east. Or the one&#39;s who have nothing and are just looking to flee to the shores of Europe to safety
Something I would do in the situation, you?</p>

<p>Change that to outdated farming methods and you have it right.

    <div class="md"><p>It is a bad ass askreddit thread, and I&#39;m glad you posted this thread.  </p>

<p>My only problem with your post is this comment:  &quot;I had the phrase &quot;Wake up sheeple&quot; in here. People with sensitive proclivities took it VERY personal so I took it out so as not to distract the feeble minded from my overall sentiment.&quot;  You&#39;re talking about how we&#39;re distracted by the wrong things, and how we need to come together as people, yet you go out of your way to call those who think you using the phrase &quot;wake up sheeple,&quot; is stupid &quot;feeble minded.&quot;  The irony in that is hilarious, not to mention the whole &quot;wake up sheeple&quot; phrase just makes you seem like an edgy teenager trying to look down your nose at people who you see yourself as superior to, which in no way helps bridge the gap between any group of people with differing opinions.</p>

<p>All in all though, great post, but maybe take your own advice and stop sewing the seeds of animosity for no reason, I don&#39;t care if you want to call people sheeple, nor do i care if people get offended by being called one, but you shouldn&#39;t be offended when someone tells you that most rational people aren&#39;t going to take anyone saying &quot;wake up sheeple&quot; seriously. Because the majority of people who say that seriously, are fucking retarded.</p>

<p>While I agree that social security is a massive failure, the idea that older workers should cease working to &quot;get out of the way&quot; is kinda insane. Using that logic, one could argue that if women would just stay home, there would be enough jobs for men. </p>

<p>In a healthy economy, job growth is key, innovation is mandatory, and people naturally age out of the system on an individual basis. The suggestion that millenials should replace boomers in the job market is non-linear horsedickery and makes me lol! 😂😂</p>

Just for one example: In my sector, there&#39;s PLENTY of jobs and substantial hiring incentives available for commercial pilots right now, particularly in the regionals. Primarily <em>because</em> a generation of senior caps have been and are coming into mandatory retirement, creating a fairly serious pilot shortage.

<p>Penicillin and many anti bacterial treatments are losing much of their effectiveness and will eventually be completely ineffectual.</p>

<p>A lot of people are going to die because of this, but there are several antibac alternatives being developed. I&#39;ve personally worked in a group dedicated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_therapy">phage therapy</a> and it&#39;s pretty promising stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw a documentary on phage therapy five or more years back. While the west went exclusively towards antibiotics, the Soviets also developed phage therapy. The Ukraine is where most of the knowledge about phage therapy resides in the post Soviet world, and many people in the west with anti-biotic resistant ailments travel to the Ukraine for treatment. It doesn&#39;t work for all of them, but all of them had no hope with western medicine. It is a field worthy of further study in the west.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is a very promising field. It has its token flaws, like any treatment, but overall I have faith in them replacing antibios as our primary antibac method. In Georgia (the country) phage therapy is so advanced that they sell these drinkable bottles with phages in them. Down it in your gut and let the buggers do their magic. While people criticize phages for being selective, nothing stops us from packing in ten phages all at once - one of them is probably going to work.  </p>

<p>From personal experience I can tell you that it has huge potential. But unfortunately people are easily spooked by the word &quot;virus&quot; so the west has been unfortunate slowpokes in adopting this direction.</p>

<li> What it all boils down to is that we&#39;ve been conditioned to believe that all cultures are created equal.  PC culture has pushed this belief onto us so much that people are afraid to say anything out of fear of being called racist.<br/></li>
</ol>

<p>Let&#39;s be clear, all cultures are not equal.  If your culture oppreses women, supports the rape of little children, stones women to death for having sex outside of marriage, beheads people who disagree with your beliefs, throws gays off of buildings, and uses bombs to terrorize other cultures, your culture is a shit culture that needs to be ended.  </p>

<p>Let&#39;s be even more clear.  Europe is full of beautiful interesting and diverse cultures already.  European cultures have value and interest.  They are accepting and non-violent.  They are far superior than the one that is replacing them.  If you don&#39;t believe me, go spend some time in Pakistan or Iraq or some other shit hole.  </p>

<p>Save Europe. Save the west.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just don&#39;t agree with the whole &#39;Muslims are taking over&#39; thing.</p>

<p>Spain was completely Muslim up until they were taken over by the Christian invaders who booted them out or forced them to convert.
OK it happened 500 years ago, but things change.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it is an invasion, just a mix up by the globalists. If our countries have many different races/religions/cultures then it is much harder to be taken to war with the usual dehumanisation techniques.</p>

<p>Will Muslims take control of our governments? 
Not bloody likely, we can&#39;t, and we&#39;ve been here generations.</p>

<p>Try not to be too scared of those fleeing countries we&#39;ve had a hand in destroying.</p>

<p>But yes, we are in for a change.   </p>

<p>We&#39;ve had a programme of multiculturalism in the UK since the 50&#39;s/60&#39;s.<br/>
The UK is no longer a near exclusively white christian culture, we are a broad mix, and those growing up here, funnily enough, see themselves as British.</p>

<p>We are adding to our already rich culture, and imo is more about poverty levels for immigrants and the failing job market than it is about evil people coming to destroy everything we&#39;ve ever known.</p>
