        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I understand, sure, competition, working hard - these aren&#39;t inherently bad things.  Want to be among the best, and make a lot of money?  You have to work hard.</p>

<p>However, recently - now that I&#39;m an adult and not 19, and am considering a little more college - I&#39;m starting to realize something.  Especially having been in the workplace.</p>

<p>There&#39;s almost like a stigma, if you&#39;re not filling every hour with work.  Take a few months off between jobs?  Employers raise eyebrows.  Don&#39;t spend 16 hours a day studying, 6 1/2 - 7 days a week during college?  Professors blame and judge you.  Don&#39;t spend 8 hours a day learning in high school, just to do 3 hours of sports, and 4-6 hours of studying afterwards?  You don&#39;t want to succeed.</p>

<p>Work making you tired?  Want to be able to afford healthcare?  Make $70k minimum with no dependents.  Want that kind of job?  Better be prepared to be a &quot;professional&quot; where you have to come in early and stay late.  Don&#39;t want to do that?  Where&#39;s even your work ethic bro?</p>

<p>After all the time in work, there&#39;s just barely enough left over to do errands, cook, and, well, there&#39;s often not even time for 8 hours sleep.  That&#39;s even if you&#39;re single.</p>

<p>So, people don&#39;t cook, they go to Wendy&#39;s or order Dominos.  They become obese.  People who work out, I&#39;ve noticed, usually are people also don&#39;t sleep much, or don&#39;t ever do anything like watch TV or read.</p>

<p>People pawn off their kids to sitters, activities, family, school, or the television.  Kids grow up empty.  They fill their emotional needs with Netflix and &quot;nostalgia&quot;.</p>

<p>This shit is fucked up guys.  Something tells me it&#39;s out of balance.  Something tells me that the big TVs and marble counter tops could be traded for a better life.  We might have to give up advanced cancer treatments, but then, if there was a market with price discovery and not a cartel for healthcare, that might be good too.</p>

<p>Anyway, here&#39;s my point, now that I&#39;ve painted the picture:
There&#39;s almost like a sense that if you have any kind of self-reflective personal life (where you have actual time to take care of personal needs and personal spiritual/emotional/physical health) then you&#39;re not working hard enough.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve realized, as an adult &quot;oh, wait, so there <em>isn&#39;t</em> enough time to take care of necessary things&quot;.  And I&#39;ve also realized that culturally, manager and administrator types have an arrogant insistence that all good people devote all of their time to whatever it is that they manage or administrate.  </p>

<p>So, two plus two = they don&#39;t like it when we have time to take care of ourselves.</p>

<p>I believe this is an implicit and &quot;soft&quot; system that&#39;s the consequence of many factors.  However, I also believe that these factors, many of them, are like a &quot;stack&quot; that&#39;s been set up intentionally by the powers that be.</p>

<p>If we were healthy, and had time to be healthy, we&#39;d be much harder to manage, more independent, less obedient.  That seems obvious.</p>

<p>We&#39;d be better workers if we were healthier, less money would have to go to healthcare and mental health (then again - anti-depressants are big money), and instead well, to bigger yachts maybe even.</p>

<p>But, they keep up unhealthy simply because it really lowers the costs of managing us and societal outcomes as well.</p>

<p>TL;DR: a series of policies and factors, some of which are very deliberate, keep us unhealthy and overworked so that we&#39;re more compliant workers.  The entire society enforces this, by shaming people who like to actually get enough sleep and have a little time for themselves.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>True or not in this particular case, I do think we should terminate the mandate that publicly traded corporations are required to maximize shareholder anything.</p>

<p>Shareholders are welcome to do their research, only purchase stock in companies they feel will generate adequate returns, and sell that stock when they no longer feel adequate returns are being generated.</p>

<p>But the publicly traded corporation should in no way be beholden to public investors.</p>

<p>This would be a good step in curbing the short-term mentality which has overtaken corporate America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this. So many of the older generation constantly say things like &quot;your generation just doesn&#39;t work hard enough, I worked part time and paid my way through college&quot;. What they don&#39;t understand is that for most people even a full time job doesn&#39;t pay for college. Life for my generation is shitty, most of my friends work over 40 hours a week, some work two jobs. Buying a house seems completely out of our reach, and with most of us having student loan debt it basically is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I studied majors which most people now laugh at because I knew the most important thing was GPA. I ended up getting a worthless MA but went to Columbia on full fellowship even coming from a crappy state school because my GPA was so high, plus I had a high verbal GRE and my faculty adviser got his PhD from Columbia. Geographic diversity might have helped too. I am in a field where I get little pay and little respect despite the higher education required and I wonder if I had gone into a more rigorous field where my GPA would have been low would I have been more successful in life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got a bachelors in science from a state school and I’m doing better then some engineers. It probably has to do with going to a slightly better school but I think people like hard working people and if you can appear hard working enough then you will get hired. But I can never work as an engineer so that much absolutely does matter. That said, I’m doing (small) business management for a developer and am able to work with engineers. There are always other ways to do things.</p>

<p>Soon the world is going to change and people are going to have to make a choice, are you going to be of service to yourself or are you going to be of service to others? Technology is advancing at a rate where most if not all people are going to be out of a job and we have to start paying people a living wage or let them starve and die. The people in power are not going give us anything for free, they are 100% self-serving sociopath&#39;s, they rather let you die than give a penny of their wealth away. Wealth so big that nobody would have to starve or need anything in their day-to-day lives. That is how much money and resources there is hidden from us. Money makes certain things easier, but it can&#39;t buy happiness and make you grow as a person. But not having to work day and night will. And when humanity has the time to stop and think, they will see the system of slavery we live in.
Humanity has been brainwashed and had our past taken away from us, and divided us with religion, colour and so many things. My hope is that as we technology progresses and we have to work less, and people have some more time to get to know themselves, that they will realize that we are all one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You misunderstand me. Money has value because humans give it value, but there is no intrinsic value in fiat currency. Gold has intrinsic value. Silver has intrinsic value. Diamond has intrinsic value.</p>

<p>These different commodities can all be <em>used</em> for something besides just trade. Gold, silver, and diamond for example all have common industrial uses. That&#39;s what I mean by intrinsic value. You can do something with them besides trade them for other things. I can&#39;t do much more with a dollar besides spend it on something useful, or make it into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic#/media/File:Bundesarchiv_Bild_102-00104,_Inflation,_Tapezieren_mit_Geldscheinen.jpg">fancy wallpaper</a> (like the Germans did when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic">Mark hyperinflated</a>)</p>

<p>This is the difference in fiat currency, which is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity, and currency backed by a commodity like gold ie the gold standard.</p>

<p>So no, please do not throw away all your money, it is the current tool to be used and throwing it away would be dumb. I just think more people should research this stuff.</p>

I finished my BS in 2002 and first MS in 2004, and I&#39;ll still have probably another 10 years of paying off college loans (yay me for getting into a nice, expensive, private engineering university). I did not want him getting into debt like I did, and finally convinced my wife and her ex-husband to agree with me about him going to a community college for his first two years and transferring to a university after that. He&#39;s in his first year now, and he&#39;s able to afford his classes with just part time work, and he&#39;ll knock out at least half of the credits he&#39;ll need to graduate, along with developing study and time management habits that&#39;ll help him in the more expensive credit hours.</p>

<p>I like having time to actually live and enjoy existing. </p>

<p>But if I don&#39;t get a car, an apartment/home, have a wife and kid, I&#39;m not &quot;successful&quot; or I&#39;m lazy. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m faced with working overtime to afford said things, or something like joining the military, because they&#39;ll pay off the debt, and give you and your family healthcare (the quality of which I&#39;m not sure of, I hear bad stories but their could be good ones). </p>

<p>It just feels like we&#39;re not allowed to enjoy life, if you&#39;re enjoying life you&#39;re not working hard enough is the general message I get. It feels like I&#39;m not cut out to be here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey thanks internet stranger! Fun little fact, I won a few hundred bucks on the Super Bowl this year and decided to take my payout in Bitcoin (since it was a much faster method than check). As soon as my payment went through, BTC was cracking $1000 and pushing to the $1100 range. I quickly used the payment to purchase a 1/4 oz of gold, thinking it would be a safe long term investment.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today and BTC is at almost $7500. My gold, on the other hand, is worth about the same few hundred it was back in January. Pretty crazy to think how much money I left on the table by cashing out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s partially debt based fiat currency. We give money its value by accepting it in exchange for our goods and services, basically time and effort. Without our acceptance, money has no value. </p>

<p>This money, which harnesses our time and effort, is created by privately owned institutions. It is loaned to us, individuals, businesses and governments, by these privately owned institutions. These institutions have families who own them. Through these institutions, they effectively own us, our time and effort, and decide what we will do in the future by deciding what to fund and what to defund.</p>

<p>They only create new money whennew debt is created. They only create the principal, not the interest. So, it is literally, mathematically impossible to ever pay them back and be free of bondage to them, as principal plus interest is always greater than all the money available to pay off the debt. As individuals, we can struggle in competition with other victims of this corrupt system and rise out of debt, even profit on others debts. However, as a human species, we cannot ever overcome the basic math of this arrangement. We will be in perpetual debt to these supposed human beings, who own the banks.</p>

<p>So, to make an analogy, these people are like a parasitic organism feeding on humanity and directing is attention and effort. As long as we don&#39;t perceive the corruption and imbalance of the system they use and the identities of the beneficiaries, we won&#39;t overcome it. We&#39;ll keep falling for the same tricks by the same beings. It&#39;s fairly simple. We submit to a currency, basically by accepting it, which requires debt to be made at all, which keeps us on a treadmill of scarcity to pay back those made it. It&#39;s easily conceivable to have a credit based currency instead. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are credit based currencies. The US dollar could be one too, if we set the money creation system up that way. </p>

<p>Gold, silver, other precious metals, property, or literally anything else of intrinsic value that is usable in exchange with others is a credit based currency. There is no need for a giant black hole sucking in the value with trickery. It&#39;s beings exchanging value with each other. If we lived with credit based currency, there would be a lot less debt. It would be conceivable for all of humanity to live without having debt. You could save, share and spend as you require. Your money will tend to increase in value rather than decrease in value, because the goods and services it can buy will increase relative to the supply of that money. </p>

<p>In other words, when you, I or we cut off parasitic organisms, we have more of our own energy and wellbeing. We are more satisfied and self-directed. We are more free. Parasites subvert free will in order to achieve imbalanced value exchange relationships. They use deception and coercion to achieve and maintain these parasitic relationships. Our tolerance of parasites, which is caused by wilful ignorance in this case, keeps us enslaved to parasites. If we all knew what I just typed, we&#39;d be free within the year. As we face problens, by putting our attention and intention upon them, we can fix them. Is this not your own experience of life? It works even better collectively, provided we actually do it, because of diverse perspectives entering our minds to enhance and hone our actions for maximum effectiveness and harmony. </p>

You really think it&#39;s fair to take money from some poor family with two working parents making only minimum wage? Heck, I made more than the current minimum wage working in high school in the 90&#39;s. And back then, the dollar went much, much farther. I could fill my gas tank for under $15.

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t agree more, bud. I feel like there must be an easier way. Like, increase a sales tax a little. Collect tolls on roads, but only to make sure that money goes to fixing that actual road, not just because they can and because they&#39;ve always done it. And if they&#39;ve collected enough to make repairs, stop tolling people. </p>

<p>I know there&#39;s no easy answer, but certainly there are some better ways to spend all of this money <em>they</em> collect and it&#39;s very disheartening to see the trillions of dollars spend on war and other countries while health care, homelessness and education are real problems at home. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure exactly how to accomplish that but I feel like setting children up with practical knowledge instead of filler that someone will never use in their lifetime. I know I had a tough time with school because I found it all incredibly mundane and most of the work was done merely to keep you busy instead of teaching you, it didn&#39;t help that most of the teachers I had growing up we&#39;re burnt out and most likely had a lot of contempt for the kids (who can blame them), there&#39;s got to be some changes made or idiocracy could end up being a documentary rather than a comedy.</p>

The problem is that it breaks the bank, it just seems ridiculous to me that a sizeable portion of my income goes towards educating a future citizen instead of it being readily available so that our country has a well educated population. You would think it would be in the governments best interest to educate every child properly but apparently that&#39;s mostly meant for the affluent or if you truly intend to get a proper education expect to be in a ton of debt, it truly is a shame.</p>

<p>That&#39;s quite possibly because he&#39;s older too - when my kid was 29 months - he didn&#39;t know much about speech or number recognition - but by the time he was 42 months - he was talking a lot and recognized every number.</p>

<p>(I am sorry if I sound like I am patronizing or cynical)
But I think it&#39;s important to realize most of the stuff they are teaching him at school - you could teach him at home - if only you weren&#39;t slaving away at your job all day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was in just a three week span that he made these improvements so I find it hard to believe that the correlation is age rather than environment, the daycare we had him in was truly terrible and did absolutely nothing in regards to education. Every day I would ask him what he learned and he would say nothing, I would talk to his teacher to see what they were reviewing so I could stay on the same page with him at home and she would straight up tell me nothing today the kids made it too difficult to go over anything (and I get it, kids can be fucking crazy) but there&#39;s solutions to that and the director just didn&#39;t care to implement any. New daycare lays out the curriculum for the week, uses real world applications to teach the kids, gives online reviews of what they&#39;ve done on a daily basis, takes pictures throughout the day of what they&#39;re doing, what they ate, when they&#39;re on the playground and my son now talks about what he&#39;s learning every single day. The difference really is uncanny but it&#39;s not hard to believe when you go from an environment of no true focus into an environment of organization and action, it&#39;s great.</p>

<p>All of this would go into a &quot;portfolio&quot; which is used to apply to Colleges or a corporate job.</p>

<p>As for the kids, they could go to school in a private school.  At a strip mall.  Four days a week at the local library.  In their home.  In a friend&#39;s home with ten other kids.</p>

<p>Anyone could do what the hell they want!!  </p>

<p>But!  Even municipalities could run &quot;public schools&quot; for disadvantage kids, selecting whatever the rating systems they want.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The training reflects the intent of those who set it up. We are to be wage slaves. What we really want is self enhancement and empowerment, to avoid an abysmal existence. </p>

<p>So, we need to change the way we teach away from obedience of authority toward personal responsibility. In other words, instead of it being acceptable to just command people without explanation, we should show the kids that the merit of the reasoning behind your interactions with others is of key importance. </p>

<p>If they understand the reason for the rules, they will be much more likely to respect them. Children tend to rebel against those who demand obedience without question and school is set up to break them of that free spirit. Instead, they could learn to simply be mindful of the self-interests of others as they make choices. When people do this well, they don&#39;t even need rules. Also, personal responsibility is the key metric we use to judge maturity. </p>

<p>This goes hand in hand with critical thought and independent mindedness. Instead of treating the kids like obedient pets, we would be treating them like young, ignorant adults. Don&#39;t assume they can&#39;t understand why the rules exist. Let them demonstrate it before you bring out the coercion, and when you have to use it, explain to them the reason why it needs to be there. Kids are actually very intelligent, but lack understanding. They can grasp a lot more than we believe they can. It&#39;s often our fault for not explaining things to them properly. </p>

<p>I honestly believe that we are most intelligent when we are young, but have a lack of experience, understanding and wisdom. We gain experience, understanding and wisdom over time, but we actually lose intelligence. We don&#39;t want to believe we do, but consider how well you played (video) games, solved puzzles, reacted quickly to stimuli, etc. when you were young vs how you are now. Was there a decline? There was for me and I&#39;m only in my mid thirties. Fortunately, we can make up for that deficit with wisdom and understanding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is, of the system wasn&#39;t rigged, no one would have to make sacrifices that you&#39;re making, to live a meager life. It shouldn&#39;t be either or.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton made a speech that paid what some of us give up <em>ten years</em> to make. Trump is no better, he hires &quot;the best people&quot; to make him more money. It doesn&#39;t matter which side of the isle they&#39;re on, it&#39;s us versus them.</p>

<p>They sell us the idea of the American dream to get elected. Then they do things to make each other more rich. They make the rules, but then they can traumatize little kids, like they&#39;re sacrifices made from the peasants of old.. and they have enough money to make it go away.</p>

<p>People on here constantly crying out about the Podesta brothers, while they forget about people like Epstein.. if you have enough money, you simply don&#39;t get punished like the rest of us will.</p>

<p>Whether or not Trump did anything wrong, he has paid the money to make sure we will never know. How many Hollywood elite did the same? And the &quot;victims&quot; take the money. How many here that have been victims would take money rather than make sure they are punished??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. You literally are thinking and saying what I say to my wife, brother and any people that I have decent conversations with. I am 33 and lived my life differently. I thought by the time I was 25 I would have it all and then some. I didn&#39;t and I felt like a complete failure because I wasn&#39;t living the quote &quot;american dream&quot;. I didn&#39;t have a huuuuge house or debt or kids and here I am prepping to live in my now wifes parents basement to save money. What a loser I am I thought!!! But, I started to listen to the people with &quot;the dream&quot; and realized it was actually a nightmare. I had the dream!!! I was debt free from everything, going on multiple vacations a year, saving money and basically waking up with my best friends everyday ( dog and wife). Finally this last year I bit the bullet. I bought a house. The whole &quot;loser living in the basement &quot; thing really paid off. We bought OUR dream house. Its 800 sq ft. 2 bedrooms. 1 Bath. Living room. Kitchen. We were able to put down our 20% and also re did the entire interior and some things outside. All in all I dont even know what I spent. 100,000 maybe, but truly I donno. But I remember as a child my father telling me that you really want your mortgage payment to be at about 1,000$ a month. Pay your bills on one income. And I actually listened. My mortgage is 1,007$. My house is small but its all that we NEED. I dont have tons of useless space that people who live in poverty or shacks would kill for I have just what I need. I already have one vacation planned for December and another for Jan/Feb ( I work outside and live in New Jersey so I hate the cold). I may be rambling a bit but this really hit me. People are not living any more. They are part of an assembly line. The more debt and kids the better because then &quot;they&quot; own you. Today at work a painter said to me &quot;wheres your Dad Mexico or something&quot; to which I replied &quot;No I go to Mexico he goes to Florida&quot; he laughed and said &quot;I gotta get a job with you, I haven&#39;t vacationed in 13 years!!!&quot; He owns his own business. He looked tired. Like he just works and works and works. I do consider myself very fortunate. I make decent money and my wife is a nurse. But my point is just because everyone else is doing it doesn&#39;t mean you have too. I dont have a facebook, a myspace, a twitter, a twatter or a 16 bedroom house like I do work on for rich people everyday. I dont feel owned, I dont feel like I have anyone to impress and I feel somewhat free. We only get one shot at this short life. Better to actually do than talk about what you are &quot;gonna&quot; do when you retire. It may never happen. But breath my friend. Just breathe when you need too. Because in the end none of this &quot;stuff&quot; really matters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the path of a reasonable man. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pay your bills on one income.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s how we did it. We lived in a dive on the streetcar line. We both lowered our lifestyle as hard as possible, and increased our earnings as fast as possible. That&#39;s what gets most people: lifestyle inflation.</p>

<p>Saved our pennies. 20% down on a fixer upper on the subway line. Renovated, fixed, repaired, upgraded, painted, split into 3 rental units, live in one, the renters cover HELOC. I don&#39;t owe anyone a single penny except for the HELOCs and the renters pay those, and more. </p>

<p>Outside of the real estate I have been essentially debt free since 33 years old. Pay cash for everything including vehicles. Not owing anyone a dime is the &quot;Fuck you&quot; position.</p>

<p>Nobody owns me. I&#39;m free. </p>

<p>My father in law doesn&#39;t like that I buy cheap vehicles. &quot;We have standards,&quot; he says. </p>

<p>&quot;No you don&#39;t.&quot; I say. &quot;You have money.&quot;</p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t give a flying fuck how many more months I would have to work before I can retire, to afford that expensive vehicle. He just wants to show off and boast, as if it means anything that I can borrow money to buy shiny shit I don&#39;t need.</p>

<p>The only winning move is to define the rules yourself. Don&#39;t play other people&#39;s games. </p>

<p>My dad worked hard his entire life, finally retired at 64. Passed of cancer at 66. </p>

<p>Know yourself. Figure out what really matters. You can go ahead and buy a nice car if you want, by all means: but don&#39;t forget that you&#39;re going to start thinking about a new one at some point in the next 12 months.</p>

<p>Know yourself. Nothing else matters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>crazy i was just thinking about this while i was daydreaming earlier. and then it came to me. Daydreaming is extremely frowned upon in school work and society. I think daydreaming allows us to  channel the infinitely deep well of consciousness inside our mind when our stress is equal to zero. This  is where some of our most meaningful thoughts come from and they do everything they can to keep us distracted. To keep us from daydreaming. Daydreaming is healthy and i think it can be very powerful, we just haven&#39;t learned to use it properly. Infact they do everything can do stop us from doing it. On a side note it is incredible how much of a waste of time college has been for me. Every teacher i&#39;ve had has openly stated you can learn everything online for free way faster. so we&#39;re literally just paying for a piece of paper. More importantly, and in regards to your post, we&#39;re paying to be distracted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That free feeling is something that cannot be bought at any store either. I pay cash for everything. I owe the mortgage company money but that will not take us the 30 yrs we signed up for. We have already been doubling up on payments. </p>

<p>And its the story of your father over and over again. My would be step father worked his ass off his entire life and was finally getting &quot;it&quot; (starting to work less and enjoy life more) at 56 years old in 2013. While he was out for his morning bike ride he had his second heart attack and passed that quick. All he had worked for gone just like that. All the talk of what he was going to do, build and cars he was going to re-store. It never happened. I got tons of knowledge from him. Things you cant pay for. Because my mother was not married to him yet we got one thing basically from his passing. Its currently on my wifes finger because my mother knew what he meant to me and it was his impact on me that I am who I am. </p>

<p>I feel very bad for people who just want more more more. It is never enough. Instead of just enjoying whats in front of you. I went through that in life. I thought it really was about those shiny things. Its not. Im just happy I learned that very quick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mhm. People still don&#39;t understand why they&#39;re stressed and they have low self esteem, depression and all sorts of anxieties. But it&#39;s like... step back and look at the life you&#39;re living and the world around you. Like I don&#39;t think people really understand. So many people are bitter and angry and <em>fucked</em> and it&#39;s totally not natural. It&#39;s not. The kind of stress most people experience that has them thinking they&#39;re going mentally ill is completely manufactured. All of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The crazy things is, out of the 40 plus hours most people work every week, maybe 15 of those hours are actually productive. So what is the point?

<p>I had a district manager tell me that I should be coming into work an hour early and that I should stay an hour late everyday. That&#39;s when the light went off and I began my exit strategy. No thanks, I&#39;d rather not spend any more time here than I have to. </p>

<p>The other thing is that everyone is trying to keep up with the Joneses. They have to have the nicest home, car, clothes, etc. All so their friends can say &quot;oh wow, nice wrist watch&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Not gonna lie, I sit here sometimes and just feel like a slave to the almighty dollar. I work 65-70 hours per week, I was one of those people that ate out all the time because I just didn&#39;t have the energy to cook. Just started eating healthier about two weeks ago and trying to cook every meal, I have a 4 year old so I don&#39;t want him to develop poor eating habits so I figure energy or not I gotta do what I gotta do. I try to squeeze exercise in on my two 15 minutes breaks and my half hour lunch and since I work from home it&#39;s not too unreasonable. Whatever free time I have left on the weekends is used to spend time with my kid and my ex, we still do things as a family and I don&#39;t take a single day to sleep in, I never go to bed before midnight and I&#39;m always up by 5:30 in the morning. It&#39;s honestly absurd, all this work and I get nowhere, I live in an apartment and I have a beat up car, I have no real assets and I bust my ass on a daily basis. I don&#39;t make terrible money but it&#39;s not fantastic either and kids eat up a lot of resources, I also pay child support which is a hefty sum of money every check.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna lie, I&#39;ve gone through some serious bouts of depression and in my life I&#39;ve contemplated suicide more times than I&#39;d like to admit, the only thing truly keeping me from ever doing it is my son as I don&#39;t want him to grow up without a father and it&#39;d be incredibly selfish for me to do it. I&#39;d be lying if I didn&#39;t say it was torturous sometimes and the worst part is I know that I don&#39;t have it half as bad as a lot of people out there, so I can only imagine what they feel like. Whenever I see mass shootings I just wonder if maybe those people broke under the extreme duress of this life and as much as I&#39;d like to say I would never do something like that and I really truly don&#39;t think I could, I can see how it&#39;s possible for someone to reach their breaking point. The system is flawed, I don&#39;t know how to fix it and I wouldn&#39;t even know where to start, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyone in a political position right now that even gives a shit because they&#39;re all perched up on their ivory towers looking down on us plebs laughing while they control everything. It&#39;s fucking infuriating and I hope that when my son is my age that things are different, maybe people will start to come together and realize this is all just a shitshow and we need to unify instead of being so god damn divisive with everything.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rambling but this really hit home at this very moment, I just finished a 12 hour shift and put my kid to bed and just as I do every night I wondered if things would ever get better. I hope they do, I truly truly hope they do but I can&#39;t say I&#39;m really confident about it. Thanks for the post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah my kid is most important thing in my life and I intend to be the best father I can and hopefully give him the proper guidance so that he doesn&#39;t make the same mistakes I&#39;ve made. If that means working 70 hours a week and sacrificing my free time then it is what it is, if it wasn&#39;t for him I would have checked out mentally and possibly physically a long time ago, I had a pretty bad opiate addiction right up until he was born and I struggled with alcohol for a couple months after his birth because being a new parent was so stressful but he basically saved my life. I really don&#39;t know that I&#39;ll ever be able to give him the things I&#39;d like to give him but I&#39;ll always make sure he has a roof over his head, food on the table and unconditional love. I&#39;ll also do my best to make sure he understands that life is full of adversity and it&#39;s not all sunshine and rainbows but you gotta keep your chin up and keep it moving, my dad did the same for me and even though I was a pretty stubborn teenager that didn&#39;t believe a fucking word of what he said I eventually found out the hard way when I had to go out on my own. I appreciate you and I&#39;m glad there are some people in this world that understand what&#39;s going on and hopefully one day everyone gets on the same page and tackles the real problems so people don&#39;t have to struggle on a day to day basis with surviving. Take it easy my friend!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely, I was going through some pretty serious bouts of depression after sustaining an injury while exercising so healthy selections weren&#39;t really my priority at the time unfortunately. While I could definitely make some healthier choices at restaurants and fast food places when necessary I&#39;m trying to eliminate it as much as possible to save money and try to get in better habits for myself and my son.

<p>If you look around you can find a nice steak for about $6. You can cook it almost as good as a restaurant $30 steak with practice and good instructions.

Most people will never even get to see one million in their life time but there&#39;s guys out there with billions of millions...theres literally enough money to go around but they&#39;d  rather have 5 houses and expensive cars...like cmon!!! What&#39;s it gonna take people to realize these things?? It&#39;s so frustrating knowing that the root of all evil is what makes the world go round and it&#39;s basically impossible to change</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The goal is to make the business work for you. This is something that you can&#39;t ever get with a wage where you trade hours of life for income: passive income which comes from a business which runs itself, with managers if necessary. I&#39;m sorry for your friends, but they&#39;ve simply not reached that goal of being able to step aside and let the business earn without their physical presence, or they&#39;re unlucky, or they&#39;re doing something wrong.</p>

<p>Obviously there are winners and losers in a scarcity economy where competitors compete for the same slice of pie. My point is with a wage, you are literally held down no matter how well the business does. With your own business, the sky is the limit. Not everyone can do this, but for young people with gumption and good ideas, they should break their chains and make a run for it, and try their luck at capitalism themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, I like to work. Free time drives me crazy. It&#39;s just the TYPE of work that we&#39;re doing that adds so little value and meaning. </p>

<p>For example, when I started gardening I could easily spend 6 hours in the garden doing physical labor and loving every moment of it. I could till the soil (large back yard), plant seeds, and then after several months I was rewarded with delicious fruits, herbs, and vegetables. It was work but there was a purpose and a tangible reward. </p>

<p>I think that&#39;s the disconnect - our work is meaningless, it offers little to no reward (besides money, and often not enough money to survive), and we are not truly creating anything. The work we do often does not create a better future. It doesn&#39;t even create a better present. </p>

The worst part?  If you fall out of line: grandmas will pester you, kids will berate you, old men who are strangers will physically hit you, bosses will drive you to suicide on purpose, and your friends will turn away from you.  It&#39;s sick as fuck, there&#39;s no &quot;human loyalty&quot;.
And yet, Japanese people complain that other cultures are too uptight and don&#39;t seem &quot;human.&quot;
The reason?  We call out Japan&#39;s shit, which Japanese people hate, especially if you&#39;re not in the system where they can abuse your for it.
It&#39;s like a society of institutional emotional abuse, where people enforce it on each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt most of my coworkers do more than 2-3 hours of real work a day.  They&#39;re attentive when the boss is around, but whenever I pass by they&#39;re just sitting down, looking at their phones all day.  I can&#39;t actually be still for more than five minutes so I naturally see everyone else as zombies.</p>

<p>When I drive my commute, half the drivers are just looking at their phones, not even paying attention when the light turns.  Yet another argument for traffic circles.</p>

<p>In my view, the population breaks down into groups.  People not really considered part of the workforce.  People who are a net negative and a tax on everyone around them.  People who sort of break even.  And finally people who get all the shit done and actually remember that it needs doing.  The largest group are those outside the workforce, kids and old people mainly.  The next biggest are the breakevens.  They just punch clocks.  The other two groups have the most impact, but the takers outnumber the maintainers by a comfortable margin.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what class they are in, people can still be a taker like a well connected tax dodge or a maintainer who uses pharmaceuticals in order to put up drywall 16 hours a day.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some people see this tendency and exploit it, sure. But keep in mind that people have been lamenting the loss of the simpler days of yore for nearly as far back as we have written records. Thoreau wrote about the breakneck pace of life over 150 years ago. Chinese scholars and mystics from 2500 years spoke of the wise ancients who lived in harmony with nature, so unlike the then modern-day people. I think this is a common characteristic of <em>civilization</em>. We did live for hundreds of thousands of years without it, and I surmise that our genetic makeup has not, by and large, caught up with the pressures of our environments. People are anxious, competitive, violent animals. The pressure cooker of modern civilization is a reflection of these instincts. We are obviously capable of so much more but I don’t think we need a ruling class to keep us doing the same thing. We all keep chipping in to make the machine keep going.</p>

<p>You can live a good life making 50-60K a year if you marry a partner making the same. </p>

<p>There are huge barriers that actually keep middle class people from moving up, and it’s not income:
-SAT Score
-College
-First Job</p>

<p>If you do well on any of these, your life will be incredibly easy. However, the way our world works is that the middle class has no idea how important how any of these things are, nor can they afford the necessary training.</p>

<p>Lastly, most Americans are struggling not because it’s tough, but because they keep making stupid decisions like buying a car, living in an expensive city, or spending more than they make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, yes and yes.  I used to work about 80 hours a week but only got paid for 35.  I used to work so hard and thought that success could be found in hard work and absolute dedication to my job.  I then realised that while I was working into most of my evenings, my boss was enjoying her life and fucking off home at lunch times.  She then resented the fact that I knew more than her and deliberately sabotaged my path to promotions and played down all of my achievements.  I then thought fuuuuck this and immediately stopped doing extra.  It was only then that I discovered that I had space in my head to really think, to be creative and look after myself.  I am now the happiest I&#39;ve ever been.  I changed jobs and was promoted within a few months.  Then I started my own business and a few months after that started my second business.  The beauty is, I don&#39;t have to work 80 hours to run two businesses.  Employment is good but only if it works for you.  When it takes up all your time I feel like it&#39;s robbing you of your life - and theft is a crime!  All of this I feel combined with debt and tv and all the stuff going on in the world is all designed to distract us from being our best selves.  </p>

<p>If you take a look at statistics regarding hours worked per week, you&#39;ll see a lot of former Iron Curtain countries above the United States in these statistics.  Many of the people who own businesses in these countries realized that you could actually exploit both capitalist and communist ideals to get workers to put in even <em>more</em> hours than they would under each individual system.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure as the memories of communism slip away this will slowly change, but at the moment it&#39;s incredible to watch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m am &quot;out and doing it&quot;.  ALSO, I&#39;m having a discussion about the real life phenomenon, which has lasted for centuries, of people exploiting other people.  Which is part of making things better, talking about it.</p>

<p>Wow, I&#39;m &quot;complaining&quot;.  That&#39;s all I&#39;m doing?  You feel the need to crusade against that because I typed a few words on a keyboard.  How about admit that your attitude is part of the problem.</p>

<p>People who are against &quot;complaining&quot; I don&#39;t understand.  If you&#39;re around it all day and it interferes with your life fine, complain about the complaining.  Otherwise, why do so many people lash out against complaining?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s usually because they used to be lower class, but have secured a middle class existence.  They&#39;re so relieved by their little petty victory and new privilege, they want, subconsciously to defend it.  They don&#39;t like Rock The Boat discussions.  So they work to shut them down.</p>

<p>They keep people dumb. Make them spend so much money on university, make them give up their privacy.
They also hate contraception and use the Church as their defense because they know that if they keep people dumb, they are more likely to have children which makes their life harder and gives the state more money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe we could enjoy a little more free time if we all weren&#39;t so mired with debt and saddled with the responsibility of funding state and federal governments with our money via taxes. What if we could find an alternate revenue stream that was sufficiently large enough to fund government operation on its own -- without our tax money?</p>

<p>We potentially have a way to do that now. If the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAUqcBc0hYI">federal government</a> were to invest in <a href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3266/1">space-based solar power</a> using an <a href="http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/OrbitalRings-I.pdf">orbital ring</a> space <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20000105202.pdf">elevator</a> to launch and maintain the panels, we could realize <a href="https://newfederalistpapers.joomla.com/11-orbitalring">trillions</a> in annual revenue. This would be more than enough to fund government agencies at their current scope and all of our current social spending. The power generated from SBSP could be sold to other countries who themselves do not have inexpensive space access via a space elevator. This could drastically improve the economy and elevate our baseline wealth. Perhaps then, theoretically, many of the ills you mentioned, OP, such as parents not having time to raise children and people inundated with endless debt, could start to improve. </p>

<p>I decided that it was not for me and are currently working around 24 hours per week which fits me perfectly. I earn quite enough, rent my apartment and that is enough for me.</p>

<p>Some people look down on me and asks me questions like &quot;b-but don&#39;t you need a car? Don&#39;t you want to own your home?&quot; Hell no i tell them, because look at me. I am debt free, 100%. Compared to them, if i wanted to stop working for a couple of months i could do that without any issues because there is nothing holding me back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mention all the costs of modern life expectations and the vices that keep it all together (like fast food). but don&#39;t forget you DO have the FREEDOM to say no.  Nothing is stopping you from buying a plot of land for $1500 in the boondocks and living there in a cabin.  Check out the youtube vids of people doing that.  My wife and I lived in a VW bus for 3 months on the road.  It was amazing for about a month and a half and then you start to feel like a deadbeat.  I met a guy who was living in a trailer he was towing with his pickup and had been doing it for 5 years straight living on federal land where you can camp for 2 weeks for free.  But he was lonely as hell and open about it.  He said he spent about $300/month and was able to save all of his social security but he longed to be part of a community, coach little league or something.  But that lifestyle also costs a lot of money.  Just respect the people that are grabbing it by the horns and are invested 110%.  If you stay out of debt and invest, the math says you will become a millionaire.  All first gen millionaires had a decent income and invested heavily in say a target retirement mutual fund or something and looked up 15 years later and had 1.5 million sitting in there.  At that point you don&#39;t have to work anymore, but many find that they feel a responsibility to actually work harder.  Look at Trump, the guy is president because he feels a duty to his country.  Sure the fanfare might be nice, but he is working harder than he ever has in his life because his foundation was great enough to allow him to pursue higher responsibilities.  It&#39;s a Free World my friend, but you may find the common trends are there because they are worth it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It didn&#39;t have to be this way. :( Anyone <em>still</em> espousing the Hamiltonian economic system ought to be strung up.</p>

<p>“I am not among those who fear the people. They, and not the rich, are our dependence for continued freedom. And to preserve their independence, we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude. If we run into such debts, as that we must be taxed in our meat and in our drink, in our necessaries and our comforts, in our labors and our amusements, for our callings and our creeds, as the people of England are, <strong>our people, like them, must come to labor sixteen hours in the twenty-four, give the earnings of fifteen of these to the government for their debts and daily expenses; and the sixteenth being insufficient to afford us bread, we must live, as they now do, on oatmeal and potatoes; have no time to think, no means of calling the mismanagers to account; but be glad to obtain subsistence by hiring ourselves to rivet their chains on the necks of our fellow-sufferers.</strong> Our landholders, too, like theirs, retaining indeed the title and stewardship of estates called theirs, but held really in trust for the treasury, must wander, like theirs, in foreign countries, and be contented with penury, obscurity, exile, and the glory of the nation. This example reads to us the salutary lesson, that private fortunes are destroyed by public as well as by private extravagance.</p>

<p>“And this is the tendency of all human governments. A departure from principle in one instance becomes a precedent for a second; that second for a third; and so on, till the bulk of the society is reduced to be mere automatons of misery, and to have no sensibilities left but for sinning and suffering. Then begins, indeed, the bellum omnium in omnia, which some philosophers observing to be so general in this world, have mistaken it for the natural, instead of the abusive state of man. And the fore horse of this frightful team is public debt. Taxation follows that, and in its train wretchedness and oppression.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Soon the world is going to change and people are going to have to make a choice, are you going to be of service to yourself or are you going to be of service to others? Technology is advancing at a rate where most if not all people are going to be out of a job and we have to start paying people a living wage or let them starve and die. 
The people in power are not going give us anything for free, they are 100% self-serving sociopath&#39;s, they rather let you die than give a penny of their wealth away. Wealth so big that nobody would have to starve or need anything in their day-to-day lives. That is how much money and resources there is hidden from us. 
Money makes certain things easier, but it can&#39;t buy happiness and make you grow as a person. But not having to work day and night will. And when humanity the time to stop and think, they will see the system of slavery we live in.</p>

<p>Humanity has been brainwashed and had our past taken away from us, and divided us with religion, colour and so many things. My hope is that as we technology progresses and we have to work less, and people have some more time to get to know themselves, that they will realize that we are all one.</p>

<p>That would have been a good supporting point of your argument, maybe someone else has more luck finding that.</p>

<p>But aside from that, I&#39;ve been incredibly annoybed by people who are always in a &quot;I don&#39;t have time&quot; frenzy. It&#39;s ridiculous. They act as if they had stress, but it&#39;s always self-inflicted (things like sport classes). That&#39;s not stress, that is voluntary. And the worst are those who feel proud because they &quot;don&#39;t have time&quot;. As if their life was so important. What a load of bullshit.</p>

<p>Good for you that you see through all of this social engineering bullshit. We humans were not made to work all day. Just look at animals, they don&#39;t do anything most of the day unless they care for their babies. It&#39;s just not natural.</p>

<p>There needs to be a far greater emphasis on vocations and alternative career paths in high schools, particularly since the happiest people I know are those who graduated high school, learned a trade, and are now making good money and are debt free. I have many, many more friends with advanced degrees and &quot;great&quot; educations and they all work ridiculous hours, are grievously underpaid, don&#39;t enjoy life, and have little to no hope of every truly being happy/free. </p>

<p>I&#39;m confused by your last sentence. We have ongoing displacement of wealth toward the American aristocracy, as well as a centralized  national government that strives to decrease state sovereignty at every opportunity. Not to mention the Fed. How does modern America differ from Hamilton&#39;s vision?</p>
