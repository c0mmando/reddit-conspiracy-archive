    <div class="md"><p>But people like this always fail in the end because ultimately they are not loyal to anybody but themselves. Ultimately they will throw each other under the bus to protect themselves or if they think it will benefit them in some way. It&#39;s not true loyalty, it&#39;s more &#39;scratch my back I&#39;ll scratch yours&#39; type stuff, or &#39;I think if I hitch myself to your ride I&#39;ll get to go to some snazzy places&#39; type stuff. </p>

<p>So I think it&#39;s entirely possible that, for whatever reason, Brazile decided it made more sense for her to come out with this stuff against Clinton in order to protect herself somehow. I don&#39;t see how her admitting all this would bring back Sanders supporters unless the plan was to completely clean out the Democratic party. Why would Clinton agree to having her reputation trashed by someone that people can&#39;t claim is an alt right &#39;conspiratard&#39;? For the good of the Democratic Party? You&#39;ve got to be kidding. The woman is a sociopath, there&#39;s no way she&#39;d agree to having suspicion cast on her by a legitimate high level DNC insider for the MURDER/solicitation of a murder of a young idealistic staffer, not for anything, and especially not for the good of anyone or anything that wasn&#39;t her. And there is no way that, even if Brazile&#39;s admissions did bring back Bernie supporters to the Democrats, it would benefit Clinton at all - it means that she&#39;s toast in the party. So I can&#39;t see that being the reason at all.</p>

<p>She&#39;s not really trashed HRC. So far, she&#39;s hung most everything on Hillary&#39;s staff. And she&#39;s nearly completely walked that back today, you know. Plus, her book&#39;s release date has been pushed back.</p>

<p>Donna has never said she thought HRC was responsible for Seth&#39;s death. And she never will. I guarantee you that if she&#39;s pushed she will say she&#39;d heard rumors and didn&#39;t know what to think. She may even say she wary of angry Sanders supporters.</p>

<p>Hillary would agree if she believed that whatever Donna said would come out eventually anyway. That&#39;s one reason, and it&#39;s good enough. There&#39;s a whole different reason, too, but I doubt many people will understand so I&#39;m not going to get into it. Suffice it to say that negative publicity does not bother the Clintons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. No fucking way she helped Seth. The more she runs her mouth the more I think she&#39;s part of a limited hang out to, as you said, lure back disgruntled Bernie bros, and more importantly, to solidify the, &quot;yes, Russia did hack the DNC&quot; narrative. Because frankly, that&#39;s the most important lie left to protect. If that lie falls it takes Obama and the intelligence communities down with it.</p>

<p>Brazile is shady as fuck. She knew that Seth was the leaker, and knew that the Russia hack was BS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I&#39;m considering Brazille is being tasked with pulling an <em>Alex Jones</em>. Dedicating the book to Rich is way too much of a weird detail from someone that so far has proven to be an asset for the Clinton machine. </p>

<p>One could argue is her insurance so she doesn&#39;t end up in The List, and as the Democrat Party seems eager to get rid of Hillary, this could be feasible... but still this stinks. She might end up as another useful wacko spouting wild claims so MSM can dismiss her and her points easily.</p>

<p>You mean that she&#39;s a limited hangout? She IS continuing the absurd push that Russia was behind this stuff while simultaneously admitting to the DNC laundering money for the Clinton campaign. Could be a reasonable guess, but I wonder why she&#39;d be instructed to reveal that money laundering scheme when it&#39;s been known about since it was happening and no one ever paid much attention to it. Even the DNC Fraud lawsuit was being built chiefly on the information in leaked documents without regard for the reports about the Hillary Victory Fund being used to launder money. </p>
