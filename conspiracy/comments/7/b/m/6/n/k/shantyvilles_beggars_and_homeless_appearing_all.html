I explore all over and have found at least a dozen hobo shelters deep in the woods... but I&#39;ve only seen a couple of fresh ones this year. I&#39;d guess there significantly less homeless now than there was 3 years ago... but still no whores. You got too many whore? Send me some whores. </p>

<p>Now we spend $60,000/yr to house inmates, many of whom are mentally ill and wouldn&#39;t have ever been a problem had they received treatment. This is probably the main reason behind both homelessness and overincarceration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have. I wish we could just provide easy to access tiny apartments for the homeless. There are social services available now, sure. But many of these homeless are not mentally sound enough to wade through the bureaucracy successfully. I would gladly pay more taxes if it meant these people had a place to go. Every time a tent city springs up the police go in and clear it out, and all the pigs pat themselves on the back for &quot;solving&quot; the problem. Nothing is solved, they just kicked the can down the road. At least with everyone in the same place we could build infrastructure to manage the other public safety issues presented by the homelss problem. By scattering them every few months we are just exposing more of the city to the problems.</p>

<p>What is up with the insane idea that homelessness is going to fix itself some day?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We got a Shanty town here on the Santa Ana river by Angel Stadium in Anaheim, Ca. Seems that a lot of the people there refuse services and shelters for them for whatever reason. I&#39;ve also known a number of them that are in their 30&#39;s or younger but don&#39;t just get jobs. My ex coworker became homeless after we got laid off from our last job. He eventually found a new job but had to still sleep in the streets and panhandle for the first 2 weeks until he got his first paycheck. I guess some just prefer that lifestyle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats the end goal and thats how they are able to sell it to liberals. </p>

<p>&quot;We can all live as first world citizens with tech jobs, plenty of food, plenty of houses and plenty of cars and products for you to buy. Come live here!&quot;</p>

<p>The end result is everybody living as second and third world citizens because there aren&#39;t enough resources to go around and the elites control every thing you can possibly buy. Cant wait for the liberal utopia!</p>
