<p>i listed some of them below</p>

                     23.12.2014    4.099.506  &amp;lt;- 1 year later the video has 4k less views?????
                     09.08.2015    4.703.277
                     01.12.2015    5.001.399  
                     06.12.2015    5.116.074       115.000 views in 5 days that would be 690k views in one month and 25k in one day

<p>So on the few days all views counted the video got 25k/day that would be 9mio. views in 1 year. But the video only got 980k in the last 2 years. So even worst case scenario the video has 20mio+ real views.</p>

<p>This is the text in English: </p>

<p>*Title: Fuck the World</p>

<p>I try to feel comfortable here, in a country where the atmosphere is cold.
If you have money you are important, all people are money grabbing.
Nobody cares about other people. Unfair destribution of money and power.
The sun (sun = hope) is rarely seen. Without sun no life.
Suppression over thousend of years left many scarfes.
People enslave others as they always did, in history very obvious today hidden and in secret.
The Media is brainwashing all of us.
Materialism and Fashism get promoted.
Today there is a black president of the USA, but he would not have succeeded if they (lobbyists and co.)
would not have paid for it. He has to do what they want or they kill him as they did before (kennedy).
All what they want is capital and power.
Soilders set whole villages on fire, how is that justice?! What is wrong in this world?
I cant see the difference between left and right anymore. Protestors become tired because nothing does change.
We have to work, but only the rich ones profit, they can do what they want because they got money and power.</p>

<p>Refrain: 
They want to keep us calm with medicaments
They make us to string-puppets
They act inhuman
They keep us in chains
Fuck the world Fuck the world.
They want to keep us calm with medicaments
They make us to string-puppets
They act inhuman
They keep us in chains
Fuck the world Fuck the world.</p>

<p>I dont know what the Future will bring us,
I just know that the young people (like him) do drugs to drug themself and nobody helps them.
They stand outside in the cold rain and wait for the day while the rich people continue to
exploit the third world. They killed thousands of people for power ans some money.
They cant be intelligant because they dont notice what they are doing.
Their children will pay for their crime. They will die to cancer or to drugs.
Nobody can escape destiny.</p>

<p>Refrain
Refrain</p>

<p>I dont know if just talking will help, they are too powerfull.
They spread fear and propaganda so nobody resists.
They give most of us food and a bed, just basic needs to keep us quiet.
Idols who revolted got killed, take a look in history.
They keep the strings and they will never let them go.
Lobbyists, politicans, cokeheads. Western world&#39;s power is made of Supresseion and Pain!
Religions are fake, the fight against terrorism is fake, war is fake.
The USA decides who is good and the rest of the world dies in its own blood.*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Germany is still &quot;occupied&quot; by over 50,000 American troops on 36 bases spread around the country, down from the 90,000 that were present right after WWII ended but still there all the same ever since. </p>

<p>You might want to think about that and the effect it has on the German psyche and young people in Germany in particular at this point. </p>

<p>The US military never leaves anywhere it goes. It builds permanent bases and mans them indefinitely. In fact it&#39;s actually a multi-billion dollar industry for a few select companies that have no competition with everything that goes into those bases having to come from the US thanks to a law that was passed to spend a whole lot of extra and unnecessary tax-dollars that way and create that industry. </p>

<p>Nothing is sourced locally. Not a bag of cement, or a stick of furniture, and that goes for everything on the entire base no matter where it is. </p>

<p>Outside of off-duty personnel spending time in the neighbouring cities and towns they don&#39;t contribute anything to the local economy around them. </p>
