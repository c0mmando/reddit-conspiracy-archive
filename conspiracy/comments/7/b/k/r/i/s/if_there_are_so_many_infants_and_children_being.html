<p>Please think about this question. Most of us here by now are aware of a pedophile ring at the highest levels of power. Some (like me) believe that it is more extensive and rife than just government and Hollywood, and that children as young as infants are used in these rituals and sacrifices. </p>

<p>Whatever you believe, you have to realize that not many of these children are going to make it to adulthood. Especially the extremely abused ones (like the video supposed to be of John Podesta taunting a young child behind a screen). They aren&#39;t going to be let into society. I doubt even MKUltra can disguise those are are extremely abused. </p>

<p>This leads to the question: what happens to the children? They die. The exploiters kill them when they are done with their prey. </p>

<p>So why are there no bodies? Because the elite use acid to dissolve the bodies. Literally dissolving them and then pouring it into the sewers. The acid destroys the evidence, and (as an added mockery to us common humans) the dead children become part of the public sewage treatment. </p>

<p>A year ago when Pizzagate was in full flight on this subreddit, it was discovered by some users that one of the neighbouring buildings near EITHER Comet Pizza or Besta Pizza (can&#39;t remember which) was a chemical factory/lab for industries. And one of the products they produce: hydrochloric acid. Oddly enough, I can&#39;t find any trace if the posts that I am referring to. </p>

<p>I made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5hwri5/how_they_dispose_of_the_bodies_at_comet_pizza/">this post</a>  almost a year ago and nobody cared. It got downvoted so that it had zero coverage. Please upvote this post so that more people see it. We need locals to investigate the areas around Besta and Comet to verify and find the chemical factory. There won&#39;t be any evidence on Google Maps as it would have been wiped. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A) Yes, but eventually they grow up. They don&#39;t become children anymore - therefore they&#39;re useless to the predators. I would also imagine that the constant abuse, sleep and sensory deprivation and whatever other ghasty torture the children endure would have some effect over time on their physical appearance, and make them undesirable to new clients. </p>

<p>B) There can only be so many islands and cells to store them all. This thing is at epidemic levels. It&#39;s not just hundreds, it&#39;s thousands if not millions of children. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>During a one-year period in the U.S., 16% of youth ages 14 to 17 had been sexually victimized;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are somewhere around 14 million children in that age group at any given time, which mean about 2.5 million of those in that group have been subject to some kind of sexual abuse. So, yes, when you look at all forms of sexual abuse, you are talking about <em>tens of millions</em> of people in the US population. </p>

<p>From my own anecdotal experience, the number of women I have spoke with that admit to being sexually abused in their pre-adult years <em>blows my mind</em>. It is way too many. The sickness is endemic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re mostly right on.</p>

<p>The other part of it that hasn&#39;t been considered is what to do with their bodies.</p>

<p>If you have a pedo island, body disposal is trivial. Either dismember them and feed them to the sharks, or incinerate, or dissolve in acid, etc.  Requires a small amount of infrastructure that would not be difficult.</p>

<p>I think, however, there is more depth to it than that.</p>

<p>You sort them.  The really good ones go to the elite for sexual exploitation.  They are the real prize.  The medium ones go into sex trafficking and are traded and bought and sold.  They are the &quot;icing on the cake&quot; when you have, for example, a major arms deal.  Here, take these two dozen for your amusement.</p>

<p>Then you have the ones on the bottom. Either they are diseased, or they are ugly, or maybe you are racist and they have the wrong skin color. They are undesirable from a sexual exploitation standpoint.  But there are a lot of them. Maybe they are too old. Maybe they are worn out.  Maybe they had drug problems or mental problems.</p>

<p>They can easily be killed, but that&#39;s wasting a resource.</p>

<p>You have organ transplants. You have cannibalism. You have human sacrifice to Moloch. You have the ability to rope other elites into this behavior and blackmail them forever.</p>

<p>The organ transplantation thing goes down a deep rabbit hole. From blood transfusions to bone marrow to stem cell donors, to literally taking them apart and using everything from the eyeballs to the skin.  Imagine if they have the technology to use nerve tissue.  Old people tend to suffer from degenerative diseases, from dementia to palsy to Alzheimer&#39;s to MS. Even things like diabetic neuropathy.  Imagine if they know how to transplant nervous tissue into your brain or spine or limbs.  I&#39;d be willing to bet that they could either do it with actual nervous tissue (brains, spinal columns, regular nerves, etc) or with stem cell injections.</p>

<p>Then what happens if you are an elderly elite with an alcohol problem? Need a liver or a kidney or maybe a lung? It&#39;s easy to find a matching donor. I&#39;d be willing to bet that someone has a database of matching blood and tissue types.  The rest of human society suffers from a lack of organ donors. I&#39;d be willing to bet that the elites do not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Joe Rogan JUST had a mushroom guy on his podcast yesterday, there was even a post about it in this forum because there was this super bizarre moment where the guest refused to answer Joe&#39;s seemingly inocuous question about portabello mushrooms, claiming his life would be in danger if he talked about them publiclly. (It&#39;s towards the very end, like 1:49 I think, and it&#39;s worth watching even though it sounds silly.) I&#39;m on mobile so I can&#39;t link but thought it might be a decent place to start. I also have had depression for almost my entire life. I&#39;ve made peace with it and try to harness the good parts of it, because i know it&#39;s not going away soon. I suggest DBT therapy, less electronics especially TV, better diet, and avoiding the pharmaceutical antidepressants, if possible. (Easier said that done with all of those, of course.) Good luck, friend!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know just how you feel. </p>

<p>I remember the first time I ever felt like that, it was in the 1980&#39;s when I discovered that Dracula was not a fictional character, he is a fictionalized version of Vlad the Impaler. That guy was seriously horrible, like Dick Cheney or even worse. Torture is an intrinsic part of the European culture for some of these people. </p>

<p>I find that reality to be horribly shocking every time I encounter it, the next time was when we visited Spain. Then again when I studied American history from the Native American perspective. The whole thing inspired me to develop a plan to beat them. That happened when they reelected GW Bush as he was being sold to the public as a return of Jesus. </p>

<p>I am a Girl Scout leader who has had lots of experience organizing a lot of big events, so I know how to do it. So I figured if the Republicans were going to be able sell a mass murderer as the return of Jesus, then I could be a better Jesus than he could. I guess I have a bit of a competitive streak. </p>

<p>So I put together a political action plan to end war globally. After all, isn&#39;t that what Jesus would do if he returned? I thought so. It is a three part plan incorporating a global political revolution for equal rights, a spiritual revolution and a lot of legal cases [lawfare]. That was back in 2003. We have had a LOT of successes since then the latests being the #metoo explosion. I think my plan is working. </p>

<p>Anyway, I just wanted to try to cheer you up. I find having some hope really helps. It is also nice to see that these is some positive direction in all of this madness. The recent #metoo thing has been awesome as is the BDS movement. Good luck. We are all in this together. :-)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The #metoo campaign came about on social media in response to the Harvey Weinstein abuse scandal. Women would post #metoo to say &quot;I too have been abused/assaulted/received unwanting sexual advances. Frankly, I think the #metoo only caused damage to our pursuit of truth. What it did was drag attention away from elite pedophilia and turned it into a self-professed victimhood where girls would say they also have felt unsafe because of men&#39;s actions towards them. All it did was take the spotlight off Hollywood and bolster this idea that all men are sexually deviant and aggressive. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was a calculated leftist move, the old divert and deflect.</p>

<p>Onto the original reason for the thread. I would not be surprised if there a D.U.M.B (deep underground military bases) full of sex slaves. Children and women (which they call breeders). The amount of children who go missing a year in America is astonishing. The global currency is not the dollar or the pound or the yen. The true global currency is human flesh, particularly young children. </p>

<p>The human trafficking/satanic elite pedophilia/human sacrifice rabbit hole was the darkest and most horrifying one I went down. Glad I came back up tbh. But I also think its arguably the most important rabbit hole.</p>

<p>Please try to see the whole evil system is falling apart, it is all comming out in the open now and the people responsible are actally the scared ones now. It is not long now until the world becomes a better place.</p>

<p>Until then it could benefit you a lot if you stepped back from the conspiracies and msm for a while and try to connect with nature again. Also try to zoom out a bit and try to find your personal connection to this world and how it influences every level of your life.</p>

<p>There are only 2 powers at play in this world; Love and fear, if you understand this you will be able to see the world and reality as it realy is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>just FYI cuz so many of ya&#39;ll seem to get confused about this: when  &quot;human trafficking&quot; is said in reference to pickton, they are not talking about people or children being grabbed off the streets then bound &amp; held against their will, being sold like material goods to rich people as slaves, etc. ala what pizzagaters think when they hear &quot;human trafficking&quot;.... <em>this</em> &quot;human trafficking&quot; - in reference to pickton, red&amp;white involvement, etc - is literally your everyday prostitution... think backpage and the like, women selling sex, men paying by the hour, that type of thing... which has nothing to do with PG.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The concrete pad was covering an exhaust vent for an underground complex so as to be invisible to aerial surveillance. Think about it. Concrete is porous and breathes. Get a small exhaust vent, cover in gravel, then dirt, then concrete and you’ve got an invisible exhaust from the air.  Explains the dirt feeling warmer and damper than usual (poster said he found this after drilling underneath)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think OP has ignored the actual data that is compiled out there... Over 16% of the US population (when measuring all adults) admitted to being sexually abused between the age of 12 and 17. The vast majority being women. That is already 52,000,000 individuals reporting sexual abuse. While the vast majority of that is from close family members like Uncle Touchy, that still leaves the possibility of millions of cases by ritualistic abuse groups. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in one of the &quot;sanctuary&quot; cities (other states are shipping mentally ill / homeless to us). Just give them a one-way bus ticket and a sandwich, and away they go.</p>

<p>The explosion of homeless people here has been unreal.</p>

<p>Most are mentally ill or otherwise unable to integrate into society. Most are drug addicts. You would not want to be around almost all of them.  A huge number of them are younger, but I&#39;m not seeing a lot of children.  Late teens and twenties, yes.  I think there are a few more resources available to keep actual children off the streets. Foster care, state run programs, etc.</p>

<p>I wonder if this explosion of people relates to the rapid widening of these pizzagate related activities. If you look at the sheer numbers compared to, say, 20 years ago, they are astounding.  Literal streets where you can&#39;t walk down the sidewalk because they are covered in tents and shopping carts and shantytowns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be the first to say this answer sounds crazy, but they are MANY people who believe this, including high level ex MILAB people and secret space program whistle blowers, IF you believe that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Supposedly, in 1954 there was a treaty signed with extra terrestrials known as the Grenada Treaty, there was also another Treaty known as the Green Emerald Covenant. These treaties were signed with a race known as the Draco, a reptilian race. Supposedly these treaties were signed via secret societies such as the Vril and Thule societies. Suppoosedly these Draco reptilians have had liasons with a race known as the Nordics and both the Draco and the Nazis worked in conjunction with them. One of the stipulations of the treaty was human trafficking and abduction, including child trafficking. </p>

<p>Supposedly this type of interaction has gone on in similar fashion for thousands of years, even back to the days of Inca and Maya where there would be tens of thousands of humans sacrificed to the &quot;dragon&quot; Gods in a single afternoon. </p>

<p>Of course this could all be bullshit. However, every almost every single culture talks of a dragon race. I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t claim to know. But plenty of people believe it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This aspect of the human trafficking/ritual abuse rings is one that is crucial to it&#39;s understanding and also one that TPTB have purposely obscured from public comprehension. When victims CAN get help (which is rarely) and their programming addressed, they become whistleblowers.</p>

<p>&quot;Dissociative identity disorder is increasingly understood as a complex and chronic posttraumatic psychopathology closely related to severe, particularly early, child abuse...&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/916186-overview">https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/916186-overview</a></p>

<p>&quot;...Torture-based mind control programming can be defined as systematic torture that blocks the victim’s capacity for conscious processing (through pain, terror, drugs, illusion, sensory deprivation, sensory over-stimulation, oxygen deprivation, cold, heat, spinning, brain stimulation, and often, near-death), and then employs suggestion and/or conditioning to implant thoughts, directives, and perceptions in the unconscious mind, often in newly-formed trauma-induced dissociated identities, that force the victim to do, feel, think, or perceive things for the purposes of the programmer. The objective is for the victim to follow directives with no conscious awareness, including execution of acts in clear violation of the victim’s volition, moral principles, and spiritual convictions...&quot;</p>

<p>A bunch of people LARPing about how best to dispose of the bodies of sexually abused children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This leads to the question: what happens to the children? They die. The exploiters kill them when they are done with their prey.</p>

<p>So why are there no bodies? Because the elite use acid to dissolve the bodies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Even if I was just all one giant coincidence, (I don’t think it is, even if I didn’t know all of this stuff, the Podestas just give off a creepy, rapey, vibe) you’d think it would warrant an investigation of sorts. Just that video alone would probably garner an investigation if your local child protective services saw it. But they really are avoiding this stuff like the plague. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will apologise for the macabre nature of what I&#39;m about to add up front, but in going the distance when it comes to the kind of completely unscrupulous, depraved and murderous creatures one must consider the kind of methods they might actually use to get away with their crimes.</p>

<p>Now where do most &quot;dead pets&quot; and road-kill wind-up? </p>

<p>There are &quot;rendering companies&quot; all over the country that turn those dead bodies, as well as the ones from dead farm animals and road-kill into various other products like blood and bone meal for chicken and other animal feeds, etc. </p>

<p>It was the use of dead cows, for instance, going back into what was sold as cheap cattle-feed which turned out to be the source of &quot;Mad Cow&quot; disease as some of you may remember.</p>

<p>There was also another major scandal that arose over people&#39;s pet dogs becoming immune to the drug that vet&#39;s commonly use to euthanize sick and dying ones because some of the rendering companies that collect the dead bodies from vets had been processing and selling the meat off those as well as from dead farm animals and road-kill back to dog-food manufacturers. </p>

<p>The result was that dogs that had routinely eaten the brands that contained those euthanized carcasses all gained and gradual built up an immunity to that drug.</p>

<p>So there is already a degree of unscrupulous money making associated with that which with any common sense being applied should never under any circumstances have occurred.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s not beyond the pale to suggest that pedophiles involved in that business or individuals in them being paid to dispose of a few other bodies once in a while would be quite capable of getting rid of them without leaving any traces of it behind. </p>

<p>There are also the somewhat sickening reports of human DNA being discovered in ground and processed meats that humans consume that has never been adequately been explained but if cows can unknowing be eating their own kind and dogs can unknowingly be eating their own kind without anyone being generally being aware of it I think we too have to face the possibility that it could be done to us as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how old you are but I&#39;m nearly 70 and companies that did nothing but rendering and re-selling decomposing and diseased animal carcasses for any purpose simply didn&#39;t exist when I was a young man. </p>

<p>Virtually all meat-based pet and animal feeds came from the same big meat packing houses with most dog and cat foods carrying the same seal of having had it&#39;s contents being government inspected and approved as anything else that came from those same meat packers for humans. </p>

<p>Not that you&#39;d want to, but you could in fact eat it without any fear of getting sick from anything that was in it. </p>

<p>Those packing houses were also the primary sources of blood and bone meal which is where anything unfit for humans or pets actually wound up and they were also the primary and cheapest source for hides to be tanned into leather and as I said the most common way of disposing of any other animal carcasses was to incinerate them due to the biological hazard inherent in their decomposition that was already underway.</p>

<p>Now you may think this is funny but I can assure you isn&#39;t and there was no incidence of any Mad Cow disease prior to those rendering companies arriving on the scene and offering a cheaper form of cattle feed they produced and that included the dead and diseased carcasses of other cattle that led to that serious outbreak and major health hazard. </p>

<p>Not funny, either, what happened to pet dogs due to those same rendering companies approaching dog food manufacturers with a cheaper source of unspecified meat than the leftover beef and chicken scraps they routinely bought in bulk from the meat packing houses that were from animals that had had all been inspected, approved, and freshly killed.</p>

<p>Now all of that had been covered by very stringent regulations and regular inspections by authorities outside of those industries to ensure public health and safety. Regulations that have since been removed or else given way to allowing and depending on the meat packing industry itself to do it&#39;s own inspections which has led to the very large and increasingly frequent E-coli outbreaks that virtually unheard of in the past.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They live normal lives, some to tell their stories, but not entirely due to the fact that these men are powerful individuals who are able to silence individuals that come out and speak about the atrocities of their &quot;gentlemens clubs&quot;. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLp5LM18wIU&amp;amp;t=3m18s">Here is an example of such a person that stands up, but doesn&#39;t list names because these people can silence individuals. She speaks about &quot;politicians&quot; people in power.</a></p>

<p>Also, who would believe such a story ? And who would do anything about it? Also if someone did do something, how would they go about doing it? If they went the legal route they would need irrefutable evidence, multiple witnesses, and a fuck-ton of money because the opposition would do anything and everything they could and they already have that power/money/public eye. If they went the &quot;immoral&quot; route, they would need a plan, and I&#39;m sure that they would be too scared to try and plan something on someone such as these men. They are a group. One falls, they all fall, so if someone slips, they are left to the sharks(public).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh baloney. Some kids don&#39;t make it, and a lot of kids have very very troubled adulthoods due to the impact of the trauma, but most of us survive and we live among you. Many of us have written memoirs and accounts of the horrors we survived. We have support organizations, we have conferences. There are organizations for the therapists who work with us and they produce their own peer reviewed journal. You could interview us and get a list of perp names and be able to map out the high level networks, but nobody does this. Stop sensationalizing what happened to us, get off the internet and do something productive on the ground.</p>

What if those who survived were used to have more children that could grow up in this mess, never seeing the light of day, and never having a paper trail.

    <div class="md"><p>Part of my post is to keep this topic in people&#39;s minds. By now most of this sub is aware of Pizzagate and of those, most are believers. It&#39;s one thing to believe that thousands of children are serially abused and raped by the elite. But the conclusion to this - the end of all these thousands of lives - is largely ignored or forgotten here. I want this to stay fresh in people&#39;s minds the next time they think about Pizzagate. And I want to trigger their sympathy and even elicit unpleasant emotions in them like sickness and disgust at the thought of what happens to these poor children. I just hope that the more upset people are by Pizzagate, the more traction and importance it will gain. Because I don&#39;t think people are thinking about that now; they are too distracted by the (moderate) Hollywood scandals and not thinking of the big picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it certainly gives a new perspective on all this &quot;making risotto&quot; stuff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Friday evening, WikiLeaks replied to Podesta&#39;s tweets with one of its own. &quot;Yes, we get it. The elite eat better than the peasants they abuse,&quot; the official account wrote.</p>

<p>In a leaked 2015 email that went viral on social media, Podesta answered a question from former Clinton Health Access Initiative employee Peter Huffman about cooking risotto.</p>

<p>“Question: why do I use a 1/4 or 1/2 a cup of stock at a time? Why can’t you just add 1 or 2 cups of stock at a time b/c the arborio rice will eventually absorb it anyway, right?” asked Huffman.</p>

<p>“Yes it with absorb the liquid, but no that’s not what you want to do. The slower add process and stirring causes the rice to give up it’s [sic] starch which gives the risotto it’s [sic] creamy consistency. You won’t get that if you dump all that liquid at once,” Podesta replied.</p>

I think this shit is way common, im a 27 year old male , i was molested when i was younger, thats not what chews me up at night, no, its the fact that so many friends, family and acquaintances have confessed the same and basically , i got it easy compared to the horrible abuse stories ithey went through.</p>

<p>It sounds um, polarizing and a vitriolic thing to say this, but at this point im askin myself who wasn&#39;t molested as a kid in this sick society. Im aboriginal but most of everyone i ever knew or intimated myself with isn&#39;t aboriginal and still, judges, teachers, policepersons , poor, white it don&#39;t matter - all have intimated the same thing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of the children (bleh, it sucks to write this thought) are born within the network and undocumented. For example, there was a pedo ring that was busted in Norway and one of the leaders got his girlfriend pregnant solely to abuse his newborn. <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/norway-paedophile-ring-police-arrest-51-men-a7432441.html">link</a></p>

<p>Now, that&#39;s not to say that this particular infant wouldn&#39;t have had proper documents, but think of how many children WORLDWIDE are born and no one knows. Now think of an entire network of people working together to keep things as discreet as possible. If I had to guess, aside from the hundreds of thousands that are kidnapped, there are so many more that are purposely brought into the world just to be abused. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The #metoo campaign came about on social media in response to the Harvey Weinstein abuse scandal. Women would post #metoo to say &quot;I too have been abused/assaulted/received unwanting sexual advances. Frankly, I think the #metoo only caused damage to our pursuit of truth. What it did was drag attention away from elite pedophilia and turned it into a self-professed victimhood where girls would say they also have felt unsafe because of men&#39;s actions towards them. All it did was take the spotlight off Hollywood and bolster this idea that all men are sexually deviant and aggressive. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it was a calculated leftist move, the old divert and deflect.</p>

<p>Onto the original reason for the thread. I would not be surprised if there a D.U.M.B (deep underground military bases) full of sex slaves. Children and women (which they call breeders). The amount of children who go missing a year in America is astonishing. The global currency is not the dollar or the pound or the yen. The true global currency is human flesh, particularly young children. </p>

<p>The human trafficking/satanic elite pedophilia/human sacrifice rabbit hole was the darkest and most horrifying one I went down. Glad I came back up tbh. But I also think its arguably the most important rabbit hole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>just FYI cuz so many of ya&#39;ll seem to get confused about this: when  &quot;human trafficking&quot; is said in reference to pickton, they are not talking about people or children being grabbed off the streets then bound &amp; held against their will, being sold like material goods to rich people as slaves, etc. ala what pizzagaters think when they hear &quot;human trafficking&quot;.... <em>this</em> &quot;human trafficking&quot; - in reference to pickton, red&amp;white involvement, etc - is literally your everyday prostitution... think backpage and the like, women selling sex, men paying by the hour, that type of thing... which has nothing to do with PG.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This aspect of the human trafficking/ritual abuse rings is one that is crucial to it&#39;s understanding and also one that TPTB have purposely obscured from public comprehension. When victims CAN get help (which is rarely) and their programming addressed, they become whistleblowers.</p>

<p>&quot;Dissociative identity disorder is increasingly understood as a complex and chronic posttraumatic psychopathology closely related to severe, particularly early, child abuse...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Torture-based mind control programming can be defined as systematic torture that blocks the victim’s capacity for conscious processing (through pain, terror, drugs, illusion, sensory deprivation, sensory over-stimulation, oxygen deprivation, cold, heat, spinning, brain stimulation, and often, near-death), and then employs suggestion and/or conditioning to implant thoughts, directives, and perceptions in the unconscious mind, often in newly-formed trauma-induced dissociated identities, that force the victim to do, feel, think, or perceive things for the purposes of the programmer. The objective is for the victim to follow directives with no conscious awareness, including execution of acts in clear violation of the victim’s volition, moral principles, and spiritual convictions...&quot;</p>
