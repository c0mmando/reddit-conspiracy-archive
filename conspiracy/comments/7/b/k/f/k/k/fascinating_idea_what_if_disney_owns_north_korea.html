        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>.... what if, apart from a consistent money maker, that NK is a place that is a hold out for the bad actors like the illuminati, so if all goes tits up, they all fly here, because they own it, and protect themselves with nukes, because of a huge disclosure to the world public. I mean if I had 300 trillion that is rumored to be the Rothchild&#39;s wealth, I certainly would be thinking of a place to hold up if world powers gang up and threatens my survival. Not only are they nuts but they are first and foremost bankers, so thinking like they do, they try and limit risk to protect themselves. </p>

<p><strong>Got the idea from lightflex, thanks man, and also from Q Anon in his reference to NK:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to reports first published in Japanese newspapers, he went to school in Switzerland near Bern. First reports claimed he attended the private English-language International School in GÃ¼mligen under the name &quot;Chol-pak&quot; or &quot;Pak-chol&quot; from 1993 to 1998.[19] He was described as shy, a good student who got along well with his classmates and was a basketball fan.[20] He was chaperoned by an older student, who was thought to be his bodyguard ...</p>

<p><strong>MK Ultra does exist, and does work, CIA has been sued before and it is well documented:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The revelations about the CIA and the Army prompted a number of subjects or their survivors to file lawsuits against the federal government for conducting experiments without informed consent. Although the government aggressively, and sometimes successfully, sought to avoid legal liability, several plaintiffs did receive compensation through court order, out-of-court settlement, or acts of Congress. Frank Olson&#39;s family received $750,000 by a special act of Congress, and both President Ford and CIA director William Colby met with Olson&#39;s family to apologize publicly.</p>

<p><strong>Can&#39;t find a nice chart but you get the idea. Military stock price goes through the roof when there is news of a conflict in NK. A FACT. What if NK is there to create fear for an UNENDING SUPPLY OF FREE MONEY by instigating fear through the public. Has been done before:</strong></p>

<p>Now, what I don&#39;t get is if NK really is Disney, or that the Illuminati controls it, what is China&#39;s role in all of it because they have a deep long history with NK, so surely they would know and would not allow it? Then I remembered reading somewhere, that China Mao Tze Tung wrote a letter to the US and iirc, in it stated that China would work for the new world order if it was left alone. Together with this context then NK = Disney is plausible. </p>

<p>Edit: On 17 December 2011, Kim Jong-il died. Kim Jong Un was publicly declared Supreme Commander of the Korean People&#39;s Army on 24 December 2011 and formally appointed to the position on 30 December. <strong>I am guessing this is where TPOB fully took over NK from this point</strong> </p>

<p>Seriously though, if you wrote this up just right with a good balance of dark humor and bizarro world you could turn it into a script of some sort, it could make a good comic book.</p>

<p>Solid post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was into image when they first hit the scene in the mid 90&#39;s. I&#39;ve got the first run, first editions of a bunch of they&#39;re stuff.
