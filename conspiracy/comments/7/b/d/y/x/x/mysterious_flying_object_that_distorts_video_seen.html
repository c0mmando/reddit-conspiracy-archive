       Yup. They saw a shadow on the roof while reviewing surveillance footage, and had to go through base security to get access to the roof.

       Maybe neither lying nor mistaken. Their official explanation may simply have been that with the highest confidence given the lack of evidence for alternative causes. You can't ever say "we don't know" in their position, so you're always saying "this is what seems most likely" to the public and investors.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's emphatically probable that SpaceX leadership is receptive to the idea of out-of-context interference in their work. I'm sure they investigated it if the film caught this object. But supplying evidence for the effects of a distant, high-velocity, possibly custom-made sabotage vehicle using a publicly-unknown propulsion method and an unknown (and again, possibly tailor-made to interfere with the rocket in a specific way) directed and possibly non-projectile weapon of sabotage... that would be incredibly hard unless you knew exactly what you were looking for in advance and could make sure you had the right sensors pointed in the right direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, if the object strafed by while targeting a fuel interface with a tight beam/pulse of microwaves or whatever, it would be practically undetectable even if you knew they were coming, and the only symptom would be sudden heating and ectopic ignition--there'd be no physical evidence in the wreckage to find.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if you knew for sure they were going to use a particular flavour of exotic propulsion which you could detect... this is a sneaking mission, so if I were in command of the vehicle I would reach a target velocity many kilometres away, maybe over the horizon, then cut propulsion and become fully ballistic during the flyby so there's nothing to detect.
      </p>
      <p>
       So considering it would be nearly impossible to be sure without intelligence sources they can't reveal, and that it would be politically unwise to start pointing fingers, and strategically stupid to reveal their suspicions even if they have them (because it would only make the next gremlin UFO that much harder to catch red-handed), and probably a bad business decision ("so, you know about antigrav... why are you guys fucking around with rockets again?"), and that it's really unlikely they could present proof anyway even if they were internally pretty sure about it... maybe in all that context, the "never before seen phenomenon" explanation really is the most honest and pragmatic answer, in a way. Hey, maybe it's code!

       The spacex video looks like a bird. They are next to the ocean. And that pad is on an air Force base. I think the base would know if there was something there that shouldn't.

       It's moving way too quickly to be a bird. You can get a sense of the speed when the video us running at normal time. When viewing the slow-mo shots, realize, it takes only fractions of a second for a fireball to expand. The object clears the screen in fractions of a second.

       Looking at the stills posted, the “distortion” is pretty clearly an artifact of video compression. When video is encoded using h.264 compression which is pretty much the standard, areas of the frame with low complexity such as the sky are saved in large blocks, whereas more complex areas like the foreground are saved in smaller blocks to preserve detail. The “distortion” around the black object is simply the compression block in that region of the frame.

       The thing about that laser weapon, when we're watching a highly compressed video at 24 or 30fps, it can smear the action of several frames. No idea what it could actually be unless it was shot in slo mo.

        When video is encoded using h.264 compression which is pretty much the standard, areas of the frame with low complexity such as the sky are saved in large blocks, whereas more complex areas like the foreground are saved in smaller blocks to preserve detail.

       Two nights ago in AZ I saw some really strange looking craft at about 11 pm. I tried to take a video of it with my S7 edge. I took a picture just fine but it's grainy and you can't see the akward movements. I tried to switch to the record setting to video it and when I did that the video would not record it at all. I could see it with my naked eye but it wouldn't show up on my phone's video. The resolution of the video went dark like everything went pitch black, but I could take a camera shot fine. It was weird af.

       Iphone does the same at night. The video is very high quality and the lens needs a lot more light. If I’m taking a picture during a moonlit night, I can get decent pictures. Switch to video... darkness.

       That's called shutter speed. At night your phone can use image stabilization and a long shutter to get a decent photo (say 1/8 of a second). With video you cant really drop below 1/48s at 24fps without the entire image smearing.
      </p>

       Get a pro video app if you want to experiment with manual controls and see for yourself.

       Any time!  I figured I'd explain more if anyone read this far down.  I love conspiracy, UFOs, EBEs, etc...  But I find that a lot of supposed 'evidence' can be chalked up to camera and compression mechanics (look at light orbs for instance).

       Yeah, I normally don’t come down this far in the comments but yesterday was an exceptionally slow day at work.

      <p>
       Your mention of light orbs instantly makes me think of the Marfa Lights, which actually don’t have to do with a camera, but supposedly has more to do with light reflecting off of the ozone and somehow making the appearance of balls of light. Pretty interesting. Was working out that way last year and wanted to go check it out in person but never had the opportunity.
