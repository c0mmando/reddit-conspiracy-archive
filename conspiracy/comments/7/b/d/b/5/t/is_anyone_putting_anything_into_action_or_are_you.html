       Look for fixer uppers, bank owned, etc.  Dont pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for wood and land that youll never truly own.  If you do spend that much try to get a duplex so you can rent out half.  I got 5 acres of pastured land for 50k and Ill have it paid off in a year.  I used craigslist and made deals with real people.  Cut out the middle men like banks and real estate crooks and youll save big.  Just learn how to protect yourself from getting ripped off.

       Absolutely. I’m trying to figure out how to make a few bucks on this, specifically working without a real estate agent. We are looking for bank owned or dilapidated properties so we can get the work done and then move in when it’s ready.

       You could also buy land with a home and add a home or two and divide the land (check local zoning) and sell off the other properties.  My friend purchased a few acres with a small home and then divided the land and built small one story homes and sold them.  Paid his house off in a few years and is doing well.  You can certainly make something cool just dont fall into the mortgage mindset.

       That isnt opposite at all! This is exactly what everyone should be doing.  In my opinion each house in a community should have its own resources and each community should take care of itself.  I like to think one day I could create a community within my town that could be an example of how things COULD be.

       And they give us things that are addicting to keep the cycle going.  Food, drink, entertainment, etc. all things that are ok in moderation but at this point so many of us are consumed by our vices, hence the term.  If we all just change our own behaivior we could change the world.  Its too bad that Love and Kindness are looked at as weak or stupid.

       Yes! I try to buy locally and buy products locally made or at least american made.  It doesnt help much to switch to a local store if they are still selling major brands.  We need to all be helping each other out in this way.  There is a reason there is so much red tape and b.s. to pay for when you open a business and it only has to do with making it harder for the avg. person to do it.

       Im not new lol, I just like to change my name from time to time cuz of paranoia.  Anyway I am not rich AT ALL. lol I used craigslist and just made deals.  You have to remember there are real people just like you who own land and are willing to deal.  You have to just negotiate and find something your both happy with.  In my case the person was even cool enough to let me pay my 10k down payment in payments lol

       more than I have.  You can do it just don't think of obtaining this in the conventional ways.  Look at what your good at and try to apply it.  As I have mentioned before there are people who have land/homes but dont want/need it.  If you can create a relationship with this person and get them to trust you wnough to draw up terms outside of a bank you could make something happen.  Also if you have a best friends try to buy and split a multi family home.

       My best friend has no interest in settling somewhere, she's more up on the move wants to rent/travel. I'm sort of tied down by my dog, half my wages leave my bank as soon as I get paid and I don't even have a car yet, it's a long way away but I'll have it one day! I'm still super young, I have time :)

       Just keep at it.  im 30 and just realized what I need to do.  Also if your friendis looking to travel around, it is much easier to do when you have a home base to come back to.  I too plan on traveling and considering myself retired by the time I finish construction.  After everything is set up your free to do what you want.  No debt=freedom

       Before WW2 most homes had gardens and chickens.  Because of the war grocery stores became more popular and started to carry more and more.  This lead to people being dependant on them as we are today.  Its funny how we change like that.

       It is more important to know where you are going than to get there quickly. Do not mistake activity for achievement.  Remember that there is nothing stable in human affairs, therefore avoid undue elation in prosperity or undue depression in adversity.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are doing probably has the opposite effect in any way you can imagine.  A man alone in this world is nothing.  Seriously, basically your actions are suicide but, I am absolutely certain there is no way you could be convenience otherwise.  They don't want people with community and implicit ties to one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your goal is to do something, anything to the power structure, towards what is corrupting your nation, going off alone to hide does nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go to a city, find people and speak with them face to face at length, pay them if you must, show them what you know.  If you are sure of your view.

       Did I say I was crawling under a rock? My point is I wont have a mortgage to tie me down, my food will be fresh and free from chemicals, my power will all be generated on my property, I will collect rainwater to help water the garden and shower, etc.  I am doing this so I am not tied down so I can teach others this way of life and build a community in the truest sense.  I plan to change things from the ground up.  There is no isolation in my plans

       In 1997, my then husband and I knew we wanted out of the rat race before we even really knew what the race was all about. We bought 5 acres in a small town far away from the cities and put a modular home on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       A year or two after living there, along came Y2K. Being young and nieve at the time, I bought into it hook line and sinker. Hell, we had JUST got a home computer and now the world was gonna end!? I began devouring anything I could read on homesteading and off the grid living before there was even a kitschy term for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       By New Years day 2000, we had aquired another 9 acres around us, another couple in their own home sharing the property, and were for all intents and purposes self sufficent with 1 child of our own and the neighbors having 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, Y2K came and went. Cue me becoming the butt of everyones jokes. Sure, I was glad that the world hadn't come to a standing halt, but I despised being dumb enough to get sucked in. Then it dawned on me, I may have jumped the gun on survive or die, but I was still WAY better off than most everyone I knew. I was 24 years old and had gained a life time of experience that I, as a city girl, would have otherwise never learned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still own the property, the houses are gone but not the friendships and I've since moved to a subburb. But I can never unlearn what Y2K taught me so I decided to give that back to society. I bend anyones ear that will listen about living self sustainabiliy and I've spent years volunteering in my community. Not only to share what I learned, but to forge ties with those people so that should the world collapse one day, I know who my friends are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I may not be out there as an activist, demanding change and answers these days but I feel like I've got survival on lockdown and should the day ever come, unless it's happening in my front yard, me and mine will be ok.

       This is exactly my plan.  I may be taking it a bit further and offer classes and workshops for general living and survival.  Cant wait to get out to my property.

       That would be a great plan! I hosted quite a few Q&amp;A sessions back in the day. I was a nervous wreck the first time I did it! But, people are so engaging and and kind when it's about something they want to learn. I loved it. Good luck!

       My best friend has no interest in settling somewhere, she's more up on the move wants to rent/travel. I'm sort of tied down by my dog, half my wages leave my bank as soon as I get paid and I don't even have a car yet, it's a long way away but I'll have it one day! I'm still super young, I have time :)

       umm so why did you even bother responding? lmfao  My question was simply to see what others are doing to "fight the man" so I could get ideas and also share what I am doing.
