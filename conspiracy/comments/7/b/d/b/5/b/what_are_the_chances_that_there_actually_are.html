       So everyone is talking about how Russian bots are taking over Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I don't like to think about the Trump Russia collusion, because I personally believe Trump and TPTB are actually taking these accusations to their advantage since they distract the population from what they're doing behind the scenes, I am curious about the validity of there actually being a Russian troll farm funded by rich billionaires whose aim is to control social media and therefore influence global politics.

       Yeah, there have been various threads already exposing the propaganda accounts from a lot of factions.

       This has been my point of view, I believe they exist, but I also belive their is all sorts of shills and bots operating on behalf of the US government, various private companies and organizations.  Back in 2008 Cass Sunstein proposed the Government infiltrate conspiracy groups to disseminate propaganda and disinfo.  Then in 2011 it was revealed the US military was running a program that allowed users to run multiple sock puppet account to push propaganda on social media.  Since then who know/suspect companies like Monsantos of doing simular operations and then we have CTR and Cambridge Analytics as well.  I personally think (because of Vault u) the Government sold that technology off to 3rd parts after it was discovered, but have no solid proof, just seems like business as usual.  I'm sure Russia was running similar technology in order to compete in the info-war.  With that said, I don't think that Russia swung our election when you consider the amount of baggage Hillary brought with her to the election and most people were already criticizing for her record and scandals.

       That's the battlefield. Alphabet is a major player as well as "the Russians" whom you may recall BHO ridiculed Romney for mentioning and said the '80s called and want their foreign policy back". Hilarious doncha think?

       I know most of the regulars around here pretty well. If they are russian they hide it really well.

       But the drive by users? I'm sure we get all kinds of bumps from state actors from all over. The way we share and process information around here is surely valuable to those types.

       Having looked at millions of posts and hundreds of thousands of accounts on Reddit, here's my opinions:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Are there Russian trolls on Reddit? - Yes, but I don't think it's to the extent it was on Twitter. Out of all the accounts I've looked at, I only have 1 flagged as "Russian troll". There are many more candidates but it can't be proven with publicly available data.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bots? - To me, "bot" means some form of automation. Yes, there are many bots on Reddit, thousands per day.
         <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Karmaparma/comments/77nny3/hens/">
          Here's an example of some being tested
         </a>
         . However, the vast majority of bots probably never post and are strictly used for voting. The ones that do post, are spam accounts.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       That said, you can't really prove motive. You don't know if someone is making political statements sincerely or not. For every fake account, there's 1000 more people who genuinely believe the same thing and will discuss it passionately.

       To put it in perspective,   look at the spikes we see here in anti Russia posts/comments and the associated outbreaks of anti Russia voting behavior.    There is no comparison.   If Russia is doing it on r/conspiracy,   they are a lot less obvious about it than CTR or the other anti Russia folks.

       Everyone talks about Russian bots or DNC bots and I'm positivd that both exist, but I would guess corporate bots are most prevalent. If you can get a page to the top of Reddit that's a ton of clicks and a lot of ad revenue

       Russia is a bogeyman and there almost certainly aren't "Russian bots" here. Very unlikely that there are Russian shills here either. Twitter is much larger so I'm sure there have been some there, in addition to Chinese bots and shills, Iranian bots and shills, etc.

       If you don't think there is are Russian bots/shills on Reddit, I think you're the one who's been manipulated.

       Russia, China, US, Shareblue, DNC, RNC. They've all got people working social media constantly.

       Russian bots posting comments using AI? I mean, sure its possible. But I don't think its that likely. Are there actual Russian shills in this sub? I also sort of doubt it unless there is actual proof. I'm sure there are CTR/Shareblue shills. I consider those "Establishment" shills. As for the rest, absent proof, who knows.

       It was done on twitter and Facebook, it's certainly feasible that it'd be done on Reddit. You're sure of the CTR/Shareblue shills, yet skeptical of the others.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've got your biases, which is ok, because everyone had them. The important thing is recognize your bias. Try to take a step back and look at it from a logical point of view. If you think CTR/Shareblue have shills on here, why is it so unreasonable to think other powers with their own agenda aren't doing the same

       You mean a people who may or may not have been Russian bought a few ads?

       I think the Globalist Establishment is the strongest power, and that is who most of the shills are shilling for, whether they know it or not. The power of all those other groups you mentioned pales in comparison.

       So a 2 month old account called Shillin4Shekles wants us to know there's no Russian conspiracy.... the largest country on earth... but there's a huge conspiracy against Israel. The 150th largest country in early.
