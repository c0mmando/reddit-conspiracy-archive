    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn&#39;t that support the notion that Trump&#39;s presidency ISN&#39;T just more of the same though (for better or worse)?</p>

<p>It baffles me how there can be so many people here on both sides of the argument, who are so sure that Trump either IS our guy, no doubt, or that he most definitely ISN&#39;T! To me, there are just way too many variables at this point to make any such determination. I&#39;ve rejected many of his choices at first and have since come to see why he made them in a fair number of cases. I can see why he chose Sessions for the position he holds now. I can see why and how he might have worked with Comey and Mueller. I can see now why Bannon was crucial during the campaign. I would still prefer none of that had had to occur, but I do think he&#39;s been playing a better game than I enjoy to admit.</p>

<p>I still think he needs to propose better solutions in the energy sector than what he&#39;s doing currently, which is my main concern at this point, but the rest of it appears to have turned out to&#39;ve been a cunning game of chess, one in which everyone but us appears to lose.</p>

<p>Maybe there will still come a day on which we are next on the chopping block (a day which would have come rather soon if the Cabal Continuity hadn&#39;t been disrupted a year ago), and maybe Trump will be responsible for it. I don&#39;t trust the man enough to put my faith in his judgment, but I also see no reason to fear what he&#39;s doing. All things considered, this has been a great year for the seekers of truth, and everyone from 4chan to T_D and here has been an integral part of it.</p>

<p>This is no longer partisan. It&#39;s a new ride in the theme park and we get to choose if we wanna ride it to see where it leads, or if we wanna go back to the rides we already know. I mean, we could leave the theme park I guess, and maybe that&#39;s precisely where the ride will lead. Maybe that&#39;d be a good thing. Maybe it would be the end of us. I honestly don&#39;t know, but the people on the ride seem to be getting a hell of a kick out of it.</p>

<p>Well, that turned into a rant I hadn&#39;t intended to write. Eh.</p>

They basically (NK) set up every little part of the trip to make it look like a paradise. They go into an office building with like 200 computers where people are allowed to go on the internet. Every monitor is on and on a search engine website but every person is just staring at the screen with their hands on their lap except for one guy who is “surfing the web”. Of course they interview this one person who claims they are allowed to freely surf the web and read whatever they want. It’s sooooo fucking creepy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically, Lucifer is the guy on top of the evil food chain. I think he comes from the Archon non-physical alien species. This group was pushed back out of power of the many years until they controlled like 6 or 7 planets. The positive alien group pushed back on their stronghold planets until there was 1 left which is Earth. These Archons are also able to reincarnate as humans as are other high level beings so they can be human for some time until they die. They are very evil and believe in evil as a philosophy and ended up enslaving many groups including the Reptilians and the Humans. </p>

<p>Most people of power including celebrities are often given a chance to sell their soul to the devil (archons). They Archons can work from within them for all of their Earthly life to enhance their career but as soon as they die, they will become the slave of the Archon on some other plane of being. This is why people like Rockafellar do everything they can to stay alive. There&#39;s nothing good on the other side for them. </p>

<p>If you want to know the origins of Lucifer, this is the best explanation I found:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is somewhere in this list of articles. Look for the blog where a MK Ultra victim explains what she experienced in Satanic rituals. </p>

<p>In case you don&#39;t find it (I&#39;m sure its there), she was born into one of the 13 families. When she was a baby, they took her to a family high priestess who marked her as a slave. (some are marked as slaves, some priests, ect..). Then, when she was like 5 or 6, she began participating in rituals. The first thing they did was cut a piece of her thumb off as a warning to never disobey them. They put her thumb piece in some kind of preserving liquid where they could wave it in her face as a threat in the future. Then they used a garden hose to clean out her ass for anal sex but the water pressure was too high so it caused intestinal damage. She would have sex with her 6 year old cousin inside of a pentagram. During this whole thing, they would torment her and the sick Illuminati cabal would laugh hysterically especially when she was in pain. She said the laughter was very disturbing. On and on she went and somehow escaped the ritual abuse when she got older. </p>

<p>(&quot;the enemy of my enemies is my friend&quot;)</p>

<p>...also, BO seems to precede Trump on many trips... and I believe it is to announce to these world leaders that Trump is to be taken seriously (in spite of what they head from the deep state main stream media propaganda).  while not may (internationally) actually take trump seriously, everyone (internationally) loved obama.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>i believe Trump didn&#39;t particularly like Obama -- right up until the first day that trump met with Obama for the first time as POTUS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama was groomed by the CIA</p>
</blockquote>

<p>not really.  the CIA would have preferred Hillary win in 2008.</p>

<p>Obama had to work overtime to convince the deep state that he was a smarter choice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>possible Trump was too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>again, the deep state preferred Hillary  -- clearly.</p>

<p>if the CIA was grooming Trump, it was only a ver small/minority faction of the CIA.  </p>

<p>I believe Obama, Putin and Assange were working together with small, &quot;old guard&quot; factions of the FBI, CIA (and even a small, &quot;old guard&quot; of Mossad) to keep evil Hillary and the pedo-fascists out of power.</p>

<p>The Korean War &#39;ended&#39; with a ceasefire in 1953. In 1966, Australian PM Harold Holt went for a swim at the beach and was never seen again. One rumour was that he had boarded a Chinese submarine but perhaps it was a North Korean sub? &quot;Time for some Black Ops, Harry.

    <div class="md"><p>Well right off the bat it&#39;s a major conduit for drugs coming from the Golden Triangle and being spread throughout the western world, like we don&#39;t know who has the capability to do that and has operatives in and among countless US military bases and embassies that don&#39;t know and don&#39;t ask any questions about their coming and goings or why or what any of those operatives are actually there to do. </p>

<p>For another, as we&#39;ve just seen, Kim&#39;s efforts to force the US military threat on his southern border to cease and desist has been used to do just the very opposite and now we see Trump gloating over all the big bucks to be made off re-arming and re-building the Japanese military&#39;s offensive and war making capabilities that it fore-swore at the end of WWII under the auspices of protecting itself and going head to head against Kim on it&#39;s own initiative if need be. </p>

<p>And of course that was after installing even more threatening THAD missiles in South Korea against the direct wishes of the South Korean government that was looking to de-escalate and create a more peaceful and mutually beneficial arrangement with Kim&#39;s regime that the vast majority of Koreans both north and south could all directly benefit from, which only proves that they&#39;re not calling the shots in their own country or for it&#39;s benefit, either.</p>

<p>So is it all nothing but a US puppet show with the only and most significant export the US has to prop up it&#39;s steadily declining balance of trade at this point are the sales of weapons and weapon systems that it has to constantly find or create some actual need or perceived threat to that going? I wouldn&#39;t bet against it.</p>

The problem is that it is from a forum where trolling is highly encouraged, and the way he writes stuff is very gibberish and vague.

<p>So yeah , I definitely remember all the main things that was said but there has been many posts like that to either make fun of conspiracy theorist because they will pay too much attention to predictions or it is a person who wants attention.</p>
