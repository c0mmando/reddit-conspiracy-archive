        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think this isn&#39;t just highly likely, I think this could tie it all together. I&#39;ll put a bit of effort into this one. This is irrefutable fact. It&#39;s going to bring it all down!</p>

<p>9/11, we know it was mostly Saudi Arabians that did that.. and it wasn&#39;t a false flag, George Bush had made a deal with the Saudi Prince&#39;s.. I&#39;m not even going to go into detail, because we all know it&#39;s true. Of course they also rigged the buildings to blow, there&#39;s no denying that. Google jet fuel. But they also wanted to make sure there was as many casualties as possible.. that&#39;s because they&#39;re Muslims and it&#39;s required for their satanic rituals, or they won&#39;t get their 72 virgins in the after life (all children because all Muslims are actually pedos).</p>

<p>The goal was to be able to create things like the Patriot act, see Bush didn&#39;t give control over, they just had a mutual interest, and it gave the government more power. This was the beginning of the deep state being taken over by the Saudis.</p>

<p>By the time Obama was elected, it was fully taken over. Obama was definitely CIA trained, but he was approached by a small group of people that used to be part of the deep state.. they realized that their interests were turned against the government, and so they stole two elections for Obama to try to undermind the deep state.</p>

<p>This is where it gets weird. The Russian narrative is a fabrication of the deep state, it was to be used against both Hillary who already had years of questionable contact with the Russians, but also as a distraction from the real conspiracy of Trump/Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Go find that famous picture of the &quot;Initiation ritual&quot;. This really happened folks. See, while <em>MSM tries to convince us it&#39;s the Russians</em>, everyone was distracted from the fact Saudi Arabia bought Trump and he is their literal puppet. This distraction is furthered by the continuation of the uranium one scandal.. the goal is to keep talking about Russia.</p>

<p>See, this all dawned on me, it clicked when someone else posted that the Prince&#39;s own Twitter, but actually they own all of the MSM, that&#39;s how they&#39;re able to keep this under wraps so long. Qatar is involved too, but I&#39;m trying to keep it simple for now. But look into what they own, they&#39;re a big part of it now.</p>

<p>But Obama is part of a secret organization that was created in order to fight the deep state created by the Saudis, that&#39;s why he travels everywhere before Trump. He&#39;s literally America&#39;s version of mi8. What&#39;s their name? Can you guess? Obama literally created ISIS. That&#39;s why Trump is so much more successful at fighting them, ISIS is actually fighting against the deep state. But ISIS isn&#39;t the group who keeps claiming terrorist attacks, that&#39;s actually Saudi Arabia trying to give the literal ISIS Obama created a bad name. Remember, Muslims rape babies, that&#39;s what their goal is.. so terrorist attacks have that with a goal in mind, why wouldn&#39;t they blame that on the secret group of ISIS.</p>

<p>Also, Trump is using mind control techniques, watch <a href="https://youtu.be/u_aLESDql1U">this short video here</a> (watch it all for it to work), and each time he says those words, he&#39;s telling the Saudi princes he appreciates their contributions, and he&#39;s still their man. That&#39;s why he says it so much.</p>

<p>I lose 2-3 days everytime I watch that video. I actually just lost a day of time just getting the link to the video.. but that&#39;s what&#39;s crazy!</p>

<p>So, when I lose time, I&#39;ve noticed that I post all over about how Russia isn&#39;t responsible, that Russia and Hillary colluded, and all kinds of anti Hillary stuff, all over. 4chan, Twitter, Reddit, Facebook.. I&#39;ve had people accuse me of being a bot, and I don&#39;t even remember doing it! I&#39;m actually Y Anon on 4chan.</p>

<p>So, that explains why you see all these people everywhere posting distractions for both sides, every time we hear Trump say &quot;billions and billions&quot;, none of us realize it, but we start arguing about Trump and Russia, whether it&#39;s actually Clinton and Russia, or Trump likes to pee on people.</p>

<p>But Obama just got back from Saudi Arabia, he single handedly blew up the helicopter and everything else we are hearing about.. but that&#39;s because he had to get to where Trump was about to go, he&#39;s literally ISIS, fighting against the deep state, in defense of the real American government. Thank him for blowing it all wide open.</p>

<p>Next time, I&#39;ll tell you how China is involved! It&#39;s fucking crazy!</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="http://reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ba4h4/the_trump_administration_is_keeping_a_us_citizen/">here&#39;s proof</a> of an American citizen being locked up, without any reason given.. it&#39;s obvious he&#39;s part of the secret ISIS group. The proof is all around us!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep seeing people mention Obama visiting places before Trump, Obama getting briefed.. since people like to make implications without offering explanations.. well, this &quot;turd&quot; as others have called it, was born.</p>

<p>I&#39;d really like to see people try to explain these ideas they throw around, rather than just say these things that they give no explanation for (or evidence of).</p>

<p>If Obama <em>really is</em> visiting countries before Trump and getting briefings still, then we should discuss it.. or they should stop mentioning it. One or the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t actually trolling.. the idea is simply to try to present something that isn&#39;t so right/left wing, but use ideas from both sides.. on a serious note, I really think it&#39;s plausible that Trump is in another countries pocket, and that the Russia narrative really could be Russia being Russia.</p>

<p>At a certain point I decided to use the terminology and concepts some people here use.. why does Obama visit countries before Trump is something I see often here. Obama is/created ISIS is something I see often here. Muslims being satanic pedos is something I&#39;ve seen here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m simply just putting it all together in a creative way, while trying to keep it plausible. It isn&#39;t left or right wing, but kind of trying to avoid bias.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never posted there, and I actually made a dedicated account because I was being harassed from users there in the past.</p>

<p>People repeatedly say plenty of stuff that they never elaborate on or give evidence of, and I don&#39;t see anyone actually discussing it.</p>

<p>Have you not seen plenty of people saying that Obama visits other countries before Trump? That he still gets security briefings? But do you ever see anyone try to explain why that would even make sense?</p>

<p>Maybe I should have left out some of the_Donald kind of phrasing.. but they never explain why they think Obama literally created ISIS, why Muslims are satanists or pedos.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of things here that are frequently said, rarely questioned, and just as rarely discussed. If these things truly are ridiculous, let&#39;s discuss it and agree. Let&#39;s not just let people say all this shit and not call them out on it. </p>

<p>At least I&#39;m trying to theorize how they could actually think these things are true. If anyone is trolling, it&#39;s the people that say all this shit, but don&#39;t ever back it up.. they just talk as if it&#39;s fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And feel free to look for my posts on Las Vegas, I&#39;ve made some real effort on a few of those, trust me I&#39;m no top mind fan. But some of the ridiculous stuff said here also deserves attention to determine if it&#39;s legitimate when it&#39;s said, or actual trolls being allowed to troll.</p>
