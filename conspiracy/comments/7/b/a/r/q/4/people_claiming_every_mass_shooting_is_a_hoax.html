    <div class="md"><p>I honestly have to wonder what they get out of that kind of argument. Trolls usually have some goal.. his makes zero sense whatsoever. That&#39;s the weird thing about a lot of these Donald fools, the way they argue and debate doesn&#39;t mesh with the way Americans do this.</p>

<p>You read about that one blogger/Twitter person that turned out to be a Russian troll farm? This is the way <em>they talked and debated</em>. It isn&#39;t American. I think if we start comparing confirmed Russian agents language, to some of the odd style of talking and debating.. we will be able to see who&#39;s actually a foreign agent trying to simply interrupt any line of thought they don&#39;t want discussed.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s merely a coincidence that the country with the highest rate of gun ownership, an increasingly uneducated populace, falling quality of life, inadequate mental health care while also happening to make celebrities out of mass-shooters has the most mass-shootings?  Why does it need to be part of an agenda?</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t the most reasonable, measured and logical explanations adequate.</p>

<p>Ironically, as people like you bury your heads in the sand, coming up with preposterous alternative theories for these mass-shootings, it allows for them to continue happening without a serious effort to curb them.</p>

<p>Another great example of coddle-culture at work.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what happened. There was extensive sagging of floor trusses (the WTC did <strong>not</strong> use beams to support the floor except on a few floors). After a point, localized failure beings and  quickly propagates to global collapse. We see the local failures on the North Tower very easily. You can <a href="http://i42.tinypic.com/9jha1u.gif">see the collapse begin in the long span floor trusses.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I believe it&#39;s a hoax. I thought it sounded crazy the first time I heard of such a thing. It was Sandy Hook.

    <div class="md"><p>You could not possibly sound more like a person who has not bothered to do even the most preliminary research on hoax events, of which there have been a multitude. </p>

<p>Anyone with common sense can realize that if people were really being shot and killed in these events, the evidence would be as convincing as it is plentiful, in order to shut up the hoax crowd you are talking about. </p>

<p>So anyone is welcome to demonstrate that real deaths occur at these events, or even that any real shots were fired at Vegas, which has yet to be demonstrated. </p>

<p>Many events involve crisis drills and crisis actors. Once you see a crisis actor, you can assume complete hoax; it is not possible for several reasons to have a &quot;hybrid&quot; event with real deaths and still use actors or staging. Totally impossible and unsafe. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also easier to not kill people than it is to kill people, in the same way that it&#39;s easier to not mow the yard than it is to mow the yard. I&#39;m tired of hearing people assert the opposite which is completely stupid and goofy. Would you rather fake some deaths and be guilty of a hoax or coordinate mass murder and be guilty of many innocent deaths? Gee I wonder which one is less of a risk. And again, if people were being shot and killed there would be evidence, not a <em>complete lack of evidence.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re reply is laughable. Since when do the MSM show images of death and gore and dead bodies and WHY SHOULD THEY HAVE TO to prove a mass shooting to a bunch of people who believe they’re hoaxes? because you’re in the extreme minority here. </p>

<p>Have you ever lost a close loved one? I have AND saw the dead body to prove it. Would I want that persons dead image posted all over the internet and on tv to prove to hoaxers an event was real? Would I fuck. And I’m sure that goes for all the victims families and loved ones. </p>

<p>What part of humanity starts parading round dead bodies and graphic images of injuries to prove events??? I think you’ll find loads of videos online of the victims of the shootings in Vegas and other events afterwards. A friend of mine met one the other day and saw their injury. The fact most of the hoaxers miss is these people have families, they are real life people. They are traumatised. They don’t want to have to come out and prove what happened to anyone never mind a bunch of sick people denying what happened to them was real. Vegas has videos of people lying on the ground dead. Loads of them. Get a grip. You think anyone is going to show dead kids on tv to prove sandy hook? </p>
