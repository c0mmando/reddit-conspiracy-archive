        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Rand broke several ribs and has fluid around his lung. He&#39;s going to be out for a while.</p>

<p>That said, this &quot;attack&quot; was pretty serious. The media alleges it wasn&#39;t politically-motivated, and Rand Paul&#39;s office says it was over a matter most would consider &quot;trivial.&quot; Now Rand keeps tweeting to insinuate the whole &quot;lawn dispute&quot; story is bunk.</p>

<p>What&#39;s going on? Why would someone attack him like that, and why wouldn&#39;t that person be in custody of Capitol Police (rather than free on bail and now pleading not guilty)?</p>

<p>Very odd. Something is up. I believe Rand when he says it was &quot;trivial,&quot; because why would he say that? And even if it might seem trivial, the attack was not trivial, which makes the motive interesting, at the least.</p>

<p>I have a theory, but I want to hear some of yours, first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory is they made some stupid bet about politics. His neighbor either lost and didn&#39;t want to pay, or there was just some disagreement about who won and lost.</p>

<p>I know that&#39;s an oddly specific theory, but I believe Rand when he says it was trivial - I don&#39;t think he&#39;d just totally lie about that. But I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s stupid enough that he doesn&#39;t necessarily want to talk about it a bunch, but his neighbor is &quot;guilty&quot; enough that he&#39;s willing to try and dissuade people from thinking it was a lawn dispute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rand mentioned the possibility of Trump being &quot;primaried&quot; about a week before the attack: <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/donald-trump-reelection-not-clear-rand-paul/2017/10/30/id/822892/">http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/donald-trump-reelection-not-clear-rand-paul/2017/10/30/id/822892/</a></p>

<p>May be unrelated. Who knows? I&#39;ve seen some leftist media outlets using it as a reason to attack Paul&#39;s politics while claiming the assault was not politically motivated.</p>
