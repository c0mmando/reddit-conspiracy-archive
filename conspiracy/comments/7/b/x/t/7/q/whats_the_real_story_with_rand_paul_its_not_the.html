       Rand broke several ribs and has fluid around his lung. He's going to be out for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, this "attack" was pretty serious. The media alleges it wasn't politically-motivated, and Rand Paul's office says it was over a matter most would consider "trivial." Now Rand keeps tweeting to insinuate the whole "lawn dispute" story is bunk.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's going on? Why would someone attack him like that, and why wouldn't that person be in custody of Capitol Police (rather than free on bail and now pleading not guilty)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Very odd. Something is up. I believe Rand when he says it was "trivial," because why would he say that? And even if it might seem trivial, the attack was not trivial, which makes the motive interesting, at the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a theory, but I want to hear some of yours, first.

       Someone posted an article on here yesterday that interviews other neighbors. They all had wonderful things to say about Rand Paul. They also said it was not about landscape issues.

       But none of them said anything about the attacker or what they thought it was about.

       My theory is they made some stupid bet about politics. His neighbor either lost and didn't want to pay, or there was just some disagreement about who won and lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that's an oddly specific theory, but I believe Rand when he says it was trivial - I don't think he'd just totally lie about that. But I'm guessing it's stupid enough that he doesn't necessarily want to talk about it a bunch, but his neighbor is "guilty" enough that he's willing to try and dissuade people from thinking it was a lawn dispute.

       I love this theory, but I would tweak a couple details. Rand wasn't the one who made the bet, it was a mutual acquaintance who offered a restored vintage Harley-Davidson XR750 to a fundraiser and there was a disagreement over the value and feelings got hurt.

       Rand mentioned the possibility of Trump being "primaried" about a week before the attack:

      </p>
      <p>
       May be unrelated. Who knows? I've seen some leftist media outlets using it as a reason to attack Paul's politics while claiming the assault was not politically motivated.

       I feel some kinda way about the stories that the neighbor is a socialist. I find it weird that a socialist would have his products for sale on QVC. I also don't buy the stories that this was a fight over hedges. Didn't initial reports say the arrest made at like 3 AM? It's all sketch af.
