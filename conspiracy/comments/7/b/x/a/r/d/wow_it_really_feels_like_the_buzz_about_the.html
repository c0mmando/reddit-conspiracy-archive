       According to the papers, United States Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Rossholds stakes in businesses which deal with Russian oligarchs Leonid Mikhelson and Gennady Timchenko who are subject to U.S. sanctions,[5] as well as Russian president Vladimir Putin's son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov.[69] Other members of the Trump administrationthat appear in the documents includeUnited States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and director of the National Economic Council Gary D. Cohn.[69]Overall, more than a dozen Trump cabinet members, major donors and advisers appear in the documents and are linked with offshore accounts. These include major donors Robert Mercer andSheldon Adelson.[1][70]
      </p>
      <p>
       The documents also revealed that Russian state organizations with ties to Putin pursued between 2009 and 2011 large investments in Facebook andTwitter via an intermediary—Russian-American entrepreneur Yuri Milner, who befriended Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg[71] and was a business associate of Jared Kushner, PresidentDonald Trump's son-in-law.[72]
      </p>
      <p>
       American singer Madonna, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, American billionaire George Soros, founder ofOpen Society Foundations,[73] and former NATO supreme commander in Europe General Wesley Clark are also named in the papers.[74]
      </p>
      <p>
       Commenting on the Paradise Papers leak, United States Senator and 2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanderswarned of "rapid movement toward international oligarchy", saying, "The Paradise Papers shows how these billionaires and multinational corporations get richer by hiding their wealth and profits and avoid paying their fair share of taxes."[75] TheDemocratic leader in the US Senate,Chuck Schumer, and the ranking Democratic member of the Senate finance committee, Ron Wyden, issued a joint statement accusing Republicans of "pushing a reform of the tax code that fails to close egregious loopholes revealed by the leaks."[75]

According to The Express Tribune, "Apple, Nike, and Facebook avoided billions of dollars in tax using offshore companies."[17] Apple issued a statement in response criticising the reports as inaccurate and misleading, stating that the company is the largest taxpayer in the world and that it "pays every dollar it owes in every country around the world"

       They haven't given the public Access to the files so we can't investigate online together.  One German newspaper and a global investigative org funded by Soros are gatekeeping the files and trickling out stories.  I guarantee if they give us full access you would hear something new every day for a year.

       It's because this had been known for decades. As I said the minute this came out literally no one will care and guess what, it dies in literally one 24 hour news cycle because there was nothing tying anyone to anything that people actually hate. If people have known about this type of behavior for decades why would they care about it now.

       Ok well it is relatively common knowledge amongst those I guess somewhat politically aware. I knew of this in high school. Obviously not this exactly but it's not hard to draw your own conclusion. That's why it died down. People knew of tax havens, we knew how bad Nike and Apple were, 2 and 2 and we kindve always thought 4.

       When it was broadcast here in the UK, I thought it would have been huge as the royal family were tied up in it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is, from what I could tell, so many people were posting 'so what, I'd do the same if I were loaded to try and avoid paying less tax'.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had to explain to these people (especially here in the UK) that it's really not about that. The elite, rich and our politicans will relentlessly pursue poor folk if they don't pay their tax, whether that be council tax or tax on their wages. They take people to court and even, in extreme cases, send people to prison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet at the same time, they themselves, the rich, elite and politicans, are being total hypocrites and avoiding paying tax themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people get alienated with the issue because most people hate tax and paying tax, we pay it through force, not many pay it through willingness. As soon as people hear 'the rich aren't paying tax' they switch off because they can relate and don't see it as a negative or bad issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you highlight the hypocrisy in it people become more receptive, but as you have said, that's just too complex for people to understad so whenever this comes up (it's not the first time leaks of this nature have happened) people just loose interest really quickly.

       What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

       It’s against the law to recognize revenue where it was not earned for purposes of tax evasion, not tax avoidance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally individuals are further protected by LLC and similar corporations from legal action. That’s why some of the news was around the Paradise Papers was publicly traded companies like Apple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since Enron, publicly traded companies have had to adhere to SOX regulations regarding finances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tax evasion is a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trick is having paperwork behind the revenue for the island reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end remember this, you don’t pay tax on money, you pay it on revenue.

       If what Corey Feldman (spelling?) is right about the pedophile ring then it would 100% prove pizzagate is real, and we can shout a big fat "I FUCKING TOLD YOU SO" to whoever tried to downplay us.

       Yeah I think the reason people believed the mainstream media narrative on pizzagate is cuz it just sounded too insane to be true to someone who hasn't been red pilled yet.

       At this point, there is so much dirt on the cabal out in the open that we're collectively digging into, that it's impossible to tell which specific topic they're trying to distract us from specifically.It's pretty obvious that the current Hollywood fiasco about Weinstein and Spacey is largely a controlled exposition of some relatively benign sexual deviance so as to proactively defuse any allegations of systemic sexual misconduct and systemic child abuse in Hollywood and also in DC.

       There are much bigger fish to fry in Hollywood than those two, three fuckers, that's for sure.

       I'm interested and following the story as it develops but there's really not that much there.  Everyone pretty much already knew about rich people using tax havens.  It's a little bit interesting seeing some names but I'm willing to bet its just the tip of the iceberg and that nothing will be done about it with all these tea partiers in the Congress.

       ICIJ tries to control the narrative. They don't provide documents in bulk, they simply report on whatever information they have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people simply don't have time to give a shit about that stuff, and the ones who do give a shit don't want someone else's interpretation of it. They want the raw information.
      </p>
      <p>
       ICIJ is partially funded by Soros, so folks here take their reporting with a grain of salt. It may be objective and non partisan, but we simply don't know for sure. If we had the unfiltered information we could draw our own conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it fades from the front page because nobody can make any investment into it.

       It’s against the law to recognize revenue where it was not earned for purposes of tax evasion, not tax avoidance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally individuals are further protected by LLC and similar corporations from legal action. That’s why some of the news was around the Paradise Papers was publicly traded companies like Apple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since Enron, publicly traded companies have had to adhere to SOX regulations regarding finances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tax evasion is a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trick is having paperwork behind the revenue for the island reserve.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end remember this, you don’t pay tax on money, you pay it on revenue.
