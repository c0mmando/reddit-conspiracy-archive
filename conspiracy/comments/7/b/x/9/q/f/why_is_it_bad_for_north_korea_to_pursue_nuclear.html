       Imagine if Saddam had an ICBM that could wipe out DC. Do you think Bush would ever invade Iraq? He wouldn't even consider it.

       Isn't it obvious Kim is pursuing a defensive deterrent, so his country doesn't end up like Iraq, Libya, or any of the other victim nations of imperialism?

       Kim and his generals like life...if you honestly think he would launch a first strike you don't understand the situation at all. He has seen what we do to people like Saddam, or even to Dictators who play along with the West, like Qaddafi. While it's not good in general to have more nuclear weapons in the world, Kim isn't some madman who is going to nuke the US first chance he gets...he want's to ensure he doesn't get sodomized with a fucking bayonet.

       Are you serious? Do you realize every year, the US conducts war games which simulate the assassination of North Korea's leader?
      </p>
      <p>
       How would you feel in China was doing war games 30km from Washington DC, in which they simulated the assassination of the US president?
      </p>
      <p>
       The DPRK only threatens to respond to an attack on their country, to defend their homeland with every drop of blood. They never threaten to attack unprovoked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not remember Trump threatening to "totally destroy" North Korea just a few weeks ago?
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that Koreans have never killed Americans on American soil. But Americans butchered 30% of Korea's population during the Korean War.

       Can you find me one of these threats? Because the only "threats" I've found were conditional - they say that they will decimate the imperialist aggressors mercilessly etc etc..
       <strong>
        if
       </strong>
       their sovereignty is violated -
       <strong>
        if

       The annual war drills which are mentioned in the article include the simulated assassination of North Korea's leader - mass bombings of North Korean cities - and war drills for a US-South Korean invasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, the North Koreans see this as an extremely serious threat, because at any moment the drills could be modified to a full-scale invasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know which country you're from, but imagine you lived in the US. Imagine if China was doing "war drills" 10 miles off the coast of New York City, simulating the bombardment of Manhattan, the assassination of the US President, and a full-scale invasion of the American mainland. I'm sure you would see this as a very serious threat, am I wrong?

       Do you have any links with the info on the assassination drills? I havent been able to find anything about that, mostly just been finding that the drills are done to train for if NK did attack, and how theyd handle it. May not be searching correctly though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im in the US, and if im not mistaken russia does this shit every year with its drills/training. Not fake assassination missions, but they certainly hold war games with the US as the enemy, as well as do numerous missions close to our borders every year for posturing and such.

       That was the claim pushed by the MSM, but none of the quotes they used from North Korea actually mentioned attacking Guam. Here is CNN for example:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/29/asia/north-korea-missile-launch-guam-threat/index.html">
        http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/29/asia/north-korea-missile-launch-guam-threat/index.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The only quote from North Korean state media they had in this article was about "containing" Guam.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The North Korean launch was "the first step of the military operation of the (North Korean military) in the Pacific and a meaningful prelude to containing Guam," state media said.

       NK is "containing" Guam by developing weapons which can effectively counter an attack from that territory. Contain doesn't mean attack.

       This. NK isn't going to attack anyone unprovoked. They're pursuing nukes as a deterrent to regime change forced by the West and subsequent pillaging of their natural resources.

       Let's not forget that most living North Koreans have direct first hand memories in there families from the Korean war. Estimates of over 20 percent of the country, 2.7 million civilians died. We bombed that entire country indescrmintly until not a single structure of any significance remained. They feel the way they do towards us for very real reasons. Add the examples of Iraq, Libya, and for North Korea to trust anything we say would be irrational. They simply want to remain and we have taught them nuclear deterrence is there best, maybe only chance.

       I mean i agree with your comment, but the people you speak about from the korean that mostly harbor that sentiment are probably not the ones high up making those military decisions. I honestly doubt that is still the reason as to why they are going for nukes and such now.

       I believe those making the decisions to pursue nucluer weapons and announce threats of there use do so simply to survive. They firmly believe, and have historical and current evidence this is necessary. Does not address how sick this society is, simply makes what seems to be insane behavior, rational. I do not think challenging this thinking has any chance of success. We need to take a different approach if war is not inevitable. What ever happens will be because it will be what those making our decisions want. That is another discussion entirely

       Where else are they supposed to test their missiles? They are friends with Russia and China. South Korea are their brothers. The only remaining direction to test your missiles is towards Japan - a hated imperialist power which oppressed Korea for generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The missiles were flying at an extremely high altitude, and they weren't loaded. So the danger to Japanese civilians is literally nonexistent.

       You're not wrong, but it's pretty disingenuous to ignore wide spread famine in NK and the (clearly) higher average standard of living in the united states. and furthermore, just because you don't like the USA, doesn't mean NK is somehow magically a better place. you area also allowed to criticize both, which I do.

       Where is your evidence that famine is still widespread in NK? Scholarly sources and journalists reported that the famine lasted from 1994-1998.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's true the United States has a higher average standard of living. It's also true that North Korea has been under extremely harsh sanctions for over 50 years. Despite this, the DPRK is able to give its citizens free healthcare, housing, and education - something we're unable to do here in the United States.
