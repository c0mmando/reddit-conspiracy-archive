<p>I work with many children and adults who&#39;ve experienced CSA. The cover-up and lack of people believing them, the people who defend the abuser, etc. seem to have exacerbating effect negative outcomes for the victims. </p>

<p>During pizzagate people were so focused on elites and I was like...this is happening in your neighborhoods, to your children&#39;s classmates, to your child. Go volunteer locally! Speak out against harassment culture. </p>

<p>Remember the Whitehouse Callboy ring during HW Bush, etc.? Have you heard of the Discovery Chanel documentary that was canceled from being air and leaked by a former Nebraska senator called Conspiracy of Silence, or the book called The Franklin Coverup, or the Dutroux Affair, Or one of Dr. Phill&#39;s last shows on pedophilia and human trafficking before his show was canceled (March 21, 2017), orhat 60 Minites Australia episode on UK government pedophilia, or that documentary called An Open Secret on pedophillia in Hollywood, or the movie Eyes Wide Shut, or the recent movie on pedophile preists called Spotligh, or the convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffery Epstein with his pedo Lolita Express plane and pedo island where he hosts orgies and has hidden cameras in rooms for blackmail, or the many people coming forward claiming to be raped by politicians and other global elites, or Jimmy Savile, etc, etc, etc.</p>

<p>There are many pedo rings that get busted all the time. There are also rings protected by police forces and government agencies that also have connections with global elites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the post btw.. I&#39;m a conservative, I&#39;ve never thought this was a partisan issue, but I&#39;ve not really seen many posts hit the front page like the Republican guy who molested the kid back in the 80s.</p>

<p>I understand the spirit of your post, that people need to be against these crimes all the time, it absolutely isn&#39;t a team sport. As far as my opinion is concerned, lock up anyone, anywhere, that broke the law regardless of the side they are on..</p>

<p>My comments are being attacked, one commented saying you &quot;stole&quot; someone else&#39;s work.. I&#39;m of the opinion that the truth is more important than the karma anyone gets by trying to point it out..</p>

<p>I never would have seen the post they&#39;re trying to argue against unless you shared it.. but if you are building off of someone else&#39;s work, please give them credit so that their argument can be more easily beat down.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t attack your post directly, so they&#39;re attacking the comments that agree with you. Fuck politics, and fuck this being limited to pedophiles.. If anyone commits an act of evil, let&#39;s call them out because their act is evil. This isn&#39;t a team sport, we only win if the evil people lose.</p>

<p>Again, this isn&#39;t a team sport, stop trying to make it a one sided issue, everyone is capable of evil, it isn&#39;t born from a political belief.</p>

<p>But go on, keep telling me how two posts show <em>a history</em> of anything. Fucking A man. That&#39;s a seriously sad argument.</p>

<p>Also, I laugh at everyone doing mental gymnastics to argue against anyone commenting, while none can disprove the point of the post. There&#39;s plenty of Republican high profile pedophiles. Fuck, maybe Trump too, he seems like he defended Epstein a little too well. Epstein even plead the 5th when he was asked about his relationship with Trump.. what would incriminate Epstein by talking about Trump?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t know about the Franklin scandal. Also, I&#39;m a conservative, and this post doesn&#39;t hurt my feefees. That&#39;s because the title makes it clear that this is to show that it isn&#39;t a partisan issue. While I see dozens of posts a day trying to paint liberals as the evil doers, I know that it isn&#39;t just them.. I&#39;m just not willing to put in the effort to point at my own party being willfully ignorant.</p>

<p>Does it matter if they &quot;ripped someone off&quot;? When I post, the goal is at revealing the truth.. if my post gets no attention, but someone takes the truth I tried to highlight, but is more successful.. why should I have a problem with that?</p>

<p>The truth is, daily I see people attacking the left, this post shows evidence it isn&#39;t a <em>left only issue</em>. And me? I&#39;m against pedophiles and any others that are evil, I don&#39;t care what political party they belong to. </p>

<p>Fuck, it isn&#39;t just about perverts, if Hillary broke the law, put her in jail. Same for Trump. Same for Bernie, or anyone else on the right.. it <strong>ISN&#39;T A FUCKING TEAM SPORT</strong>.</p>

<p>Please, realize you&#39;re making this post a partisan issue, when the title clearly is intending to show that it isn&#39;t just the left. Both parties are equally capable of evil. If you&#39;re against evil, then don&#39;t defend either side, put evil people in prison, period.</p>

<p>You&#39;re basically trying to use two posts from that day to say &quot;Your claims of &#39;inconsistency&#39; is easily proven false&quot;.. or simply &quot;this doesn&#39;t need attention because of these two posts&quot; while ignoring the entire comment is about the <em>history</em> of the subject, not what&#39;s on the front page at any given moment.</p>

<p>So yeah, you&#39;ve officially gotten me to waste my time with your idiotic accusations of &quot;30 fake votes&quot; and &quot;subtly influence everyone to use a more apologetic tone&quot;- no mother fucker, I said <strong>BURN EVERY SINGLE CRIMINAL AT THE STAKE.

<p>So yes, this comment that&#39;s 4 days old that no one will ever see, because I&#39;m not trying to influence <em>anyone</em>.. you&#39;ve officially wasted my time, while being the one trying to convince people what <em>isn&#39;t important</em>.

<p>Bullshit. On the front page <em>right fucking now</em> there&#39;s a post accusing a Republican of sexual misconduct with a minor.</p>

<p>You are trying to sow division and make people fight along partisan lines, when everyone knows both political parties are controlled. You are also trying to subtly influence the moderators to feel like they have to use a heavier hand against Republican posts or face accusations of partisanship.</p>

<p>This post is a repetition of a talking point that has been used here for over a year, and it has been refuted hundreds of times.</p>

Any reasonable conspiracy theorist knows there is good and evil on both political sides, but on forums like this people plug their ears. Anything that doesn&#39;t fit the narrative is downvoted. Example: go to the_donald right now and there&#39;s a post celebrating the firing of Louis ck and another defending Roy Moore. But both are just accusations.

    <div class="md"><p>Because this sub only pushes the democrats who get caught in it, and accuse countless others who by all indications are perfectly innocent.  As long as its a democrat being called out this sub generally just goes with it ans adds more unfounded shit about that person, or how they&#39;re connected in 7 separations to some well known convicted pedophile.  Yet when a republicans name gets brought up, theres always a horde of &quot;people&quot; who defend them, or calling out the source, or the accuser, or that they were framed bc they&#39;re such flawless good ol boys.</p>

<p>Its fucked up, someones finally saying &quot;its not just democrats, lets hold everyone to the same standards,&quot; goes on to post a list and a handful of people come to shift the goalposts to make it seem like they&#39;re only bashing republicans.  </p>

<p>They don&#39;t seem to delete any references to pedos by Republicans.  As a matter of fact I don&#39;t think you understand what exactly the_donald is.  It&#39;s markedly NOT a Republican subreddit.  It&#39;s a non partisan America first, nationalist sub.  They don&#39;t care who you are or what party you hail from, if you aren&#39;t on board with Donald Trump, they will shit all over you.  That&#39;s why the sub is named after Donald and not Regan or &quot;Republicans&quot;.</p>

<p>Do not allow, I repeat, <em>do not</em> allow poison like this to linger in the air without being downvoted and confronted with facts.They also love to use logical fallacies and other shilling tactics that can be seen in the sidebar link &quot;The Gentleperson&#39;s Guide to Forum Spies.&quot;</p>

<p>Even if you see blatant shilling, don&#39;t just make sarcastic comments back. Always make a factual explanation, or demonstrate that someone is using a known shilling tactic.</p>

<p>Shills win by lying. But they also win by dividing us, lowering the quality of content, frustrating everyone, and demoralization. The thing that demoralizes shills is when you expose them with facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the post btw.. I&#39;m a conservative, I&#39;ve never thought this was a partisan issue, but I&#39;ve not really seen many posts hit the front page like the Republican guy who molested the kid back in the 80s.</p>

<p>I understand the spirit of your post, that people need to be against these crimes all the time, it absolutely isn&#39;t a team sport. As far as my opinion is concerned, lock up anyone, anywhere, that broke the law regardless of the side they are on..</p>

<p>My comments are being attacked, one commented saying you &quot;stole&quot; someone else&#39;s work.. I&#39;m of the opinion that the truth is more important than the karma anyone gets by trying to point it out..</p>

<p>I never would have seen the post they&#39;re trying to argue against unless you shared it.. but if you are building off of someone else&#39;s work, please give them credit so that their argument can be more easily beat down.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t attack your post directly, so they&#39;re attacking the comments that agree with you. Fuck politics, and fuck this being limited to pedophiles.. If anyone commits an act of evil, let&#39;s call them out because their act is evil. This isn&#39;t a team sport, we only win if the evil people lose.</p>

<p>Totally agree.  They all need to hang and soon.</p>

<p>Here here.  Now, where&#39;s your Democrat and non-affiliated lists?</p>
