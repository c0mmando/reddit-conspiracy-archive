        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I see tons of bashing of the left and the democrats. About a million crooked Hillary posts a day, and people exclusively dogging on &quot;libtards&quot; and &quot;snowflakes&quot; with their &quot;safe spaces&quot;. I see terms like &quot;liberal agenda&quot; being tossed around here, and it&#39;s just becoming a dumpster fire of young naive newer conspiracy theorists being drawn into this &quot;the republicans and trump can do no wrong! MAGA!&quot;...</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t help that you have shills like Alex Jones doing the dirty work of the social engineers and helping lead his audience toward being trump supporters and Fox News listeners...</p>

<p>Does anyone else think this is all part of an elaborate plot by the TPTB, social engineers and media, to subvert the conspiracy culture? By sucking them Into partisan politics and, therefore, rendering them useless against the system once they&#39;ve become part of it? </p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ll get them to endorse conservative beliefs, and effectively pit them against the leftists and liberals! We&#39;ll create much tension, this will surely benefit us!&quot;</p>

<p>We are supposed to be the smart ones, the watchdogs calling out these bullshit narratives and social experiments, not fucking falling for them. I urge you all to consider the fact that they may be trying to merge conspiracy theorists with hardcore conservative ideology and support for their puppet president, by branding him &quot;anti establishment&quot;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly what my post is saying that you are falling for, sir.</p>

<p>Consider what I said. Wouldn&#39;t be too difficult to just have trump be playing a character to appeal to theorists and anti state types? It used to be a staple belief as a theorist, that both parties are merely used as a divide and conquer scheme, and each election is merely an &quot;installment&quot; of the next puppet new world order hatchet man. </p>

<p>Great way to get theorists and the anti government demographic under your control, no? Also, social engineers know we don&#39;t trust the media, so couldn&#39;t they just use them to &quot;attack&quot; trump and add credibility to his anti establishment appeal? </p>

<p>This seems highly plausible compared to the theory that a wealthy billionaire, who stacked his cabinet full of Goldman Sachs banksters and elites, is somehow &quot;shaking things up&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Theorists have a unique appeal, because they reject the two party system entirely. Lots of open minded people who question the government out there, and aren&#39;t a part of this phony left right dichotomy. </p>

<p>So, by &quot;planting&quot; a phony &quot;good guy&quot; president who promises to take down the corrupt elite, and by staging these media attacks (aka free publicity) on him, and a slew of other staged political theatrics, to add to his anti establishment appeal.</p>

<p>There trying the &quot;conspiracy theorists; if we can&#39;t defeat them, let&#39;s try to gain their trust by staging an election in which an independent self made candidate defeats the obvious corrupt establishment democratic nominee. Then they will follow him as their media, we will divide the culture, and we can ultimately damage the effectiveness of their movement&quot;.</p>

<p>Interesting experiment might be to use machine learning algorithms to see if there is just a single vector of spam or if there is more than one group pushing their agendas here. For instance do all the flat earth posts come at the same time as the jews for jesuits posts? Or is one group trying to make us look dumb while another tries to make us look bigoted?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s really fucking ironic is we have moderators of this sub that spend a good amount of time in dem/repub discussions in other subs, engaging in long-winded dialog with people about party politics. Then, they pop over to r/c and delete legit conspiracy self-posts, then pop back into the matrix for more discussion with the ignorant plebs in r/politics (or something similar) about the election, or Hillary. It&#39;s actually the most disappointing thing about this sub. The mods spend all day in six or seven other subs, then come here and make five fucking posts linking us to some MSM site. I&#39;m talking five posts in like 2 hours, just one mod! It just seems wrong on many levels. This sub deserves mods that don&#39;t wash-out the new stuff with a bizarre array of links and , frankly, non-conspiracy material for the most part. And not much insight, on average. I get that the mods should be engaged, and help build content, but five posts per morning seems a bit much considering how fast the board washes out. The other crazy thing, is how these link posts to some zero-hedge type article have like 22 upvotes within 30 minutes, in almost every case. They win, we lose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wont downvote you. I will say this, I am a middle ground kind of guy. I would say centrist but that words being hijacked. It&#39;s sad. So anyways I&#39;m a center right. Not hardcore right. I can&#39;t stand seeing what the left did with their I years. They target conservatives with such hatred. It&#39;s rather disgusting. Seeing how they are literally trying to impose socialism here. Fuck that. I really try to live by of it doesn&#39;t hurt me then let it be. Meaning gay marriage marijuana sure fine. Peeing in the wrong bathroom. Nah. Bringing socialism nah. Not cool. I know there are alot of grammar mistakes. I&#39;m tipsy and typing on my phone so..... sorry. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see Trey Gowdy as controlled opposition....hell, anyone allowed to have an audience and pander to us is controlled opposition.  I think it&#39;s now down to good vs evil.  Is anyone good?  I hope so.  Hard to think they would have a platform to get to us without constant attacks from the &quot;bad guys&quot;.  Anyone pushing their &quot;political party&quot; should be deemed suspicious, IMO.  Not much difference between them at this point.  Also, I am suspicious of this post.   So......   </p>
