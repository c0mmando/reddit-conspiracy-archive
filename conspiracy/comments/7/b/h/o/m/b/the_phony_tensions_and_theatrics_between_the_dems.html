       I see tons of bashing of the left and the democrats. About a million crooked Hillary posts a day, and people exclusively dogging on "libtards" and "snowflakes" with their "safe spaces". I see terms like "liberal agenda" being tossed around here, and it's just becoming a dumpster fire of young naive newer conspiracy theorists being drawn into this "the republicans and trump can do no wrong! MAGA!"...
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't help that you have shills like Alex Jones doing the dirty work of the social engineers and helping lead his audience toward being trump supporters and Fox News listeners...
      </p>
      <p>
       Does anyone else think this is all part of an elaborate plot by the TPTB, social engineers and media, to subvert the conspiracy culture? By sucking them Into partisan politics and, therefore, rendering them useless against the system once they've become part of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       "We'll get them to endorse conservative beliefs, and effectively pit them against the leftists and liberals! We'll create much tension, this will surely benefit us!"
      </p>
      <p>
       We are supposed to be the smart ones, the watchdogs calling out these bullshit narratives and social experiments, not fucking falling for them. I urge you all to consider the fact that they may be trying to merge conspiracy theorists with hardcore conservative ideology and support for their puppet president, by branding him "anti establishment"...

       You can thank the elite political class, corporate heads, and the media for pushing this sub "right." The concerted and open attempts to take down the president at any cost has many rejecting the mainstream narrative, EVEN people who don't support Trump.

       That's exactly what my post is saying that you are falling for, sir.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider what I said. Wouldn't be too difficult to just have trump be playing a character to appeal to theorists and anti state types? It used to be a staple belief as a theorist, that both parties are merely used as a divide and conquer scheme, and each election is merely an "installment" of the next puppet new world order hatchet man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Great way to get theorists and the anti government demographic under your control, no? Also, social engineers know we don't trust the media, so couldn't they just use them to "attack" trump and add credibility to his anti establishment appeal?
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems highly plausible compared to the theory that a wealthy billionaire, who stacked his cabinet full of Goldman Sachs banksters and elites, is somehow "shaking things up".

       What does that even mean? Does "filled with shills" mean "filled with people who have opinions that differ from mine"? That seems to be the primary way in which that term is used on here.

       It means that links to CNN about Hillary get 295 upvotes in one hour, and super-important questions and discussion threads get either straight-up deleted or have zero upvotes all day. That's what "filled with shills" means.

       Theorists have a unique appeal, because they reject the two party system entirely. Lots of open minded people who question the government out there, and aren't a part of this phony left right dichotomy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, by "planting" a phony "good guy" president who promises to take down the corrupt elite, and by staging these media attacks (aka free publicity) on him, and a slew of other staged political theatrics, to add to his anti establishment appeal.
      </p>
      <p>
       There trying the "conspiracy theorists; if we can't defeat them, let's try to gain their trust by staging an election in which an independent self made candidate defeats the obvious corrupt establishment democratic nominee. Then they will follow him as their media, we will divide the culture, and we can ultimately damage the effectiveness of their movement".

       The CIA is good at their job. There is still some signal in the noise here though. I also just like watching the rate of spam as it goes up and down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interesting experiment might be to use machine learning algorithms to see if there is just a single vector of spam or if there is more than one group pushing their agendas here. For instance do all the flat earth posts come at the same time as the jews for jesuits posts? Or is one group trying to make us look dumb while another tries to make us look bigoted?

       I think they just have a few old tricks they toss out that are tried and true and they sprinkle them around based on current events, sometimes randomly probably, to create division and make us look wacky to lurkers.

       Flat earth, Jews run the world, anything super anti democrat or anti socialist with rude language, Bigfoot, pro Nazi stuff and lots of trump tweets. They're creating an image with the way they spam. It slowly has an effect on the way you view this culture and this movement.

       What's really fucking ironic is we have moderators of this sub that spend a good amount of time in dem/repub discussions in other subs, engaging in long-winded dialog with people about party politics. Then, they pop over to r/c and delete legit conspiracy self-posts, then pop back into the matrix for more discussion with the ignorant plebs in r/politics (or something similar) about the election, or Hillary. It's actually the most disappointing thing about this sub. The mods spend all day in six or seven other subs, then come here and make five fucking posts linking us to some MSM site. I'm talking five posts in like 2 hours, just one mod! It just seems wrong on many levels. This sub deserves mods that don't wash-out the new stuff with a bizarre array of links and , frankly, non-conspiracy material for the most part. And not much insight, on average. I get that the mods should be engaged, and help build content, but five posts per morning seems a bit much considering how fast the board washes out. The other crazy thing, is how these link posts to some zero-hedge type article have like 22 upvotes within 30 minutes, in almost every case. They win, we lose.

       You can see it in the mod's history. And also, if you make a comment on someone else's self-post, then go back to your comment, and see that post/thread' has been deleted' by the mod.

       I wont downvote you. I will say this, I am a middle ground kind of guy. I would say centrist but that words being hijacked. It's sad. So anyways I'm a center right. Not hardcore right. I can't stand seeing what the left did with their I years. They target conservatives with such hatred. It's rather disgusting. Seeing how they are literally trying to impose socialism here. Fuck that. I really try to live by of it doesn't hurt me then let it be. Meaning gay marriage marijuana sure fine. Peeing in the wrong bathroom. Nah. Bringing socialism nah. Not cool. I know there are alot of grammar mistakes. I'm tipsy and typing on my phone so..... sorry.

       I see Trey Gowdy as controlled opposition....hell, anyone allowed to have an audience and pander to us is controlled opposition.  I think it's now down to good vs evil.  Is anyone good?  I hope so.  Hard to think they would have a platform to get to us without constant attacks from the "bad guys".  Anyone pushing their "political party" should be deemed suspicious, IMO.  Not much difference between them at this point.  Also, I am suspicious of this post.   So......

       Dude what are you talking about?  Both sides are equal to blame. Stop pretending that conservatives are the evil ones.  The liberals are pulling the same shit.  Both biased peoples are super defensive over every little article that comes out bashing their side, then get on the offense to attack the other side.  You're not helping here.
