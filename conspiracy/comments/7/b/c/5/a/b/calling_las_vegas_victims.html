<p>&quot;Apologizing ahead of time because I am sure this will get long--Again thank you to everyone who has reached out and checked on us. Thank you for everyone that listened to us tell this tale already, the more we talked today the more we processed. As bits and pieces are coming back into focus the harsh reality of the situation is weighing more and more, I know we are the lucky ones and I thank every God, every Universe, and every possible fated moment that protected us from the insanity that was last night. That said here is what I experienced last night and I apologize now for any profanity.
I am going to start about 20 minutes before Jason Aldean went on--Stacy was having lower back pains from standing on pavement for three days and wasn’t dying to see Jason Aldean, so he set off to find a seat for a bit promising to come back or meet us at the lockers at the end of the show. This is where the 1st fated moment happens...he wasn’t able to find anywhere to sit and decided to just come back to us. Thankfully he did, as he was without his cell phone and would have been God knows where. So we are all sitting in the grass, complaining about the chicks who were literally dancing on our heads, being silly and totally sober which for me was our 2nd fated moment. 3rd fated moment was that we had agreed to not push towards the front of the stage on this last night (like we had the previous two nights). All three days/nights we chose to be on the same side of the stage. The side to the right of the sound booth, lighting controls and 150 yard bar that split the standing area in half. Jason Aldean starts, we stand up and we get three songs in when there is a popping sounds that like every news outlet has reported sounds like fireworks. It literally sounded like someone had thrown a hand full of those poppers on the sidewalk. Everyone around us wasn’t too concerned and Jason kept right on playing. About 10 seconds passed and thats when the second pops started--now I don’t know guns, but it was so fast and SO LOUD and so LONG it didn’t seem possible to be gunshots. I thought it was like a transformer blew, or the sound equipment crackled, or he was using pyrotechnics that malfunctioned. At this moment Jason paused ever so slightly, but then kept on playing. Another 10 second break occurred and then came the 3rd round of pops. This time they were louder and people in front of us were hitting the ground. Now people are screaming get down while others are shouting shut up its just fireworks. Everyone in our group of 5 was crouching down a little by this point and that is when the 4th round of pops started--now this is when we knew SHIT was bad. The guy in front of us was screaming GET DOWN and as we sucked our bodies into the astroturf ground I saw that his girlfriend was bleeding--and in the blur of movement the guy behind us was still saying “it is not gunshots” and like in a bad movie he got hit in the stomach with a bullet. So we are huddled on the ground for the 4th round of popping--that seemed to go on for a lifetime--and some how in the moment that followed that round our group realized we needed to run. In what seemed like seconds we were on our feet clutching each others hands and sprinting--this is when the 5th round of pops started. As we were running we were watching people get struck all around us and we were leaping over people who were on the ground (in the moment I let my mind believe those people were laying down by choice--but I’m afraid its not the truth). As we were running you could hear this sound zipping past and the wind slicing and after the fact we realized those were bullet. As the 5th round is stopping we are sprinting out of the south/west side of the venue (opposite of the Las Vegas Strip--basically the backside of the venue). We make it through the exit gate and as we are running the 6th round starts. Of course we have no idea where the shots are coming from, it honestly felt and sounded like shooters were all around us. This is when we came to a security fence that was enclosing the entire event--as the 7th round of pops started people all pushed the fence over and this allowed us to flee further towards the airport. As we funneled down a street with other people we kept hearing the pops. Finally we found ourselves trapped against the perimeter fence and the hangers of the Executive Airport. Thankfully people were resourceful and started throwing rocks to break windows to find shelter in buildings. Initially we went in the building, but quickly found that we were only capable of going up and being stuck in a office, so we all quickly decided to head back down to where we could run if we needed. When we arrived back down stairs people were working on how to get over the fence (this is where I sacrificed my husbands favorite flannel to cover razor wire--sorry babe) Somehow in all of this someone in a truck found themselves trapped with us. And working quickly everyone got the truck tied up to the fence and after two attempts, the guy was able to pull down the fence so that everyone could flee to the tarmac. This is where we took shelter for about an hour while we waited for the next step. Now during the time we were stuck on the tarmac, there were reports of shooters in every hotel, people were frantically looking for friends and family, cell phones were dying and this is where fate #4 happened. All weekend we had been putting our purses in a locker--thankfully this night Juliann decided to carry hers and had a phone charger that allowed people to use their dead phones. Somewhere in the midst of all of the running 2 things happened 1. I posted on Facebook that we were ok (not sure where we were or when I did that but I am assuming it was when we broke onto the airport) 2. I called my mom--now I would love to claim I was calm and collected but I was FRANTIC, we were trapped and panicked about how to get to safety, so mom my sincerest apologies for that phone call--a call no mom should EVER have to get. At the airport with us were three guys that had been shot, they managed to run over 0.5 mile despite wounds and everyone rallied to apply pressure, tourniquets, etc. while we waited for any help. In the end we were shuttled off the airport, my cousin came and picked us up and let us hang at his house until we were safe to get back to our hotel (Tahiti Village 2 miles south of Mandalay Bay). Once we could we got into our room, packed our Sh*t in about 5 minutes and the 5 of us booked it out of Vegas home to our babies. The fact that the 5 of us made it out TOGETHER, without any serious injuries is a miracle. A few scrapes and bruises are nothing compared to what others endured. We were the lucky ones. We were on that side of the stage that was open viewing from the Mandalay Bay--15 minutes prior we girls took a picture with the hotel as our backdrop. My heart breaks for those around us that didn’t share our fate. My heart breaks for the families that didn’t get the frantic phone calls and texts that ours did. It is an experience that will change us and we appreciate all of the love and support while we process things that one should not have to process. It isn’t fun being part of the biggest massacre on US soil, but considering all that was stacked against us, I am so thankful that we are all here to learn from this. My shin will heal, time will make the sounds less vivid, and hopefully the sights we saw will fade. Until then I will pray for those who lost loved ones, I will love my friends family and children more fiercely then ever before and I will not focus on the twat nod that did this, or the gun control issues that will come up from this or the motive behind this, because none of those things will erase this.&quot;</p>

<p>improving background checks</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In what way?  Slowly but surely making it so that anyone who distrusts the MSM/government is banned from owning a firearm?</p>

<p>In what way are background checks &quot;improved&quot;?</p>

<p>That was already part if the background check process.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but it didn&#39;t show up in the Texas shooter&#39;s background checks. So the end result of these &quot;improved background checks&quot; will end up being a statement that the US Air Force and whomever else they find negligent will promise to do better in the future. </p>

<p>No victims from the last two mass shootings (two of the five deadliest shootings in modern American history, both occurring in the last month) are speaking out about gun control. I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever seen that before. There&#39;s something else going on, and idk what it is, but it has nothing to do with guns. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Texas Church shooting is actually a great example of why law abiding citizens should be allowed to arm themselves. It was an NRA member who put 2 bullets in the church shooter, causing him to flee. This guy obtained his guns illegally, so if you ask me, it&#39;s the failure of the government to uphold their existing gun control laws that is the true problem. If the govt can&#39;t even keep guns out of the hands of this mentally ill criminal, do you think more laws will really do anything? </p>

<p>As far as Las Vegas goes, some evidence suggests a push towards higher and higher levels of surveillance as the end game. To the point where there will be metal detectors at every casino entrance. Just a thought. </p>

<p>There what is?</p>
