Because the way his comment is structured appears as if he&#39;s talking to the person he&#39;s replying to, as opposed to the person talking in the video in the comment that the guy who he replied to had replied to, due to the structure of internet forums. My point, which I now suppose I should have just been outright with, was that he shouldn&#39;t start with &quot;You...&quot; if the person who he&#39;s directly referring/replying to is not who he&#39;s directing his comment toward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I’m sure that whining and jamming Trumps balls every time he tries to do anything is really gunna help usher in a new era of greatness. He’s definitely the biggest representative of the American people, and any “real American” would actually hope for the president to succeed, no matter who it was! I know I pray for Trump to do well, and I prayed for Obama to do well, and I’ll pray for every president we ever have to succeed, whether I disagree with them or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.</p>

<p>Unlike Republicans, who professed they wanted Obama to succeed, but rooted and worked to make him fail behind the scenes, I&#39;m gonna be honest:</p>

<p>I want Trump to fail. At every thing, at every turn.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a hard pill to swallow , but unamerican pieces of vermin who become president thru hated, racism, and Russian prios <em>should</em> fail. So we don&#39;t do that again.</p>

<p>We already failed, really, by making him President . The glass is dropped. I&#39;m prepared for the shatter when the dropped glass hits the geound.</p>

<p>No heroics by good Americans. Let it play out. And deplorables, it&#39;s your fault for unwittingly partnering with Russia and voting for the shithead in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sumarongl meant &quot;raising people&#39;s wages&quot;.</p>

<p>The thing is: The amount of wages (according to classical economics) relies on three things: 1) The amount of circulating capital in an area, 2) The cost of raw materials for an industry and 3) The amount of the labor force.</p>

<p>The globalists have been hiding inflation by depressing wages. (There&#39;s something called the Wage-Inflation Spiral. Basically, as wages get higher inflation gets higher.) The central banks have so inflated the money supply (with stimulus) that they fear Weimar Republic-style hyper-inflation. One of their methods to hide it is by keeping wages low. Hence their love of illegal immigration. </p>

<p>The amount of people in a labor force will determine the &quot;average wage level&quot;. More workers = lower wages. </p>

<p>Without illegal immigrants and H1b visas-holders, we&#39;d be in an environment tailor-made to raise wages (given that the worker pool is smaller). </p>

<p>But this is just one aspect to consider.</p>

<p>The other is the amount of circulating capital in an area. More capital flowing through the system puts pressures on the economy to lift wages up. But the thing is: The central banks are choking off liquidity. They&#39;ve given trillions in bailouts to banks and corporations--with strings attached. Do not spend this. Sit on it. Or too much money flooding into the system will trigger hyper-inflation.</p>

<p>As a result, we have the lowest velocity-rate in decades. See chart here: <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V</a></p>

<p>So, of the two metrics which determine the Wage-Fund [1) circulating capital and 2) the size of the labor force], the globalists are rigging the system to keep wages at historic lows. Americans [in terms of real dollars] haven&#39;t had a pay raise since 1979!</p>

<p>This is by design.</p>

<p>This is what the trade deals like NAFTA and the TPP were specifically set out to do. &quot;To equalize the pay-scale between the U.S. and Mexico&quot;.</p>

<p>Trump has struck out at these manipulative tactics by going after illegal immigration and the trade deals. Remove those, and you&#39;ll see wages start to float up like magic </p>

<p>Basically, it&#39;s like an scuba-tank submerged in a lake. Its natural tendency is to want to rise. It requires a lot of work and manipulation to artificially keep it down.</p>

<p>You&#39;d be shocked at how quickly wages start shooting up after global financial institutions have their stranglehold removed from the U.S. economy. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Value equivalent to minimum wage&quot; is really a function of how readily you can replace someone in that position.</p>

<p>Most minimum wage positions can be readily filled by anyone literate and with decent interpersonal skills.</p>

<p>Sadly, there&#39;s a large swath of jobs floating just above minimum wage which can&#39;t be so easily filled by plugging in a new employee. Those are the positions most hurt by gloablism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But how are you going to enforce that? Price controls, penalties for automation? </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong: I&#39;ve been &quot;left&quot; my entire life, as in anti-war and pro-working people. But good intentions must play out within reality.</p>

<p>The current dog-whistle pseudo-left doesn&#39;t understand that. Defending unlimited illegal immigration is entirely inconsistent with the desire to raise minimum wage. The immigration situation we have massively distorts the labor market and inevitably puts downward pressure on wages. Trying to treat the symptoms by raising minimum wage by fiat, instead of going after the causes, is just going to make the economy more inefficient, which isn&#39;t good for anyone.</p>

<p>So, as a leftist, since I have to choose, I prefer to protect American workers by enforcing immigration laws and yes, sending people home. I&#39;m sorry that people will be inconvenienced, but that doesn&#39;t justify the harm that is being done to American workers.</p>

<p>Of course, if we really want to benefit workers we need to end the wars, slash the military budget, abolish the Fed, stop taxing labor more than capital gains, etc.</p>

<p>I mean, I&#39;m totally sympathetic to your intentions, but our problems are a lot deeper than the minimum wage not being high enough. But then again, I&#39;m not confident at all that such reforms will be made before a general crisis happens, like Russia in the 90s or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Show me the trend where CEOs in the past have made the executive decision to make less millions in order to pay the peasants more.  It doesn&#39;t exist. More likely is the notion that they would replace min. wage workers with automation/robots.  McD&#39;s is already itesting the &#39;automated kiosk&#39; market....so, tell me, would you rather have a job at current wage levels....or no job at all since a robot can do it cheaper? The bigger picture here is the wage divide....and wage stagnation for lower and middle class workers over the last decade....while the CEOs make record salaries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Canada is raising the minimum wage to $15/h and multiple large businesses have already placed orders for more automated machines. Drugstores, Grocery and department stores, even dollar stores are all going automated. Its a 30 percent increase in minimum wage, its not sustainable or reasonable and it will hurt out economy up here. If you raise minimum wage that much in one pop you need more regulations. You need to make sure companies cant just go automated. create more subsidies for small businesses who cant afford to pay everyone that much. </p>

The only time in my life where I slightly got ahead of the curve was when I was working 50 hour weeks at that wage. Once it jumps to $14 in Jan/&#39;18 then $15 Jan/&#39;19 and the cost of living follows suit, a lot of people are going to go hungry. It&#39;s going to split the working class into two; working class and welfare class. It&#39;s basically already happened here in Ontario, $15/hour will be the nail in the coffin.

<p>That tax should have no room for loopholes. 100% goes to a branch of government that invests it back into the economy be-it with tax breaks or whatever else. If done correctly, this let&#39;s everyone involved win immensely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh? What are you getting so defensive?</p>

<p>Raising wages is one way to redistribute wealth, and wealth equality is seen as a component of a healthy economy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No defense here but we are talking about two different points in the conversation. Your point is redistributing wealth causes an influx to drive the economy, which I agree with. My point is after the pay hike you will see rising prices which increases gdp because obviously more spent pushes this indicator up but the rise in wages erodes purchasing power so employee is no better off then before in general. However the government reaps a windfall on all sides when wages and prices increase. As for name dropping who someone was working for means nothing. Obama&#39;s brilliant economic advisor says 3% growth was not possibly. 9 months later we see 3% so these experts may not be as bright as we give them credit for. Additionally anyone tied to the Clintons is useless to me as they are in bed with the worst scum of the Earth, sorry for my digression.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No rising prices driven by rising wages, key difference. Additionally I work in manufacturing and I can tell you every increase in labor drives an immediate increase in price to our customers. So I can justify my opinion from real world experience.

    <div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;ve worked at the company for almost 10 years and I&#39;ve seen it go from a small business to corporate. Interestingly, the wages were much higher when it was a small business.</p>

<p>So you were able to connect wages to prices before but now you&#39;re not able to? What do you make of that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what exactly do you mean by small business to corporate? I mean in reality that is a discussion of business ownership type and really has no bearing on this. I can have a small business with 10million in sales and a corporate entity wit h 1million in sales. Please explain what you mean exactly by those terms. If its typical corporate takeover, private equity comes in buys the organization and eliminates highest paid staff. They then work hard to drive up production and sales artificially to make the business more attractive. The company is left as a shell of its former self and is rolled into a larger organization or sold to the next corporate raider for fleecing. I never once said we could no longer tie price to wages. It always impacts price, just like changes in materials, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No you said higher wages of executives based on business size. Of course increases in wage rates at any level impact price. You alluded that if executives got paid less prices will drop, well of course it would. So your solution is to hold prices constant while increasing  lower wage rates at the expense of executive pay. Socialism much? So you have completely changed the discussion, it was about increasing wages originally. Your bias is clear here. You want executive pay to go down and  regular wages to rise. Bad news in the US we pay what your value is, sorry if you aren&#39;t worth as much as you believe you are. That&#39;s a you issue and at this points its clear we are not even talking about the same thing. To finish up I tried to discuss this with you but you are not willing or capable to acknowledge paying workers more does little for them in real world buying power when price inflation is considered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re saying is demonstrably false when considering the past 50 years in this country.</p>

<p>Right now executives make 376 times more than their average worker. Compare that to a 20 to 1 ratio in 1965. That type of inequality is not healthy for any economy.</p>

<p>When talking about increasing minimum wage people often say that will raise prices. So why isn&#39;t that same argument applied to executive pay?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are trying to say the ratio is bad for the economy, ok, and.... The discussion is will raising workers pay cause price increase, answer yes. Will the increase in wages be offset by price increase, answer yes. Is the government the one who reaps the most benefit from these wage increases answer yes. When you write down someone is saying something demonstrably wrong please provide a source, study something. You produce an opinion piece that doesn&#39;t prove anything and doesn&#39;t even address the question being discussed. So at this point you are a troll or an idiot and I refuse to waste energy on your ridiculous socialist argument as it doesn&#39;t address what is being discussed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at Apple.  They seem to be the worst offender in the PP so far.  I&#39;m expected <strong>the rich</strong> (not the dems, not the republicans), but indiscriminately the rich to be caught up in the PP dragnet.  Honestly, if you were rich too, it would be tempting.  You are asked to pay high taxes or find some quasi-legal way to not pay.  Compared to the average Mexican or African, you are rich.  YOU (reader) could give some of your money to poor Americans or poor people in the world, but chances are you do not.  You do not because like the rest of the rich people (no matter where they lay on the scale), in your interests you wish to preserve the wealth you have.  I too am like you.  I only want to give to my friends and family, and only when I know they are in genuine need.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He inherited way more than 1 million dollars. Forbes doesn&#39;t know how much debt he may have to banks outside of the US. Maybe he is worth 3.1 billion, but he started on third and thinks he hit a triple. Its funny when you are on a conspiracy form and are advocating for politicians to release their taxes and you are met with people syaing he doesn&#39;t need to. Why not? What damage is there if he does? Why wouldn&#39;t you want more information on the president? Makes no sense. I didn&#39;t support Hillary either they are both shady, but Trump is president and should be held to the same standard we had for the last several presidents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok what’s your point? It sounds like your point is trump is smart/great leader because he turned around 10 million into several billion. I’m saying he didn’t do that alone he had lots of help and he isn’t as great of a businessman as he claims to be. American banks won’t even loan to him. Why wouldn’t they loan to him if he was some incredible business man that always paid his debts? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in finance and am very familiar with financial regulations. White collar criminals will technically have money to their name but can be indebted to others in ways that cannot be tracked. One of the reason regulations are in place is to identify suspicious dealings that may indicate unsavory financial ties.</p>

<p>Donald Trump sets off every red flag for anyone familiar with financial crime. Every single one. Being a billionaire means nothing if he is on the hook to other oligarchs, the mafia, terrorists, other heads of state, etc. US banks couldn&#39;t determine who he was indebted to, so they stopped doing business with him entirely. That&#39;s not a conclusion banks come to on a whim. That&#39;s after years of unexplained, seemingly criminal activity without plausible explanation.</p>

<p>His businesses are examples of blatant fraud/money laundering fronts. Read up on his latest failure, Trump SoHo. His kids narrowly avoided prosecution for it. Or check out the Taj Mahal. A casino that went bankrupt. How exactly does a casino lose money anyway? Or you could ask the folks wth Trump University degrees how their job prospects look after getting that kind of &quot;education&quot;. Take your pick. His latest fraudulent endeavor is proposing a tax bill where his family would save a billion dollars in taxes at the expense of the rest of us.</p>

<p>Being a billionaire isn&#39;t a sign of success, especially when you can&#39;t point to something you&#39;ve accomplished to achieve it. He&#39;s left a trail of schemes, settlements, and bankruptcies behind him. That indicates that he built his inflated wealth by cheating others. And now he&#39;s governing those he cheated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, proving he lied on the FEC forms would require being able to determine who he&#39;s made earmarks/promises/IOUs to. Those kinds of things wouldn&#39;t be able to determine without some kind of investigation. So an investigation is currently happening - and they are looking into his personal finances, which he has been very unhappy about - at this point, they need to gather evidence for larger crimes. Lying on forms has been treated rather trivial (see: Jared Kushner) because he&#39;s now the president of the United States. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s my point. These things take lots of tracking to figure out because they aren&#39;t reported on a bank statement or P&amp;L. That&#39;s why we have regulations to determine suspicious activities. They cannot be proven right away, but if data is collected over time, there&#39;s usually a clear indication of what&#39;s going on. He hasn&#39;t been charged with financial crimes, but the banks in the United States distanced themselves from him years ago because they don&#39;t want to be implicated in what he has going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you actually looked at the advertisement yourself? Or are you just parroting that dope Alex Jones like a good little sheep?</p>

<p>There is nothing in that ad that says anything about there going to be a revolt against Trump. It says that people should join the protest across the country and do so until he is driven from power. It even explicitly says that they want to achieve this through &quot;non-violent protests.&quot;</p>

<p>There is nothing in that that justified the irrational fear of people claiming that antifa was going to start a civil war/armed revolt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The <em>only</em> thing Trump is good at is selling himself. He wasn&#39;t even a very successful businessman- he just happened to be born with a marketable name, managed to market it as synonymous with luxury, and then he sold the rights to put his name on things. That&#39;s how we ended up with things like Trump Airlines, Trump Beverages, Trump: The Game, Trump Casinos, Trump Magazine, Trump Mortgage, Trump Steaks, Trump Travel, Trump Communications, Trump Tower Tampa, Trump University, and Trump Vodka.</p>

<p>All of those ventures had two things in common: his name, and the fact that they failed. In almost every venture, all he did was attach his name- so when they went under, <em>he</em> didn&#39;t lose any money. The investors, though, and the employees, all bore the brunt of that failure.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a huckster, plain and simple. If he hadn&#39;t been born to wealth, he&#39;d be a used car salesman in a loud suit doing late night commercials on public access.</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s because he said things that a lot of people really wanted to hear, like how liberals were mean and other races are bad. Oh, and then there was that whole Russia thing.</p>

<p>I did my research on the man. Until just a few years ago he was considered to be a clown and a racist, now he&#39;s considered to be an idiot and a racist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehhh it is what it is. If you read Trumps books he is intelligent maybe that is because of editors, if you listen to his speech to congress it is a lot different then his speeches at rallies. Part of being a good presenter is knowing your audience and being able to speak at the level of your audience and getting your message across. This of the PHD professor that lectures like he is trying to fluff up the review board. You tune him out because you don&#39;t understand the message and then you start to have a contempt for him because he still doesn&#39;t try to make you understand and is coming off that he is better than you. Obama I believe spoke at an eighth grade level</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ehhh it is what it is. If you read Trumps books he is intelligent maybe that is because of editors, if you listen to his speech to congress it is a lot different then his speeches at rallies. Part of being a good presenter is knowing your audience and being able to speak at the level of your audience and getting your message across. This of the PHD professor that lectures like he is trying to fluff up the review board. You tune him out because you don&#39;t understand the message and then you start to have a contempt for him because he still doesn&#39;t try to make you understand and is coming off that he is better than you.

    <div class="md"><p>If you think raising the lowest level of economic compensation will help consumers or the country as a whole, you do not fully understand economics.  A $15/hr min. wage, for example, would increase the cost of doing business for many companies, henceforth resulting in higher prices for consumer goods and services.  It&#39;s all about purchasing power, and in that situation a Bigmac will likely cost you $8-10 instead of $4 or whatever it cost now.  So, given that, how much better off could a person live on minimum wage in THAT economy? InRe: consumers buying power...a deflationary environment is best as &#39;cash is king&#39;.</p>

The employee is no better off as he has to pay more for goods. However the government gets a bigger cut on employee wages, employer wage taxes and increased sales tax on higher priced goods. This is basic economics and frankly just common sense. Obviously from some posts here common sense is not as common as I would have thought.</p>
