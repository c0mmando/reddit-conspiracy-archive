        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Brendon O&#39;Connell, stalked, beaten, jailed and exiled For Speaking Out Against Israel.</p>

<p>For those of you who don&#39;t know what he&#39;s about:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When they arrest me in Australia I am going to war with the Western Australian establishment. I will operate every non violent, non compliance trick in my repertoire, and I have a few. The aim - to force a parliamentary inquiry and funding for the High Court. The simple fact is, Zionist Power is to great to expect politicians to act independently. You have to force them.</p>

<p>The best method is the hunger strike. Because of my 2012 hunger strike the Western Australian prison system changed the rules on hunger strikes. It is considered &quot;self harm&quot;. So, now, the prison will force feed a prisoner after 10 days. If you resist, they will render you unconscious with drugs. Place you in an ICU and feed you via TPN - an IV tube administering &quot;Total Parental Nutrition&quot;. That IV access is also good to administer all sorts of things while they&#39;re at it. So, make sure you ring around the hospitals - Royal Perth Hospital, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Fiona Stanley Hospital.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep it up indefinitely.</p>

<p>If I have to die, so be it. Sounds extreme? I have no life left. They took it all. I didn&#39;t help, but that&#39;s besides the point.</p>

<p>I am 46 years old. I cannot work - they told me to go on a mental health pension and forget about ever working again. They refuse to allow me to attend university rendering me, &quot;Not A Fit And Proper Person.&quot; However, lunatic Orthodox and Ultra Orthodox Jews are warmly welcomed into universities. Lunatic racist, homicidal maniacs with a religion of racism, hate, homicide and ethnic cleansing. So, Orthodox Zionist Jews are just fine. People who expose their racial and religious violent extremism are punished, vilified, stalked, harassed, threatened and killed.</p>

<p>Does this sound right to you?</p>

<p>I will fight them and their sickness to the grave.</p>

<p>Also known for:</p>

<p><a href="https://jdavismemphis.com/2017/04/27/israel-the-greatest-spy-machine-of-all-time-operation-talpiot-and-the-technion/">Israel â€“ The Greatest Spy Machine Of All Time - Operation Talpiot and the Technion</a></p>

<p>In late October 2017, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TchAvsMeBOM">Brendon O&#39;Connell has disappeared</a></p>

<p>Turns out he&#39;s been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT5at3MX1iA">arrested in New Zealand</a>. He was in custody in Mount Eden prison, which is in Auckland New Zealand.
He went to New Zealand on the word of a contact he&#39;s got within the NZ government (whose name is unknown), he was obliged to do so by him and it was suggested to Brendon to go there in order to get a fair hearing.
When he arrived in New Zealand airport (Auckland Surrey, he was approached by immigration who seemed to give him a hard time...
And Brendon being Brendon, he said &#39;Okay I&#39;ll go back to Malaysia&#39; at which point he&#39;s been arrested and held in detention.</p>

<p>Kevin Richard Foley had tried many times to contact DFAT (department of foreign affairs and trade) in Australia and basically they made it really hard for Brendon&#39;s legal team and told them nothing.</p>

<p>At this stage it seems like Brendon is in prison without charge and he&#39;s been there for over 2 weeks now.
Foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop knows who Brendon is and has a personal dislike for him because of O&#39;Connell&#39;s previous work exposing her in the past.
Because the information Brendon has, in this case within itself has the potential embarrass and devastate not just Bishop but the Australian government.</p>

<p>(I mean the fact that an Australian man is seeking political asylum from Australian government in NZ speaks volumes)</p>

<p>Brendon O&#39;Connell has had his first hearing already and is currently seeking asylum in New Zealand as a political refugee. He&#39;s awaiting his second hearing (or possible had it already by now). Worse case scenario is he gets extradited back to Australia. Please share this posts or the linked videos and spread the word.</p>

<p>TL;DR: If you don&#39;t know about Brendon&#39;s case, you need to go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFRV23uUZAf7l3tyq1CAoMA">his channel</a>, go to <a href="https://isolatebutpreserve.blogspot.nl/">his website</a> and check it out for yourself. I&#39;ve put the most important links above &#39;THE CASE IN FULL&#39;. Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT5at3MX1iA">this video</a> for a quick summary of the situation.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJrQwl9rw3A">Media Defamation Against Brendon O&#39;Connell</a> --- <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/98310463/racist-blogger-brendon-oconnell-arrested-after-trying-to-enter-new-zealand">This is the propaganda against him</a> (The usual racist and anti-semitism card)</p>

<p>If all of us don&#39;t unite and put pressure on those who want to end free speech, sooner or later we will ALL be victims of those who jailed Brendon. Harrison Christian has made a video accusing Brendon of being anti-Semitic when we all know that is a LIE. Brendon was one of the first (if not the first) to be charged under these absurd new laws which prohibit free speech. His case will undoubtedly set a precedent in future court cases, this means that THIS PARTICULAR CASE MUST BE KNOWN BY EVERYONE. Please go to <a href="https://www.change.org/p/10785677/u/21757615">https://www.change.org/p/10785677/u/21757615</a> and sign the petition to free O&#39;Connell - it&#39;s the least you can do.</p>

Again, i am asking this as you are not coming across as an honest and impartial person reading this for the first time, rather as a troll with vested interests.

    <div class="md"><p>So basically this guy was harassing some Jewish people at a supermarket, was charged under Australia&#39;s discrimination laws and then fled the country. Even if you disagree with the idea of hate speech laws, this guy is clearly a bigot and shouldn&#39;t have the right go around harassing people because of their religious beliefs because of his personal fucked up world views. Now he thinks people will care about his hunger strike in prison, get over yourself asshole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It may simply be one of the worst posts in the history of reddit. So at least props on that.</p>

<p>1) You say you don&#39;t even know what a zionist is. Maybe you should read a book or learn one of the most basic terms out there.</p>

<p>2) You don&#39;t think race should be included in everything. That&#39;s great! You should tell the zionists who advocate taking a DNA test for people to live in Israel , who give unsuspecting black ethiopian Jews birth control and who run over people with bulldozers for being on &quot;their land&quot; not to care about race either.</p>

<p>3) You&#39;ve seen nothing nefarious. Which means you haven&#39;t noticed the genocide happening in Palestine. Or the extremely influential Jews who publicly stated that Jews are superior to everyone else.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the equivelant of your comment:</p>

<p>Person 1: the KKK is bad.</p>

<p>You: I have no idea what the KKK is but it seems you are picking on them for nothing! </p>

<p>In other words, maybe don&#39;t be a fuck stick to someone if you want them to be receptive.
