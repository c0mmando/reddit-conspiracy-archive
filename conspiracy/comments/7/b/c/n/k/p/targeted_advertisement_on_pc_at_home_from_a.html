A coworker was telling me about how his son might have gotten HIV from his boyfriend, when I asked why he said he found HIV medication, and he knew it was HIV medication because he googled it. My phone was out during this conversation. My google account is attached to both my phone and home PC. I use google chrome. When I got home I was watching youtube videos and I got an HIV medication advertisement, the medication was called Prezcobix. Wrote it down. Also I do not have a facebook.<br/>
EDIT: I have never googled HIV in my life, and it&#39;s such a rare disease I can&#39;t think of one time in years this has come up in conversation.</p>

<p>None of that really matters if you install even one bad app on your phone. Ever see that warning &quot;This app uses storage, camera, contact list, microphone, GPS, etc&quot; when installing one. Yep, perfect spy program. It will capture your data and sell it off to ad networks that can correlate who you are with tons of other data your computers leak. </p>

<p>I am an old guy, NEVER google, talk about, text about, nor really even think about yoga.  Was talking to my brother and he says &#39;well, I&#39;m thinking about taking a yoga class to help with flexibility&#39;.  Me says &#39;ahhh, so you&#39;re also hoping to meet a hot sexy chick in yoga pants too!&#39;  Us:  hahahaha, hang up.</p>

<p>I go have a smoke, and on same phone fire up zerohedge to check up on fight club.  Ad squarely presented to me for yoga pants from lululemon.  Literally not more then 5 minutes after phone call.</p>

<p>I went in and disabled microphone access for just about everything, but annoyed/creeped the living shit outta me. As soon as I get up off my ass and go get a USB dongle for cell phone data sharing, gonna go back to my old dumb flipphone.</p>

<p>&quot;Whats become of you my old flame!!  why oh WHY have they turned you into a whore!!  you were once so pretty in your tight black yoga pants!&quot;</p>

<p>This podcast is just some food for thought. I&#39;m not suggesting your phone isn&#39;t listening to you and your conversations, but there are other ways apps and companies can mine data from their networks for targeted advertising. It&#39;s interesting if nothing else. </p>

We don&#39;t have to ascribe judgments of right or wrong to appreciate cleverness when demonstrated in questionable ways by these large companies.

<p>Browser cookies, and browser/online fingerprints. </p>

<p>Everything you do online and communicate is catalogued by NSA, Facebook, Amazon, Google</p>

<p>You have a little space on a RAID array somewhere, with everything about you in that space. Your conversations. Interests. Porn fetishes. Your entire digital fingerprint. </p>

<p>If you’ve ever worked with a lawyer in a federal case, cell phones, TVs, laptops, anything connected to the internet is left behind to have a truly confidential conversation. </p>

<p>Android phone in my pocket, screen locked.</p>

<p>I stopped in electrical section and was looking at Levitron smart home devices on the shelf. (light switches etc.)  I didn&#39;t talk to myself or anyone else when I was checking these out, reading the boxes etc.</p>

<p>A couple of hours later I was home and on Amazon.ca and looked at the &quot;daily deals&quot; section, and low and behold there were a number of Levitron smart home devices listed on sale.</p>

<p>I&#39;d never looked on my phone or PC&#39;s at these devices, and have never done a search on Amazon for these devices.</p>

<p>Very strange, I can understand your phone or tv listening to you, but I had not talked to anyone when looking at these products.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plausible scenario:</p>

<p>When you Google something on Yahoo ;-), your targeted avertising ID can be updated with new content especially profiled for you. Your IP is recognized as well.</p>

<p>Then you may log in to Facebook or any other social media app. Targeted ads pop up. Your IP is recognized. Your interactions are recorded and Ad ID contents may be updated accordingly. Social media information system naturally obtains all data regarding your
friends and followers, level of communication activity between certain individuals, other accounts etc. I.E. the system knows YOUR digitalized social network, because the system IS your digitalized social network.</p>

<p>Now, because the system knows also your friends&#39; IPs and can update their targeted ad contents, it is very very easy to share same ads among any socially connected group - i.e ads initially targeted for you only.</p>

<p>This scenario does not require any phone mic hacking or mobile device surveillance. All this needs is that the applications you use, utilize the same targeted ad providers OR multiple targeted ad providers share their data with each other on the background w/o you knowing it. I am not sure how legal or illegal this would be. From consumer&#39;s privacy point of view this is kind of grey-zone, but most probably you failed to read the small print when you created the social media account, installed your browser, accepted the cookies, and agreed the service terms and privacy policy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a known advertising tactics to target key individuals or smaller key groups who potentially are seen as early adopters within their larger/surrounding social network. If they buy, the rest will follow. Also, tightly bonded groups may have similar interests, needs and over all consuming behaviour.</p>

<p>So, advertising content that is automatically shared between socially active &quot;sub-network&quot; members makes business wise total sense - eventhough it violates our expectations about our right to privacy - which we agreed not to have.</p>

<p>To some extent there are parties e.g. EU, national legislations, internet privacy organizations etc. trying to block this development. For us. Because we, The People, The Consumers are too damn dumb to do it ourselves.</p>

<p>Ehheh:</p>

<p>This link just describes the first, visible layer of a bitter onion. Of course layers go deeper. So, dig deeper. Keep crying. Listen to Iron Maiden&#39;s &quot;The Prisoner&quot;...</p>
