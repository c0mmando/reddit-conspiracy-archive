Let's not get into bi-partisan discussions, just hear me out: yeah, it's easy for all of us to love the idea of a US President "draining the swamp". Please, let's be critical and alert. That's all I'm asking for. And remember to ask for more. Light has to shine EVERYWHERE, not only on the things that a POTUS might expose or clean up. And ultimately that's OUR responsibility.

       Best part right here. If you recall, this group also broke the Panama Papers story, which barely touched on Soros' even though he was implicated in that release. Obviously he hid his unscrupulous practices, since he was funding the release. No doubt we'll see the same with the Panama papers. Anyone in with Soros will surely be omitted. That shouldn't stop us from coming down hard on the people implicated, but we should be making an earnest effort to disclose Soros' questionable practices as well.

       Interesting thought. Did not know that about Soros and the Panama Papers.

       Is it possible he's leaking these to distract from waht's going on in SA right now?

       Idk perhaps, anything is possible. I don't pretend to know what goes on behind those elite, closed doors, beyond the extent of "nothin' good". There's certainly a motive to use such releases to take down competing cabals. Evil men only bring to light evil strategically, and never their own evils.
