<li><p><strong>JFK Files</strong>. Lots of drama, but in the end CIA can release what they wish and what&#39;s best for them, eh?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trump is our savior</strong>. POTUS is going to save the US and the world, and he&#39;s not part of the establishment at all! Let&#39;s not get into bi-partisan discussions, just hear me out: yeah, it&#39;s easy for all of us to love the idea of a US President &quot;draining the swamp&quot;. Please, let&#39;s be critical and alert. That&#39;s all I&#39;m asking for. And remember to ask for more. Light has to shine EVERYWHERE, not only on the things that a POTUS might expose or clean up. And ultimately that&#39;s OUR responsibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Paradise Papers</strong>. Funnelled through an institution called ICIJ which is funded by Soros. That stuff is establishment, not grassroots. Best case is that it&#39;s one Cabal faction against another. Either way, they don&#39;t have OUR best interests at heart.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weinstein / Spacey / Corey&#39;s targets</strong>. Small fishes. What about Alefantis and all the other &quot;elite&quot; pedosadists? &#39;Nuff said.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Saudi arrests</strong>. Saudi Arabia can only be redeemed if it stops supporting terrorism, stops being full of rich assholes abusing children and stops being a puppet to Israel and US Zionist Forces.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Israel/Zionists/Netanyahu</strong>. Not a Limited Hangout, but nobody&#39;s talking about them or doing anything about them. Instead a bunch of LHs try to divert attention from things like this.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Stay safe and alert, people. Don&#39;t let the Smoke and Mirrors get you.</p>

<p>Best part right here. If you recall, this group also broke the Panama Papers story, which barely touched on Soros&#39; even though he was implicated in that release. Obviously he hid his unscrupulous practices, since he was funding the release. No doubt we&#39;ll see the same with the Panama papers. Anyone in with Soros will surely be omitted. That shouldn&#39;t stop us from coming down hard on the people implicated, but we should be making an earnest effort to disclose Soros&#39; questionable practices as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting thought. Did not know that about Soros and the Panama Papers.</p>

<p>Is it possible he&#39;s leaking these to distract from waht&#39;s going on in SA right now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk perhaps, anything is possible. I don&#39;t pretend to know what goes on behind those elite, closed doors, beyond the extent of &quot;nothin&#39; good&quot;. There&#39;s certainly a motive to use such releases to take down competing cabals. Evil men only bring to light evil strategically, and never their own evils.</p>
