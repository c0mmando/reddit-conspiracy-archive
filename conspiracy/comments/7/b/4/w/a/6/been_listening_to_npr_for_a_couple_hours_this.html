       I didn't interpret that as keeping tabs on NPR so much as keeping tabs on the people who listen to NPR and what they're being told. Sorry if I misunderstood but to me it sounded like "NPR listeners are the enemy."

       Tom Ashbrook is an interesting character, it seems over the last 8 years or so his show is split in half. The first half seems to be CIA pr and the second half is something random like cooking or equally as stupid.

       It got 12 times worse... but not in the last year.  It's been steadily declining since Bush was in office.

       "We're taking about NPR though." A person can be a liberal &amp; listen to npr
       <em>
        and

       believe that conspiracies happen. I, for example, am a pretty far-to-the-left example of this &amp; I'm certainly not alone. It's actually, in my observation anyway, a pretty recent thing that conspiracy conversations are so often flooded with hardline conservatives/republicans.

       Conspiracy in the US, from my view, was always pretty bi-partisan. Aren't the original American conspiracies "they're coming for our guns" and "globalists are taking over"? Sure in the early 2000s W.Bush took a lot of it, and there was the whole "Monstanto maaaaan" and "William Hurst made pot illegal maaaan", but calling it a normally liberal place of discussion is just a little uninformed. Which would be natural depending on when you joined the conversation. 
Also, I'd bet my house that the majority of the conservative influx you're experiencing are people who considered themselves liberal or center in 2015. Most were probably Obama voters.  I think the 2015-16 news cycle pushed a lot of people to the right.

       Being a liberal, especially an anti-war one, in the few years after 9/11 was pretty rough. I'd definitely say that deeper lines were starting to be drawn in a lib/con sense, maybe we just started noticing our differences more. Also: I was just
       <em>
        obsessed
       </em>
       with the waco/okc stories in the 90's; still am, tbh.

       I believe what they said, is that they use a variety of sources before they form an opinion. Why should anyone have to discount any certain source?
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm seeing in comments reflects the idea that people tend to have different opinions. I'm a conservative but I believe npr usually gives a less biased opinion than most MSM, or at least attempts better journalistic integrity.. and unfortunately on the right there's not much I find that isn't heavily biased, so I have to decide for myself what's true between multiple sources on all sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you truly ignore and discount and one source, you'll simply never know if they make any attempt to improve their journalistic integrity. Besides that, that's a simpleton's way of viewing the world. If you're able to think critically, then why avoid any information?
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I think people that avoid certain sources are afraid it's gonna hurt their feefees. A grown ass person should be able to read information that goes against their beliefs, especially if they want to be better informed.

       I'd have to disagree with NPR's bias. I think they're as neoliberal as any mainstream source out there. I don't think they give anything right of Marco Rubio a fair shake in arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
       My comment was trying to point out the irony of being downvoted for criticizing NPR on a conspiracy board. I also got a lot of flack for making a similar comment about the AP, which I found even more absurd because the AP literally is the "official story".

       I think the problem is a lack of independent investigation.. Before the 24 hour news cycle, they actually spent much more time trying information for themselves. Now, they use the news wire, and the majority just cite each other as sources while interpreting the source with whatever their bias is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like Laura Loomer, except not looking for facts that supports what you're trying to prove, but simply following the facts while trying to have integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think all these alternative news sources need to practice what it is that mainstream media
       <em>
        stopped
       </em>
       doing, because the shit I read is the exact same thing.. with an edgy interpretation instead of trying to go find facts for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       In all, the problem really started with the 24 hour news cycle, they just pump out as much news as possible, and they stopped putting effort into the actual news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically high effort posts versus shitposts. The media is shitposting more than they're high effort posting.

       Maybe it's always been like this and we're just hyper-aware now because of how fast the hive can fact check everything. I mean, do we even know what a real, impartial, international news wire would have looked like in the 70s or 80s?

       I think you’re correct. This sub should ideally question mainstream narratives. But there’s been such a huge influx of alt-right/Trumpshilling posters who hypocritically bash the MSM, yet give FOX, Breitbart and other right-wing sources the benefit of the doubt. They’ll deny the FOX trust, but their talking points and views betray them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So your seeing pushback to that here now, all over this sub. In the last month or so, those not worshipping Dear Leader have been vocal about it. It was inevitable. As much as we should be questioning the mainstream narratives, we should also be questioning the current administration. Homeostasis of the sub is being sought after an unhealthy (but short-lived) imbalance occurred of blind acceptance and groveling hero worship. It’s for the best.

       It's more like your criticism of NPR along with the general divisive and superior tone suggests that you drink from conservative outlets that encourage a certain attitude and mindset that everyone else can pick up on once they've been to those websites/forums and read what they read.

       Your assumptions are wrong. If you don't want to be called dumb stop writing dumb shit. Left and Right politics is divide and conquer. I listen to NPR all my life. Instead of assuming and making stupid comments why not ask me. Classical Liberal. I don't listen to conservative bullshit the same way I cringe at progressives.

       Because you think that anyone who could argue with your points must be a liberal. Good grief. If there are more than a couple groups picking fights with conservative these days, those who still consider themselves in that camp maybe should start doing some reflection on why so many people take issues with them. Fuckin a. The idea that someone could argue with you is so wild to you that your next best explanation is that I'm "forum sliding tactic to wear me out with nonsense".

       I just reread our exchange. I once played chess with a schizophrenic. You remind me of that.  What you think occured and what actually happened are two different things.  I have no clue how you think you challenged my world view. You cam acted like a dick made a bunch of way off accusations and assumptions. In my attempt to figure out just wtf you were talking about you flipped it and accused me of assuming, because of one of my guess's and now you have won lmao, just like that game of chess.  Whatever good luck to ya!

       I don't think people get it, it's on bluetooth speaker playing louder than my wife can deal with. I can hear it throughout the house. 
I DID NO HEAR THOSE STORIES ALL MORNING. I heard about the shooting 20 times or so.

       I have no agenda. I thought it was crazy that no mention of Saudi insanity so I posted. I hang out in /new and had no idea this would make it to front page. Where most of you mules would see it.

       Better question is why does anyone have to report on what you think is important? There's a lot of shit going on in the world, I'd rather they (or other sources) cover the things others aren't focused on, rather than be the talking heads (like CNN) that can latch on and talk all day
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       what they think is important.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you think is important isn't really important to me, and that's how opinions work. They've gotta cater to everyone, not just you. More diverse news is better if you ask me.

       It's not so important it needs to be talked about constantly, more important than everything else. I'm more concerned with events actually happening in our country, and both of the things you're concerned about are things we will find out more details about over time.

       Of course they are. He wasn't "allowed" to purchase the guns legally but he still did. Obviously they're going to try to make it even harder to purchase weapons, especially if you any sort of record. You can already here the bullshit they're pushing.

       That’s fucked up. Not an accidental oversight, obviously. But I guess it’s no surprise the old sociopaths are hiding funds. Got to hide the money somewhere to pay off witnesses to missing and murdered native children in Canada and Australia! And Prince Andrew’s overseas pedoventures don’t pay for themselves either.

       I realized npr was completely compromised when they tried to do "political debates" where both sides jumped over each other to demonize trump and they called it bipartisan because they had a conservative/republican side represented by an establishment/never-trumper. Another redpill is pbs...pay attention to the fine print when you're watching that channel. They like to say names/roles/organisations really quickly/subtly...it's the same 5 sources and they bring in a lot of extremist contributors from the sjw side hoping that you won't notice because they're dressed up nice.

       My thing with NPR and On Point in particular is the callers. Notice how well spoken all of them are. Some guy claiming to be a truck driver calls in and hammers out major opinion manipulating talking points and he sounds more like a Stanford Professor than a truck driver.  This happens over and over. I think the CIA or other special interests groups call in pretending to be soccer moms, truck drivers, activists all the time. It's fucking fake more times than not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have pointed this out to a friend and a couple of months later he said he thinks I am right. If you listen critically the callers are all fake pushing a narrative.

       They combine to create our version of the BBC. Luckily almost half of all people are smart enough to reject them and they lose a lot of credibility by having a base that is particularly partisan. England isn't that lucky.

       I heard them mention that yesterday morning. It was basically a headline quickly followed by, "but there's little evidence to support that". Then they seamlessly transitioned to talk in depth about how Trump was inciting civil war within the Republican Party. Which is a bigger story? Seems pretty damn biased.

       Yes.  NPR is the propaganda long-game.  Propaganda for the "educated".  Yet if you pay attention, over the long run, NPR is extremely biased with the stories they draw attention to,
       <em>
        and the stories they omit
       </em>
       .  They have also taken I think it's $1.8 million in money from Soros's Open Foundation.  (It's even listed on the NPR website, so at least they're honest about that.)

       I've been listening to npr for ages. It'd never been clearer to me that they are a bought and paid for news organization.  I used to swear that they were unbiased, for better or worse with my age the picture is coming into focus.

       Fuck NPR - I gave to them for many years but never again. I knew they were fucked when I heard this interview:
       <a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/06/nprs-diane-rehm-asks-bernie-sanders-about-israeli-citizenship-rumors-208583">

       Why don't we ever talk about all the posts that are clearly misinformation and start tagging people for accuracy since so many of our top posters are so clearly posting fake stories?
