No one would believe the Clinton camp did if they fell first.  Besides, what is going on in DC with PizzaGate, Spirit Cooking, and adrenaline-laced blood transfusions is so shocking the public needs prepared anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There may be two opposite conceptions of the development of this issue: (1) the &quot;more permissive&quot; left may indeed see this as a strategy to <em>normalize border-line behaviors</em> (50 shades, LGBT, extreme porn, various fetishes - some of which are still illegal) by the public&#39;s gradual acceptance that its just how things are; (2) the &quot;more judgmental&quot; right may be on a serious campaign to root out the most horrific practices (cp and trafficking) and link those who are involved to political opponents as well. Time will tell which of those tendencies evolve, and the socio-political effects of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Omg gay marriage is going to normalize bestiality and pedophilia and group marriage!&quot;</p>

<p>No, the state needed and lacks a compelling reason to discriminate among consenting adult two-person relationships on the basis of sex, for access to a state-contrived legal arrangement conferring certain benefits and responsibilities.</p>

<p>Animals and children aren&#39;t consenting adults, and groups aren&#39;t the same as couples. There is no slippery slope.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t get this &quot;the elite want to turn everyone gay!&quot; meme. A man realizing that he&#39;s capable of intimate sexual relationships with other men would be incredibly empowering compared to the emasculating, oppressive heterosexual and reproductive relationships that so many guys I know are in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for offending. The phenomenon I am looking at is the gradual reformulation of what activities are socially acceptable. All I&#39;m asking you to consider is that 60 years ago LGBT was socially unacceptable, 40 years ago plain porn was unacceptable, 20 years ago extreme porn was unacceptable. What is unacceptable now may in the future be acceptable. It&#39;s the sexual-normalcy Overton Window shifting. Is this a discussion you can address or not?</p>

<p>Also, I stated a case for two tendencies with inverted motives and goals - &quot;permissive&quot; and &quot;judgmental&quot;. Which do you consider yourself as? Which goal do you consider as the proper goal? </p>

<p>How do you presume to know what my opinion is? Did I state it? Was anything actually specifically anti-LGBT in it? Was the analysis incorrect? Was it useful? Was it a responsible use of free speech?</p>

<p>Finally, I gave two perspectives on a topic that has filled the internet for a month. Do you think that this kind of social-sexual-political commentary should be banned? Should only one perspective be banned? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably yes.  What I have learned is pretty horrific, but it involves children and taking their blood once it is maximally saturated with adrenaline. That blood is then pumped into the elites.  It rejuvenates the body better than any plastic surgery.  This is why Joan Rivers looked as she did, but Johnny Depp looks as he does.</p>

<p>...which means these children are intentionally horrified in order to boost their adrenaline, which answers the &#39;why would these sickos sexually abuse and torture innocent kids&#39; question. Seems like a lucrative way to synergize 2 profit centers: CP/trafficking along with a source of young blood with elevated adrenaline. Dear god this is awful. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39; the vidence that the blood of the young rejuvenate the old: <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fountain-of-youth-young-blood-infusions-ldquo-rejuvenate-rdquo-old-mice/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fountain-of-youth-young-blood-infusions-ldquo-rejuvenate-rdquo-old-mice/</a></p>

<p>The idea is that they take the blood of the young for this purpose and the adrenochrome part (it&#39; not adrenaline, it&#39;s adrenchrome which is diferent, oxidized adrenaline I think) is that it&#39;s a type of high you get from it. So they could inject straight adrenaine but that woudnt give the youthful rejuvenating properties.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the religious component, another reason why they torture and murder children. Many whistleblowers have claimed that the elite, or many of the elite, are part of a cult that&#39;s basd around Lucifer and they basically see themselves as different from &#39;the masses&#39; and view other human beings as inferior and kind of in the same way other people view livestock or insects. So as well as usig children&#39;s blood for a high and for youth-giving properties, they also do it as part of religious rituals and see their torture and murder as having spiritual significance. Then there is the fact that all this stuff is used as a system of control - they get people involved in these rituals to terrify them, or to compromise them so that they&#39;l be blackmailable or too scared to bow the whistle or get scared into doing whatever they want. So that&#39;s why all these politicians and celebrities nd people who have some measure of power and control over public perceptions and policies etc, end up being outed as pedophiles - they are either chosen due to their perversions and sociopathic personlities, which mean they are willing and ale to do immoral things and also make them blackmailable.</p>

<p>So there are various levels to it.</p>

<p>Seems like a lot of work for something that isn&#39;t even a controlled substance. </p>

<p>The article you linked doesn&#39;t really show &#39;young blood rejuvenating the old&#39; so much as it shows that a deficiency of CSF2 and TIMP2 impairs brain function. </p>

Far from being distracting it brings all those associations and connections together and provides an actual reason for why that degree of corruption and perversity was possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump was a disliked late-comer and interloper in both Hollywood and politics. In something of a league of his own, if you like, compared to those others. </p>

<p>He&#39;s blunt, boorish, and despite his wealth rather &quot;common&quot; and anything but sophisticated or a bon-vivant but he knows how to cater to those types and anyone else because that&#39;s the business he was in. </p>

<p>Now there have been claims and counter claims with women that know him stating that they&#39;ve been offered substantial amounts of money if they&#39;d falsely accuse him of improper sexual advances. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also been said that he flew at least once on Epstein&#39;s Lolita Express to Epstein&#39;s pleasure island but the same flight log that listed Bill Clinton&#39;s 26 trips and Hillary&#39;s six, makes no mention of him ever being on that plane at all. So I&#39;ve left him aside for now until something more substantial turns up. Doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve discounted the possibility, it&#39;s just that there&#39;s far more dirt flying around all those others and not just sex-capades but serious political corruption and criminality that may even include human trafficking a well.</p>

When I first found out pizzagate was undeniably real I was devastated, it seriously affected me and impacted me on a personal level- it is going to deeply hurt and traumatise people and I think all these gradual revelations are part of a plan that leads to as full a disclosure as possible in such a way that prevents total societal psychological meltdown and also begins prep for what comes next. </p>

Te Queen asked Rolf Harris to do her portrait one year becuse they were friends. Prince Andrew is friends with Jeffery Epstein and was accused of rape by  girl, but it all just got wept under the rug. It&#39;s just so obvious that there&#39;s something wrong going on there - does anyone really think that British intelligence had no idea what peopl who get that close to the Royals have in their closet? Then there&#39;s the weird stuff like the body found in one of the Royal estates of a youn girl, the accusations of abuse and a pedophile ring at Buckingham palace that came out in 2014, the police who came forwrd to say a member of the royal family was investigated as part of a pedophile ring invetigation but it wa covred up- that is all a hel of a lot of smoke and yet no one seems to connect the dots and most Brits think claims that the Royals are pedos are insane. To me it&#39;s insane to think they AREN&#39;T pedophiles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are 2 things that are happening.
1.  Legitimate information is getting out there regarding evil acts that people have done.
2.  Damage control is being done by the deep state, where they sacrifice some of their own, by admitting to things that are less bad and linking them to terms of things that are bad.  So you get things like the elites are groping women in public, or jerking off in plants/casting couch type scenarios, but you don’t talk about taping children to tables or kill rooms or worshipping Moloch or anything like that.</p>

<p>I just don’t see #2 working long term.  I think we’re well past critical mass, where there’s too many of these stories that people can’t ignore them any more.  I think it’s just going to keep snowballing rather than leveling off at whatever damage control level they think is acceptable.</p>

<p>Ok so seriously, I have been visiting this page a lot and I see a great deal of information pertaining to satanic rituals/satanic worship by the global elite. I hadn&#39;t heard much about this prior to maybe a year or so ago. Why do they do this? Does it really give them power over others? Seems strange and so foreign to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I struggle to think that any normal, sane person could make much sense of it.  There’s just all the clues that they are doing it.  I’m not well versed on this and am just spit-balling here, but here’s some of my thoughts.  I think they clearly use these rituals as a gateway.  If they don’t have something to blackmail you with you don’t get into the club (or to move up in the club or whatever).  Some of it are sacrifices to their gods.  I think they also believe there’s a magical component to these things where they draw power from their rituals.  Some of it, I think is just pure sociopathic behavior where they get pleasure out of dominating and abusing others.</p>

<p>I think someone more well versed in their religion would have better offerings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My ultimate favorite is that <em>being a pedophilia survivor makes you gay</em>. I&#39;ve had that directly said to me here, that because I&#39;m a bi female, I must have been molested. </p>

<p>I mean, I was. The only statistic that I&#39;ve seen in real life about sex abuse that proved to be true was 3 out of 4 victims will end up abusing drugs or committing self-harm. We had a 4 bed room in rehab, and 3/4 had been sexually abused. </p>

<p>My biggest concern with pedophilia &quot;awareness&quot; now is that parents are concerned about stranger danger. No one&#39;s talking about incest. Even in the domestic violence programs or therapy circles, we&#39;re not calling it INCEST, but minimizing the abuse. Being molested by a family member is a double violation of trust and safety. </p>
