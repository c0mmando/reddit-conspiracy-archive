    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I am from the country where Dutroux&#39;s case happened. Immediately everything was covered up when this was discovered. His wife has even been released a few years ago. There were ties with sects, pedo rings, high-up politicians, judges, police officers, even royals.. we live in an extremely corrupt country, even though on the surface it looks like our country is free.</p>

<p>Also, the Brabant Killers murder and terror sprees have been covered up even 30 years later. The case was cold, until our #1 lawyer started leaking information to the public, and the media and judges are trying to keep him quiet now and trying to calm down the public. Apparently the highest police officers assisted in murdering our own citizens to create terror.</p>

<p>It’s fine if we like their work, but we have to admit and acknowledge they are shit people who abuse and rape. I️ mean for Christ sake, every single woody Allen movie (but one? The Sophia vagara movie is one I️ have not seen) contains the plot line of a well older man in a relationship with a minor or barely legal female. It’s pretty clear where he stands, especially marrying his adopted child. </p>

I just hope that the people reading this thread are here in support of making what has been wrong for so long, finally right. Not because of the gossip or because we want to see something exciting happen. These sick sick people deserve to be exposed. I believe this goes deeper than any of our minds can even fathom. Most likely it&#39;s root grow much further below the ground than one would think. These disgusting perversions are without a doubt linked to all high profile people with a lot of sway. So it makes me wonder, what came first, the chicken or the egg? Are they famous and powerful because they like children? Or is this something that they begin to partake in after they gain their money, fame and power? Makes you wonder doesn&#39;t it? It would appear to any reasonable person after reviewing evidence that there seems to be a connection between these behaviors and gaining fame. Fame that only can be achieved once in a billion lifetimes. What do you think fellas and ladies? What is the connection between the elite and the attraction to children? Why are so many of them like this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When these people ascend to the heights of the social ladder they may find that normal thrills just don’t cut it anymore.   Pedophilia and gross displays of power may be one of very few things that rile them up the same way driving a race car or having alone time with the partner would for most people.     </p>

<p>I’m beginning to think that real decency or decency as I would like it to be is somewhat of a rare thing, and in some way tied to necessity.    That people are decent because it is easier to be decent.   But when they have an opportunity to be indecent without consequence then that is when true morality shows and it may not be as alluring as we’d like to think.   </p>

<p>My thoughts may change by morning, but it seems to me that some people are just selfish, abusive, and ultimately weak and insecure animals lusting for sex and power without concern for ethics and without guiding principal.    If there is a bright side it may be that all the refinements and shows of class and privilege can’t withhold how pitiful and deserving of scorn these creatures are.    And too, in the end those with real decency can show something so wholesome, strong, and upright that one would have to question its source and wish to attain it themselves.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, you&#39;ve got it all wrong. All this stuff coming out isn&#39;t something meant to shock us at this point. It may have been, but they&#39;re already working around that now. The point now is to tenderize us for it. In the same way that it was so controversial when we would find out old celebrities like Rock Hudson was gay, but now when a celebrity comes out it&#39;s celebrated. They are getting us ready for a time in America when this kind of stuff will be legal and okay. First it will be a mental problem, then it will become a lifestyle choice. If they get any kids to start coming out saying they are doing it willingly, then they can push for lowering the age of consent. They will push for new legislation much in the same way they have for gay marriage and transgender rights, saying that it&#39;s not a choice.</p>
