    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t doubt for a second this is a thing. But, consider this too. I work until 5, and having access to a real keyboard dramatically increases the volume of material I put on reddit. I am 99% a comment guy though. Don&#39;t look at the last couple weeks of my history, got a lot of work and life being lifey shit and I&#39;m not doing tons of reddit atm. But generally I would drop at least 50 comments between 8 and 5. There are people just like me that mostly make posts though. Then I get home, and I hate reddit on my phone, I&#39;m much more likely just to read a lot. So, this should be factored in too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just today,  but for the past few weeks. The new queue is almost unreadable because 90% of it is national enquirer bullshit or racist propaganda. Sometimes multiple posts per minute. When you look at the history of the posters they non stop spam about a dozen threads. We are obviously being prepped to be banned. Media will write stories about how crazy we were and they will use those stories as the proof.</p>

<p>About 5:05 today the spam just stopped. Its been great. Still 30% insane stuff, but at least its genuine delusions and not what basically amounts to intellectual terrorism. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is something we can do but it will take a lot of work.</p>

<p>First you need to understand what clustering algorithms are. They are used for classification in machine learning. So someone writes a program that rates posters on a variety of criteria. You then create a matrix of all the posters with their various scores on these criteria. You then plot the posters on an NxN graph where N is the number of criteria they are scored on. Then you measure the distance between each poster and each other poster using an N-dimensional version of the Pythagorean theorem. </p>

<p>Once you have these distances you see clusters of posters that have similar scores. Each cluster represents an type of poster. You can then look at stats like when each cluster posts and what kind of posts they make. We would probably find that there are different groups with different agendas shitposting here.</p>

<p>I can do this but its a shitload of work and I have a job. If there are any comp sci folks on here with time on their hands I will send you $100 of Dash for doing this work. If you can make a webpage that filters r/conspiracy/new and marks up each post with its cluster I will increase it to $200 of Dash. If you don&#39;t know what Dash is then go find out!</p>
