        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was born in Tallahassee, Florida 1990. I moved from there to Pensacola in ’97. I then moved from Pensacola to a town my mother and father were both from several generations back called Ft. Walton Beach. I&#39;m a Florida Cracker. The place I have grown up in my entire life is ultra conservative and very patriotic. I grew up respecting my country and what we stood for. I felt so much pride knowing I lived in America. So , let&#39;s kick it to today. I&#39;m 27. I own 2 houses, I pay for my own education and take 2 classes a semester an night college. I am a certified hvac technician and work a full time job. I have a 3 year old and a newborn. I am married. Life is  damn depressing. Ever since I watched loose change I feel like it&#39;s all a facade. I feel like I&#39;m Jim carry in the Truman show. What I mean is that a lot of people around me and my environment don&#39;t see the big picture. We are owned by oligarchs. War is pointless. War is a business. Our banking system is a sham . I feel like I&#39;m in a perpetual cycle where nothing changes and that I&#39;m a modern slave. P.s , I do see a therapist once a week, and Truman show was filmed near where I live and work. Also, I smoke pot</p>

I hate special intrest groups and I hate citizens United. Everyone says hold on things are happening. I feel like nothing changes. Thanks for the words of friendship.

    <div class="md"><p>It might not be entirely evident that stuff is moving but I can tell you it is. The problem with the media right now is that we&#39;re fed jack shit, gotta find all the info yourself, even if just rumors or small steps</p>

<p>That being said, Saudi Arabia purge is linked to Trump. It is no coincidence that 2 weeks after Trump&#39;s visit, the King changes the next king from a cia preferred candidate to his son who&#39;s pushing for women driving and other great issues</p>

<p>Then Jarred Kushner takes a secret trip to SA and now the purge begins? Is he even back from there?</p>

<p>We should see action in the US rather soonish, Donna Brazile turning on clinton is a good indicator, Tony Podesta stepping down is important too, Mueller most likely after him, we should get confirmation any day now lol</p>

<p>we&#39;ve been screaming possibly the truth for a year, now that they&#39;re forced to talk about it, trying to shift blame will be hard since we&#39;ll be retroactively correct and not conspiracy <em>theories</em> anymore :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it seems intriguing, I work in an office now sitting all day and I miss blue collar work.  I studied auto mechanics in college and did it for serveral years, so I have some background in that.  Of course it was automotive AC, not residential or commercial, heating is different, all the pipes fit with hose clamps or o-rings, soldering was electrical not copper pipes, nothing in a car should flush, it was 12.6 volts DC, not 120 or 240 AC.  I would need to go back to school for a couple years to learn it.  But my knees hurt and back hurt from sitting, I&#39;m bored and this doesn&#39;t pay that great with no future of being self employed.  You ever think about starting your own business? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve thought about starting my own business, but that takes a lot of time and wisdom. I&#39;m currently going to school to be an electrical engineer. I know what you mean about being in an office all day. I know my ass belongs outside. As far as the automotive air conditioning goes , it&#39;s the same principal. You have a condenser, compressor, evaporator, and metering device. If you understand that concept you can quickly figure out the piping, refrigerants, and voltages. It&#39;s really simple. When I first went to school for HVAC I was like wtf are they talking about. Now it&#39;s like jerking off, it&#39;s just happens naturally. I have self respect for myself knowing that I contribute to society . The day I knew I was respected was when I ran a service call for a company who had a bunch of older men present when I was diagnosing a system. They all shut up and listened when I began to talk. They would ask questions and I would answer them. It was an awesome experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look I have nothing against people having religion in their life. To me, whether you are Catholic, Baptist, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, or Buddhist, it don&#39;t make a damn. It&#39;s all fake . Its not real at all. I can&#39;t even argue with you because it&#39;s pointless. Religion is like santa</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work for a good company. I make 18/ hour with 3% commission. I use to work for a company in Destin and would work 90 hours in a week on call. The company I work for now stays away from the resort companies so we don&#39;t work ridiculous hours. Winter gets kind of slow, but this year we have been steady. Just know that you will go on call as a technician</p>
