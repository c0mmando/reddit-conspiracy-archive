       I was born in Tallahassee, Florida 1990. I moved from there to Pensacola in ’97. I then moved from Pensacola to a town my mother and father were both from several generations back called Ft. Walton Beach. I'm a Florida Cracker. The place I have grown up in my entire life is ultra conservative and very patriotic. I grew up respecting my country and what we stood for. I felt so much pride knowing I lived in America. So , let's kick it to today. I'm 27. I own 2 houses, I pay for my own education and take 2 classes a semester an night college. I am a certified hvac technician and work a full time job. I have a 3 year old and a newborn. I am married. Life is  damn depressing. Ever since I watched loose change I feel like it's all a facade. I feel like I'm Jim carry in the Truman show. What I mean is that a lot of people around me and my environment don't see the big picture. We are owned by oligarchs. War is pointless. War is a business. Our banking system is a sham . I feel like I'm in a perpetual cycle where nothing changes and that I'm a modern slave. P.s , I do see a therapist once a week, and Truman show was filmed near where I live and work. Also, I smoke pot

       I voted Trump because it was a vote against Hillary. I had hope in the back of my mind that Trump would stick to his rhetoric. I hate special intrest groups and I hate citizens United. Everyone says hold on things are happening. I feel like nothing changes. Thanks for the words of friendship. I'm glad there are people in this world who get it.

       It might not be entirely evident that stuff is moving but I can tell you it is. The problem with the media right now is that we're fed jack shit, gotta find all the info yourself, even if just rumors or small steps
      </p>

       That being said, Saudi Arabia purge is linked to Trump. It is no coincidence that 2 weeks after Trump's visit, the King changes the next king from a cia preferred candidate to his son who's pushing for women driving and other great issues
      </p>
      <p>
       Then Jarred Kushner takes a secret trip to SA and now the purge begins? Is he even back from there?
      </p>
      <p>
       We should see action in the US rather soonish, Donna Brazile turning on clinton is a good indicator, Tony Podesta stepping down is important too, Mueller most likely after him, we should get confirmation any day now lol

       Yeah I've been trying to keep up with that. Donna brazille may just be a pawn in the over all game, but I wouldn't trust a damn thing she says. It's evident that she can lie. I hope this purging in SA has a huge impact for the well being of citizens in SA. Time will only tell

       Yes of course, she's trying to put the blame of seth rich's death on the russians possibly still, but even talking about that is great for us

       we've been screaming possibly the truth for a year, now that they're forced to talk about it, trying to shift blame will be hard since we'll be retroactively correct and not conspiracy

       . I've never been happier, because I discovered more of myself, through self improvement, health, mindfulness and yoga.  I had a vasectomy because it was the responsible thing to do, we have enough kids here, and we have enough garbage. Don't ever forget what you truly control on the planet with your actions, be good to your body and mind and take deep breaths.

       How is having a vasectomy "the responsible thing to do"? What about condoms, or ya know, not busting inside of a vagina. I fail to see how mutilating your own genitals is "responsible", more like the lazy version of responsible, because it's one less thing you'll have to concern yourself with.

       Condoms? And create more waste and cost to just having sex? And the pullout method success ratio is something you really want to play with? Last time I checked a vasectomy was free through insurance. Keep buying your condoms. If you are having sex that is.

       I work for a good company. I make 18/ hour with 3% commission. I use to work for a company in Destin and would work 90 hours in a week on call. The company I work for now stays away from the resort companies so we don't work ridiculous hours. Winter gets kind of slow, but this year we have been steady. Just know that you will go on call as a technician

       The coolest thing about my job is that HVAC involves: electrical, plumbing, gas, flue, welding, refrigeration , and many more trades. I have never had to call a company out to my house. I fix and repair just about everything. It's a good trade to know.

       Yeah it seems intriguing, I work in an office now sitting all day and I miss blue collar work.  I studied auto mechanics in college and did it for serveral years, so I have some background in that.  Of course it was automotive AC, not residential or commercial, heating is different, all the pipes fit with hose clamps or o-rings, soldering was electrical not copper pipes, nothing in a car should flush, it was 12.6 volts DC, not 120 or 240 AC.  I would need to go back to school for a couple years to learn it.  But my knees hurt and back hurt from sitting, I'm bored and this doesn't pay that great with no future of being self employed.  You ever think about starting your own business?

       I've thought about starting my own business, but that takes a lot of time and wisdom. I'm currently going to school to be an electrical engineer. I know what you mean about being in an office all day. I know my ass belongs outside. As far as the automotive air conditioning goes , it's the same principal. You have a condenser, compressor, evaporator, and metering device. If you understand that concept you can quickly figure out the piping, refrigerants, and voltages. It's really simple. When I first went to school for HVAC I was like wtf are they talking about. Now it's like jerking off, it's just happens naturally. I have self respect for myself knowing that I contribute to society . The day I knew I was respected was when I ran a service call for a company who had a bunch of older men present when I was diagnosing a system. They all shut up and listened when I began to talk. They would ask questions and I would answer them. It was an awesome experience.

       Look I have nothing against people having religion in their life. To me, whether you are Catholic, Baptist, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, or Buddhist, it don't make a damn. It's all fake . Its not real at all. I can't even argue with you because it's pointless. Religion is like santa
