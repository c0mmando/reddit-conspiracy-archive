    <div class="md"><p>trump said no and the bodyguard turned it down. period. 
wtf is this logic?
if i offer you minors and you say no. i leave you for the rest of the night. then i will spread that you got it offered and said no, but then i left you alone.. who knows?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, not “period”. The guard then stated that he stood outside Trump’s door for a few minutes and cannot attest to what happened during the rest of the night.</p>

<p>So, really, what we have is CONFIRMATION that Trump was offered prostitutes..... funny how that’s come out when the dossier alleged that nearly a year ago and all the trumpies called it “fake news” and “outlandish”. </p>

<p>You know what that claim has as of now? PLAUSIBILITY. It was outlandish, gotta admit, but now that someone has come forward and confirmed a portion of the story— that means it’s worth further digging. It went from being called “completely made up” to now being “partly true”. What we know is that
1. Prostitutes were indeed offered 2. They were initially denied 3. It is unknown if they came back.</p>

<p>But the prostitutes are fucking REAL. That was a HOLY SHIT revelation of the day</p>

<p>Moreso than that, Donald is said to have been pissed on by prostitutes and recorded for kompromat for the Russian government in that very hotel ....</p>

<p>Now we have confirmation of TWO key facts: 1. He was there and 2. Prostitutes were indeed offered by the Russian govt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like he’s changed his story a little or your article is coloring in details for him (daily caller is famously a shill publication PRO trump)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Schiller told investigators that he and Trump stayed at a luxury hotel during their 2013 Moscow trip, although he said he could not recall its name. He said he was not certain if he stayed on the same floor as Trump, although he acknowledged that they usually had adjoining rooms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whereas before, in your article, he says he placed security at the door ... the congressional testimony states he stayed for a time (a couple minutes) and then left. He also can’t recall if they were staying even on the same floor. </p>

<p>In addition, he went on to say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to people familiar with the questions, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) asked Schiller if he saw Trump engage in any compromising behavior while on the trip.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, <strong>not to my knowledge</strong>,&quot; Schiller responded.</p>

<p>He also said he did not remember accompanying Trump on any other trips to Russia but <strong>told investigators that he could not rule it out.</strong></p>

<p>In fact, that is the majority of what I heard before I even knew he would be an actual option for Presidency.</p>

<p>None of it was as big of a deal as people like you have made it out to be. And a lot of the time it was just 100% manufactured bullshit.</p>

<p>For example, the democrats really thought all voters would give a shit that President Trump said “women LET YOU grab them by the pussy if you’re rich and famous.” Keyword: Let. </p>

<p>Was that supposed to make me think he’s a sexual predator? Lol</p>

<p>Or how about when they said he was a nazi with ties to the KKK and then it was revealed that Hillary is actually the one with KKK ties via Mr. Byrd. Lol</p>

<p>Or when they said he colluded with Russia and now it’s coming out that was once again...Hillary and co. Lol</p>
