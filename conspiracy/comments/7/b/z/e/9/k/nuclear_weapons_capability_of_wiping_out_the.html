       <strong>
        Nuclear weapons explosive power - HOAX
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Nuclear weapons supposedly wipe out anything in a mile radius from the epicenter.
       <br/>
       Reality:
       <br/>
       Nuclear weapons have less destructive power than conventional mega bombs, which is how Hiroshima and Nagasaki were really bombed.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Atomic bomb's explosive power is a hoax
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Nuclear war doesn't mean instantaneously leveling the targeted country.
       <br/>
       Reality:
       <br/>
       1. Hiroshima and Nagasaki: real documents reveal that classic mega bombs was what was really used.
       <br/>
       - release of doctored photos to suggest total destruction;
       <br/>
       - omission of expected footage, starting with aerial overview, to cover-up the hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       2&amp;#46; Illuminati didn't launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union after World War II:
       <br/>
       Had the atomic bomb's capacity to destroy the enemy not been a hoax then this is what should have been logically expected, in order to prevent Stalin from also getting nukes.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Years later, the ultimate atomic bomb BIG LIE starts
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The Soviet Union, created by illuminati agent Lenin, in reality an ethnic German, would fall again under their control shortly after Stalin's death.
       <br/>
       That's when the nuclear weapons hoax was extended from "
       <em>
        if you have it then you have it all
       </em>
       " to "
       <em>
        nuclear deterrence / mutual assured destruction
       </em>
       ".
       <br/>
       This was one of core hoaxes used to brainwash the global audience ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Nuclear war is basically spreading radiation globally
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Yet there is one decisive consequence of its massive use: SLOWLY burning humans around the globe with radiation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuked 1945 hoax - for dummies
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Why did the illuminati bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki?
       <br/>
       To stop Stalin, who had just declared war on Japan, what would lead to a communist Japan within weeks, same as what happened in East Europe after the arrival of the Red Army.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed with conventional mega bombs not with atomic bombs.
       <br/>
       Graphic evidence:
       <br/>
       - buildings standing near Hiroshima's ground zero;
       <br/>
       - faked photos;
       <br/>
       - no aerial footage documenting the level of destruction.
      </p>
      <p>

       The bigger the lie, the more people will believe it.

       True, and it really gives politicians the power of diplomatic relationships, to "prevent" nuclear war, when actually it's the power to be blood sucking parasites. (Sorry for my English, I'm French)

       Thanks for the reply, although at this point "diplomatic relationships" do not matter since at least 192 UN recognized "heads of state" do nothing but to execute orders from Alexander Adolf Hitler, the Fuherer's great nephew and successor as Illuminati Grand Master.

       This is the kind of shit that makes me embarrassed to even read this. This and flat earth. Your undeniable evidence ignores physics, hundreds or maybe thousands of photos/videos since the 1940s, eye-witness accounts, ignores the fact that we have to specifically use pre-atomic age steel for many industrial uses because of the amount background radiation since the trinity test.

       The fact that it's a dome actually supports it surviving the blast, the bomb detonated almost directly above it so the building structure was able to withstand the downward force.

       Forget the Tsar Bomb, even without it we have enough nuclear weapons to completely fuck the planet.
