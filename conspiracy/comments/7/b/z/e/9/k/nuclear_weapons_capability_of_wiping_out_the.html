        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1>Nuclear weapons capability of wiping out the enemy is a HOAX - UNDENIABLE EVIDENCE</h1>

<p><strong>Nuclear weapons explosive power - HOAX</strong><br/>
Nuclear weapons supposedly wipe out anything in a mile radius from the epicenter.<br/>
Reality:<br/>
Nuclear weapons have less destructive power than conventional mega bombs, which is how Hiroshima and Nagasaki were really bombed.</p>

<p><strong>Atomic bomb&#39;s explosive power is a hoax</strong><br/>
Nuclear war doesn&#39;t mean instantaneously leveling the targeted country.<br/>
Reality:<br/>
1. Hiroshima and Nagasaki: real documents reveal that classic mega bombs was what was really used.<br/>
- release of doctored photos to suggest total destruction;<br/>
- omission of expected footage, starting with aerial overview, to cover-up the hoax. </p>

<p>2&amp;#46; Illuminati didn&#39;t launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union after World War II:<br/>
Had the atomic bomb&#39;s capacity to destroy the enemy not been a hoax then this is what should have been logically expected, in order to prevent Stalin from also getting nukes.  </p>

<p><strong>Years later, the ultimate atomic bomb BIG LIE starts</strong><br/>
The Soviet Union, created by illuminati agent Lenin, in reality an ethnic German, would fall again under their control shortly after Stalin&#39;s death.<br/>
That&#39;s when the nuclear weapons hoax was extended from &quot;<em>if you have it then you have it all</em>&quot; to &quot;<em>nuclear deterrence / mutual assured destruction</em>&quot;.<br/>
This was one of core hoaxes used to brainwash the global audience ever since.</p>

<p><strong>Nuclear war is basically spreading radiation globally</strong><br/>
Yet there is one decisive consequence of its massive use: SLOWLY burning humans around the globe with radiation.</p>

<p><strong>Hiroshima and Nagasaki nuked 1945 hoax - for dummies</strong><br/>
Why did the illuminati bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki?<br/>
To stop Stalin, who had just declared war on Japan, what would lead to a communist Japan within weeks, same as what happened in East Europe after the arrival of the Red Army.  </p>

<p>Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed with conventional mega bombs not with atomic bombs.<br/>
Graphic evidence:<br/>
- buildings standing near Hiroshima&#39;s ground zero;<br/>
- faked photos;<br/>
- no aerial footage documenting the level of destruction.</p>

<p><strong><em>Notes</em></strong><br/>
The bigger the lie, the more people will believe it.<br/>

<p>Thanks for the reply, although at this point &quot;diplomatic relationships&quot; do not matter since at least 192 UN recognized &quot;heads of state&quot; do nothing but to execute orders from Alexander Adolf Hitler, the Fuherer&#39;s great nephew and successor as Illuminati Grand Master.</p>

<p>the radiation that was on site in Hiroshima and Nagasaki</p>

<p>Explain to the audience who exactly published this &quot;data&quot;.</p>

<p>literally every dumbass with a detector</p>

<p>I&#39;d be interested in seeing any such genuine third-party report you claim exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the kind of shit that makes me embarrassed to even read this. This and flat earth. Your undeniable evidence ignores physics, hundreds or maybe thousands of photos/videos since the 1940s, eye-witness accounts, ignores the fact that we have to specifically use pre-atomic age steel for many industrial uses because of the amount background radiation since the trinity test.</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s you who ignores physics. See my reply to poster isyad:<br/>
<em>In this physics course, will it explain how this building&#39;s <a href="https://cdn1.pri.org/sites/default/files/styles/story_main/public/story/images/01_lede.jpg?itok=KDtwKeA2">dome support</a> (located less than 1Km from the epicenter) survived FULLY in tact, same as in this <a href="https://cdn1.pri.org/sites/default/files/styles/original_image/public/06.jpeg?itok=9iZY6Zio">photo</a>, if it&#39;s true that nuclear weapons supposedly wipe out anything in a mile radius from the epicenter?</em></p>

<p>What don&#39;t you get about doctored photos/videos?<br/>
You &quot;conveniently&quot; ignore the obvious psy-op video I exposed, &quot;Tsar Bomba - Largest Nuclear Device Ever Tested (50MT)&quot;.
Not to mention censored photos/videos, such as:<br/>
- no aerial footage documenting the level of destruction;<br/>
- omission of expected footage, starting with aerial overview, to cover-up the hoax.</p>

<p>Forget the Tsar Bomb, even without it we have enough nuclear weapons to completely fuck the planet.
