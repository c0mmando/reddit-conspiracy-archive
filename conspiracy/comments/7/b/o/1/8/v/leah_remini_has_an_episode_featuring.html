       I wanted to get a couple of these data points all in one place for fellow researchers.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         A&amp;E’s Emmy-winning series, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, filmed an episode featuring interviews with women who allege they were raped by Scientologist and That ’70s Show actor Danny Masterson, but the episode hasn’t been scheduled.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This connects to another item, reported earlier, wherein Michael Pena's wife Brie Shaffer is calling for Leah's show to be taken off the air...and for Scientologists to stand with Masterson.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <em>
         But there’s another reason why Brie Shaffer calling for the cancellation of Leah Remini’s show in the name of Danny Masterson is noteworthy.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         And that’s because she’s listed in a police report as a witness to one of Masterson’s alleged rapes.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        <em>
         In 2004, the woman we’re calling “Victim B” reported her alleged rape to the Los Angeles Police Department, which had happened the year before. When she was asked to provide the names of corroborating witnesses, the first person she named and the first listed on the report was Brie Shaffer.

      </p>
      <p>
       And both of these items tie together with a recent blind item posted on celebrity muckraking blog Crazy Days and Nights. If you replace #1 with Danny Masterson and #2 with Shaffer, then this confusing blind item starts to make sense:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        To make this work, I am going to number every person involved and at the end give a description of that person rather than during the blind itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        #1 had an employee. Prior to her(#2)  becoming #1's employee she dated a very very very close person (#3) to #1. The person at the time was way underage. Like, as in not driving underage. #2 was about a decade older. #2 raped #3 on an almost daily basis with the tacit permission of the parents of #3. They thought it was important to the development of #3. At some point, #2 decided to move on. The night she did so she went and had sex with #1. They continued to have sex even when #1 had a long term girlfriend (#4). It was during that period that #1 hired her as an employee.
       </p>
       <p>
        At some point during the relationship between #1 and #4, he raped her. #2 knew about the rape. #2 also knew about another rape committed by #1. How? That particular victim (#5) was the best friend of #2. Oh, and #2 also knew about another rape committed by #1 because that victim (#6) came to #2 in confidence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course #2 was still sleeping with #1 so she told him everything. AT some point, #5 filed a police report about the rape. At that point, #1 transferred all of his properties into a trust ( I have the paperwork and documentation but not going to name the name of the trust). The trustee of that trust was #2. When #5 made a deal, the trust was dissolved and everything went back into the name of #1.
       </p>
       <p>
        #1 then rewarded #2 by giving her cash and property totaling about $1.5M. During this period, #2 was making life miserable for the victims and also having a child with #7.
       </p>
       <p>
        #1 - A-/B+ list mostly television actor who does other things in entertainment.
       </p>
       <p>
        #2 - The description in the blind is about all I have.
       </p>
       <p>
        #3 - B-/C+ list mostly television actor.
       </p>
       <p>
        #4 - An actress/celebrity no one really would know.
       </p>
       <p>
        #5 - Doesn't want to be identified.
       </p>
       <p>
        #6 - Doesn't want to be identified.
       </p>
       <p>
        #7 - B list mostly movie actor.

       Pizza Gate was a fake political narrative designed to slander.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, there is more interesting conspiracies involving Scientology than the typical political theory crafting posted here.  There is a lot of REAL cover ups regarding Scientology and their various organizations and Leah Remini deserves a lot of credit for trying to shine the spotlight on their abuses.
