         The investigation we refer to as Pizzagate, is massive in scale, and was a continuously developing story for at least a month. The Podesta's, their art, the clintons and their foundation, connections to Laura silsby, money laundering through art, the relationship between James alefantis and powerful DC elites, organ harvesting, blood transfusions, spirit cooking; it is truly a massive rabbit hole and web of related events/findings.

         The shills are trying to "zero it in" on simply this wacky idea that we all thought kids were being raped and kept in the basement of this pizza place. Some may have thought that, but we were not that reckless and quick to jump to conclusions. Plus, that staged false flag shooting at CPP

       Exactly. But the shills will sound the alarm and say, "dutrox and the Franklin scandal and Jimmy Saville don't count as being part of pizzagate!! Since they are older scandals!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like they have this obsession with specifically denouncing and destroying the term pizzagate itself, because of the steak it has gained and the massive following and participation of investigators it has spawned. They're trying to destroy a brand.

       Pizzagate is a silly, stupid fucking sounding term. Some of you don’t seem to get that that alone makes people laugh at those pushing it. I’m no shill. Just saying what I’m fairly sure some others around this sub agree with.

       Yes it was very unfortunate it became known as that. Many investigators were discussing what else to call it to get away from the pizzagate term without losing the momentum that had been gained from it and that's how pedogate was born. Pizzagate and pedogate basically refer to the same thing. There's no point in getting tied up in distinguishing them from one another, in general it's about global elite pedophile rings - the abuse and rape of children being used for blackmail and leverage in certain circles, and people with horrific sociopathic and pedophilic tendencies being specifically targeted and recruited for powerful positions because they will be easy to control. There's other theories about this religion/cult thing among some elite groups that means that they enjoy this sick stuff and think it has some sort of spiritual significance but how much of that goes on and whether that stuff came before the blackmail stuff or after I don't know.

       Except that the very post you're replying to literally argues for the stupid fucking name of pizzagate. Because to them, the pizza is the important part, not catching the fucking

       The only thing everyone agrees upon that 'Pizzagate' ever meant was:
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta's leaked emails contain code words such as pizza, pasta, cheese pizza etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedogate on the other hand is the investigation into child sex trafficking in positions of power.  This investigation has all the merit and validity in the world.  Pedogate should be something everyone helps in.  There is no left vs right in outing people that sell children for sex.

       You are literally fighting "your own people". What you just responded to is absolutely true. Some people are more concerned about trying to find pedophiles, while people like you are trying to keep it "pizza" related.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to support the people that are trying to determine if there's something that ties it all together, rather than people stuck on emails about pizza.. which by the way, I've seen everything food related thoroughly debunked. Pretty sure I even saved one about dominoes and pasta/cheese if you need a reminder.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is this, if your goal is trying to figure out how the elite are preying on children, why the fuck are you stuck on fucking
       <em>
        pizza
       </em>
       ??
      </p>
      <p>
       At the
       <em>
        very least
       </em>
       , now that the info is out, the
       <em>
        code words
       </em>
       aren't going to be about fucking pizza. As a matter of fact, the entire "investigation" got so much attention that these very rich people probably paid security experts to learn how to protect their "messages".. like encryption, different secure apps, ciphers, embedding messages in images.. the million ways to communicate without getting caught.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here you are crying "but muh pizza!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Give it a break, either get on board at trying to find out who the perverts are, or keep investigating something that the majority of us believe was debunked long ago.. just realize, you pushing your pizza story only helps the criminals.. so are you trying to catch the predators, or is it more important to link it to a bunch of fucking emails?
      </p>
      <p>
       Choice is yours, just realize I'll call you out if you make the wrong one.

       Yeah, no. There are constant top rated posts that focus on the "troof" that there is a secret sex dungeon under a pizza shop. With spirit cooking and the likes.
      </p>
      <p>
       All because you wanna dial back the crazy now, doesn't not negate what pizzagate is. It's a conspiracy about a secret sex dungeon under a pizza shop where the "wealthy elites" (aka Clinton, Podesta alafantis and the likes) rape and kill children while looking at weird art collections and eating pizza.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't dial that back as much as you try.
      </p>
      <p>
       If want to shift focus on child trafficking and the illegal sex trade, kudos. I hope you too volunteer at many of the shelters abused people and children stay at, or give donations, or become a big brother/sister, or a child advocate, or foster some of these children who have been rescued from abusive places.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you are sitting there posting triangles and pictographs about art and code words and taking about cheese pizza, you aren't helping. Showing concern means being proactive in the real world with real organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       But dumbing down a real situation by shouting "PIZZA SPIRIT COOKERS" is phony and this fake outrage about people rolling their eyes at the ridiculousness that is pizza gate is a laugh.

        Yeah, no. There are constant top rated posts that focus on the "troof" that there is a secret sex dungeon under a pizza shop. With spirit cooking and the likes.

       This hasn't been true since roughly October/November of last year. All of the actively discussed topics related to pizzagate are entirely independent of the existence of a sex dungeon beneath Comet Ping Pong. There may still be one kept secret, or it may be beneath a neighboring building as many have suggested, which would obviously be a major breakthrough in the investigation. However, whether this particular claim is true or false does not change the premise being investigated. The idea that this all hinges on the basement of a pizza shop is a goalpost-moving/gaslighting/cover-up tactic used by several major media organization in coordination with social media manipulation.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It's a conspiracy about a secret sex dungeon under a pizza shop where the "wealthy elites" (aka Clinton, Podesta alafantis and the likes) rape and kill children while looking at weird art collections and eating pizza.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They don't even hide the art. It is (or was) on the walls of Comet Ping Pong, hanging openly in the homes of John and Tony Podesta, and posted on public social media accounts. This was an example of extreme hubris catching up to people who got far too comfortable flying under the radar. This is not what the conspiracy is really about. We do not preclude the possibility that Clinton, Podesta, etc. are themselves participating in the assaults, and in fact many think it likely that they do (or did), but the main meat of the theory is about the level of organization supporting the trafficking itself. The interesting questions involve political corruption/cooperation/infiltration/influence in government, law enforcement, and media, and the operations of possible front organizations such as NGOs, adoption agencies and orphanages, watchdog groups, charities, etc.

       This is a necessary band-aid after-the-fact, but it's much better to keep prevent anyone (especially children!) from going through such abuse in the first place. Even the most powerful, dangerous criminal organizations cannot survive total public exposure and traditional law enforcement. The continued online discussions and investigations play an important role. We must keep the story alive so that the mainstream media cannot bury it (again). Intense public scrutiny is necessary because there is so much incentive to obstruct justice.

       All you've pointed out is that it's been a year since all this shit got attention, and these rich people likely paid security experts to explain how to hide their communication.. encryption, ciphers.. a million ways to hide info. If you were onto anything, it's long dead. The simplest being.. don't be a pedo over Gmail.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there's a year gone by where the supposed criminals have learned, at the
       <em>
        very fucking least
       </em>
       , they need new code words.. and your defending the pizzagate? Simply think about your (lack of) logic.

       Yea. That's what pizza gate is about. At least a part of it. I was apart of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was alafantez. He has an article where he talks about his basement. There's a place out back that is related to the art place alafantes own. Alafantes is one of the 50 "most powerful" people in D.C.. etc etc etc etc

       It goes way deeper than this. I only talked about the tip of the iceberg. There's a lot of weird shit going on. I just can't get back into this. It bothers me too much. My bad. I can try to point you in the right direction. But there's literally like 50 facts that make it look like alafantes owns a rape kill dungeon.  Not just 5.

       I'm sorry, but the simplest reason it is stupid, is because so much of it is based on art. I've seen art critics give pages and pages of their thoughts on art. Do I see what they see? Not at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there's the elite, the people that can actually afford this art that I clearly don't understand and see as the critics do.. should they look at art through a filter of "normies will see this as creepy as fuck".
      </p>
      <p>
       What if I can afford this art, and the whole reason I bought it is to shock people at how creepy it is? If there's anyone who
       <em>
        needs to be shocked
       </em>
       , woken from just fucking doing the same old shit everyday.. it's these fucking people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why aren't we attacking the artists? If their art is satanic, and therefore something a pedophile would buy, shouldn't we be checking if they're the
       <em>
        ultimate fucking sicko
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe I just cracked the pedophile ring, it's the obviously satanic artists we need to be going after.. it does make sense, right? They created the biggest thing that links it all together!

       Sure. We can't really go after anyone because we have no proof. Art is self expression. Legal in the US. Which is okay with me.

       We'll look at you being all rational and civilized. I guess my point is better directed at those trying to persecute someone for having weird taste in art, rather than going after the artist that connects all of these "satanic perverts".
      </p>
      <p>
       What's funny to me is the people that aren't religious that use the art as some sort of evidence that they're guilty.

       I think the art work it is a strong indicator. But we can't go on witch hunts because of art. It's just a piece of the puzzle.

       Exactly. But the shills will sound the alarm and say, "dutrox and the Franklin scandal and Jimmy Saville don't count as being part of pizzagate!! Since they are older scandals!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like they have this obsession with specifically denouncing and destroying the term pizzagate itself, because of the steak it has gained and the massive following and participation of investigators it has spawned. They're trying to destroy a brand.
