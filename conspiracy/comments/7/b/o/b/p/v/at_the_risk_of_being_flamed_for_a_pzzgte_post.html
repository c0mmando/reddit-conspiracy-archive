       Snopes tells us that they are
       <strong>
        unable to locate any substantive aspect of the claims that could be fact-checked or otherwise held up to the light to determine their veracity.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet there is a person at the comet business who would be able to explain what the purpose of the password protected images contained on that server that was unfortunately shot up by the lone gunman that day by accident of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       And snopes also helps us deal with the statistically insignificant impact of pedophelia on child welfare /s.....
      </p>
      <p>
       "And while rumors about pedophilia and child trafficking remain standard in urban folklore, roughly 90 percent [PDF] of assaults on children in the U.S. are committed by a friend or family member, a number reiterated by the United States Department of Justice. Most [PDF] abuse of the nature alleged is committed by family members, family friends, or other trusted adults — without the use of coded toys or pizzeria sex rings."

       That's the reason the sub was taken down. The claim that the pizzagate sub was inciting violence because a nut walked into ping pong and fired a shot.

       I agree and I was a bit harsh skimming over your second comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way the events happened a week apart tells me they were related in some way, and not in the witch hunt sort of way. It's as if someone ordered the sub to be shut down and a false flag shooting at the same time. But that would be crazy tin foil hat speak wouldn't it.

       Could be that reddit admins kowtowed to pressure and axed the sub... and the folks scattered all over to voat and twitter and 4chan and other outlets so they needed something a little more universal to drive the point home... but I dunno. I'm reading thru the Waco and Oklahoma City Bombing and I can see how conspiracy theories can get spun out of control in the minds of the wrong person.

       I believe so. When it went to Voat it got bigger. Google search index filled up with even more Pizzagate. The shooting effectively forum slid a bunch of that nasty stuff off the front pages of Google search, while at the same time conflating conspiracy theorists with gun toting whackjobs in the MSM. Real question is, who applied the pressure on the admins? Was it a lawyer representing Comet? I wonder...

       When you're right you're right. I didn't look into pizzagate until after the shooting. I just looked up the actual dates. It was taken down on 11/24/16. Shooting was 12/05/16. The reason for taking it down was
      </p>
      <p>
       "For those not familiar with the movement, the "Pizzagate" subreddit was started by a group of Trump-supporting internet sleuths who were attempting to use WikiLeaks' leaked Podesta emails to connect the Clintons and John Podesta to the convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein.  That said, when the Podesta emails failed to reveal a "smoking gun" linkage, the sleuths instead turned their focus to mulitple "pizza" references in Podesta's emails which then led to the speculation that those "pizza" references must be code for something far more sinister."
      </p>
      <p>
       I found it to be a strange explanation on what it was.

       Yeah... the sub wasn't really that partisan after it's inception cause the shit spun off on a million tangents at once and was just doxxing all kinds of people... The Wikileaks stuff ran it's course and was still a big part of the central "research"... but there were literally dozens and dozens... if not hundreds... of businesses "investigated".

       That is an excellent point. The conspiracy is not the substance of the server or the allegations made by users, but rather the complete denial and ignorance we are witnessing by law enforcement. There is more than enough information to warrant a proper investigation, so why isn't it? That is what interests me the most...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not specifically taking about whats on the server, but between Alfantis Instagram, podestra emails, etc, I would like to see a official police investigation. It is no coincidence every reporter who investigates this ends up dead.

       Pizzagate is pedogate. Pizzagate was a psych op to discredit pedogate researchers. Plenty of reporters have died investigating human trafficking. This sub is merely controlled opposition, hence why the real juice is in new, other smaller subs and private subs.Plus, nobody is posting information that has a death cerificate attached on reddit. This sub is a good place to start, but is filled with gatekeepers.

       Oh... I guess if you wanna say pizzagate is the same as human trafficking and organized pedophilia then investigators prolly have died over that... but that ain't really what we're talking about.

       Pedogate investigations is what created the pizzagate movement. I do believe the movement was then hijacked into a psych op and discredited with the whole “fake news” buzz. So yes, it definitely is connected to what we are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will add it is hard to find archives of any the pizzagate research due to it being purged from Reddit, 4chan, voat, etc.

       Right... but do you know anyone who actually saw that part of the website of with their own eyes? Or screenshots from other sources... My memory is hazy on the events so it is possible that there were those PW protected files on the CPP website... but I don't remember seeing it with my own eyes... and I would prolly remember that.

       No, just the same screenshots as you.  But the amount of people saying they couldn't hack it, or the level or protection was farfarfar beyond a typical small business website.

       I’m having a hard time believing the 50th most powerful person in DC is using a small business web server for music or family photos.
      </p>
      <p>
       He used that sever because he wanted some information to remain hidden. Now the question remains, what he hiding? At this point, a police investigation would almost be pointless because he has most definitely destroyed and relocated the server.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Anon claimed to have hacked the encrypted part of CPP's website (
        <a href="https://ibb.co/hOjnyG">
         https://ibb.co/hOjnyG
        </a>
        ), found CP (images and movies) and reported it to DCMP. The CPP network included 9 different servers across the globe, including Berlin, Germany. It appears the files were able to be sold through CPP. Shortly after the report was made, the false flag occurred (magically shooting CPP's hard drive). After the false flag, Anon spoke to Det. Marcus Stevens at DCMP and reporting his findings, offering to help DCMP in any way. CP cannot be disseminated, so Anon had to describe what he found and how. After about a month, Stevens stop communicating.
Given the lack of interest by DCMP, Anon turned to the FBI, DHS, and the NYPD. No agency pursued the report, however, Anon said NYPD was interested but inferred their hands were tied. In desperation, Anon went to the press. Some media people claimed interest (FOX 5), but implied they couldn't cover the story.
During the time Anon reported what he found, his mail was opened and a prowler was found outside his house, hiding in the bushes. The suspect lived two states away and was charged with vehicle prowling. In addition, some of his property was damaged in a separate incident. Anon said he lives in a good, quiet neighborhood

       I've been trying to find that thread that initially had the Wethepizza.com hack and literally posted the evidence in that thread. However it was quickly deleted. You will find the Guy #2 disinfo post (in my opinion disinfo) and people referencing the first post, but not the goods people really want.

       Ok so two thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       A. CPP is a gateway to CP and other criminal pedo activity
      </p>
      <p>
       or
      </p>
      <p>
       B. A honeypot/sting opp that we uncovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, that's why the MSM covered it up and never investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       If A. TPTB are behind it and some very powerful people are involved who can pull strings w/ DC police investigations (remember Seth Rich)
      </p>
      <p>
       B. The govt/fbi/sting opp is blown and they are just trying to minimize the damage to ongoing investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why I think it's a criminial conspiracy not a govt opp is that they brought in all the most vile people who willingly became involved and then JA gets invited to the WH to play ping pong w kids there w/ Obama???  That's not a good "cover story" for a honey pot opp.

       I saw this back end page. Was hundreds of passworded files. All different sizes. Wasn't up for longer than 2 days before it got removed. Then enter the false flag where a harddrive was shot up, what was that all about? Pains me to see shills in here denying this existed. Plenty of proof, photos and videos of it on YouTube.

       Yeah... the sub wasn't really that partisan after it's inception cause the shit spun off on a million tangents at once and was just doxxing all kinds of people... The Wikileaks stuff ran it's course and was still a big part of the central "research"... but there were literally dozens and dozens... if not hundreds... of businesses "investigated".
