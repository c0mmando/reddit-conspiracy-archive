        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Republicans accept campaign contributions(bribes) in exchange for lowering taxes for their wealthy donors(Koch brothers etc.) which is why they are always campaigning on less government spending and lowering taxes. Republican regulators such ass the FCC and FDA also accept donations(bribes) in order for certain communications bills to be passed or certain drugs/chemical approval.</p>

<p>Democrats accept campaign contributions(bribes) in exchange for increasing government spending in sectors that will help their corporate donors. Which is why Democrats are always campaigning on increased government spending and social services.</p>

<p>Both sides care nothing about American people, and spend their entire time in office trying to pass legislature written by their donors. </p>

<p>Obamacare was written by insurance companies who made billions milking the taxpayers. If the government foots the bill, they can charge whatever they want. This is why you see medical bills where you&#39;re paying thousands of dollars for a bag of salt water. 
Obama was put in office to specifically pass a healthcare bill and to get TPP passed. He succeeded in passing healthcare which made his donors very happy and now he&#39;s making millions giving speeches and doing book deals.</p>

<p>Just as Obamacare was written by insurance companies, republican tax plans are written by wealthy donors like the koch brothers. The main goal of a republican in office is to get the tax plan that their donors wrote passed. They get that done, they end up getting hired at their donors companies where they make millions of dollars a year.</p>

<p>All you need to do to see if a politician(republican or democrat) is working for the people is to look at how much their net worth changes after leaving office. For example, Jimmy Carter and Ron Paul both have net worths that are about the same as they started and have not drastically increased. </p>

<p>There should only be two politicians we look at. Not democrat or republican. But a politician who puts the American people above his or her own interests. Vs a politician who puts their own interests above the interests of the American people. That is literally all anyone needs to do and we would completely get rid of this entire left vs right bullshit and be able to vote people in and out of office based on their actual policies, not the color of their party or the stupid fucking animal that goes along with it or whatever bullshit name they chose to call themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So.. You&#39;re telling me they do not represent my needs and rights as an American Citizen?</p>

<p>Next, you&#39;ll be telling me that Cops are not here to &#39;Protect &amp; Serve&#39;?  Oh wait, a Supreme Court ruling said they had neither to protect or serve an american citizen in any way.  Except writing them a ticket... Google it.</p>

<p>This can&#39;t be!!. I learned in Civics about the Bill of Rights. I learned about freedom of speech, religion, due process for all , the right to bear arms, a speedy trial by my peers and many other things..</p>

<p>I remember being the only kid in my American History Class against the Iraq War... I was 15 and thought the world was taking crazy pills.  I finally got my parents on board that GW Bush was awful and that 9/11 <em>may</em> have been different than the original story.  But they are making the same damned mistake.. Buying the Trump stuff hook line and sinker... Some people just like to be led.  Think my parents are that type.  /end anecdote</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re not identical but they&#39;re close enough (next to each other on the spectrum, both corporate whore parties)</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/1peIWYG.png">https://i.imgur.com/1peIWYG.png</a></p>

<p>Both are extreme right and extreme authoritarian, and part of the establishment.</p>

<p>Anti-establishment politics is like the region of moderate libertarian (mini-anarchist/minarchist or just moderate non-authoritarian government) versions of center left, centrist and slightly right</p>

<p>(NOT extreme/far right like the Libertarian party, I believe that party is shilly, extremes do no favors for most people, that&#39;s why they&#39;re extreme, and that party incl. Ron Paul and Gary Johnson advocate for free market economics which
deregulates the market to an extreme degree in order to give corporations more power due to virtually no regulations holding them back -- controlled opposition, and Gary is an obvious pro-TPP Koch bros shill).</p>

<p>The establishment dresses up moderates as extremists,
and extremists as normal. :/</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been under NEOliberalism (extreme right/deregulated economics, one flavor of which, is crony capitalism)
for 30+ years. Reagan&#39;s trickle down economics was a scam. Wealth has trickled from the working/middle/upper middle class UP to the elites. Not the other way round.</p>
