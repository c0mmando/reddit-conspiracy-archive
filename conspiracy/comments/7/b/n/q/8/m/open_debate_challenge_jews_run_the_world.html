    <div class="md"><p>This is what people really don&#39;t get. I&#39;m not even saying that some Jews run the world - I mean <em>maybe</em> that&#39;s true, but I don&#39;t think any of us know who runs the world. But Jews in general are just fucking people and I can&#39;t even imagine what it must feel like to see so many people blame you for every evil on earth. Jesus Christ! Pun intended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! Yes, I&#39;m Jewish and so is my husband. We are normal, regular people. All the Jews I&#39;ve known my whole life are normal, regular people.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if some elite Jews run the world or not. But if they do, I certainly don&#39;t know them personally. And I certainly don&#39;t benefit from it.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m on this sub because I don&#39;t think we know the truth about lots of different things that have happened. September 11th, Sandy Hook, JFK, Moon Landing, Las Vegas, etc. etc. I just want to find out the truth, like everyone else here. 🙂</p>

<p>Thank you again for knowing all Jews are not bad people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched the towers fall &quot;live on t.v.&quot; too. At the time, I didn&#39;t give it much thought because I was too upset (like all Americans). My children were toddlers at the time. So I was busy with them too.</p>

<p>Then afterwards, busy being a Mom and raising them, etc. etc.</p>

<p>So it wasn&#39;t until about a year ago that I actually really THOUGHT about 9/11. When I researched, I realized they fell in a controlled demolition.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To all the seemingly nice jews that posted in here, do u believe that palestinians should have human rights? Access to clean water and electricity? Do you believe it is ok to target children? Do you actually follow the torah which states there shall be no state of israel until the glory of the lord wills it? Are you aware that there are groups of orthodox jews that oppose the state of israel due to the true teachings in the torah? Do you know that the palestinians and jews truely did exist in peace and used to babysit eachothers kids before the haganah and militaristic groups of zionists began emmigrating people to palestine? These are serious questions and i have no problem with jews and know the difference btw jews and zionists. I ask these questions bc most jews dont know alot about the real horror palestinians live in and the lasting effects of mental health problems the state of israel has caused through murder, torture and refugeeing so many innocent people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not looking to debate, just correct me if I&#39;m wrong.  While there are many Jews in key positions of power and influence, they are overruled by the Jesuits and Vatican in higher positions.  So while it would appear the Zionists have the control and power, they are just puppets.  </p>

<p>Where I get confused is the relationship between the two.  Why did the Vatican choose the Kazarian/Jews for this role?  And where do people like the Rothschild&#39;s fit into this?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I call the Jews that are being used by the Vatican &quot;contemporary court Jews&quot;   or &quot;papal Jews.&quot; However, I believe the meme about Jews being in numerous places of power is an exaggeration. If you look around at the government positions in the legislative, judicial and executive branches you will find the majority of these people are Catholics.</p>

<p>For hundreds of years, certain Jews were granted privileges that other Jews were not in exchange for services which were considered un-Christian i.e. money lending. They were called court Jews. The difference now is that instead of only performing banking, they can also be found in other positions and are under the auspices of the White Catholic power structure.</p>

<p>The founder of the Rothschilds was one such court Jew. </p>

<p>I do not agree that there is such a thing as khazar Jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That makes a lot of sense, thank for answering. </p>

<p>Another question I&#39;ve been wondering, which may be off topic.  Do you know if the Roman Catholic church created Islam?  Do you think they currently control both factions, Shi&#39;ite and Sunni?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alberto Rivera said this when he was alive and it makes sense to me. I believe they did, though I acknowledge hard evidence is lacking. So if they did in fact create Islam, it would have been Sunni Islam which is the original form of Islam. I think this is why they want war with Shia Iran for example because they don&#39;t fully control Shia Islam. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! Luckily I am no longer smelly or particularly awkward. I guess I fall into the ugly duckling category - no one would ever guess I was <em>that</em> kid. </p>
