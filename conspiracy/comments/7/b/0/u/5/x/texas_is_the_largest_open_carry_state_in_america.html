    <div class="md"><p>Idk man. Maybe. </p>

<p>Reports say the shooter was in full tactical gear. I&#39;m wondering if some of the churchgoers <em>were</em> carrying and <em>did</em> shoot back, but weren&#39;t effective either because of the shooter&#39;s tactical gear, and/or because the shooter was using human shields. But if churchgoers <em>weren&#39;t</em> carrying because it&#39;s against church rules, then it could turn into a pro-gun conversation. </p>

<p>Reports are also saying that the shooter was ex-military (serving in the U.S. Air Force from 2009-2013). If true, the conversation becomes much more complicated. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main thing that leads me to believe that is it being done in Texas. People defending gun rights usually say if people were allowed to carry stuff like this would be stopped in the moment. Now this is done in a place where many people do carry and it wasn’t stopped so that trumps the argument of more guns keep us safer. If this happened in NY where gun laws are tight it doesn’t have the same affect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a tiny little church. I&#39;m guessing everybody was sitting in the seats facing the preacher and the shooter probably open fired on their backs. Either that or they were standing during hymns and music, making the shooter less obvious until he opened fire on them, probably with a semi or fully auto. Nowhere to run, hard to probably even find a moment to draw your weapon in defense. The chapel is probably the size of a large living room.</p>

<p>Three or four wannabe gangsters break into a home... Owner shoots one or two, hold the others until cops arrive, and a driver is arrested shortly after. Stories like that are common here where many people in eastern WA own firearms.</p>

<p>From your video.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s good that the guy shot at the shooter, but you can&#39;t change the fact that one bad guy killed 26 people because he was able to get an AR-15.  We shouldn&#39;t make this about the one good shooter, but about the 26 dead because of one bad one.</p>
