       Idk man. Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports say the shooter was in full tactical gear. I'm wondering if some of the churchgoers
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       carrying and
       <em>
        did
       </em>
       shoot back, but weren't effective either because of the shooter's tactical gear, and/or because the shooter was using human shields. But if churchgoers
       <em>
        weren't
       </em>
       carrying because it's against church rules, then it could turn into a pro-gun conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports are also saying that the shooter was ex-military (serving in the U.S. Air Force from 2009-2013). If true, the conversation becomes much more complicated.

       The main thing that leads me to believe that is it being done in Texas. People defending gun rights usually say if people were allowed to carry stuff like this would be stopped in the moment. Now this is done in a place where many people do carry and it wasn’t stopped so that trumps the argument of more guns keep us safer. If this happened in NY where gun laws are tight it doesn’t have the same affect.

       Thanks for the info. People don’t realize how quickly things like this can go down. Plus, just because you carry a gun around doesn’t mean you’re gonna have your wits about you to instantly pull it when shit pops off.

       It's a tiny little church. I'm guessing everybody was sitting in the seats facing the preacher and the shooter probably open fired on their backs. Either that or they were standing during hymns and music, making the shooter less obvious until he opened fire on them, probably with a semi or fully auto. Nowhere to run, hard to probably even find a moment to draw your weapon in defense. The chapel is probably the size of a large living room.

       Small town southern church. I can’t believe at least one individual wasn’t carrying. Born and bred Baptist from a small southern town  I can tell you that there was a revolver and pistol in my vehicle and plenty of others. I can also say my sweet 80 year old grandmother had a nice little 38 on her person. This is daily life in the south. So to think not a single person had a gun. Nah. I don’t believe it.

       Doesn't matter if you're carrying, I highly doubt anyone would be ready to react if one second they were spending a quiet Sunday morning in church and the next second a lunatic burst through the front door and opened fire. I'm not saying this as an attack on guns, as there are many cases where those who carried DID prevent a mass shooting, I'm saying this because the idea you have here is ridiculous.

       Actually it does. Have you already forgotten the shooting at the church in Tennessee? Who stopped the guy? How? I’m not saying that it would have been prevented. I’m saying in an open carry state in the south the likelihood someone in that church having a personal weapon was highly likely.

       He was asking them to state verbatim parts of a communist book of some
Sorts.. when they got it wrong they were killed. And there were two shooters confirmed. Draped antifa/communist flag over the front of the alter area I guess.

       And people don’t take guns to church. They leave them in there car.. safest place to religious people are in the house of the lord who will protect them from all evil. So I don’t blame people for not having guns. I am not religious.. by the way. Just thinking why they didn’t have guns.

       Nope, he was shot as he was exiting the church.  The person that shot at him may have hit him but how he died hasn't been confirmed.

       He could have just as easily been going to his car to get another weapon... yet here you are on two threads pushing a narrative.

       It's because 26 people still died.  The people trying to make this about the local, calling him a hero, are the ones with a narrative, trying to make it a positive statement about gun ownership when people I know from this town still got hurt or died
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       someone was able to acquire a gun designed for military use.

       Turns out you are wrong. Dude is a hero in every sense of the word. They killed him before police got there.

       It's good that the guy shot at the shooter, but you can't change the fact that one bad guy killed 26 people because he was able to get an AR-15.  We shouldn't make this about the one good shooter, but about the 26 dead because of one bad one.

       He's a hero but he's clearly not the story here, unless someone is pushing a 'guns are fine' narrative.
