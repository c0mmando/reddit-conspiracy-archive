       I've just started looking into the pizzagate thing so excuse me if I'm ignorant. As far as I can see this is all based on the emails with pizza etc in them. Has anyone considered this could be code words for drugs? The slicing things thinly to me could be that he's got drugs but not many and needs to know how many to share them amongst, type thing.  I'm at a loss to why anyone would use known code words in emails if they were really doing this. I doubt these people are stupid and find this whole thing hard to believe. Anyone with any good sources of info on this that isn't just the emails?

       Yes... I am the only person in the world that thinks the codewords are in reference to drugs... the rest of the population either thinks they aren't codewords and are to be taken literally... or that they are codewords describing children in boxes to be sacrificed to Moloch.

       As far as I can see so far I think it's more likely to be drugs than anything else. If it's just the emails and an art collection then I don't know how everyone is coming to these conclusions.

       Of course. When you read them in context, that's the only logical conclusion. Read them. You will see. And don't read them sourced from Pizzagate people. Read them objectively.

       The hypocrisy of the Pizzagaters is perhaps no more apparent then when they rant and rave about liberal artwork yet ignore Trump's equally perverse photos with his then teen daughter. Like the one of him posing with and grossly handling 15-year-old Ivanka behind mating parrots. They apparently have no problem with this.

       Two things:
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of Jimmy's photos of children on his Instagram account were of his God daughter at different ages. People make the mistake of thinking the photos are of multiple children, when they are mainly of his god daughter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, some of Kim Noble's SRA child abuse artwork was attributed to being either Jimmy Comet's or even the Podestas. Another falsehood.

       It's a bad joke. Big deal. Lots of people use lame humour. Most do, in fact. It's like saying, it's better to play pool on a couple of beers rather than on a couple of pops.

       "On" implies having consumed said item. Or, another example, "I am surviving ON three hours of sleep a night."

       "On" is not used literally. To think so is ridiculous.

       agree. completely. it's just totally ridiculous. It seems like this whole sub is full of people who think it's true though. I don't get it. If there is something going on I think we're being distracted by this to what it really is.

       I suspect that the Pizzagate narrative was in the works well in advance of the Trump campaign for election and for the direct purpose of discrediting his political opponents.

       Don't paint everyone with the same brush. Not everyone is clinging to the pizza restaurant. There are many confirmed ,high level pedo cases though. Sandusky, Epstein, Saville, the Vatican. This is a huge problem and only the tip of the iceberg. It's undeniable.

       You're probably never going to get a smoking gun. Looking at all of the circumstantial evidence, it's undeniable that these people are straight up creeps.

       Cause accepting everything at face value is boring... 95% of those food references probably should be taken at face value... but there are a few here and there that just stick out as really odd... who fucking knows though?

       Initially, the alleged pedo code was fabricated by the blogger running DC Pizzagate wordpress. They photoshopped in a "white" category, allegedly meaning child virgin, which doesn't exist, even in the homosexual colour codes. It was added in there to create an effect—a dishonest and manipulative one. Since it was revealed, that blog has sense removed the con job, out of obvious embarassment and to coverup their involvement. It doesn't even matter at this point, because everyone on the pizzagate side still believes there is a white category, even though it's been debunked.

       One thing I noticed about the Pizzagate crowd is that few, if any at alll, have read all of the emails in question. There has been so much fabricating and photoshopping that originals have almost been lost in the fog of lies. If you actually read the emails in context, they don't appear anything like the Pizzagaters have framed it. The same goes for Hillary's emails. Nobody actually reads them but creates all these conspiracy theories around them. I have read them, and they are some of the most boring batch of emails I have ever read.

       any comments on the 'Evie's Crib' blog site then, also run by Luzzatto and closed to public access since the word got out. Maybe you can help me decode this; "you can spend some time with her online, raw and uncut". I've been searching for a plausible explanation for ages.
