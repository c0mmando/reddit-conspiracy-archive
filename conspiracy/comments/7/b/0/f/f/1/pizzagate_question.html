As far as I can see this is all based on the emails with pizza etc in them. Has anyone considered this could be code words for drugs? The slicing things thinly to me could be that he&#39;s got drugs but not many and needs to know how many to share them amongst, type thing.  I&#39;m at a loss to why anyone would use known code words in emails if they were really doing this. I doubt these people are stupid and find this whole thing hard to believe. Anyone with any good sources of info on this that isn&#39;t just the emails? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hypocrisy of the Pizzagaters is perhaps no more apparent then when they rant and rave about liberal artwork yet ignore Trump&#39;s equally perverse photos with his then teen daughter.

    <div class="md"><p>Two things:</p>

<p>Most of Jimmy&#39;s photos of children on his Instagram account were of his God daughter at different ages. People make the mistake of thinking the photos are of multiple children, when they are mainly of his god daughter.</p>

<p>Secondly, some of Kim Noble&#39;s SRA child abuse artwork was attributed to being either Jimmy Comet&#39;s or even the Podestas. Another falsehood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Initially, the alleged pedo code was fabricated by the blogger running DC Pizzagate wordpress. They photoshopped in a &quot;white&quot; category, allegedly meaning child virgin, which doesn&#39;t exist, even in the homosexual colour codes. It was added in there to create an effectâ€”a dishonest and manipulative one. Since it was revealed, that blog has sense removed the con job, out of obvious embarassment and to coverup their involvement. It doesn&#39;t even matter at this point, because everyone on the pizzagate side still believes there is a white category, even though it&#39;s been debunked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing I noticed about the Pizzagate crowd is that few, if any at alll, have read all of the emails in question. There has been so much fabricating and photoshopping that originals have almost been lost in the fog of lies. If you actually read the emails in context, they don&#39;t appear anything like the Pizzagaters have framed it. The same goes for Hillary&#39;s emails. Nobody actually reads them but creates all these conspiracy theories around them. I have read them, and they are some of the most boring batch of emails I have ever read. </p>
