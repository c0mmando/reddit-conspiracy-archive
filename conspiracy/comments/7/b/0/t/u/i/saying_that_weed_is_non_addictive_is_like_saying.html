       Sigh…no, no it's not. I smoked for years. Pretty much everyday. A couple of blasts out of my one hitter. Then, a few months ago, for whatever reason, I no longer had the desire. Now, if I smoke a lil once a week that's a lot.

       I think it's addicting, in its way. I have problems controlling my use, so I've had to stop. No problems with booze, cocaine (which I didn't like, anyway), anything else. But if I had pot, I'd smoke it.

       It doesn't matter if your smoking 2% ditch or 97% oil, it's not addictive. I've worked at one of the bigger Growop's in the country and was friends with the extractors. The entire time I worked there I had access to the most potent oils and would smoke a lot. I left that job for a better paying job and wasn't I around the same stoner environment. I don't smoke anymore and had zero problems kicking the habit. I don't have a problem with weed and I will smoke occasionally. Now compare that to people addicted to opioids or meth.

       What about the people that won't quit weed for a higher paying job and smoke weed all day everyday? Then they say "I can quit whenever I want to" and you say then stop smoking for a week and they reply "No I don't want to, I like it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now weed obviously ISNT physically addictive like most other drugs, but I do think people with addictive personalities can be mentally addicted to being high from weed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say I'm mentally addicted to drinking alcohol, I just started, and I've been doing it everyday for a week or two. I can "quit" whenever I want to, but I like it and it makes me feel relaxed and happy. Am I mentally addicted to the feeling or no?

       Well alcohol can put you through physical withdraw but it's also a habit. Some people can't stop chewing on their fingernails. If someone won't quit for a higher paying job maybe the job isn't worth changing their lifestyle. I personally somewhat regret quitting my job at the Growop. I might get more money now but the people I worked with had similar interests to me. When I smoked more, my daily life was way more interesting to me. Now I feel like I became a drone worried about money. I was a lot happier being a stoner. Maybe people that won't quit for a higher paying job know more about what they want. Money can't buy you peace of mind.

       You are 100% right, you shouldn't get a different job JUST because it pays more. You only live once and you shouldn't waste your time on earth for a job you hate or quit your job at a growop for more money.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, life was more interesting because weed does that. I'm not hating on weed AT ALL, I support weed legality and people smoking and growing it. I don't care about that. It's just when people say it's not mentally addictive but then when we keep the same circumstances and change the drug name, all of a sudden it's mentally addictive, because it's physically addictive? Which makes no sense. 2 completely different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you should get your job at the grow op back. Fuck doing something that you don't like.

       People who smoke weed will always defend the fact it's not mentally addicting.
      </p>
      <p>
       You smoke it everyday, cause you like the feeling, and it relaxed you right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I can do xanax and drink alcohol everyday because I like the feeling. Yes those are physically addicting, but put that aside and there's MENTAL addiction at play as well. I would take those because I like the feeling they give me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same thing with weed, NOT everyone who smokes is mentally addictive but you can't deny the fact that some people are mentally addicting to weed.

       It's not weed they are addicted to. It's a habit they are fine with having. They might have a mental addiction to the habit but one could have the same addiction to anything.

       Exactly my point. It's not weed necessarily, it could be anything. Could be sex, alcohol, cigarettes, eating donuts, coffee, you name it, anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's a habit they form, and if they try and break the habit, it can be hard for some people. Weed isn't "addictive", it's people becoming addicted to the feeling something gives them is what I'm saying, and you're right, anything can give anyone a feeling they want

       Imo if it's not physically addictive and is habit forming, it forms a habit because you enjoy it. That shouldn't necessarily be a bad think. It's up to each person to consider weather it's a bad habit or just a habit. If it's ruining your life, you might want to consider quitting or cutting down. In cases where people can't quit, the person themselves probably has problems with addictive habits and if weed wasn't in the picture it would probably be something else. It's easy to target weed as the problem because it's a popular (probably one of the safer ones) habit for people with these kind of problems.

       I used to smoke it alot as well and i suppose i used to feel a yearning for the weed smoke in my lungs but its nothing compared to cigarettes. I would say it's a mild addiction at the worst I dont see ppl seeking their cars for some heady nugs.

       Yeah because cigarettes are physically addicting. I smoke them sadly, and trust me they are. I also used to smoke a shit ton of weed a couple years ago, and I was NOT physically addicted, obviously.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I would say I was mentally addicted because I wanted to smoke everyday. And that's because I liked the feeling it gave me. I wanted to feel that feeling again.

       The bigger conspiracy is that the weed kids smoke today probably isn't as natural as one may think. If it isn't happening already, it's guaranteed that the shit will get laced when big pharma starts mass producing it. The only way to be sure is to grow your own or buy it from a farmer that you trust.

       I would say the difference is that weed is not physically addictive, but it is
       <em>
        psychologically
       </em>
       addictive. You won’t suffer too terrible of withdrawal symptoms quitting pot as you would trying to kick heroin or even cigarettes.

       Daily user. Many years. Cannabis is mentally addictive but not physically.  If I were still taking the prescriptions I once was, my body would go through withdrawals if I ran out but now, I don't go through withdrawals but mentally I'm bummed. However, bummed I can deal with; cold sweats, vomiting, tremors, I can not.

       I hate this argument. Weed isn't physically addictive, people say that it's psychologically addictive which is true, but only because you allow it to be. A person can become"addicted" to anything that they do or use because they are creating habits. A person could habitually perform any mundane task and create a psychological addiction in the same manner that people habitually use marijuana and call it an addiction.

       Have to really consider true addiction vs simple physical dependence. Even though some of these symptoms can often overlap, they're quite different in definition and experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Symptoms of physical dependency can occur with a lot of things from sugar, caffeine, cannabis, sex, crack to real deadly stuff like processed food. Usually in the form of headaches, night sweats, insomnia, vivid dreams and irritability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrast that to true withdrawal from an addiction. Which can have scary symptoms like hallucinations/delusions, psychosis, tremors, vomiting, suicidal ideation, extreme mood changes or just straight up die depending on the substance. Ontop of the physical symptoms of dependency.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is of course exceptions when it comes to individuals who are already predisposed to a mental illness that could cause them to exhibit addictive behavior/symptoms to any number of things.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be inconsiderate to recovering and recovered addicts to compare something as bothersome as physical dependency to the literal hell of addiction. I've never met a true cannabis addict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out post-acute withdrawal syndrome too. Just when the addict thinks things will start getting better.

       Lol that’s like saying vodka is more addictive then a “ditch” beer like bud light that only has 6% alcohol. Not false advertising, know how to handle your shit. Drink the whole beer don’t drink the whole bottle.
But most importantly don’t compare cocaine and heroine to marijuana. Alcohol and tobacco kill thousands every year marijuana deaths are at ZERO. I think the issue is your decision to take a drug without the proper knowledge. People like you are the problem.
