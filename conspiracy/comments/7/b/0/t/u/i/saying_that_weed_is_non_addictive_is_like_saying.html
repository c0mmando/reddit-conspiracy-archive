    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter if your smoking 2% ditch or 97% oil, it&#39;s not addictive. I&#39;ve worked at one of the bigger Growop&#39;s in the country and was friends with the extractors. The entire time I worked there I had access to the most potent oils and would smoke a lot. I left that job for a better paying job and wasn&#39;t I around the same stoner environment. I don&#39;t smoke anymore and had zero problems kicking the habit. I don&#39;t have a problem with weed and I will smoke occasionally. Now compare that to people addicted to opioids or meth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the people that won&#39;t quit weed for a higher paying job and smoke weed all day everyday? Then they say &quot;I can quit whenever I want to&quot; and you say then stop smoking for a week and they reply &quot;No I don&#39;t want to, I like it.&quot; </p>

<p>Now weed obviously ISNT physically addictive like most other drugs, but I do think people with addictive personalities can be mentally addicted to being high from weed. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say I&#39;m mentally addicted to drinking alcohol, I just started, and I&#39;ve been doing it everyday for a week or two. I can &quot;quit&quot; whenever I want to, but I like it and it makes me feel relaxed and happy. Am I mentally addicted to the feeling or no? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well alcohol can put you through physical withdraw but it&#39;s also a habit. Some people can&#39;t stop chewing on their fingernails. If someone won&#39;t quit for a higher paying job maybe the job isn&#39;t worth changing their lifestyle. I personally somewhat regret quitting my job at the Growop. I might get more money now but the people I worked with had similar interests to me. When I smoked more, my daily life was way more interesting to me. Now I feel like I became a drone worried about money. I was a lot happier being a stoner. Maybe people that won&#39;t quit for a higher paying job know more about what they want. Money can&#39;t buy you peace of mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are 100% right, you shouldn&#39;t get a different job JUST because it pays more. You only live once and you shouldn&#39;t waste your time on earth for a job you hate or quit your job at a growop for more money. </p>

<p>And yes, life was more interesting because weed does that. I&#39;m not hating on weed AT ALL, I support weed legality and people smoking and growing it. I don&#39;t care about that. It&#39;s just when people say it&#39;s not mentally addictive but then when we keep the same circumstances and change the drug name, all of a sudden it&#39;s mentally addictive, because it&#39;s physically addictive? Which makes no sense. 2 completely different things. </p>

<p>But you should get your job at the grow op back. Fuck doing something that you don&#39;t like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly my point. It&#39;s not weed necessarily, it could be anything. Could be sex, alcohol, cigarettes, eating donuts, coffee, you name it, anything. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s a habit they form, and if they try and break the habit, it can be hard for some people. Weed isn&#39;t &quot;addictive&quot;, it&#39;s people becoming addicted to the feeling something gives them is what I&#39;m saying, and you&#39;re right, anything can give anyone a feeling they want</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imo if it&#39;s not physically addictive and is habit forming, it forms a habit because you enjoy it. That shouldn&#39;t necessarily be a bad think. It&#39;s up to each person to consider weather it&#39;s a bad habit or just a habit. If it&#39;s ruining your life, you might want to consider quitting or cutting down. In cases where people can&#39;t quit, the person themselves probably has problems with addictive habits and if weed wasn&#39;t in the picture it would probably be something else. It&#39;s easy to target weed as the problem because it&#39;s a popular (probably one of the safer ones) habit for people with these kind of problems. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah because cigarettes are physically addicting. I smoke them sadly, and trust me they are. I also used to smoke a shit ton of weed a couple years ago, and I was NOT physically addicted, obviously. </p>

<p>But I would say I was mentally addicted because I wanted to smoke everyday. And that&#39;s because I liked the feeling it gave me. I wanted to feel that feeling again. </p>

<p>Weed should be legal, people should be able to do what they want and smoke what they want. There lives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have to really consider true addiction vs simple physical dependence. Even though some of these symptoms can often overlap, they&#39;re quite different in definition and experience.</p>

<p>Symptoms of physical dependency can occur with a lot of things from sugar, caffeine, cannabis, sex, crack to real deadly stuff like processed food. Usually in the form of headaches, night sweats, insomnia, vivid dreams and irritability.</p>

<p>Contrast that to true withdrawal from an addiction. Which can have scary symptoms like hallucinations/delusions, psychosis, tremors, vomiting, suicidal ideation, extreme mood changes or just straight up die depending on the substance. Ontop of the physical symptoms of dependency.</p>

<p>There is of course exceptions when it comes to individuals who are already predisposed to a mental illness that could cause them to exhibit addictive behavior/symptoms to any number of things. </p>

<p>It could be inconsiderate to recovering and recovered addicts to compare something as bothersome as physical dependency to the literal hell of addiction. I&#39;ve never met a true cannabis addict.</p>

<p>Check out post-acute withdrawal syndrome too. Just when the addict thinks things will start getting better.</p>

But most importantly don’t compare cocaine and heroine to marijuana. Alcohol and tobacco kill thousands every year marijuana deaths are at ZERO. I think the issue is your decision to take a drug without the proper knowledge. People like you are the problem. </p>
