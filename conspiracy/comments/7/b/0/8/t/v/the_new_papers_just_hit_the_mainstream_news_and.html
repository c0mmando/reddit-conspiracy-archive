       Question 1)No, and that's the point. Question 2) Yes, there is always a motive and that the point as well. In Vegas there was no motive, per history or anything else.. which leads me to a quesion.. How does that atrocity go dark in the media without having discovered any clear motive?

       Yes there's more data points pointing to motive on this one. But I'm not so sure that someone didn't put him up to it/ give resources, planning, motivation to carry it out.

       Guys! We are so fucked the media is releasing where we keep all of our secret money. What are we going to do? There's going to be international backlash exposing how corrupt we are. We need a distraction will make the front page of every newspaper on Earth!! It needs to be all anyone will ever talk about. It needs to be like 9/11 times a thousand. It needs to be like first contact with aliens. It needs to be YUGE!!
      </p>
      <p>
       I got it! We'll use one of our secret brainwashed people to shoot up his church in some small town in Texas.
      </p>

       Perfect!!!

       Couldn't they come up with something better than this though? This is an international crisis for these kinds of people, a mass shooting in Texas isn't going to make front page news for more than a day or two

       Sure in Texas. But Texas is not the world, and the paradise papers are an international incident. Seems like a dumb way to cover it up.

       You don’t live in Texas.

       People think this is the world.

       You made it seem like a dumb way to cover up because you put emphasis on the excitement of the supposed conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If these shootings are actual coverups to simply distract the masses from other important happenings involving high profile people across the world, I would bet locations for mass shootings were chosen long before they actually happen.

       Let me explain like you're five. It's a big deal, especially in Texas, but Texas is not the world. Do you think the Texas shooting is going to be in the news for more than in day in Italy, or Japan, or the UK, or anywhere else in the world. It's not, it probably won't be in the front page tomorrow in most of the world, but you what will be? The paradise papers. That's why saying that the shooting is a cover-up is stupid. This is an international event, and Texas is not the world, no matter how much Texans think it is.

       Sure it’s an international event. 
But where is gun control “needed” the most? Where is the topic of gun control at its highest? Are most European terrorist attacks carried out with guns? No, they use cars and bombs to kills people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now compare the citizens of the US to those abroad. Basically sheep right? The epitome of the ever spending product of mindless capitalism right?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are just not thinking of how people domestically and abroad from the US take events like this. Does a puzzle have just 2 or 3 pieces? No it doesn’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you saying something can’t be a distraction on an international level JUST because it happened in the United States is what a fucking moron would say.

       The fuck are you talking about? This is mindlessly rambling.

      <p>
       One more time. This shooting in Texas is not going to distract everyone from the paradise papers. It's a big story, especially locally, but it's not big enough to bury the paradise papers story. So, if you were some shadowy iluminati type group trying to distract people, it wouldn't make sense to fake this shooting, because it doesn't help you at all.
