       We all know there is a cover-up happening, either from MB and all of the law suits or the alphabet crew to substantiate their innocence from anything they may be involved with. Two mass shootings, two different amounts of information being released.

       Lot of chatter out there about big happenings in LV that night. Info kept quiet for a reason. If you wait for info be delivered in your lap you may be sitting for a while. Chatter is world players coup, counter-coup events. But for Reddit sake will keep to official narrative of single shooter and refuse to believe Jason Goodman videos or what 4chan says.

       [A video camera captured the blood bath inside a rural church, law enforcement officials said on Wednesday, recording the worst mass shooting in Texas history, which left 26 people dead, 20 wounded, and a small town devastated. That gruesome footage, which state and federal investigators have reviewed, stemmed from the church’s practice of regularly recording its services and posting the videos online.
      </p>
      <p>
       Law enforcement agencies declined to say whether they would ever publicly release the video, which shows that the shooting lasted about seven long minutes, said an official who was briefed on the matter, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing.](

       Nothing in the news....despite the filing from MSM to release information. Seems no one is digging or getting anywhere. Even most independent journalists have moved on. Who can blame them? They're probably being shut down or there's no where to go from here.

       Has anyone ever been to Texas??? Almost every person on the street is in possession of a firearm. Youre trying to tell me not ONE person in that church had a gun on them....in rural texas?!?!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how could almost 50 people get injured and shot when there wasnt even that many people in attendance each week? You can prove this to yourself by simply watching the videos the church posted themselves.

       Seems like they are purposefully making it sound unbelievable as a way of mocking people who actually believe this shit.

       lol...youve clearly havent spent anytime here have you? I live about an hour away from the tx border in rural kansas, and even though we arnt nearly as gun crazy as texans are...everytime I go to chruch there is at least 3 or 4 people packing heat OPENLY. I can only imagine how many people conceal carry. I dont know one person in my town who doesnt have firearms in their house. And id say 8 out of 10 of those people have a gun on them AT ALL TIMES. But like i said, we arent nearly as gun crazy as texans are...they live and die by their firearms. If you dont beleive me, simply visit anty church in rural texas on a sunday.

       I live in a north of Dallas in a town smaller than Sutherland Springs and I don't recall anyone ever bringing a gun to church services, not that it would be taboo or anything. Everyone dresses in their Sunday best and that leaves little room for a holster and gun.  It doesn't surprise me that no one out of 50 people had a gun. It also doesn't surprise me that someone Steven Willeford was nearby to stop it either. You better believe everyone will be carrying next Sunday though.

       ok....lets say thats true, not many openly carry because they get their concealed permits...next time you go to chruch...ask everybody there if they are concealing their weapon....i promise you - you will find at least one person who is. And if you dont, then you must be the only town around here that doesnt have people carrying everywhere they go. Have you ever carried a gun??? I can carry a pistol in skinny jeans and nobody ever knows. They make special holsters for any kind of outfit you can imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny how nobody is addressing the fact that 50 people have never even been in attendance from the looks of their video. They were lucky to have 30 to 40 people there on a good day. And you can prove this by simply watching their videos.

       Why would they? Are they tearing down the manadalay bay or the aurora theater? There's no legitimate reason to take down a perfectly working building. None.

       I'm just going to start by saying I'm assuming right up front we have two wildly different views of these tragedies. Murderers and psychopaths have existed as long as humans. People do horrible horrible things every single day. Serial killers, serial rapists, massacres, genocides have existed forever. So to say that it is impossible for someone to do these things without them being mind controlled and a false flag and all this is nonsense. Las Vegas does not make sense and there are many many missing puzzle pieces and there are other examples but to say they every mass killing has a secret government motive is taking things way too far. And where I get upset is sandy hook and now this church shooting. Regardless of what you think or how you feel there were a lot of small innocent children who died in the most horrific way imaginable. There were two children there who will forever live with the fact that they were in the room while their three siblings, their pregnant mother, their uncle and two grandparents were murdered. Those are the facts. I have two small children and I can hardly read about it because it's unimaginable. This is a small church that held what, 70 people? In a community of 700 people. Who in God's name would ever want to step foot in that building again? The same with sandy hook. Those little kids were herded into a corner of a room and executed. No one in the world would want that building to remain standing. If you want to believe there was a conspiracy behind this that's your prerogative but people need to learn to show respect to the victims. Especially when they are small children. If you don't have any you couldn't possibly understand but there's nothing more unimaginably horrible than hearing about these events and knowing exactly how world crushing this type of event is to these survivors.

       questioning it, demanding answers and justice, that is respect. I disagree with you. I'll leave it at that since you're already telling me I can't understand since I don't have kids, so this will go nowhere.

       I'm not saying anyone without kids can't feel the pain of children being murdered but I'm just saying for me my ability to stomach stories about child abuse and crimes like these has gone away. My children are my entire life and to have to put myself into someone else's shoes in a situation like this is something I can't do. My wife was a department of children and family investigator and had to quit because of one particularly bad case and she said since having kids she doesn't know how any of them with children could do their job. It's too hard when you have to go home and look at your own children. I wasn't trying to say you can't understand the pain and suffering but it just really hits a nerve when I hear people trying to say these things are fake. I don't think that's exactly what you were saying but I'm not sure. Anyways, again I guess we disagree in this case but what answers are we looking for with the Texas shooting? I don't see how there's any conspiracy here.

       the MSM were interviewing fake wounded survivors at LV the next day.

      <p>
       we know somebody was recruit crisis and/or crowd actors for an event in LV.

       this is premeditated theater not impromptu save the day after the fact.
