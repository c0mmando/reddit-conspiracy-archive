       It's getting to the point where it's unreasonable. I believe the point is to inundate people with bull shit. Like there is literally a conspiracy to overload all the normal people with bull shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Case and point, someone asked for proof that security cameras MUST have led lights in them to be real cameras and recording.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that's just stupid. Any person can be recording in a public place at anytime and no one needs to get notice. It's apart of the freedom of press, first amendment rights in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now a bunch of "special people" downvoted my comment and asked for "proof". The problem is that you can provide proof because the question is so patently false, there's not even an article on the subject. Also, it's so damn stupid I'm not wasting my time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think at this point is time, it's safe to assume no one with even a hair of common sense should be providing proof upon request. It's just a bunch of jack offs requesting proof because they think they can "win a conversation" by requesting it. When in reality, you should only be asking if you are truly interested and are seeking truth,

       You certainly cannot believe that proof is never required.  So, when do believe it is appropriate to back up assertions with proof?

       This is what happens when you allow unchecked conjecture to run rampant, people get sick of it and develop an irrationally high expectation of proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for asking only if you are truly interested, that's nonsense.
I think it is anyone's right to challenge any assertion that is made, when it is unsupported with anything but an opinion.
      </p>

       We are all to blame for this happening by not enforcing more robust 'fact checking'.

       I don’t know specific example OP is taking about, but I think there’s also a difference between claiming something as undeniable fact and clearly stating is conjecture or opinion (and everything between). Some users get hostile when you point out evidence against their hypotheses because they are confusing their own strong feeling with facts. Some users get defensive for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       What’s interesting is that there are several users who will shit on others hypotheses/evidence/“subtly”break rule 10 but will state their beliefs as fact, with absolutely no proof, then call others shills for making an effort to show evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it’s important to note these hypocrises and inconsistencies.

       Let me recap: you're going to make what you feel are reasonable claims, often without proof or evidence, and when asked by someone why they should believe you without proof, you're gong to decide if they are worthy of you providing it? Do I have that right?

       No. I'll make unreasonable claims. I like conspiracy theories. So I will suggest things like aliens or pedophilia. And I am saying I won't provide cite, I will provide enough information for someone who's interested to look up a citation them selves.
      </p>

       And yea that's exactly what I'm saying. And from other people responses, minus yours, the denigration of socializing on the internet, and philosophical rules for arguing actually support what I'm saying.

       Right, there is a group of people asking for citations! No one needs to cite sources for stating opinions online. Besides, citing sources is peer review. It is not science. Even if people did cite sources, it doesn't mean that the source is credible. They are usually not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really believe there is something behind this. Normal people don't demand a bibliography to substantiate an opinion posted on the internet.

       Isn't it obvious that some questions should have answers that can be proven, and other questions are so resilient to easy proof that you have to spin out multiple theories about them?
      </p>
      <p>
       We really should become good at calling the difference between the two situations, and not bicker about it.

       Here's an example of a provable situation: Either Podesta is in jail under the legal system that has open public record-keeping or he isn't.

       Now, he may be in any number of conditions that range from free and happy, to on the way to the station - that we can theorize about.

       I had a jack-off ask me to prove that I wasn't a 250lbs troll by stepping on a scale and taking a picture. He also demanded pictures of my diplomas to prove I wasn't as uneducated as he was trying to claim. There's something nefarious going on out there in cyber land. People are up to something...

       Some of them I think are paid distractors. The objective seems to be to muddy the waters and derail any kind of serious discussion. They seem to have a pretty simple formula that they use to try and trigger people into discrediting themselves. I'm extremely difficult to trigger, so I just lead them around in circles. It is interesting to see how far they will take it...sometimes it will go on for DAYS.

       I wouldn't be surprised at all. I bet there are people playing both sides too. And some of them, of course, are just obsessive bullies.

       I have also noticed, I think, an uptick in mean-spirited, low-hanging bait posts (Like choosing an unpopular comment and holding that up as an example of the community as a whole). I think its dumb because they could probably find plenty of popular examples and common circlejerks that would be cringey to a lot of casual uses.

       In my opinion that makes for a low quality content in a meta sub, but TopMinds seems to have a bit of
       <a href="/r/Drama">

       There are some really hostile people on here but I like to talk to them at times because I don't really have a dog in the political fight, but they do and I like being able to politely talk to them as they devolve into ad hominem. My only real goal, other than observing all political intrigue, is showing with proof that there are actual shills here. I don't know what political affiliation or their true motivations, but they are here copying comments and cross posting from other subs, using alts to avoid bans, trying to lure people into bans, and sock puppeting to support their alt accounts. I have a few posts the admins asked me to send them to see if there is vote manipulation but I have yet to collect the links.

       Exactly, anything can be photoshopped. But, it stuck me as odd that they anyone would demand that kind of proof. No one asks for something like that from someone on the internet. It is a distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I want to know something, I seek the proof for myself. I don't expect someone to spoon-feed me the truth. I've noticed what seems to be an orchestrated demand for "proof," and if you don't give it, somehow you are discredited and your opinion is invalid. But, that is not how that works.

       Me and my brother bet heads with this. He's always asking for "proof" and  it makes my eyes glaze over. We all have the internet. We have similar tools to aquire the info. To ask ME for proof is excusing themselves to actually work at there own investigations. I don't have the time let alone the patience to hold someone's hand and step by step administrate the red pill. Also hurts that he's in a  college  bubble being an all mighty scientist and I work my insurance job killing time by spending half my day googling what I want. But fuck me right. I'm not in college atm so apparently my opinions mean dick. He's a great example of the college bubble. My advice to those who need to silence a doubter? Hunt for patents. The best defense I have. Patents are some great evidence that designs and functions are being designed and in the works
