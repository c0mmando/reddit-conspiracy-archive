        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello folks I wanted to share another path of research related to the high strangeness, synchronicity and other elements of the ME.</p>

<p>I started listening to Exegesis without knowing what it really was. Im only 6 chapters in but I feel the need to share the findings.</p>

<p>So Philip K dick was the author of some of the most influential Sci fi of our generation. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t read any of his work but have seen movies based of such work. But listening to the audiobook I am consistently floored with the syncs between his life/research and mine. And he has been coming to similar conclusions that I have.</p>

<p><a href="https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=C2176WD_RlcC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;output=reader&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;pg=GBS.PP28">https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=C2176WD_RlcC&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;output=reader&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;pg=GBS.PP28</a></p>

<p>here is a quite large sample of the book.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cK2MPgAHRk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cK2MPgAHRk</a></p>

<p>And this is a documentary on the man.</p>

<p>Dick mentions that his life became more and more like a PKD novel, with synchronicities and people he wrote about confronting him on why he chose to write about them. Looking at the cover I was personally hit hard. </p>

<p>The cover of the book and the Chapter headers are a Vesica Pices or Mandorla. In my research of the Mandela effect the mandorla popped up quite a bit. </p>

<p>Having never read a PKD novel I can tell you that without a doubt, it does eem my life is like a PKD novel. </p>

<p>Yesterday I look on Amazon.com for “Magic: the gathering Decks.”</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/FOM2A4R">https://imgur.com/FOM2A4R</a></p>

<p>I get this in the search. The bottom left corner has Jesus and Satan arm wrestling. I was like SHIT ive seen that before. From one of John Lamb Lashes videos.</p>

<p>Well that&#39;s a sync.......... but wait theirs more!</p>

<p>Right after checking Amazon I go on CNN to see what the mainstream is pushing and boom WTF do I see?</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/1N5gw8n">https://imgur.com/1N5gw8n</a></p>

<p>Are you kidding me CNN. So memes, MEMES are how Russia stole the election. </p>

<p>What are the odds the MTG has that picture on a playmat and it just happened to pop up, While months ago some Russian Troll factory person made a meme with that picture that coincidentally was used in A JLL video months before that. And then CNN decides to use that image and post it on that day, and I just so happen to click over to it................ Life being a PKD novel, is a novel idea.</p>

<p>Dick talks about a Force reaching backwards through time and offering clues to the I that sees.
He mentions the possibility of Tachyon as being the transmission method. The idea of the holy spirit being the collective highest self is sending back information through dreams, and thoughts and experiences.</p>

<p>He calls this force by a couple different names, Valis, Logos, Holy spirit. But fitting in the Gnostic bend it seems he has accessed something outside of time. (the akashic records) I think that all authors are doing this, I mean where do original stories come from. The Aether or the collective consciousness? Are they the same thing?</p>

<p>Everybody that reads a body of text will naturally emphasize and deemphasize certain wordsor concepts presented within. Each transaction of Author to reader is like a snowflake, even the same person reading the same text at a different time in their life would have a completely different effect. </p>

<p>What are the effects of reading. Firstly before one writes a thought/information down it has to come from somewhere. Lets say this is from Source/Holyspirti/higher self/collective consciousness. Most of the time really powerful ideas are brought to mind not via the words use to explain the experience but those words to describe the experience have to be chosen and compiled into a transmissible form. </p>

<p>So the initial input is a thought from the ether. Then this abstract and fluid thought-form is converted by the person into a new form that represents a simplified watered down version of that initial thought or idea as words are the bottleneck in transmitting ideas. </p>

<p>So there is the initial push or lightning strike of a thought and then the person picks up this thought or abstraction and in order to build understanding of the thought “Thinks about it.” Some thoughts stay in the realm of subconscious abstractions and others that you feel sufficient for sharing are converted into words.  </p>

<p>So when I read the words of a sentence I have a series of archetypes and experiences pulled up by the subconscious as if the subconscious is a librarian and whatever you are looking at and focusing your attention on the librarian goes and seeks out all the links and word associations/experiences related to that thing. </p>

<p>The context of a persons past experience filters/colors the content of any inputs. As no person has the same context then no sentence is read and interpreted the same by any person. And even the same person reading the words at a different point in time may have a different contextual understanding of the thought./idea. </p>

<p>So if the original source of an idea is from the ether, that idea is then transformed by the experiancer and put out into the world. What if the experaincer of the thought was unaware “Who” he would be talking to with his words. That maybe there is another force which nudged and subtly moved you to write words specifically so that another person might interpret a hidden message meant just for them. </p>

<p>The idea is we are shaped by the past everyday through every word we read and hear. The nows experience being interpreted through the filter of past experience. But I think it goes both ways, with the future reaching back with syncs and clues and slight nudges so that the future could exist. </p>

<p>X marks the spot so too speak. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.edelomahony.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Torus.jpg">http://www.edelomahony.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Torus.jpg</a></p>

<p>The torus has come up time and time again as being an important shape, and I think shapes and geometry can teach your subconscious somehow. </p>

<p>Think about the center of the torus and you have the past below and the future above with the now being the convergence point for the X</p>

<p>the V shaped by the top half of the X shows how the further from now the wider the amount of possibilities. </p>

<p>The Lamba or upside down V portion shows how further away from the now has wider possibilities </p>

<p>The point is Now with future and past influences all swirling around. </p>

<p>The interplay of thoughts/ideas/ information in time is certainly intriguing if you think about the chain of custody for an idea. </p>

<p>Think of everything Carl Jung wrote, or Plato, Shakespeare, Homer. The countless shapers of the future whos effects only amplify over time. The more individual minds that digest a body of work the more unique perspectives and by extension new ideas can come out of it. As if every word is a seed and this seed becomes a different plant in each person, bearing different fruits but still having the core energy of the original. </p>

<p>What Carl Jung wrote was a combination of the things he read, ideas he had, thoughts he elucidated, and the veritable cornucopia of experience that was the filter which he took life in and outputted his works of philosophy. That again would be read and interpreted uniquely by each person. </p>

<p>It is a feedback loop of Idea, Conversion into words, Reading the words, Interpreting the words via life experience. And then sharing the truths of what was gleaned from the idea being thought about. The loop continues when that is read by another person. </p>

<p>So there is the intention of the author and I think the intention of the “All” at play whenever anything is “Created” I mean we cant create anything outside of what is possible in creation. So anything we could possibly create had to have already BEEN somewhere in the toolbox of creation. The materials are required to create, in this sense the materials being the thoughts and ideas of humanity. I we are truly pulling from the Source then it seems like what we glean and create makes us a vessel for this communication of source to the individual cells of the source, our souls. </p>

<p>Ok so back to PKD and his book here.  The mandorla on the cover was a bit of a wink from the universe as ive said “Syncs are Winks from the universe Seen by the Eye and interpreted by the I that sees.”</p>

<p>PKD describes the Events of 2-3 74 which was the events of Feb and March of 1974. The whole thing was kicked off when the nurse come in wearing an Ichthys necklace. Which is a Mandorla., The light hit this sacred image as PKD had taken Sodium Pentathol for his wisdom teeth removal. He saw a glinting pink beam of light that all at once downloaded information into him that for the next 7 years he would be taught in his dreams and the synchronicities in life and research, this analysis and work of sussing out what exactly was happening became Exegesis. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthys">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthys</a></p>

<p>A quote from the book.</p>

<p>“For well over two months I was convinced that the Holy Spirit, which is to say God,was directing me, and in a sense this is true; it is a matter of semantics: at one time these would be the only terms we had available to us: we would have talked about divine vision and so forth. What I think now is that more modern terms can be better applied: the future is more coherent than the present, more animate and purposeful, and in a real sense, wiser. It “Knows” more, and some of this knowledge gets transmitted back to us by what seems like a natural phenomenon. We are being talked to, by a very informed entity: that of all creation as it lies ahead of us in time.”</p>

<p>This is pretty much what ive been talking about for the past year or so, the universe is speaking to us all through metaphor and our experiences. The dialog only taking place when there is recognition of of a conversation taking place. </p>

<p>“ I don&#39;t feel I was “picked” by a Future force, as its instrument, etc. bidden to make manifest its word, etc, any more than when you are watching a TV program the transmitter has picked you. It is BROADcast: it just radiates out in all directions and some people tune in, some do not: some like what they see and hear and others reject it. All I did was transduce, as all creatures do. I just gave it what I had revived a local habitation and a name, as Shakespeare put it.”</p>

<p>Again this is what I have been saying. Its not like we are chosen, more like we chose to be open and that brought to our awareness the frequencies just under the surface. Its our job to separate the signal from the noise. But one persons signal might be another noise and vice versa. To differentiate between trash and treasure is what we do, the treasures we attempt to spread and share, the treasures being the truth that we come too. </p>

<p>“I feel I have been a lot of different people, a lot of people have sat at this typewriter using my fingers and writing my books. My books are forgeries. Nobody wrote them, the goddamn typewriter wrote them, its a magic typewriter. Or maybe its like how John Denver gets his songs, I get them from the air/ether just like him. Like his songs -my books- are already there, whatever that means.”</p>

<p>More to come on the breakdown of this book as I compare it to what we have been experiencing here. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man so I have been trying to get people onto this book for awhile. You&#39;ve got a great grasp of his thoughts. How ideas transmit through time etc, i agree with alot of this post. I was getting hit with a thrashing of synchronicity when I seen this book at a second hand shop, opened it up and every page spoke to me. I have put it on pause as I work through some of his other books though, and I still haven&#39;t read valis / ubik which from what I hear are critical parts of his thinking required for reading it.  Though looking at the glossary the list of philosophers and thinkers referenced is off the wall , many of them in the same vein of thought as ours.</p>

<p>N
 I noticed at the start of the exegesis (which is just a small 400 page sampling of over 8000 pages) that the editors had to mention that they were careful in putting together the exegesis so as to not spawn a religion off the book. Phillip was trying to figure out the nature of our reality as we are, I believe the last video I seen of him at a conference he had concluded we are living in some type of holographic reality (there&#39;s alot of illustrations of torus in his book as well, so if you are listening to an ebook may be worth noting to look the illustrations up)</p>

<p>Lastly another writer in the same vein : frank Herbert , specifically destination void and the dune series...but now that you&#39;ve got me thinking about writers tapping into the future I&#39;d like to mention the Sci fi writers who have a &quot;future history&quot; Asimov&#39;s foundation series, heinleins stuff, h pipers fuzzy stories....</p>

<p>&quot;Once, at the other end of the country, there was a band of escaped slaves that hid out in The Great Dismal Swamp, intermarrying with the indigenous tribes. Among them was rumored to be a lineage of displaced Sufi holy men that practiced a particularly metaphysical version of meditative alchemy. &quot;</p>

<p>I was born and raised within an hour of the Great Dismal Swamp and naturally found myself practising the Whirling Dervish aspect of Sufism</p>
