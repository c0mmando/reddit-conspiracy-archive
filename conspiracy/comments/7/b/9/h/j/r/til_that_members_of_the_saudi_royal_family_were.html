<p>Even more interesting: The FBI helped the Saudi&#39;s leave the United States because they &quot;feared for their safety&quot; after the September attacks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The F.B.I. records show, for instance, that prominent Saudi citizens left the United States on several flights that had not been previously disclosed in public accounts, including a chartered flight from Providence, R.I., on Sept. 14, 2001, that included at least one member of the Saudi royal family, <strong>and three flights from Las Vegas between Sept. 19 and Sept. 24, also carrying members of the Saudi royal family.</strong></p>

<p>The three Las Vegas flights, with a total of <strong>more than 100 passengers</strong>, ferried members of the Saudi royal family and staff members who had been staying at Caesar&#39;s Palace and the <strong>Four Seasons</strong> hotels.</p>

<p>Once the group managed to arrange chartered flights out of the country, an <strong>unidentified prince</strong> in the Las Vegas group &quot;thanked the F.B.I. for their assistance,&quot; according to one internal report.  The F.B.I. had interviewed many members of the group and searched their planes before allowing them to leave, but it nonetheless went back to the Las Vegas hotels with subpoenas five days after the initial flight had departed to collect further information on the Saudi royal guests, the documents show.</p>

<p>The F.B.I. documents left open the possibility that some departing Saudis had information relevant to the Sept. 11 investigation.</p>

<p>&quot;Although the F.B.I. took all possible steps to prevent any individuals who were involved in or had knowledge of the 9/11/2001 attacks from leaving the U.S. before they could be interviewed,&quot; a 2003 memo said, &quot;it is not possible to state conclusively that no such individuals left the U.S. without F.B.I. knowledge.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, I had never heard about that.  It appears you are correct.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, on Sept. 11, 2001, members of the Carlyle Group – including Bush senior, and his former secretary of state, James Baker – were meeting at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Washington, D.C., along with Shafiq bin Laden, another one of Osama bin Laden’s brothers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct. The moment he learned of the attacks, he appeared not to react. He later explained:</p>

<p>“So I made the decision not to jump up immediately and leave the classroom. I didn’t want to rattle the kids. I wanted to project a sense of calm,’’ he said of his decision to remain seated and silent.</p>
