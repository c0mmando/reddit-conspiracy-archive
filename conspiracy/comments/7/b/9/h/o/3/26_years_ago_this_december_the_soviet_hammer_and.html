       The Iron Curtain will still be standing in a hundred years' time": Erich Honecker January 1989.   After more corrupt elections, huge demonstrations in the city of Leipzig, and elsewhere,  Honecker was forced out October 18.  November 9, 1989 Berlin Wall opened.   December 25, 1991,  just two years later,  the Soviet Union was dissolved without a shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overwhelming force is not enough to keep the elites in power when a large enough part of the population have had enough.   The demonstrations that ended East Germany and then the Soviet Union were peaceful,   law and order was never cancelled.
      </p>
      <p>
       These days the elites may be willing to cancel law and order in order that a repeat of Leipzig not happen in the US.   Brexit and the failure of the deep states choice of candidates in the US were the first two dominoes.    There will be less tolerance for any third domino at this point.

       Brexit hasn't lead to the hardships of the USSRs last legs, if you can prove otherwise. The 2016 hasn't lead to a decrease in quality of life, but I mean he still has 3 (7?) years to screw it up.
      </p>

       What might the third domino be? A Yellowstone Supervolcano Eruption taking out much of the agriculture in the USA and some of Canada would be catastrophic, but IDK if people would riot right away or try to hoard food and then riot when the Supermarket Shelves are empty; but by then, that bit of time would give the Gov time to entrench for the riots.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not seeing a third domino that can take these political blunders from huge annoyance (on a historical scale) to complete catastrophe.

       I was thinking more in terms of an economic downturn of the kind that the US didn't have another round of ammo to cover it up,  no more TARP,  for example.    In other words,  a level of severe inflation or deflation that put well over 50% of the population in severe pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as a large percentage of Americans,  in their minds,  have more to gain than to lose by sticking with the current regime,  it will surely continue.    Its a virtual social contract at that point,  there is enough buy in.   Obviously,  in the case of East Germany and then the rest of the Soviet Union,  a time came when a large majority had had enough of the bs,  people agreed there was no future in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is not there yet.    But when it comes,  it can come fast.   And when it comes,  it could be a surprise on the scale of the surprise the fall of the Soviet Union evidently was.    It had not been foreseen,  had it?

       This one bears repeating: Werner Obst
In 1985 German economist Werner Obst published a book entitled Der Rote Stern verglüht. Moskaus Abstieg - Deutschlands Chance (The Red Star is Dying Away. Moscow's Decline - Germany's Chance), Munich: Wirtschaftsverlag Langen-Müller/Herbig, third edition in 1987, in which he predicted the collapse of the Soviet bloc and the reunification of Germany within the immediate future for about 1990, based on the analysis of economical statistics and trends.
