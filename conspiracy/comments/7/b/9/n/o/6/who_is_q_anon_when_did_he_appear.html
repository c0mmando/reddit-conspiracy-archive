    <div class="md"><p>Security clearances can be issued by many United States of America government agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of State (DOS), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Energy (DoE), the Department of Justice (DoJ), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). DoD issues more than 80% of all clearances. There are three levels of DoD security clearances:[1]</p>

<p>TOP SECRET – Will be applied to information in which the unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.
SECRET – Will be applied to information in which the unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to the national security.
CONFIDENTIAL – Will be applied to information in which the unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the national security.</p>

<p>Additionally, the United States Department of Energy issues two levels of security clearances:</p>

<p>Q Clearance – Allows access to Classified information up to and including TOP SECRET data with the special designation: Restricted Data (TS//RD) and special Q-Cleared &quot;security&quot; areas.</p>

<p>L Clearance – Allows access to Classified information up to and including SECRET data with the special designation: Formerly Restricted Data (S//FRD) and special L-Cleared &quot;limited&quot; areas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please refrain from personal attacks. Questioning the content of anonymous information is definately valid. Doubting it or trying to understand if its disinfo is valid. Trying to identify an anonymous individual is generally not liked, tho exceptions like the autists identifying hillaries it guy or seth rich&#39;s online footprint are a fuzzy ground that does garner supporters due to national implications...

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this is nerve wracking. Clearly they are killing the competition overseas and we are having a massive upheaval within this pedophile power people conglomerate in the USA but abroad as well where other agents play their roles. Honestly I am hoping the snake eats itself here. I think there is an off chance for this to tip over... For instance Kim Jong Un will have the US president in the country opposite his. The man goading him and worsening a dark scenario. He could well launch an attack to try and kill the president that would then prompt an instant retaliation. Many claims say that the internal coup presently is between the intelligence and military agencies, all of the and black groups, etc. And those are the kind of people who want a man like Trump out of the picture. Too much sass and no class? Ha.
Clearly the alliance between Saudi Arabia &amp; Israel was brokered with USA as mediator so we can continue the conquest of the middle eastern world and leave it in ruins for the business barons to sweep in on. Iran and North Korea are on the way, make no mistake. Unless we have some miracle occur and intervene somehow, miraculously, I do sadly foresee a despicable amount of avoidable casualties. Worldwide. Few would be spared. :/</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As long as there is vested interest in money, and as long as we value currency the way we do, degrade our humanity to this level, and murder each other over language differences and color, we will indeed repeat this until a great cataclysm consumes the planet. Which in no way would I find ironic at this point. If Yellowstone exploded tonight I would chuckle at the fate bestowed upon those who hijacked the land from its original inhabitants.
Most people done know which countries still don&#39;t have central banks in the cabal...
Syria was one.
Libya was one, and the murdered Gaddafi.
Iraq was one, and they killed Hussein.
Iran is one.
North Korea is one.
And they&#39;re just checking names off a list. Even the major communist countries are in the pockets of the true shadow brokers and for whatever reason this system has remained intact.
Fucking baffling... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These people have lived relatively &#39;simple&#39; as bushman, but not ignorant or primitive. They possibly have the longest oral history tradition that starts predating the last mini-ice age over a dozen thousand years ago. Its a very localized history, but it is continuous and predates all other globally know chains of history. They are on par with the un-connected amazon tribes of americas. (tho it is reported some of these tribes have recently been massacured... [I Hope it is not so!])</p>
