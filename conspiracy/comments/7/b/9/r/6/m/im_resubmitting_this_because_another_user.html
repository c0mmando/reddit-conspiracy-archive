      <hr/>
      <p>
       Do you remember how President Trump visited Saudi Arabia back in May of 2017?  Do you remember how warmly he was greeted by King Salman?  I do.  It was a spectacle.  Why was he greeted so welcomingly?  After all, President Obama's reception was... shall we say, less than grand.  Do you remember how after Trump's visit, Saudi Arabia started becoming more open in their policies?  Women can drive there now.  Did you notice how the Syrian rebellion became quiet?  Did you notice how quickly ISIS was crushed after the visit?  Why did Saudi Arabia suddenly want to get their oil companies listed on the NYSE?   What could have caused this?
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer this, we have to look a little further back.  Back to around 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all goes back to fracking.  You see, the Kindom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has always relied heavily on its vast petrol reserves for wealth and prosperity.  And they were ruthless.  OPEC.  The cartel of gasoline.  You can't count the number of times throughout history that OPEC used its power to crush governments, manipulate prices, control supplies, and fund activities.  If there ever was a international group of bullies, OPEC was it.  And at the head of this organization was the mighty KSA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then came the fracking boom.  Suddenly, the world was no longer at the mercy of OPEC.  This made them nervous.  So, they did what they always do.  They pumped out more petroleum, driving the price of gas to lowest in decades.  What was their objective?  To bankrupt these fracking businesses.  KSA is rich.  Very rich.  They figured, we'll just drive gas prices unbelievably low and take the loss until all these fracking business startups crumble.  Do you remember how cheap gas got between 2013-2016?  It was ridiculous, wasn't it?  But what they didn't count on was just how cheap fracking had become.  So many of these business didn't go bankrupt.  So they took another step.  To convince the world that fracking was bad for the environment.  So they lobbied and supplied funds to the Democratic party.  Why?  Because the leftist are usually the ones who support ANY and ALL environmental regulations.  Do you remember all the legal battles that fracking had to go through?  Hell, it's still illegal in most blue states.  Do you now understand why the Saudis donated so much money to the Clinton campaign?  She was HEAVILY favored to win and if she did, you can bet your ass that illegalizing fracking would have been on the top of her list, returning us to dependence on arab oil.   But... this didn't work either.  Fracking continued.  And then, a shitstorm of reality hit them hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, KSA had vastly underestimated the amount of total shale reserves in North America.  They had no idea that so much of this stuff exists.  They thought maybe they could ride it out if the reserves would dry up in a decade or so.  But nope.  We have enough shale to supply us for at least 50 years.   Hmmm... big problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you're King Salman, what do you do?  Well, there's only one thing you can do.  Give up the reliance on oil production and try to use existing wealth to stay wealthy.  To modernize its trade to include more than just exports of oil.  They would need to build an entire industrial country from scratch.  To do that, he needed the help of the USA.  And that's where President Trump comes in.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting.  It was a business meeting.  King Salman asked Trump for help.  Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price.  Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding.  No more contributions to American politics.  No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups.  King Salman took the deal.  All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive.  ISIS was retreating.  Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition.  Yay.  All good up to this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now comes the bad
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all the royalties in KSA are into this.  They don't like losing the power they once had.  What's worse, they don't want to become liberal.  They now start resenting King Salmon.  They start plotting against him.  At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).
      </p>
      <p>
       October 1, 2017.  The top floors of Mandalay Bay isn't Mandalay Bay, but is Four Seasons, owned by billionaire Talal.  Who was occupying that whole floor that night?  I can't remember where, but I heard that the whole floor was reserved for that week.  Now, no one would do that unless they were Saudi royalty.  We don't know for sure, but my guess is Crown Prince Mohammad.  We know it wasn't King Salman, because he was in Russia at the time.

        https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The plan is to take out the crown prince.  Then kill King Salman.  With the King and the Crown Prince dead, who is next in line?  Yup.  The former deputy crown prince, Muqrin.  So, posing as terrorists who wanted to buy the guns for some terrorist attack, they dupe the CIA or FBI to supply the guns to the death squad.  Their real plan is to climb the stairs right after the deal and kill the VIP in the floors above them.  This is why the weapons cashe was located on the 32nd floor.  They would only have to climb a few stairs or take the elevator up a little to start the killing.  Now, here's what happened that night:
      </p>
      <p>
       ** With the post from u/kneejerk55, I have modified the events of the night.  I think it fits much better**
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ol>
        <li>
         <p>
          Paddock is the contact man to supply the guns.  He meets a couple of assassins ahead of time (remember, the shooting starts at 10:05).  At this point, Paddock is thinking this is a gun deal.  Only a few magazines are loaded.   He merely wants to show the customers how to load the chamber etc... What he doesn't know is that the advance team was sent to secure the floor.  That all but one entry point to the floor would be barricaded (crucial since the reason Campos becomes suspicious of the blocked doors is what ultimately leads him to investigate)  The reason for the barricade is that once the assault starts, the assassins want to make sure to impede the authorities as much as possible from reaching the top floors.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          CIA/FBI (or Trump's own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place.  Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins.  Remember, we're talking about an army of assassins here.  You can't kill a Crown Prince who's protected by 30 armed bodyguards by pulling a Jack Ruby.  I estimate at least 20 assassins in total.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          What the assassins didn't know was that the prince had disguised himself as a regular dude to enjoy the nightlife in Vegas.  (Saudi princes have been known to do this)  He had slipped away from the Mandalay and was at the Tropicana playing some cards.  As soon as the FBI (or some other agency) learned of the assassination plot, they stormed the Tropicana and extracted the prince.  The video can be seen here.
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo">
           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVHmshtmDqo
          </a>
          They lead him out of the casino and escort him to the nearest helipad to be picked up.  BUT, on the way, they encounter some resistance from a few assassins.  Hence the firefight at the airport.  Eventually, he makes it to the chopper and is whisked away. This explains the flight radar reports you see all over the net.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Meanwhile, the FBI has gathered up as many of the assassins as they can.  A few are armed with sidearms.  They don't have rifles yet because the rendezvous with Paddock hasn't occurred yet.  Hence the random firefights at various casinos that night.  A few are killed.  Hence the Laura Loomer videos of covered up dead people.
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM">
           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oxAZIpSUuM
          </a>
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          The assassins already in Paddock's room gets a call.  They are told that the Prince is not in his suite above.  That he's being escorted out of the Tropicana.  They start panicking.  If they get caught in this plot to assassinate the crown prince, not only are they dead, but their employer is dead as well.  They come up with a plan.  They will kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd below.  They're gonna make him a crazy lone gunman.  So they kill Paddock.  They break a window.  They pick up a rifle and start firing at the crowd below.  After a couple of mags, they realize that the other mags aren't loaded!  Holy fuck.  They start reloading as fast as possible.  This is why the average time between bursts of fire is over 40 seconds.   One of them gets an idea.  Let me go to the other room and break that window and shoot at the fuel tanks at a nearby airport.  This will draw the police away from the Mandalay and they can escape.  So he goes and attempts just that.  Unfortunately, the tanks do not blow up.  By this time, Jesus Campos is knocking on the door.  So they just unload on him.  This is why there are (supposedly) 200 shots through the door.   Campos escapes a lethal shot and calls in security.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Now the assassins are getting nervous.  They realize that someone in the hotel knows that someone is firing.  They fire as much as they can.  They are thinking as soon as this barrage is done, we run.  But the swat team starts knocking on the door.  Fuck.  The assassins realize they're screwed.  So the first one shoots himself.  (This is the first of the single shots you hear at the end).  The second assassin isn't so sure.  He doesn't want to die.  So after 10 seconds of courage gathering, he shoots himself as well.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          The SWAT team bursts in and finds 3 bodies.  They start asking questions.  But because the FBI is already there (remember, they extracted the prince) they take over.  They quickly assess the situation.  They realize the implications.  They remove the 2 assassins bodies, take a picture of Paddock lying there, and release it to 4chan to solidify their narrative.
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          Paddock is made the patsy.  Why?  Because if a failed Saudi assassination attempt was responsible for the deaths, if the FBI/CIA had supplied the guns that killed 58 innocent people (not counting Paddock since he's an asset), then two things would happen.  One, we would demand that we go to war with Saudi Arabia.  And two, which ever organization that Paddock worked for would be utterly dismantled.
         </p>
        </li>
       </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Wew lads, I know.  Quite a story.  Now, let's fast forward to one month later.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know a missile was intercepted by the Saudi military on November 3 or 4th.  This was probably the final effort by the anti King Salman group.  This was their last ditch effort to kill him.  OR, it was staged to give King Salman the excuse to round everyone up in retaliation of the assassination attempt.  We know that MASSIVE raids and the rounding of Saudi princes took place on the 5th.  I will guarantee you that all these people are anti Salman/Mohammad.  And who was just killed?  Yes.  The son of Muqrin, Mansour.  Mansour's death was retaliation.  I have no doubt of it.  He was executed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, now that this has happened, what's next?  Well, my guess will be that we will learn all of the funding that has been coming out of Saudi Arabia for the past decade.  It will expose their connections to the DNC.  We will learn that they have been at the root of all the turmoil in the Middle East.  Then, they'll all be executed.
      </p>

       ?  Thanks for reading.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S.  The story works just fine with Paddock as a private illegal guns dealer, meaning the FBI/CIA only helped to foil the assassination attempt.  He doesn't have to be working for an alphabet agency.  However, given the clues from his life style (or the utter lack of it), I'm betting that he was an asset.

       Why? None of this is based in fact, its all speculation. Bill Gates owns an equal sized stake in the 4 Seasons as the Saudi prince who was not in Mandalay Bay on that night. Right there this house of cards the OP built comes crashing down. This sub has such a hard time accepting that an actual white dude did this.

       I didn't say the sub was racist, if thats how you read it then that assumption is on you. I'm saying that the subs nonstop search for a way to make this dude not the shooter and that somehow a brown person did it, thats fucking annoying.

       People on this subReddit are concerned about the steaming pile of shit that the Las Vegas story is. The FBI is clearly not telling the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, about the shooting in Texas, do you think anyone on this subReddit is going to claim that a Mexican did the shooting. 
No fucking way, because the  evidence in the Texas shooting is very clear, however the Las Vegas shooting is a bunch of bullshit.

       Paddock was doing something wrong. Whether he did some of the  shooting or just supplied guns, he is not innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if he was some kind of Superman genius with incredible stamina and intellect for his age, why did he waste energy and take the risk of bringing in way more guns than he would ever need. Bulletin clips  are smaller than guns. Any shooter knows that more clips equals a higher body count. Did he think all 23 guns would jam? Fuck no.

       Forming an educated narrative based on available information is not unfounded speculation. Not saying this is gospel, but this is an interesting narrative that makes more sense than the offical story.

       Where is your verification?  Oh that's right it was just a crazy white guy, because that's what they told you.  The one thing that is certain is that the offical "old white guy" narrative is either severely flawed or a lie.  How could you argue for the offical story when the officals themselves have had to make so many significant revisions to the straight forward conclusion you insist is correct?

       It also has a large amount of people who no matter what, will believe the official narrative without any question and shoot down anyone who questions it.  I agree the post was all speculation (with clear connections to facts in the case) but you quickly write off the fact that the Saudi's had nothing to do with it purely on your own completely move past the obvious connections that should be question. Not sure why race got brought in to this at all but let’s just acknowledge that a white male was involved and implicated as the guy responsible. That doesn't make all white dudes bad or mean that people would have a hard time accepting it. I'm a white male and I'm ashamed of where our country is currently but Vegas doesn’t have anything to do with race and the simple fact that you'd make that statement means you inherently are a racist. You know what? That is your choice and it doesn't really matter to me and I respect you as a human being in spite of it.  The only things that do matter are the victims and their families. They deserve to know what happened and race has not one thing to do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real, honest, question... Do you really believe you could look the victim’s family members in the eye and tell them the official report is correct and 100% accurate? There is no house of cards; there is just OP’s explanation of the timeline with clear connections in the argument. If Bill Gates stood as much to gain or lose as the Saudi's then I would at least take a look in his direction to see if there was a connection. Not to mention you also just had another potential assassination attempt thwarted this week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you only deal in facts lets address some. No speculation at all. What facts have the authorities given us? Stephen Paddock(white male since you are fascinated with that) broke a window rained fire down on concert goers and then shot himself. Now through the facts, such as unbiased third party video footage we've come to find out there were two smaller caliber shots (I guess he missed the first time) that roughly line up with the official timeline of him shooting himself; subject to change. Also we know that there is not a single video of him entering and exiting the casino, because well... they said so. We know that almost every single person interviewed on the ground that night was sure that there were multiple shooters. That isn't some guy on the internet giving his speculation those were people at the concert. I know the immediate reaction is that this was a stressful environment and people didn’t know what was going on. To a man, almost every single one interviewed says they can’t understand why the official report pushes the single shooter narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our government stands a lot to gain and a hell of a lot to lose by letting the facts out to the public. I don't know what happened on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay but what I do know is that it didn't happen the way the official report says it did.  If you want to pretend that race has something to do with it or politics or anything other than the facts of the case then let’s hear your opinion, I along with a lot of other people would love to hear something come from the official report that addresses these concerns.

       See you ignore obvious answers because you believe there is a conspiracy. The multiple shooters based on sound thing was pretty readily explained by acoustics. Multiple shooters on the ground is also easily explained by the sheer chaos of the area. Thousands of people fleeing while people are getting shot from some unknown location. If paddock was sweeping side to side it could totally look like bullets were coming from multiple places.

       Sit down son and let me drop a little knowledge on you. Successful people or "those who might amount to something" put the same level of effort in to everything they do. For me it really doesn't matter if it is my job or a reddit post, I put that same level of effort in to everything. Take some advice from me, don't try to insult people who are tyring to have a meaning ful conversation by insinuating that they probably aren't succesful in "real life." Not that it matters in this relm but trust me I'm doing just fine.

       As to the facts you didn't give me one bit of information that I can't just as easily disprove or discredit. The fact is that I am open to trying to get to the bottom of it and you believe what your daddy tells you just because he said so.

       It really doesn't. Mandalay Bay 4 seasons, which those people own a share of. No one has yet proven they own
       <em>
        that particular
       </em>
       location. Also, they're rich, I mean ungodly rich, without owning it, they could simply buy all the rooms for whatever nights they want. But so can any other insanely rich people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the idea of the mass shooting as a distraction really makes no sense, at least not from the same location as the "assassination" attempt.. and this location is the sole link they are trying to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, think about that. They try to bring in another hotel that has zero links (that they claim) as the location the prince or whoever is supposed to be, by simply claiming a video we've all seen that doesn't prove anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they even mentioned "Trump's intelligence agents" like what? Did Congress create a new intelligence service for Trump behind closed doors, or is Trump privately paying for this? In either case, this sounds like something Hitler would do, and I don't see why anyone would take this seriously once they saw that said.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Wew lad" is an indicator this is a trumpet, and they're just creating fan fiction trying to make Trump the smartest best president
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       , when he had absolutely zero to do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all rests solely on these people supposedly owning the four seasons, while ignoring that insanely rich people from across the globe could have done this for a variety of reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it poorly explains why you'd commit a mass shooting at the place you're supposedly trying to assassinate someone.

       First, I think you've done a phenomenal job here. This is well-researched, highly informative and very creative. I too think KSA may have had something to do with the LV shooting, and would love to get behind this theory.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You see, the May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting.  It was a business meeting.  King Salman asked Trump for help.  Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price.  Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding.
        <strong>
         No more contributions to American politics
        </strong>
        .  No more supplying funds to terrorists or splinter groups.  King Salman took the deal.
        <strong>
         All of a sudden, women were allowed to drive
        </strong>
        .  ISIS was retreating.  Syrian rebels suddenly ran out of ammunition.  Yay.  All good up to this point.
       </p>

      <p>
       No more contributions to American politics? You realize that

       think Trump had

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I didn't even interpret it as pro-conservative, TBH. I thought it was very fair and balanced, and for the most part, non-partisan. The only part that seemed biased to me was the paragraph I excerpted above, and not because it was pro-conservative or pro-Trump, but because it was too out-of-character for Trump, and therefore not believable.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know objectively that Trump has no problem accepting donations tied to foreign interests. His top donor, Sheldon Adelson (who's married to an Israeli citizen, and who owns a free Israeli newspaper that's sole purpose is to disperse pro-Netenyahu propaganda, which he openly admits) has been extremely vocal about how his $30 million donation to Trump's campaign and inauguration were contingent upon Trump's promise to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. And apparently, that's totally legal.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, I'll be honest -- it definitely pisses me off that billionaires and oligarchs like Adelson have so much influence over how our tax dollars are spent, but ultimately, that's a larger systemic issue. But my anger is directed at the system that enables this to happen, rather than specifically directed at Trump, or at any other individual politician (regardless of party) who legally accepts donations tied to foreign interests. They all do it and Trump is no different.
      </p>
      <p>
       For that reason, and based on his track record (in particular, the Adelson example mentioned above), it's completely out-of-character for him to tell Saudi Arabia "No more contributions to American politics." He's a businessman, not a humanitarian, and doesn't claim otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the fact that, AFAIK, Trump has never been a passionate advocate for women's rights (and I have no problem with beauty pageants, but Miss America is not about women's rights). Additionally, his campaign platform was about making America great again and putting America's needs first. Therefore, it's hard to believe he went to Saudi Arabia and passionately advocated for women's rights so convincingly that the Saudis agreed to fundamentally change their culture over night. Nothing to do with my personal feelings about Trump (of which, I honestly have none)... it's just that, it goes against what we know about him and what he claims to stand for. Championing women's rights in the Middle East has never been part of his agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, that was my issue with that paragraph. Nothing to do with it being pro-conservative or pro-Trump; just too OOC for me to believe.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I wanted to connect the dots.  Period.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And I think you did this incredibly well. That's exactly what I was thinking as I read it -- just utterly impressed at how well you connected so many disparate dots. The Trump paragraph didn't seem like a dot though, and seemed more like some incompatible object, and threw the whole web of connections off for me. But, honestly, kudos on your stellar dot-connection skillz!

       Or, since the post seems to point to us having a more openly close relationship with KSA Trump would have told them that their current social laws are unacceptable; what I mean is we've always been close with them and everyone knows it but most people don't approve of them as allies and the government hasn't really been openly pro-KSA, so if we're going to work more closely with them on things other than oil and ME affairs they need to make changes to become more palatable to the average American citizen.

       Could Melania and/or Ivanka had a role in convincing Trump to get that kind o women's rights deal? Could also be something thrown in there as a show of power from Trump/the US to other countries/agencies who would work out that the relaxation of anti-women laws was prt of a deal, not that he convinced them by advocating for th rights of women, but just said 'this is what you have to do as part of the deal' and it could also be kind of showing off a US 'stamp' on SA in terms of culture. A sort of calling card or secret 'fuck yoou' that those in the know would understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it could be that Trump said 'no contributions to US politicians except for me.' And the stuff with ISIS etc could be Trump wanting to take credit at home for 'ISIS being on the run' which they are always banging on about in press conferences. So I think the theory can work even with Trump's self-serving attitude.

       The DNC most certainly is compromised but not in the way that you're suggesting. Hillary was very pro fracking and was said to have "sold fracking to the world." Bernie, on the other hand, was solidly against fracking.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Hillary def did have a connection to Saudi Arabia. How does Huma Abedin fit into this? Which one of these guys was paying the Podestas $140,000 a month while John Podesta was chairperson of Hillary's campaign?

      <blockquote>

        "I don’t support it when any locality or any state is against it, No. 1. I don’t support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I don’t support it — No. 3 — unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using.

      <p>
       So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think that’s the best approach, because right now, there are places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated."

       yeah I don't think it was really a liberal or conservative thing like OP says but the salman king was going to possibly get deposed by some other Saudi princes and/or businessmen like this guy and he was arrested due to that, even if they bother wanted women to be able to drive or whatever. MBS, aka mohamman bin salman, is consolidating power.

       I think one possibility is that Trump is also completing a power-play. IMHO, this is being mistaken for him “Draining the Swamp”.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reality, he is simply taking the power from those who had it, and transferring it to his own people.

       I know it's a bit belated, but honest question here...

      <p>
       What are you supposed to do if you literally don't trust or believe a single damn thing or person about, well, anything?

       Just not care?

       I'm by no means a conspiracy theorist, I don't even know wtf I'm doing here. But I do know that LV shooting was more confusing than just about any of the tragic news I've woken up to 15 years of adult life. And your "theory" is... well-written if nothing else. I just think everyone's completely full of shit. Probably even you, even if your motives are unknown even to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's full of shit. America is full of shit. China is full of shit. My government is DEFINITELY full of shit. The terrorists are completely full of shit (come the fuck on nobody loves their god that much - are they just sick of living in the sand? I don't fucking know). Hell, I'm probably full of shit saying everyone is full of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to believe you. Or somebody. Or something. But I don't think the "truth" even exists anymore. There's your truth. Or America's truth. Or Trump's truth, or something like that, I guess? But "the truth"? If I would go to the grave saying Scenario A is the truth, and you would go to the grave saying Scenario B is the truth, then ultimately, at the end of the day, once the dust settles, aren't both truths going to the reality anyway?

      <p>
       You're probably right to an extent, but I can hear Trump saying something like "Now look, Prince, no one knows the American people like I do.  Believe me.  And look, I can't do big deals with your country if your going to keep going around executing chicks for driving or something silly like that, OK?  It would be a total disaster for everyone.  So do a little something to look more modern as a culture so they take your business modernizing seriously."

       WTF? This is a complete fantasy scenario that is completely unsupported by evidence. This is more of the 4chanization of this subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that there are a lot of people that think that because is a "conspiracy" sub, that means that all rules for logic, evidence, and argument just fly out the window. That's the main reason conspiracy theorists aren't taken seriously. But there are conspiracy theorists that actually take evidence seriously! Has anybody here read
       <em>
        Rush to Judgment
       </em>
       ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Army of assassins? Multiple bodies in hotel room covered up? CIA? Weapons dealing? Saudi royal family? This is a bad movie plot, not a real conspiracy theory.

       How is that "logic"? He just took words from OP's post and put question marks after them. It's really effective at masquerading as an argument for dumber folks though. Here I'll do it with yours:

       Which is even more dumb. Why would a group of elite assassins wait till the night of the assassination to buy guns from some guy they've never met and don't know???

       That is true for sure. It definately happens in every aspect of life.
In this situation though, I think its better to challenge someone's "biggest  or best" idea to prove them wrong, not the "arms deals" that everyone knows about. The rest of the arguement doesnt contain 1 fact.

       It's funny you say it's something a conspiracy guy would do because it's actually something 'skeptics' do. Take something that is true and lump it in with a bunch of crazier sounding stuff to try and discredit it.

       I thought it was ONLY Paddock implicated in the weapons dealing in this conspiracy. He had no connections to government, just he was an arms dealer... Some how...Even though he only used guns he bought personally and legally... And all his gun and gun transactions are accounted for...

       Of course the government deals weapons. How do you get from the government tracking sales of weapons from licensed dealers in Arizon to:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) Stephen Paddock (not a weapons dealer)
       <br/>
       (2) demonstrating weapons
       <br/>
       (3) in a luxury casino hotel suite
       <br/>
       (4) to an army of assassins
       <br/>
       (5) posing as terrorists
       <br/>
       (6) planning to assassinate other Saudis
       <br/>
       (7) and when the assassins find out their plan is falling apart, they don't run away, but instead ... wait for it ...
       <br/>
       (8) kill Paddock, break the windows and fire on the crowd
       <br/>
       (9) in order to
       <strong>
        cover their tracks
       </strong>
       !!!!!

       Thanks for pointing out where he got the facts incorrect. If you were going to indicate why he is wrong and it shouldn't be taken seriously it seems you would point out what hes gotten wrong.

       Good theories rely on actual, verifiable evidence. This kind of thing is just a mishmash of different unverifiable facts thrown together to fit a narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people want conspiracy theories to be taken seriously, this is the worst way to go about it. I can't for the life of me understand why a sub that actually purports to want the truth and wants others to know the truth, upvotes and supports obvious LARPs and fan-fiction. It only obfuscates the truth.

       This post isn't trying to fill a narrative, if so, what narrative is that?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not "just a mishmash of different unverifiable facts thrown together to fit a narrative.", it's a bunch of verifiable facts that can't be linked in a verifiable manner. thus, the theory. Saying that the CIA killed Kennedy is an unverifiable fact, should we stop it with those theories too?

       Maybe it's intentional misinformation?  Maybe that's why so much obvious bullshit is upvoted heavily here?  Maybe upvote bots are used to promote the bullshit.  Or maybe the average
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       user is not very bright.  But a lot of the more prolific posters here do a lot more harm than good by hurting the legitimacy of the sub.  Then again maybe the users should be using critical thinking and downvote bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's impossible to tell intentional misinformation from wild speculation or creative writing assignments.  But if I was a government agency trying to make conspiracy theorists look bad and lead people in the wrong direction it would look a lot like the OP.

       This is what bothers me. I've been a conspiracy theorist for decades, because when I was relatively young I was exposed to programs and facts that made it clear that SOME conspiracy theories were true, or at least there was substantial evidence to believe that they were true.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I got older and read more and gained an education, I continued to be interested in certain conspiracy theories that appeared to be justified by the facts. My main interest has always been in knowing the truth, and convincing others of the truth, insofar as I understand it. And the reason for that is that I believe the world can be a better place if government secrets are brought to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why I came to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , under a different name, many years ago. There was always a lot of fluff, but there was genuine insight as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lately, not so much. What I see is a trend towards either (a) blind acceptance of anonymous fan fiction, which is bad, or (b) willingness to go along with fan fiction that isn't backed by evidence and logic because doing so is exciting. This is the opposite of the search for truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I don't know what to think. I think some of the posts may be intentional misinformation. But that misinformation would never gain a foothold if real users didn't upvote it and continue to spread it around.

       And when you question a theory you're hit with "why are you even in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ?".  Sorry for not blindly believing every theory without evidence.  Skepticism shouldn't be turned off just because we want to believe something.  One should be skeptical towards all new information.  Not just the "official narrative".  I think the excitement of being "one of the few in the know" pushes people to believe some crazy shit.

       I found the economic portions to be a great conspiracy. Saudi Oil trying to destroy USA Fracking.

       But things went sideways when talks of an army of assassins... Trump with his
       <em>

       intelligence team... Saudi being the one asking to stop fracking by partnering with DNC (when clearly well water, and earthquakes are a cause of concern amoung constituents).

      <p>
       Basically attempting to wrap politics into a conspiracy falls flat. Not every conspiracy has political aspects. Sometimes they can simply be predatory business practice.

       I downvoted it.  The entire post is ridiculous, especially the parts about fracking that devolve into a left/right narrative when in reality both parties actively support it.  Almost thought this was satire at first... The worst part is that new people are seemingly enjoying it.  Another nail in

       No shit, you already said that. I actually didn't downvote this post but I'm saying some people come to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       to delve deep, read up on sources, and reach their own conclusions rather than just upvote what they want to hear. Sure, this post is thought-provoking, but it isn't a particularly great post imo because there isn't much evidence given for the majority of these claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just for comparison, here are a couple of my recently saved links from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       that I found to be better posts because they have sources for their claims, and serve as a launching pad for doing my own thinking and research on the claims they are making.

       Right, but generally people believe something because of some kind of evidence.  You don't just start at what you want to believe and hope the evidence comes later.  You start with the evidence you have and theorize from there.  This sub isn't

       Are you saying there are no witnesses who swear there were other gun fights going on that night?   Are you saying there's no radar evidence of a chopper in the area?  Are you saying there no witnesses of shooting in other casinos?   Are you saying there isn't 2 distinct shots at the end, instead of one as would be suspected in a suicide?  Are you saying there's no proof that someone, tho we don't know who it was, was escorted out of the casino by 5 armed agents, all with automatic weapons drawn and AIMING at unarmed civilians?  Are you saying that the radio chatter matches the official narrative?  Are you saying the average barrage pauses are not 40 seconds long?  Are you saying the Four Seasons isn't owned by Talal?

       I'm saying you speculate A LOT for what "evidence" you actually have.  I understand you're trying to fill in the blanks with what's available but you jump to a lot of conclusions.  Instead of deferring to the most likely/reasonable scenario you tend to do the opposite.  It's one thing to believe these things as a hunch but to present them as fact or even likely is disingenuous.

      <p>
       To start, your first few paragraphs about Trump and Salman are pure speculation.  Your main evidence is women being allowed to drive and the implication that SA was funding both ISIS and the rebels fighting ISIS but stopped doing so because Trump promised to help with something.  So Trump gets what?  And Salman gets what?

       Really weirdly convoluted assassination plan, doesn't make any sense.  Why setup the arms deal?  Is this really the best plan a bunch of professional assassins could come up with?  A plan with close to 100% chance of being caught.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        CIA/FBI (or Trump's own intelligence) got wind of the assassination that was about to take place. Immediate action is taken to round up the assassins. Remember, we're talking about an army of assassins here. You can't kill a Crown Prince who's protected by 30 armed bodyguards by pulling a Jack Ruby. I estimate at least 20 assassins in total.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       "I estimate".  More pure speculation.  How did Trump/CIA/FBI get the intel RIGHT before it was supposed to happen?  How did you come up with the numbers of bodyguards and assassins?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They lead him out of the casino and escort him to the nearest helipad to be picked up. BUT, on the way, they encounter some resistance from a few assassins. Hence the firefight at the airport.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Assassins somehow find him?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The assassins already in Paddock's room gets a call. They are told that the Prince is not in his suite above. That he's being escorted out of the Tropicana. They start panicking. If they get caught in this plot to assassinate the crown prince, not only are they dead, but their employer is dead as well. They come up with a plan. They will kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd below. They're gonna make him a crazy lone gunman. So they kill Paddock. They break a window. They pick up a rifle and start firing at the crowd below.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Explain to me how this makes any sense whatsoever.  Please.  How does firing on the crowd help them in any way?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Are you saying there's no proof that someone, tho we don't know who it was, was escorted out of the casino by 5 armed agents, all with automatic weapons drawn and AIMING at unarmed civilians?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This sorta happened but it's almost certainly not who you're claiming it is.  Where are his 25 other bodyguards?  Why are "his bodyguards" not surrounding him to protect him?  Why does he go a different direction than "his bodyguards"?  I'll just repost my other comment regarding the video since you didn't respond to that one:
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence:
1) man aims gun at unarmed people
2) guy in back is too nonchalant
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusions:
      </p>
      <p>
       Must be a Saudi royal family member?
Is it more likely that these are poorly trained LV police being followed by 2 hotel employees? Or is it more likely that these are personal security escorting a Saudi prince (who apparently doesn't need the escort that badly because he separates from them at the end of the video)? If these were private security why wouldn't they have their VIP surrounded? Why would he just tag behind them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's my understanding of your theory:  The CIA/FBI/whoever was going to sell guns to a group of assassins.  The assassins were actually there to kill a Saudi Prince.  The Saudi Prince is actually out gambling. The assassins then kill Paddock and start firing on the crowd(why?).  Some of the assassins somehow intercept Saudi VIP on way to helicopter and are killed. 2 assassins left in hotel are killed and everything is covered up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were A LOT less specific it would be somewhat believable.  But as is it makes absolutely no sense.  Re-read your entire post with the mindset of a skeptical person who needs to be convinced and analyze it.

       And yet it contains an element of truth for the whole "Draining the Swamp" narrative. Trump's a good guy (as far as politicans go)??? I mean, why would be exchange stock opportunities for liberalising the country? That kind of narrative doesn't usually fly around these parts 🤔

       Because of the real reason to do the ipo and not get China involved in Saudi’s new biz model. The petrodollar. Since oil is denom in US dollars all countries have to convert their worthless paper into our worthless paper. So we stay in control and can print more money.

       It is a massive economic plan by the Chinese to spread their influence across the entire eastern hemisphere. This includes economic development zones, railway projects from Eastern China clear across the continent to western Europe, gas pipelines, shipping lanes and ports, etc. Another goal is to develop many of the raw material exporting countries in to value added exporters (I.e. produce finished goods).

       Anyhow, the US sees this as a threat, obviously. This has led some people to suspect that the US is behind recent separatist turmoil in Catalonia and Myanmar (to mention a couple), both of which would be important locations in the One belt One road plan.

       Essentially they are trying to recreate a modern silk road and the US doesn't want that.

       Is there any verifiable info tying in the Saudis? All I'm seeing is OP's recollection that the top floor might have been rented all week and its ownership.

       I think your overall outline is good. I have questions about details.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest question is why it seems like they exaggerated the number of people who were actually wounded (over 500) and possibly the number of people that were killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like we have some kind of a Sandy Hook situation on the ground, with crisis actors taking falls. That doesn't mean no one was shot/killed, just that it's really obvious that it wasn't 500 people, and some of the injuries are obviously fake (rifle wounds to the head that are fixed with 2 days in the hospital).

       It seems like were they planning to stage a mass shooting as cover for the hit on the Saudi Prince, with Paddock or someone else as the "lone gunman" Oswald.

       OP's theory makes a whole lot of sense, but now I'm uncertain. It's difficult to reconcile the presence of crisis actors at the event (anyone remember the 'hero' who saved "30 people" after getting shot in the neck?), or at least present shortly after the event to give interviews, with the whole idea that real bullets were fired into the crowd and people were actually getting killed.

They start plotting against him. At the forefront of this movement is none other than the previous Deputy Crown Prince, Muqrin, and his son, Mansour (the man killed in the helicopter crash of 11/5/17).

      <p>
       The major flaw in this theory is that a number of the people arrested, such as the tech investor Waleed bin Talal or Amr Al-Dabbagh, who's been working to promote entrepreneurship in the kingdom, are some of the most liberal elites in Saudi Arabia.  Waleed bin Talal is part Armenian and comes from a branch of the royal family once exiled for wanting reforms, ffs.  Furthermore, the goal of wanting to modernize and diversify the KSA economy will be impeded by the very people who are currently modernizing and diversifying the KSA economy.

       The conspiracy is very simple - MbS is targeting anyone and everyone who could be a potential challenge to his authority.  It's a pure power play, repeated over and over throughout history when a would-be-claimant to the throne eliminates his relatives and their supporters.

       “LOL, just no.  Anyone who knows anything about non-traditionals depletion rates understands the limitations of shale. It's an important but by no means dominant part of the energy equation.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Bit harsh on the oil component of his theory when all you did was offer up an Art Berman surface level “forecast” on macro production levels. His point that US production has been flat, while importing less, and exporting more actually supports the theory that KSA is in panic mode. Its in their best interest financially the US produces less, imports more, and exports less. They’ve come to stubbornly realize, after flooding the market to unsuccessfully choke out US shale while losing trillions, they’re no longer running things uncontested. Big problem indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only driver of the energy equation can be summed up in one word - economics - no mention of that in your link you so condescendingly posted as if you were a TA grading a term paper. At the end of the day, Art Berman has a BS in History and a MS in Geology. He can churn out all the papers he wants but the fact is geologists do not calculate reserves and perform economic analyses at E&amp;Ps. Petroleum Engineers do all the heavy lifting which causes many geologist to develop an inferiority complex and over compensate in one way or another but I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Breakeven for the Permian is &lt; $30/bbl while the House of Saud needs around $75/bbl. You can do the math on how much they’ve lost over the last 2.5 years. Like the OP said - big problem. Its fair to assume they are looking to diversify with the US not only far less reliant on foreign oil, but making it uneconomic for much of OPEC to produce, leading these countries to run a massive deficit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The OP said KSA was counting on US shale to dry up after 10 years, but it will last 50...while this is hyperbole, he isn’t far off the mark. Wells are forecasted on 40 year decline curves when annual reserve reports are filed with the SEC - including shale. Exxon just spent $6.6B acquiring a highly undeveloped acreage position in the Delaware Basin accounting for billions of barrels of reserves yet to be recovered. They’re one of many operators in one of many US shale basins. It’s entirely realistic between tech advancements, innovation, EOR, and new field discoveries the US will be a disruptive force in the global oil market until renewables completely take over.

       There's a lot of hype talking about $35 shale coming out of wall street and from shills from within the oil industry, but these figures are actually skewed by the drastic reduction in labor inputs as a huge portion of the shale biz got wiped out and put on life support in early 2016.  The breakeven for the Permian is actually closer to 45 dollars, with a range of 30-60 depending on location.  The extraction cost for Saudi oil, however, is less than $9 - the breakeven price is inflated based on the price they need for their government budget, but in terms of cost of production they run circles around us now and forever.  And that's not even mentioning the fact that their oil comes out of the ground refinery ready whereas our WTI already sells at a steep discount compared to the other major benchmarks (Urals and Brent) due to lack of demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, you never even addressed the main point, and that is the fact that non-traditionals have a much higher depletion rates, and we're already seeing evidence of this eating into growth in the Permian.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A new report from Horseman Capital Management Ltd., and cited by Bloomberg, says the decline rates are deeper than usual because drillers are placing too many wells in close proximity to one another. The wells then kill pressure in each other, lowering the amount of oil that can be recovered from them. "New well production is increasingly cannibalizing legacy production," Russell Clark, investment manager at Horseman Capital Management, wrote in a new report, cited by Bloomberg. "The decline rate looks to be accelerating."
       </p>
       <p>
        Shale companies often trumpet their ability to tweak their drilling practices in order to cut costs, boasting about “drilling efficiencies” that have allowed them to lower their breakeven prices over the last three years. But one of those practices is putting so many wells close together, a practice that was thought to squeeze more oil out of the ground at lower cost. However, while the costs might indeed remain low, this new evidence suggests that cramming wells close too close together could be eating into their own potential production levels.

       Haha it looks like the name of your game is to pull up imright.com and regurgitate a bunch of points you believe support your position. Theory from the OP just claimed Saudi sees US shale as a threat and I agreed. Thats all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is saying the US has more oil reserves than Saudi. I can tell you have zero technical background in the oil and gas business because you used “non-traditional” multiple times to describe whats called an unconventional reservoir (low porosity/low permeability, requires stimulation, higher well density/tighter spacing). Reminds me of the tavern scene of Inglorious Basterds when the Englishman posing as a German gives himself away putting up the wrong three fingers to order drinks. And yeah you’re right when you say there is a difference in decline curves and spacing requirements in conventional vs unconventional reservoirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Economics is obviously more granular than the general statement I made as well. Its a function of operator, acreage position, engineering, and geological factors that take years of studying and work experience to comprehend. So don’t talk to me like you understand well spacing, porosity, permeability, viscosity, petrophysics, reservoir heterogeneity, pressure depletion, reservoir management, enhanced oil recovery techniques, stimulation techniques, material balance, etc...because your knowledge appears to be surface level.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article from oil pro is common sense. Too many straws in the ground will negatively affect reservoir management in a number of ways, and infill drilling can have a unintended impact on the decline curves of parent wells when drainage area is unknown or not considered. There is a lot still being figured out through trial and error in the Permian - including spacing issues which pertain to acceleration vs new capture. There is also different development strategies amongst operators in the Permian. Not everyone is drilling and completing wells at breakneck speed - this impacts those articles you referenced describing aggregate production levels. Its just too complex of an issue to sum up in a few paragraphs. Nonetheless, the point from the OP is still valid in my opinion - KSA has lost market share and they’re concerned about it. Enjoyed your stanley hudson response to my joke. Im done going down this rabbit hole. Last word is all yours.

       My two issues with the video are the formation, and the split at the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you are guarding a target you have one or two covering the back, not some guy occasionally turning around and pointing his gun at him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other is at the end the guards seem to continue straight while the last two guys seem to head down a hall to the right.

       Them following is odd for sure but the formation and other aspects seem off.

       I have not seen anything that dates this clip; some say it was filmed at a drill months before. The behavior of the guards is amateur. The formation is not strategic; they are not uniformly garbed; they are loose &amp; juicy and not racked &amp; jacked. Pointing their guns around at people.... meh. The two guys at the end are very casual. Not like lifelong royalty born and bred to rule. They look more to me like a couple of producers riding herd on some of their crisis actors in a drill. Even the public don't act right at all. Like this is a lark. Not like people in shock or being traumatized. It's more like some casual off the cuff video of people in between scenes, just walking around getting in positions, and boys will be boys, so yes, playing with their toy guns.

       It didn't seem like the guy in shorts was being guarded/escorted to safety if he was a prince, so I agree that was off and left me with a lot of questions.  Still OPS theory is a good one, given what's happened in SA.

       Yes ops theory does help fill in holes and explain what may have happened.  But that video is odd for sure.

       It would be great if he really was Mohammad.  But the theory works just fine with anyone who is close to King Salman.  All that matters is that an assassination attempt was made against someone close to the king and the recent deaths of princes is retaliation for it.  But keep up the good work!  Would LOVE IT if someone could ID the guy being escorted out of the Tropicana.

       In your opinion does it really look like the armed people are guarding the 2 in back?  Have you watched the entire video?  Why do the 2 in back not stay with the security at the end?  Why are the security not actually protecting/surrounding the 2 in back if they're VIP?

       Don't know.  But one thing is sure.  You don't aim a rifle in the firing position at unarmed people like that guy in yellow was doing, unless there's an immediate threat.  It's an extreme measure only taken when under attack.  The guy in the back is pretty nonchalant.  Only arrogant royalty act like that I think.

      <p>
       1) man aims gun at unarmed people

      <p>
       Must be a Saudi royal family member?

      <p>
       Is it more likely that these are poorly trained LV police being followed by 2 hotel employees?  Or is it more likely that these are personal security escorting a Saudi prince (who apparently doesn't need the escort that badly because he separates from them at the end of the video)?  If these were private security why wouldn't they have their VIP surrounded?  Why would he just tag behind them?

       Is anyone gonna comment on the two guys at the rear just peeling off to the right from the armed guard at the end of the video? I feel like if the men with guns were tasked with protecting the two walking men they wouldn’t walk away from the guard like that. Not to mention there is nobody protecting their sides or rear.

       It's almost always the case because conspiracy's are usually build, by design, to incorporate all the factoids and to simply downplay anything that doesn't  necessarily fit. But this usually makes these types of theories seem forced or unauthentic. This particular narrative doesn't come off that way.

       Fracking isn’t really a threat to the Saudis though. It costs them about $10 to produce a barrel, with fracking it’s over $50.

       I’m not sure what’s going on over there, but it’s not because of fracking.

       Over $50 to produce a barrel with fracking yet WTI crude was around $50/barrel last time I checked. I really doubt the cost to produce a barrel through fracking is that high.

       Costs have been dramatically reduced with new techniques while output has increased from about 5 percent of the actual oil in the shale to about 17 percent with conservative estimates of an increase to about 25 percent in the near future. So oil produced from fracking has gone up in spite of the glut of world wide oil supplies and lowered profits. Fracking is not stopping but rather increasing. The Saudis are in major trouble. This is why this theory makes so much sense to me even if there are a few gaps in the theory. BTW, I've worked in Bakken oil field. It's a great place to work if you can get on a crew. High pay and great food if you are in the right place. Make sure your contractor has a place for you to stay and pays your room. Otherwise I would skip on it. Even Walmart pays their cashiers about 20 bucks an hour.

       I'm tired of seeing that lame reasoning. Trump needs to do something that doesn't paint him as a total asshat. He has actually gotten praise from the Left when he's done something they approve of, but when you do way more bad things of course positive opinions are going to be lacking and called out.

       Sure she could have used that as leverage, as in to say she told them she would change her position on the matter if they were to come to an agreement (considering everybody had expected her to be the next POTUS.)

       I call BS.  That's not how they move chips in a casino.  As if that's not routine. They do it everyday.  They use secure carts that they push, right (Ocean's 11- the Asian snuck in one of these)?  Not a bag.  That is someone's personal bank roll/passport.  Carrying it so close to the chest...  If you are being evacuated from your suit and your a loaded, you just grab your cash.  Leave all rest- it can be replaced.

       i don't buy this story.  no insight into casino security, but I would imagine in the event of an active shooter everything at a casino goes into lock down.  EVERYTHING.  that means chips are pushed into a drawer and locked.  that's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       this isn't a 4 drawer community bank.  with 12 feet to the exit.  this is deep inside a casino.
      </p>
      <p>
       shooting starts, boom.  lockdown.  chips are safe.  vaults are closed.  security starts 911 drills.
      </p>
      <p>
       all ppl working in casinos in vegas at the time had to take part in some active shooter training.

       I think a planed attack on a Saudi in the top floors is a good theory however none of these theories explain the pointless mass shooting for me. All it does is attract attention to their position, so rather than just eliminate paddock and stroll out of the hotel room they attract all sorts of law enforcement to their position and have to kill themselves. Doesn't make sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing however that's been in the back of my mind is the classic murder cover up technique which involves killing a few other people alongside your actual target to cover up a motive. Was there someone in the crowd who was a target? Maybe those apparent 'range finding shots' at the start was actually sniper rounds at this person?

       Maybe the massacre was supposed to be a distraction to allow the assassination to take place? I also wonder if Campos big secret is that he let the two shooters go up the stairs but was too scared to fire back after getting shot at and shot. So many questions...

       Right, like those 4 Israelis that went missing for a few days and them popped up after. Lots of suspicion directed towards those guys on /pol/ anyways, but quickly dispersed. If they died, no one would pay much mind, similar to any rich Arab guy killed during the time would catch little notice. Except for the fact it was a country concert but still they like American stuff

       Maybe they realized they were screwed and the massacre was a way of going out with jihad points on their side for killing infidels. A way to go out on top doing what you believe to get you to heaven. Though it wasn't the initial plan. Also if they were this type I wouldn't think thy would killer themselves. I think thy would go down shooting.

       Plus all of the gun fire coming from the room couls be used as a cover for the gun shots on the other floors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the theory of shooters out on the one building near the crowd, and possibly in other locations.  These could be snipers to shoot at the top floor if the prince got cloae enough.  Or they could just be scouts to relay what they see on their end and what is happening at the ground.

       Well this is of course given the theory that there was multiple shooters. It only takes 1 guy to shoot up the crowd and 1 other guy to kill the target ideally. And it wasn't supposed to be before, but during. Enjoy your snarky comment anyways if it makes you feel better

       Allegedly to distract from a bigger plot to set off a device of some sort is what I've heard tossed around. Maybe to let the more important members escape, as the underlings might be kept in the dark on the bigger plan. Shooting at the tanks may have been a warning, and when they murdered Paddock 'they' may have realized their original plot was foiled so just started shooting people to make up the difference. Idk, but guess we have to wait til the end of this year just to know Stephen's motive so gonna be a lot of speculating.

       Since you're having a little trouble, i'll explain.By the time they had realized the prince wasn't there, The SWAT had already gathered up most of the assassins. The attention was ALREADY on them. So no, they couldn't casually walk out, because I bet they weren't letting anyone out of that hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would have been stopped, and then the other assassins would have confirmed that they were the last two assassins, then they would all be dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       SO one pretends to be a crazy lone gunman, while the other 'tries' to make a distraction (doesn't work). This would probably get them a prison sentence if caught, instead of a guaranteed death sentence.

       Don't have one. But to me it only makes sense. Paddock had no reason to shoot through the door if Campos was going to another room.

       I think the two remaining assassins were given orders to create chaos/diversion for the gunfight involving the remaining assassins and the crown princes security detail. A heavy gunfight would attract local LE to their position and be outnumbered in a short amount of time.

       I'm also wondering, having flown into McCarron a few times, if (per OP's theory) they knew the Prince had already been evacuated from the Tropicana to the airport... Maybe, instead of 'creating a distraction' with the range-finding/sniper shots... could they have been taking shots AT a target at the airport? To me, desperate, last-chance shots at an airport target, followed by "Oh shit, the jig is up!"-fire into the crowd / create-dead-patsy-scenario seems plausable, as well.

       What if the/a target was in the crowd though, nobody seems to have mentioned that, it's the only reason I can think of why they would in load on the crowd. Shooting at a target being evaced to the airport could be plausible though.

       I think the FBI and CIA foiled the assassination plot, but had to cover it up for geopolitical reasons. They went with a mass shooting and made a patsy out of the last loose end they had, Paddock. That makes more sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, though, this all fell apart when Trump made a deal with Salman to make SA more liberal and stop funding illegal terrorism out of the goodness of his heart. No it looks more like Salman was going to dramatically change SA, to make it more liberal (more in line with what you'd expect from an industrialized nation) in preparation for turning SA one day into a seemingly western nation (with a rigged democracy and everything). These plans probably came as a result of the failed efforts to shut down American fracking in part, sure, but I think it's more about Salman's vision for SA. He'd also have to take out his political opponents, because if he plans on liberalizing the country, that means there won't be enough power left for his colleagues, colleagues that will benefit from continuing the monarchy, as they likely have aspirations of one day taking the monarchy, aspirations that come into conflict with Salman designing a new westernized power structure around his dynasty. The attempted coup was likely a first strike scenario, they knew what was coming. Trying to tie Trump into this as if he's some kind of saint trying to save all the oppressed people of the extreme muslim world is hilarious to me.

       Well, if the plan was to kill Salman and the assassins didn't know that he wasn't in the crowd until they were up on the 32nd floor and received the call that he was being escorted out of the Tropicana, it's somewhat fair to assume that their plan was blown and they panicked and improvised. This could be why there isn't exactly a
       <em>
        good
       </em>
       reason for them to open fire on the crowd, but if the FBI/CIA walked into their Patsy, Paddock, dead, with the firearms and assassins missing, then they risk the U.S. intelligence warning Salman of the assassination attempt and leaking their names/the assassin's employer name to the king - who would then, of course, kill them all in retaliation. Not the best explanation, I know, but either way - it's looking like the assassins are screwed, so they improvise a not-so-well-thought-out plan and start shooting as a distraction to draw multitudes of police and ambulances and first responders to the streets, giving them more time and hectic-ness (?) to escape with as opposed to simply allowing the FBI/CIA to come after them unobstructed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this is just me theorizing and trying to contribute to the discussion. Hopefully more leaks and more information is revealed and we can start to make these ties more solidified. Could those range finding shots have been directed at who they
       <em>
        thought
       </em>
       was Salman, or where he was supposed to be instead of the Tropicana? This explains the reports of shooters and lockdowns at other casinos all around LV.

        I think a planed attack on a Saudi in the top floors is a good theory however none of these theories explain the pointless mass shooting for me. All it does is attract attention to their position, so rather than just eliminate paddock and stroll out of the hotel room they attract all sorts of law enforcement to their position and have to kill themselves. Doesn't make sense to me.

       I'm thinking FBI didn't know it was an assassination attempt ahead of time and it was just a routine ISIS gun sting. The Four Seasons was the best place for an assassination attempt but assassins couldn't get guns to the top floor of a Las Vegas casino hotel, but FBI would get guns up there for them in a sting of ISIS members. After Paddock was killed the assassins went to the Prince's floor and he wasn't there. FBI was waiting on Paddock's call to round up the ISIS members but he didn't call.  Assassins realized it wasn't a real gun deal but a sting when they found all the empty magazines and that they were fucked, so they allah ackbared the crowd and suicided.  But the FBI got the Prince out.

       I researched the dead bodies a couple of weeks
ago. Many lead back to online identifies which appear fake. That is - no pictures older than 2012, no friends in common with me. No family members posting on the deceased walls. No ability to find funeral plans. When memorials are held, few people show up.

       Epic post my friend. This made my night. One aside as Im pondering this. Wouldn't is make just as much sense that the FBI fired on the crowd themselves to cover up both the failed assassination/coup and the potential arms deal revelation? And the friendly Trump reception by the King would simply be expressing thanks to Trump for saving his bacon?

       it is but I doubt the rich care about that. not directly. if fracking was allowed but had regulations on it it could be done safely but much more expensively making it not worth it to do, not compared to buying oil from Saudi Arabia anyway.

       You filled just about every hole in the entire Vegas shooting narrative. Thing is, your theory doesn't have any hole at all. This explains so much. The Trump visit, the roundup of Saudi Royalty. The numerous shooting reports. The police radio chatter. That one guy who with his girlfriend met a middle eastern guy with a suspicious suitcase who threatened them and then ran. I kept thinking, the numerous shootings were distractions. But I also thought the MB shooting seemed a distraction. But, I do suspect one thing missing. Jesus Campos was lying. He wasn't shot or even injured at all. The building engineer was repeating a narrative even he didn't believe. They are plants designed to cover the truth. They are either plants by our guys or by the assassins and are being used to plant a false narrative to distract from the reality and reinforce the lone gunman narrative. You don't address the problem with the car that had tannite explosives in it. I have no idea why that was there. A distraction to aid a retreat? Something obviously went wrong with the attempt.

       Well put. I think this is the best explaination too. But we need to help tie those lose ends given what we now know most likely happened.

       Ohhh. Now I see why the FBI went so hard core to cover this shit up. Duh!!!. They had to keep a lid on this because they were cooperating with the Saudi King  so they had to pretend they had no idea what was going on. Keep the false narrative going to give him time to get his ducks in a row and make his arrests and purge. Otherwise, there would be another assassination attempt and the second time it might succeed. Oh, hell. I get it now. Makes perfect sense suddenly. That's why they help protect and control the fake hotel engineer and Campos. Poor Laura Loomer was chasing her tail trying to interview Campos. I did give her a good lead on the truth about multiple shooters but she went back too late to get the evidence other than one random bullet impact she managed to find. All the others were scrubbed by FBI. Gosh. the FBI worked their asses off to hide those impacts. They couldn't let the truth get out. Damn.

       I love the research but my main issues are as follows:
- Donald Trump isn't some stalwart for women's rights and liberalism. If he was trying to get something out of the Saudi's I think the IPO is closer to the mark. The women's right's might be to ingratiate America to their cause but it's not cause Trump is demanding it. 
-What about the meeting with Kushner and the Saudis. Are we okay with non-documented coups being coordinate in secret by brother-in laws? If so, whatever, it's already happening, I'm just trying to be consistent.
- What about Iran? We're hearing the drumbeats of war with Iran after the missiles into Saudi Arabia. Who's to say that the deal with Trump isn't for letting women drive but it's for bringing vast sums of money to the US (IPO) for him and his buddies to invest him while stoking war with Iran which would also increase the price of oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       in general, I'm more anti-Trump / anti-I'm not sure if he knows what he's doing rather than thinking it's all planned out. Either way, interesting.

       Don’t let your hatred of trump blind you to what reality is. Perhaps step back and take personal politics out and reread it from that perspective.

       Also the woman driving move was really meant to draw out political opponents within Saudi who were more in the middle but had allegiances against the king. Brilliant plan really.

       Why... just read a history book....9/10ths of the material Alex draws from is anti democracy propaganda from the French Revolution....seriously theres a reason the uneducated are easy prey.  I mean c'mon just READ about the real, historical acount of the illuminati (just for instance) and compare that to how its been rebranded... ALL of this stuff is just rebranded old crap, made to look modern to scare you.  Shiiiit a good portion of this stuff came straight from McCarthy....

       what book, some are good some aren't cuz history gets written by the victors. I like people's history of USA tho for example. Yo uare too defensive, I am not saying you lied or anything but you can't say that just because magic crystals is false that means the theory in this particular thread is false. Two different things. Anyone can post to this sub so there are bound to be some people with wrong ridiculous ideas. Don't let that get you mad. I understand tho, this topic, 58 innocents killed, it's really tough.

Was Benghazi caused by a video like Hillary, Obama and Rice told us it was constantly after it happened?
Was the Pissgate dossier financed by just the FBI or did Hillary and the DNC pay for it too
Was the Penn state football coach raping little boys in the showers for decades?

       You've spun a yarn, but in my opinion you've missed the big picture. Trump was there opening a new place called Center For Combatting Extremism (or something to that effect). It made a worldwide statement, that all countries would begin to turn against those citizens within them, that had become "extreme". It's got to do with economics sure. It's got to do with diversifying a portfolio, sure, but moves are made when convenient, but there has also been a push for many years, by progressive socialism and globalism, to work between the seams to gain the upper hand. One of the ways they do this is by changing warfare itself, and there was a man at Westpoint who wrote about the next generation of war being both cyber and physical.
To skip to my point, I have this vast theory in my pocket that I've been developing for say 28 years, and I feel much of it is relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Warfare is changing, and the next generation will be based heavily on COIN (CointerInsurgency) as a strategy. There are a lot of moving peices in my theory, but what it comes down to is that there will either be a new nuclear deal, or there will be a new nuclear arms/defence race, or there will be a new war. It will come down to whichever is more profitable, and that must take into consideration the inevitability of a thinning of the herd (one way or the other).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are "re-education camps" in the UK now. Their first year saw 1500 people put in these regular looking government buildings. How long before guantanamo closes and reopens down the road? Just a matter of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       To reiterate- this war on terror will eventually be a war against you and me. Society is closing. Information is a game and the peices always seem to fit, but how certain are you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ho confident are you, that your theory is the whole truth and that there isnt much more?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whats happening in Lebanon now, is a huge setup. We need to talk more about war and yes economics, but more about war. I happen to know a thing or two about, that.

       Better than that.....I can provide proof to UK government subversion and allowing terrorists to infiltrate British society in order to destabilize it. Why would they do this? To destroy society from within. Order from chaos. Hegelian Dialectic. Thesis/antithesis. Problem, reaction, solution. They want the white right and the Islamic radicals killing each other in the UK and Europe. Proof of such is in this post.

       I think the above narrative works even if you only assume a small number of assassins that were meeting with Paddock. A lot of the chaos could be from various security (hotel/fbi/police) doing searches at other locations and maybe finding one or two others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The prince's security would only have sidearms and light body armor. Two people with heavy vests and assault rifles would have been plenty.

       Read the first half. Don't agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       KSA upped production so prices would drop, at the behest of the US, to target the economies of Russia, Iran and Venezuela, all heavily reliant on oil/gas. That was around the same time those countries were being squeezed by America. It has diddly squat to do with fracking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shillary Clinton was one of the biggest promoters of fracking around the world, check the email leaks. Even Sanders pointed this out in the primaries. I don't know what's the deal with fracking, but it had absolutely nothing to do with the drop in the oil price. The idea that the Democrats under Hillary would have enforced enviromental regulations is delusional beyond belief. Didn't read beyond this nonsense.

       If you go back to new articles from the timeframe, and follow the OPEC line of thought, this is completely backed up.  OPEC has had a monopoly on not only oil, but the petro-dollar, ever since Nixon sold us up the river to the Saudis.  YES, OPEC waged war on prices to kill the shale boom, and although not ALL 'new' shale/fracking businesses went under, plenty did b/c of OPEC's price drop.  This was all over the news, both US and internationally, at the time.  To suggest otherwise is either ignorance on the topic, at-large... or blatant negging of a rational theory proposed by the OP.

       If this line of thinking was all over the main-stream media, then it's probably false. When have they ever talked openly about what is really going on, especially in areas as important as KSA and the oil industry?

       I think it's not so much fracking but the IMF doesn't want Saudi Arabia to diversify it's economy because they're worried about the petrodollar becoming less valuable. I see IMF saying something is bad and that makes me think it must be good.

       Very nice larp but why did you throw the DNC in there? Wouldn't it be American agencies and not the DNC? I'm just not sure how that fits in your wall of text. Also Podesta and Clinton weren't arrested on November 4th.

       I'd like to add a thought that occurred to me reading your theory. Could it be possible that the deal was all set up by the FBI, Paddock (the asset) as the 'independent arms dealer', the FBI have the whole place bugged with cameras, wires etc so they can catch what they think are isis terrorists as soon as they do the deal, the assassins check in obviously under extreme surveillance and this is when the FBI find out they aren't isis terrorists like they thought but KSA assassins plotting to kill the prince. The whole plan goes tits up and they have to cancel, assassins realize they've been conned and go on the rampage as you said.

       Also, the arrest of Paddock's brother on child porn charges fits nicely into this. He started taking to the media too much, and already seemed like a weirdo, so it was time to make him go away.

       Not a photoshop, but if both beard and hair was shaved, is plausible, but a stretch.  The way both walk however is pretty close.

       However as of a week ago in interviews he still had his usual facial hair.  So watch out for next time he's photographed within the next week or two and if it looks significantly shorter than in the past?

       Remember that Republican Bush and Cheney first worked with Saudi for 9/11... I'd edit the DNC part to be the Corporatocracy and remove the party bias... Saudi funded both parties and have a huge lobby in America that doesn't care about the party, but cares who is in power...

       Yeah, as interesting as this is it comes across a little too much like blind praise for Trump. Am I supposed to believe he's really the good guy in all of this? Or that there even is a good guy? I don't know, it just seems too neat and convenient. And while I admit I don't like Trump and that may be making me biased here, we should probably also acknowledge that OP is a T_D poster with plenty of biases of his own. That may be skewing the interpretation of these events quite a lot, especially considering that they key points of this post are based purely on assumptions.

       Hold on bro.  The only part Trump really plays in this entire story is to tell the Saudis to behave.  That's it.  I do link the Saudis to the DNC quite a bit, but that connection is not a secret.   99% of the post is about the internal turmoil in KSA because of fracking and the events on the night of Oct. 1.

       I wasn't presenting it as a counter-argument or trying to say that OP's theory doesn't count. If I was trying to do that I would point out that most of his key theories revolve around nothing more than assumptions that have no supporting facts. Let's go through some examples:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)
       <em>
        Leftists are pro environment so must be anti-fracking, and therefore that is why Saudi Arabia supported Hillary and payed leftists to convince the world fracking is bad
       </em>
       . Not only is this ignoring the fact that fracking may in fact have some environmental risks and people might be concerned about this without being paid, it also completely ignores the fact that Hillary has always been fairly pro-fracking. And even if that weren't the case, it is still a complete reach to say that the one reason Saudi Arabia supported Hillary is because she would help them shut down fracking. This also ignores the fact that both Republicans and Democrats have been best buddies with Saudi Arabia for years. This isn't just a "leftist" or DNC thing, it's every major American politician.
      </p>
      <p>
       2)
       <em>
        Saudi Arabia is moving away from an oil based economy and wants Donald Trump to help them industrialize
       </em>
       . Is any of this even true? I'm not super up to date on Saudi Arabian current events, but what evidence do we have that they are trying to diversify away from oil, that they asked the US to help, or that we are helping?
      </p>
      <p>
       3)
       <em>
        "The May 2017 meeting between Trump and King Salman (and his son Mohammad), was not just another meeting. It was a business meeting. King Salman asked Trump for help. Trump was more than willing to give it (like listing the oil companies on the NYSE) but his help would come with a price. Liberalization and the stop of illegal funding."
       </em>
       What is this based on? This isn't even a theory so much as a story of how great of a businessman Trump is. OP speaks like this is all fact but what evidence is there that Saudi Arabia needs Trumps business advice? Are they trying to open a fraudulent school or something? Saudi Arabia is toning down their human rights violations slightly and this is because Trump forced them to in exchange for his amazing business advice? This sounds like a T_D circlejerk more than anything based in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       4)
       <em>
        The assumption that all of the princes, businessmen, etc that were arrested or killed were the badguys.
       </em>
       This has been posted around this subreddit a lot recently as if it were fact, but everything I have read elsewhere makes it seem like no one really knows who is good and who is bad here or why any of this is happening. OP paints a wonderful picture of the benevolent leader fighting off a coup attempt from the evil princes, but this could just as easily be a power-hungry prince eliminating all of his competition with support from the US in exchange for guaranteed arms sales in the future. Lets not forget that the prince who is taking power is also the one responsible for the war in Yemen. Seems like the perfect ruler for the American war machine to support.
      </p>
      <p>
       5)
       <em>
        Pretty much everything about the Las Vegas shooting.
       </em>
       I've read a lot of the different theories about the massacre, and this is certainly one of them. I see several major issues with it though. First of all, those videos do not show what OP claims they show. The SWAT guys walking through the Tropicana appear to be escorting a medic and two other civilians, possibly casino staff. If they are protecting a VIP, they are doing an awful job of it. They don't even have him surrounded! And the supposed prince only bares a slight resemblance to the actual guy. The second video is even worse. It's literally a cellphone video of a grainy youtube video. Maybe it shows a dead body, but it's impossible for me to tell. You would think a shootout with trained assassins in a crowded casino would have more evidence that a deliberately difficult to see video. Also there's the fact that the shooting has a lot of signs that it was pre-planned and not just a spur of the moment decision by some assassins whose plan backfired. I absolutely believe there is more to this story than the FBI are telling us, but I'm not convinced that this is what happened. Certainly not with only this little evidence anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for my bias, at least I was upfront about it. I don't like Trump, I think he's a corrupt businessman and he isn't concerned about helping anyone but himself. That alone isn't the reason I doubt this theory though. I doubt it because as far as I can tell, it is just a story that OP made up that sounds really cool. And it really does sound cool, it's some excellent writing and would probably make a good Hollywood movie. It's just awful convenient how it happens to make Trump, Kushner, and the current Saudi rulers look like the good guys while making the DNC, the FBI, and the ousted Saudis look like the bad guys. Things are rarely that black and white in real life.

       I'll tell you, becoz the 'official narrative', which was a lie, couldn't hold up and rather than dig themselves deeper into a hole, they got everyone to shut up. And thanks to the likes of Rupert Murdoch, who owns 80% of

       Nice fan fiction mongoliod
So many problems with this babbling incoherence. 
Well, I think the general idea and theory is solid but including the tropicana stuff and some of the other things is too far into the realm of speculation. 
Up until that point you could follow the facts. But for fucks sake the tropicana video is obviously a whoever was on duty, thrown together, all hands on deck, LEO team clearing the casino floor of potential threats. Maybe there were other shooters maybe not, but understandably they had to do due diligence. 
The guy in suit behind the officers was most likely the on shift head of casino security and the guy in street clothes was probably off duty head of security or high ranking security officer who came in for the emergency. He even appears to be carrying a hand gun case.
They would of been leading the LEOs through the building seeing as they know the layout.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of that video you can hear them saying to the officers "we're breaking off", and then walk a different direction while the officers say something to the effect of "let's do this". I'm speculating but I would guess the tropicana was cleared, and the security guys were going to the office to see the cameras or to attend to whatever other responsibility they would have in that situation whilst the LEOs were heading back towards the street to clear the next hotel.

       Why would Trump wants stopping of illegal funding in order to help ? ISIS was USA's ground force in Syria. That part doesnt make sense.

       ISIS was a lot more than a ground force in Syria.
Remember they started and continue in Iraq.  I'm friends with many Chaldeans who were displaced and slaughtered with the Yazidi.  ISIS there were people they knew.  People they had grown up with.  Different branches of ISIS are different things.

       Very well written. One thing that makes it seem like just a shooting is the fact that he opened fire right as the concert started.

       Great post! I would like to point out there were some pretty obvious crisis actors on the scene during, and shortly after the event.

       I'm not 100% sure how this fits into your hypothesis. I don't think it outright refutes it, but I do think it ought to be tweaked some to account for this. Thanks for the insightful perspective though, and keep up the good work!

       I have to wonder how many randoms who weren't involved are likely to step in front of a news camera and claim they were involved.

       You'd think crisis actors have been coached both in their responses, and in dodging questions that aren't covered by those responses.

       I like the entire theory except the arms deal/failed assassination attempt bit. I even think the Saudis were probably responsible for the Mandalay Bay Massacre, but I never liked the arms deal theory. Way too complicated for no reason. 
But the rest of this post is 10/10 imo. Good stuff.

       Ii have to admit, I was skeptical at first, but it does explain how they could try to get away through the other adjacent hotels that had gunmen in the lobbies that night. And look who wound up dead recently.

       They could have been plain clothes agents brandishing their guns because of the emergency.  The witnesses are probably correct in seeing guns.  They're just wrong about who they were shoot at.

       There were multiple witnesses who experienced automatic gunfire in several locations. That's not seeing someone with a weapon. It's hearing a weapon being fired. It's not the same thing at all.

       This is pretty amazing! Well done for the digging involved. Reading through this, and all the stuff that's come out lately make me feel super uneasy and unsafe with our government. Does it make you feel uneasy putting it out here like this? Just an honest question considering everything that has happened to those involved in this cover-up.

       Remember the weapons with scopes set up in two positions? I always thought that the first shots were a mob hit and the ensuing carnage the cover up. This fits within the narrative presented here. Just the wrong mob....

       thanks for the response. I also have an issue with the whole "covered up dead people" in loomers video.. it's one person and it's damn near impossible to tell if it's a person. good theory nonetheless.

       It's grainy but that's for sure a body. Towel or something laid over it and definite legs and feet sticking out. Also, another witness describes in detail seeing a body in Tropicana. Both he and his girlfriend met a Middle eastern guy with a suitcase who claimed there was nothing in the suitcase but then laid it on the floor and asked them with a grin if they wanted to see what was in it. Then gunfire erupted in the direction this guy had been directing people. The man then ran toward the gunfire.

       Sorry if I missed it, but can you explain to me again why they needed to set up an arms deal with Paddock if their goal was to assassinate a prince?  Why didn't the assassin squad just bring their own weapons?

       Sure.  The death squads would mostly like be Saudi nationals here on tourist visas.  They would be going through customs, just like you and I would when going to a foreign country or returning to the US.  No way you're sneaking in guns.  And if you bring it here legally, you leave a paper trace which can be traced back to you and your employer, so that's not an option.  The only thing they can do is purchase the guns here in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, contrary to what the left will tell you, you can't just walk into a store and just buy a gun.  There are background checks, ID checks and so on.    If you don't have a valid US ID, you can't buy a gun, especially multiple guns.  So a deal for a mass purchase has to be made.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's only half the problem.  How are a dozen Arab guys gonna bring 28 guns into a heavily monitored casino hotel and not get detected?  Impossible.  So Paddock solves both problems for them.   One, he can supply the guns.  And two, he's a regular at the hotel, a big spender.  So when he's bringing up huge amounts of luggage, no one looks twice.

       I was beginning to think the shooting was a firefight between two groups of people and the crowd was in the crossfire.

       Idk man. The guys in Paddocks room May have been shooting at the crowd as a distraction so that the rest of the team could get away.

       Do you think the escort from the Tropicana led them to Hooters where all those ambulances were filmed? See video

       . Perhaps gathering sources for multiple firefights at other casinos would be helpful. I think this discovered after listening to the to the radio communications.

       This is absolutely genius. They wanted to acquire untracable firearms so they had an illegal deal going down which mysteriously went bad. The FBI is corrupt as fuck, we all know this because of how they treated the Clitons. Figures they'd be complicit in protecting the government that helped sponsor the 9/11 false flag.

       What I don't understand about this is why they would just start shooting into the crowd. Everything else makes sense, but this part -- I just don't think that's a rational reaction to what happened, and these guys were obviously super smart. Seems to me they'd take some guns, take the elevator down to the first floor, and book it. There will be some cops, but not enough to stop them with their larger weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be that some stayed behind while others got away? That the shooting was literally a real-time distraction? One guy stayed behind -- thus why the shooting was only ever from one gun. One stayed behind while two or three others got away.

       Paddock was a gun runner no doubt. This explains the flight to PHX and the rental car drive back. Why not just fly back? Why even go to PHX? Something to pick up? Something that couldn’t be brought back on a commercial flight? Had to be driven in a rental car to a hotel in Vegas?

       Very interesting theory...
      </p>
      <p>
       I would add two seemingly unrelated items that fit nicely within the overarching agenda of the Sunni Muslim agenda.  The goal of Islam is world domination, not just regional influence or financial strength.
      </p>
      <p>
       Test how the events described above fit with the recent release of
       <a href="https://onegram.org/">
        OneGram
       </a>
       , a gold-backed, Sharia-compliant cryptocurrency, along with the announcement of
       <a href="http://discoverneom.com/">
        Neom
       </a>
       , an all-inclusive 26,500 square kilometer multi-national, multi-cultural super community stretching across northern Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran threatens their ability to accomplish their
       <a href="http://discoverneom.com/">
        Neom
       </a>
       goals, as does Hezbollah (in Lebanon) and the entire Shia Crescent (including recent alliances made between Iran, Turkey and Russia) if they are not dealt with before they establish themselves as the regional power.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, the United States also stands in the way of Islam's world-dominating agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       If every Muslim nation (and Muslim individual) adopted OneGram as the only means of currency in commerce, the US Dollar and all other world currencies (including the IMF's SDR) would quickly become obsolete, especially if the UN is behind Neom.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the US Dollar stops being the world reserve currency, our world power status quickly dissolves because we will no longer be able to finance our existence through fiat monetary policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it awfully coincidental that the Saudis and UN both target 2030 for their respective agendas.  Then again, this is just a theory...

       There's a helicopter theory, I suggest you take a look at that and other videos. Then you draw the conclusion yourself.

       This is very scary how the police is portraying the story so differently, I think I've seen enough evidence to make a solid conclusion.

       Big problem with this theory is that there are no visible bullet holes in any buildings, tents or the venue roof. There at no broken windows in the concert area as shown on video during the FBI cleanup.

       Then I pictured some late-40’s FBI dude walking in, cleaning the scene, and saying, “Ya know where I think setting this conspiracy’s base would be best for myself and my intelligence organization? 4chan.”

       To disguise the failed assassination attempt.  If the royalties in SA found out that an attempt on their life was made, everyone would be executed.  Now, mind you, the deception failed because the prince was escorted out of the casino.  Hence the massive retaliation from King Salman 2 days ago.

       I think you're onto something with the fuel tanks.  Note that those are
       <strong>
        not the tanks for public McCarran Airport.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       They are for Area 51 Janet terminal, Sheldon Adelson's Las Vegas Sands Corp., 2 charter jet companies and a touring helicopter company (the kind that make no noise).

       I would watch this on TV. I would suggest you look at #3 again. If the assassins knew the Prince has 30 or so armed guards would they not be with the escort team? I do not see 30 agents that are tasked with saving the Prince anywhere near that group. They are not going to leave his life in the hands of several armed agents when the attack seems to be widespread.

      <p>
       Some detail here. Not only did fracking continue, the pressure on fracking coming from lowered crude prices caused the industry to work harder and develop better and cheaper methods to extract the oil from shale. The wells also went from recovering about 5% to recovering around 17% and with the new technology in the works to improve those recovery rates to around 25% in the near future as well as expand the length of time a well will be useful. So, production INCREASED from the fracking wells and is expected to continue to rise for the next 50 years. Also, those states where fracking is illegal, some of them may give a green light on Fracking as their economy worsens due to liberal policies and they look for more tax revenue.

       All of this made sense to me until I read the part that almost seemed to suggest that Trump wanted Salman to stop illegally funding terrorists and make SA more liberal, out of the goodness of his heart or some shit. It started falling apart there, and then continued falling apart when SA assassins started shooting Americans to avoid drawing attention to their presence at Mandalay

       Someone that Trump doesn't like getting arrested by SA doesn't make SA "on our side". There was a coup against Salman (probably because Salman is going to Westernize SA, which will destroy any hopes of the other royals becoming monarch in the future when he puts into place a certified rigged democracy like us). Obviously after a coup you're going to imprison and kill your adversaries.

       Remember that crazy movie titled, "Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"?  It was based on a book authored by an obvious British spook named Paul Torday (unlikely his real name).  Go to amazon.com and read the synopsis and reviews of his other spooky books which involve children who "go missing" and characters afflicted by unusual and unhealthy compulsions.

       Top-notch thinking and write-up!!
       <br/>
       <strong>
        Still not satisfied on the shooting of the crowd though.
       </strong>
       I think the crowd shooting has more to it.  Why why why shoot up a crowd for 40 min?  It would also be nice to know how many of the AR’s had bump-stocks.  Also nice to know why the hammer was in the room (could it be planted?)  Also why all the video monitoring?  I know it’s very hard to address these questions because we’re not privy to the evidence.  Maybe someday an anon will deliver more goods.

       Just to add to the chatter, and to further explain where the security footage went:
The CCTV systems in the Mandalay Bay are most likely from an Israeli company with deep shadowy connections.  Interesting to see this office in Reston, obviously servicing contracts for their Neighbors.

* Why would the gunmen fire so many volleys if they were so nervous about getting caught and knowing they were exposing themselves to capture?

       <li>
        <p>
         They don't know others are captured.  They only know that the prince isn't in the rooms above and that they have to hide that an assassination attempt was planned.
        </p>
       </li>

        <p>
         Lol.  I didn't know there was a hammer.  I just took a re-look at the room picture and you are right.  But the hammer could have been used to secure the floor.  Remember the doors were jammed.  Maybe they brought it to put nails in the doors.
        </p>

         Some guys are saying that it's impossible to reload 100 round mags in avg of 40 sec.  You're saying it's too long of a time?

         Saudi's aren't that dark.  And Saudi's are known to shave.  But as I said in the post, we don't know exactly who they were after.  It could be the crown prince or it could be someone else close to the throne.  OR, I could have the whole story backward and the assassination attempt was made on this guy

         Muqrin, the former deputy crown prince.  In that theory, King Salman is trying to wipe out the opposition.  But that requires a whole new line of reasoning from the start.  Maybe I'll do that version some day.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I was thinking about that.  How do we know how many volleys were actually fired out the window vs how many where fired in to the hallway to defend themselves?  Maybe a firefight with the swat team occurred that we don't know about.  You know how the people in the crowd are not dying as often as you'd think?  Maybe the latter barrages were a firefight with the swat team who arrived a lot quicker than they anticipated.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Nono. The LVMPD definitely entered first.  And they saw the extra bodies.  And they were coerced to lie about it.  Notice how shaky the Sheriff is in his press conferences?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Because the assassins were hired by Saudi royals who killed 59 people and injured nearly 500, all for their internal politics.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Plant.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Maybe they shot the tanks first to try to get it to blow to distract the police.  When that failed, they started attacking the crowd.  Either way, their objective is to disguise the assassination by making it look like a terror attack.  Blowing things up, shooting in to a crowd, pretty much accomplishes the same objectives I think.
        </p>
       </li>

       . Sure seems easy to remove a magazine and load in a new one in a few seconds, especially if I've trained my muscle memory to do this in high stress environments, with my eyes closed. When you say "reload" do you mean take an empty mag and place 100 bullets in it? I've assume each mag was already loaded with bullets.

       Re: #9, if they wanted a distraction, why not blow the vehicle full of explosives? Even still, why would professional soldiers not have an exfil plan in place that didn't require an escalated event with hundreds of victims? I always assumed low key was the way of assassins.

       Your theory is an interesting cross reference of current events, but the details are a bit shaky (which is to be expected with such a large scale event with potential for cover ups).

        Some guys are saying that it's impossible to reload 100 round mags in avg of 40 sec. You're saying it's too long of a time?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not at all. Unlike v/truthzealot I do shoot, a lot and I'm a 'Nam vet. No one that I have ever seen can load a hundred round mag in 40 seconds. Loading a mag into the gun can be done in less than 40 even by a neophyte. Loading the rounds into the mag (they don't come pre-loaded) is much more time consuming. It's also harder than most people realize if they have never done it. Your thumb gets sore really fast and if you keep going you'll wear the skin off.
      </p>
      <p>
       One more point I'd like to make, what I heard in all the videos was not a bump stock firing, it was full auto and one of the guns was a belt fed. I could distinguish two calibers, a 5.56 x 45mm and a 7.62 x 51mm. The 7.62 sounded similar to the M60's we used in 'Nam, yet different. It was very familiar, I had a hard time placing it. Finally it dawned on me, it was a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_Herstal">
        Fabrique Nationale
       </a>
       . To be exact it was an
       <a href="https://fnamerica.com/products/machine-guns/fn-m240b/">
        M240B
       </a>
       belt fed. Yet a belt fed was never mentioned in the "official story." Most people might buy that lie, but I know better. Also the room Paddock was in should have been littered with spent brass. That stuff adds up fast when shooting full auto. I saw 100 rd 5.56 mags in the room but no spent brass. It should have been wall to wall on the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the belt fed guns are only legal to own by a select few citizens. Any full auto made after 1986 (law) can only be possessed by certain citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you would like to hear one and see one being shot. Here's a video of my 11 year old grandson shooting one. He's very safe and loves guns so I decided it was time to introduce him to full auto:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrC9q0oM0N8">
        Video
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the sound I heard in the videos. All guns and calibers have a slightly different sound. I've been around them enough to be able to distinguish a lot of them just by their sound.

       So we're saying the same thing, right? Reloading a mag is very fast, but loading rounds into a mag is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was belt fed, does that imply such a weapon was hidden in a cover up?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how many rounds are in a single belt?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was belt fed, it
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vClOquwimP4">
        appears to be even easier to reload than a magazine

       . So we're back to the drawing board on why the reload interval was so long (especially if we assume these were trained gunmen).

      <p>
       Gonna stop you right there.  While true that fracking fluid is mostly water and sand, they also use chemical agents that remain underground to hold the fissures open.  Those chemical agents can be a number of different things, they're real vague about what they are actually and so I have to assume that what they are pumping down there is actually bad for the environment.  You would have to be supremely naive to believe an energy company, who had the potential to make billions of dollars doing this, wouldn't use dangerous chemicals in their process if it meant extracting the oil/gas more efficiently.

       But that's just it.  The allies and foes of energy giants are changing dramatically these days because of fracking and renewable energy.  I will bet you that OPEC nation will all fall within the next decade.  Look at Venezuela.  It already happened there.

       OPEC has a shelf life because the Oil will eventually run out, no idea when that will happen but I agree that it will happen soon.  It may not happen in the next decade but I suspect I will live to see the end of OPEC.

       The Jesus Campos part of the story is lacking. Supposedly they fired 200 shots at him, and he only got hit once in the leg? He then did not check into any ER or clinic for another eleven days, and managed to drive to Mexico, with a leg wound. By the way, almost all leg wounds are fatal. He would have to be extremely lucky for the bullet to not tear through his major artery, muscles, and not crush his bone. Also, he is not even registered to be a security guard in Nevada. So I get the feeling that he works into this story in an entirely different capacity.

       Maybe you're right.  We just don't know enough to conjecture what really happened.  I personally most of the barrages of fire you hear in the videos are aimed INWARD toward the hallway, as opposed to out the window.

       There is definitely truth to your theory, and I think it is a great idea to state the theory and then work backwards from there, filtering out and refining the parts that dont fit. It's always one step closer to the truth. I think that whatever role Campos played was certainly sinister. And I think his bullet wound is totally false. Cant question a "hero" right?

       Very good job here! This shit reads like a Tom Clancy novel....but there is a lot of evidence out there of a Saudi operation and I think much of this points in the right direction. This shits going to get buried for the “betterment of National Security,” by those who know all to well what happened. I have a feeling that a lot of loose ends are gonna get taken care of soon. I know they’re have been deaths already but I think that may be only the tip of the iceberg.

       I read one of your earlier posts about Vegas, and I thought it seemed pretty believable, but this takes it to an entirely different level. Great job. I do have a few things that I am trying to make sense of.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         If the FBI/CIA thought they were going to be selling guns to terrorists why would they pick a room overlooking a music festival with 25,000 civilians? I know the idea of being hidden in plain sight, but there must have been other rooms that could have been used.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Is it possible that Campos was also FBI? I suspect if the FBI had a major gun deal going down, they would want agents in surrounding rooms or the hallway incase something goes wrong. I think Campos and the other maintenance worker who came forward may have been FBI agents posing as hotel security and maintenance workers. Doesn’t really change your theory since he could have still gotten shot when trying to move in.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why wasn’t the man being escorted protected from his rear? All of the people doing the escorting are in front of him leaving his backside completely vulnerable
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The thing I am having the hardest time understanding is the financial ties. There were MGM stock sell-offs beginning in early September including huge put options by George Soros. In addition to that, stocks related to gun manufacturers began to climb around the same time. Based on this information as well as my first point (which I don’t think is just a coincidence), I think the plan all along involved shooting into the crowd at least some number of rounds. Whether that was to create a diversion away from the real assassination attempt or not is difficult to understand. I want to believe that firing on the crows was just a spur of the moment decision like you seem to imply, but based on the financials I don’t think that is the case. Do you have a possible explanation for the events if this part of the attack was premeditated? Were FBI agents going to take out the shooters in the middle of the attack to be heroes?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Thanks again for a great theory.

       Thank you for the compliment.  All the things you point out are definitely a mystery.  Who knows what the bigger picture is.  When it comes to actual details, I'm sure my theory is at least 75% wrong.  But the overall picture is what's important and hopefully someday we'll get a better explanation than we're getting now from the authorities.

       I'm thinking FBI didn't know it was an assassination attempt ahead of time and it was just a routine ISIS gun sting.  After Paddock was killed the assassins went to the Prince's floor and he wasn't there.  FBI was waiting on Paddock's call to round up the ISIS members but he didn't call.  The quickly escorted the Prince out.

      <pre><code>Prince Salam came up with Vision 2030. Theoretically, it was shift away from oil; selling off part of Aramco; and an attempt to bring in new industries.
Yet Vision 2030 cannot possibly work when the majority of productive jobs in Saudi Arabia are held by expats. Bringing in new jobs raises the question of where are the new (skilled) workers to come from.

The assassination attempt allows King Salman to clean house and drain the royal swamp of any Sunni Waheeb heirs who don't agree this is what they have to do. The country has to become more liberal in order to bring in workers in order to build a $500 billion city in 8 years.

       Alwaleed bin Talal does NOT own the four seasons above mandalay bay. He owns a large stake in Four Seasons Resorts which MANAGES those floors branded as four seasons. MGM resorts still owns those floors. The only hotel he actually owns is the George V in Paris,which is also managed by four seasons.

       Remember that people critisized Trump for saying that it was a MIRACLE? Well going on this theory it seems like this situation could have been waaaaay worse had they pulled of a murderous coup right in a US hotel. Not minimizing the deaths that happened by any means but had this situation gone down this way wow it would have been a NIGHTMARE!!

       Costs have been dramatically reduced with new techniques while output has increased from about 5 percent of the actual oil in the shale to about 17 percent with conservative estimates of an increase to about 25 percent in the near future. So oil produced from fracking has gone up in spite of the glut of world wide oil supplies and lowered profits. Fracking is not stopping but rather increasing. The Saudis are in major trouble. This is why this theory makes so much sense to me even if there are a few gaps in the theory. BTW, I've worked in Bakken oil field. It's a great place to work if you can get on a crew. High pay and great food if you are in the right place. Make sure your contractor has a place for you to stay and pays your room. Otherwise I would skip on it. Even Walmart pays their cashiers about 20 bucks an hour.

       Yeah, as interesting as this is it comes across a little too much like blind praise for Trump. Am I supposed to believe he's really the good guy in all of this? Or that there even is a good guy? I don't know, it just seems too neat and convenient. And while I admit I don't like Trump and that may be making me biased here, we should probably also acknowledge that OP is a T_D poster with plenty of biases of his own. That may be skewing the interpretation of these events quite a lot, especially considering that they key points of this post are based purely on assumptions.

       Is there any verifiable info tying in the Saudis? All I'm seeing is OP's recollection that the top floor might have been rented all week and its ownership. What info places anyone from the Saudi family there during the shooting? The evac video could show a person of Arab descent or some other random rich person.

       Ehh, I just don't have it in me.  LOL.  Typing that long ass post was enough of a chore for me.   Besides, I find all those links in a post kinda distracting.  If anyone just puts any key word in to youtube, you know they could find all the stuff I mentioned very quickly.
