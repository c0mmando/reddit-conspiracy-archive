       I've known for several years that a rocket can't travel to the moon due to the free expansion of gas into a vacuum. I graduated from Columbia Engineering with a 3.95/4.0 GPA so when I finally decided to stop listening to TV and do my own research the answer was obvious. It's a silly idea. Science has knows this for hundreds years but NASA keeps plugging along. [As a side note realize that none of the smart kids in science ever went to NASA, maybe JPL or Raytheon, but never NASA proper. They don't like real scientists at NASA and they don't recruit them] But why fake the landings? What's the end game? To make humans look good? To waste money? To beat Russia? How about none of the above.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon landings were the first use of video and computer data to create a fake event. Hundreds of operators and techs at mission control completely reliant on their instruments, billions of viewers glued to the TV. And all of it faked. None of it real. And everybody believed it because they trusted their piece. Whether it be folding up the parachute or testing the thrust or logging the flight path. All real people doing real things towards a result they believed in which happened to not exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scientists, intelligent and trained at mission control, trusted the readings, acted on them with no way to know they weren't real. Same as the people watching on TV. Funny when I think about it now. One central computer at Mission Control. One video feed. Billions of people believing. So easy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake this is why we have Microsoft and Apple and the Internet. It is to make fake things look real. The Moon Landing Hoax was the first wide-scale application.

       I idolized Rocket Scientists growing up. It's why I studied science. I know now they were duped but I don't blame them. You may think scientists know everything but they only know what they need to know, what gets them the degree, the job, the promotion, the award, etc... everything the gets in the way or contradicts is discarded. They didn't fake it but they also didn't bother to check if was real.

       The gaslighting campaign on the America people started immediately  after (((they))) killed Kennedy.  They faked the moon landing. They did 9/11 and all their fancy propaganda television channels were acting when they said Osama Bin Laden and Al quada did it.  It's a scary truth, but America has been overrun with Zionist traitors

       I wrote this for another post, but the post was mysteriously deleted, so here:
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA is a subversive group. One of many government agencies that make up the deepstate. The deep state contains people that are on government payroll but often you and I could never prove that they are..  Contractors working civilian jobs and receiving government paychecks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since 9/11, nearly every single terror attack committed in America (and most in Europe) have actually been hoaxes perpetrated by the powers that be.  For example, the Boston bombing brothers were CIA assets working back and forth between America and Chechnya.  The CIA uses any means necessary to enact regime change in whichever country they choose, including the staging of hoax terror attacks.  The CIA knew exactly where the brothers were during the entire Boston bombing play.  That didn't stop them from entering peoples houses, forcing the owners out with their hands on their heads while the swat teams (((searched))) for the brothers. The brothers are both alive and in Chechnya.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's important to note that these events are very very real acts of terrorism. These events are special made to terrorize.  When people are terrified they are easier to control. They will be more willing to gobble up any comfortable narrative reported to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since 9/11 the Zionists/Freemasons/corporatists have lied about Muslim terrorism to terrorize us into paying for wars in the Middle East.  The list of these hoax attacks is so long I will not share the entire list as it would turn many people away before they even researched one.  It's common to hear, "that's why I can't believe conspiracy theorists. They can't ALL be fake!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I am here to tell you that yes, they can all be fake. People do not go on random killing sprees of strangers for no reason.  Autistic kids to not kill random classrooms full of kids.  Millionaires do not randomly kill county music fans, Muslims do not blow themselves up for Isis. The demand for terrorists was much greater than the supply, so the CIA and legally protected media stepped in..
      </p>
      <p>
       Hoaxes = sandy hook, Boston bombing, pulse night club, Charlottesville, Barcelona, NYC etc

       Ya know we have satellites &amp; space station &amp; we’ve sent probs to mars &amp; outside of our solar system &amp; to other planets too? I’ve seen a damn moon rock in person. Been to many space museums.  Watched the footage. Seen how it all works. Seen people train for it. It’s ridiculously outdated to think that that particular conspiracy is true. We have been to the moon many times.

       The Apollo moonlanding was probably a hoax, because Nasa is nothing more than a smokescreen for the secret black budget space program, where they have more advanced technologies than Nasa has.

       The reason why that's being covered up is because we're in contact with several ET species and at least one of those species seems to have their own agenda. Most people would shit their pants if the truth would come out.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't expect the military to come out and say "hey we're being visited by ETs and some of these ETs abduct people and there's nothing we can do about it".
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously the military would want to keep things quiet and would try to get some sort of defense active to protect Earth. This is one of the objectives of the secret space program.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you want to learn about the secret space program, search for lectures by Richard Dolan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you think my claim is a bit silly but I think it's a bit silly that you're posting in r/conspiracy and aren't even aware of the possibility of a secret space program.

       I think you're quite right op. Jewish freemasons were firmly in control of both the US and the USSR. There was no 'real' cold war or tension outside of the degree necessary to enact policies and advance internationalist agendas. That's why they give us the typical jewlywood halftruth in 'interstellar': 'herpdarp it was staged as a brilliant propaganda move to defeat the soviets'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Extremely important to understanding the history and existence of fakery and judeomasonic mind control is the soviet unions photomanipulations as part of the war propaganda effort. One of the biggest and most slanderous lie in history is still considered dogma today and was concocted on the basis of lies and photographic forgeries.

       This is what I've never understood, if Big Brother is so capable of doing everything and is behind insane conspiracies, the how have they not landed on the moon? I mean for gods sake man they can activate the mic and video on our phones, through beaming information through satellites in space, but they can't land on the moon? 
Think about that. If you still think the moon landing is fake then maybe thinking isn't for you.

       They probably can't leave what they call low earth orbit, for whatever reason. It doesn't matter. They clearly pocketed the $150 billion and stayed put here on Earth. But do continue to defend poor old Uncle Sam, he could use all the help he can get these days.

       Same pattern everywhere in conspiracy circles. Ppl that break this lazy pattern get people to take them a bit more seriously.

       Because the moon is not terra firma.  It's not anything you can land on.  It's a huge light fixed in the firmament which nobody can get past.  They just want you to think they can trigger hubris and get you to scoff at the idea you have a creator.

       Ya know the idea of creationism and an eternal universe aren't in contradiction right? Same with creationism and evolution. Read up on James McCosh, president of Princeton from (1870-1890?). He may have been the first to talk about this. So your fake moon idea isn't satanic. Science enhances our understanding of theology, it doesn't dismantle it.

       There is honest science then there is dishonest/fake science.  False science absolutely attempts to dismantle creation.  If they can get one to allegorise Genesis which is the foundation of creation then one has nothing stand on.  If people knew the Moon was giving off it's own light there would be a lot fewer atheists.

       The moon is still a source of light to us. In context to when the Word was spoken it absolutely was a source of light. Was God supposed to explain that the earth wasn't the center of the universe and that we revolved around the sun? Or did God let us figure that out ourselves? Just dig deeper with your philosophical cap and you'll see that science never disproves genesis, and that most science is correct, and goes together with creationism

       Other verses describe the Moon's light as "her light" possessive.  The Moon is it's own light.  It's completely obvious if you just observe it.  Watch the sun and moon when they are in the sky at the same time.  Notice it hardly ever makes any sense.  We don't need to compromise with modern science (falsely so called) just because they have institutions churning out indoctrinated youth and massive propaganda agencies like NASA churning out CGI.

       It's being lit on one side by the sun the same as every other planetary body in the solar system including the earth. How can you even argue that the sun's light doesn't fall on the moon. It's fantastic.

       Yeah and it's suppose to be lighting Venus in the night too even though it's allegedly between us and the sun.  There are so many problems with the model if you actually think about it.  You will have to buy the ridiculous nonsense the shills try to sell you to believe any of it once you consider all the false cosmology busting problems.

       You should only be able to see Venus for a few hours after sunset. Because its orbit is closer to the sun it appears to stay near the sun in the sky, but is only visible in dimmer lighting during dawn and dusk. You may be thinking of Mars?

       Right, an event that makes zero sense in the model we are all taught.  Venus is in an orbit that is between the Earth and the sun.  At 1am our side of the planet is facing almost exactly the opposite direction as the sun (facing out toward outer space) yet we are still able to see Venus which is on the other side of the Earth.  That entire model is a deception.

       Do you have proof that the Moon landings were real? Do you have concrete evidence that leaves absolutely no doubt whatsoever that we successfully landed on the moon?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your argument is basically that we should never question our indoctrination. That we should accept what we are told and taught in school without any question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a question for you. Why have we never gone back to the moon since the original landing?

       Do  you have undeniable proof that they were fake? My argument wasn't that we shouldn't question indoctrination. I disagree with you're premise, that we have been "indoctrinated" into the moon landing. My argument is that there is a contradiction in the conspiracy; belief in an omnipotent government that can and will do anything, yet also belief that they can't land on the moon. 
Now to answer your question. We have sent other things to the moon since. We haven't sent humans simply because there is no need to. Why spend all of the resources sending ppl when robots perform better, without the needs of air oxygen and food.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe this critical thinking should suffice.

       Your argument is inherently flawed because the contradiction you cite is incorrect. The conspiracy buffs, or at least speaking for myself, do not believe that the government is omnipotent. That would be incredibly foolish. I believe there is a monolithic conspiracy that involves a small, close-knit network of people that have infiltrated
Government and other influential organizations. I don’t think many people believe they are omnipotent. I don’t think it would be a stretch to say they have hidden technology that the general public is not aware of, but my point is the contradiction you cite is not a direct contradiction, or even one by definition.

       Well, when I read that ppl believe the gvt knows the world is flat, caused the vegas  shooting, time travel, dimensional portal at the great ziggurat etc. then yes some ppl believe they can do everything imaginable. Maybe it's not a contradiction for you, but for many it is.

       Who said anything about always believing every conspiracy is true? It’s about not accepting authority. It’s about questioning it. You can’t just accept things at face value. You have to dig deeper.

       I'm open minded to whatever any nut has to say. I'll even listen to what flat earther's rant about. I don't discount anything unless I've seen it with my own eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       These guys though, they never get boots on the ground. How's about you guys get together, pool your money, figure out how to send a really simple rocket probe into orbit. You've seen simple rockets that get to the edge. Ya can't figure out how to go a bit past? Have a camera pointing back at the earth, then you can see for yourself what's going on. Not too far from there to get to the damn moon if you don't have payload weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about the moon landings. Well, it sounds pretty basic. If you'd have a super telescope pointing to the moon, you should be able to see the landing site stuff. I don't care if they say, oh no telescopes are powerful enough. Well, same thing as getting your own probe into orbit. Quit the whining and make your own damn telescope. You guys are geeks quit playing video games and work on that stuff instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the only way these guys 'll believe things is if they do the scientific research themselves. They don't trust nobody. Well do it yourself then. But they never do.
      </p>
      <p>
       They go around saying they're so smart, but they somehow can never figure out how to get the seed millions themselves, to do the scientific research. Figure out how to make a million, start some chain store, get a bunch of locations. Eventually you make many millions which can get you billions. Now you can start this scientific research.
      </p>
      <p>
       They never figure out how to win at business. Yet they go around saying they're so smart. How come you can't figure out how to make big money? It's pretty basic, go into a store, it sucks, you make a cooler store than them.
      </p>
      <p>
       You beat them by having low costs. What makes products expensive? All the middlemen taking their cut. Figure an industry out where you can own all the processes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can start out small, things like meat. Everybody else is so expensive, but an animal eats grass, why's it cost so much. All that is, is raising livestock. Get a farm. Later on, when you get into restaurants, you own the meat, dairy, cheese, companies. Get a farm, grow the grain for your bread and pasta, toppings and spices. Now you can make pizza cheaper than the others who have to buy from some supplier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now where's your expenses coming from, fuel. You don't need petrol, alcohol can be a gas. Get that from weeds you'd grow. They're already running flex fuel vehicles. Use that fuel in farming equipment and semi trailers.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all starts with a bloody farm. With your store or 24hr drive thru restaurant, start with one location that looks like a national chain store. Costs money. Suck it up. Never go public with stock, so it's always you in control and can do what you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that one location does well, get another. Eventually you have chain stores around the world. Later on, you get into other sectors. All these billionaires usually stay in the field they started in. They never branch out into other companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       How you make money is have a lot of locations and never be greedy. Make a little bit from a lot of stores. Eventually you can play with the big boys in the world and beat them. Pretty easy to beat these guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you got money to do scientific research yourself and hire conspiracy geeks like you, that don't trust nobody.
      </p>
      <p>
       They can't figure out how to network with other conspiracy guys to set up their own scientific research. For guys who say they're so smart, they sure can't figure things out about getting their own boots on the ground and seeing the truth with their own eyes.

       So we are supposed to believe you because you have a "4.0" and went to a good school supposedly? May of faked the first one, but they have forsure been there since.

       Not a good school. Top 10 in the world. The entire space program is a simulation costing billions of dollars and involving billions of people in a "Truman Show" style production. You don't want to believe it's a lie because it undermines the genius of man. It makes us monkeys who are good with our hands and not so much with the intellect. We are the TV people. We live inside the TV. We're also the Internet people hence the irony of me having this discussion here but so be it. The Space Program in general creates a reality that cannot exist and gets people to buy into it using computers and video. There is no real science behind it and I challenge you to find a professor at a 4-year college who will publicly defend it in an open forum. You will be surprised to find they all fade away when the question is posed from a skeptical scientific angle. They are happy to explain but loathe to defend.

       I mean I'll gladly believe it's a lie. I'm not in awe with NASA and space programs, not buying into anything and I can say nobody in my life does either. Just think it's a silly thing to lie about. At this point we have done cooler things than go to space. So to say humans aren't extremely smart is silly. Robots have been created that made up a language, cars are self driving, scientists are on the verge of reversing paralysis. So just because space programs are bullshit does not mean people are dumb. Also not sure how space programs have put anyone in a Truman style production haha. You try to sound smart but you are kind of dumb. Good day sir. Congrats on that awesome education.

       I just came to me last night, that it was the moment they unveiled their new system of manipulating belief: TV and the Internet. One computer system at Mission Control providing all the data, one feed showing all the pictures and billions of people not questioning any of it. It is the world I was born into. They say science is supposed to help us understand the world around us but it has been so corrupted that it's not much use anymore.

       The machine is stronger than ever. I bet you didn't know you can count the votes cast in the presidential election. The machine tells you to believe the TV and the feeds but it never tells you to do your own math. I did the math for the rockets and did the math for the election. I counted the votes and compared them to the population and the registered voters. I'm probably the only American to do this. If Hillary and Bernie don't people to count themselves, they won't. That is the machine. It is the appearance of free will while being completely controlled. The Moon landings were the birth of a new machine.

       If you didn't count the votes you are under control of the machine. You believe in those sharks on the campaign team or the organizers or the party more than you believe in your own ability to do addition. Let me give you a hint: it's not even close. It's not even off. It's a complete joke but nobody counts for themselves anymore when we have TV and the Internet. That is the machine.

       It's not who won or lost it's that we've become so dependent on TV and the Internet that we don't even bother to investigate anything for ourselves. It's the same machine that's been in place since the Moon Landings. The colors, the sounds, the emotions divert us from the basic logic behind space travel or an election. We don't verify, we go with what we feel. Politics and Science are Religions. So the next time you marvel at how we're not throwing virgins into volcanoes or pulling out live hearts consider the possibility that only the names have changed but the song remains the same.

       The machine is not falling apart. For example, did you count the cotes in the last presidential election? Or did you take the news and Internet at face value? Did you know the votes can be counted by the average citizen? Did you check to see if they were right or made sense gives the demographics and voter registration data? You did not. Not even if you were angry or in disbelief did you actually go and count for yourself. No. That is the machine in action. TV and the internet take the place for reality. That's the world the Moon landings gave us.

       Having a "pressure differential" inside a vacuum is like having a dry spot inside a bowl of water or ice cubes on the sun. By definition a vacuum is 0 pressure everywhere, including underneath the spaceship. In space, inside the engine bell the pressure will be 0 no matter how much gas you have or how fast you expand it. Go search for a video of NASA flying a model rocket inside a vacuum chamber. You will never find one because it is impossible to do.

       That's 100% false and violates basic laws of physics.

       The expanding gas pressure is literally what pushes the vehicle forward.

       In a real physical system and object can only do one thing at any moment. You are saying the gas would rather push the rocket than escape into empty space. You are saying that gas will move towards an area of high pressure (the ship) and away from low pressure (outside of the ship). No matter how much blast you create it disappears into the vacuum because everywhere in the vacuum is always 0 pressure and that is where the gas will always go. Rockets work in the atmosphere because you can have high and low pressure in air but you cannot have high and low pressure in a vacuum.

       I have to agree with Dumpstertrash1 here. Countless times you see people flaunt their "Intelligence" with nothing to back it up. When you say things like "I graduated from Columbia engineering with a 3.95/4.0 GPA" you're basically saying that you probably never even went to that school and that having some sort of high GPA makes you right about everything you're talking about. The moon landing wasn't faked, we still have people in space as of now, and people have been to the moon. You imbecile.

       The fake moon landing was to bolster the false cosmology the Vatican created with Copernicus and has continued to this day.  Outer space doesn't even exit.  We are in an enclosed terrarium and it's not a spinning ball.  They lie to hide the greatest evidence of creation which is our Earth and it's Biblical cosmology.  Jesus Christ is Lord and died for all of ours sins.  That's what every false religion and conspiracy and science is there to make you doubt so that you will be brought to the pit.  This is also why all the Elites worship Lucifer/Moloch.

       There are way too many comments for me to sift through- but could someone point me towards evidence that the moon landing was staged? (Nothing from Wikipedia I don’t trust Wikipedia). Thanks I’ve honestly never considered that it was staged because no one could provide me a solid argument.

       Wait:  Private Contract (read:  not government) rockets and payloads are sent to space every two weeks.  These payloads are sent to LEO and GSO.
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering your "rationalization" of "gas in a vaccuum" would trigger at 70km, you are saying that ZERO PERCENT of our space travel is true.  Even the Space Station at LEO is at 400km.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think you are confusing "expansion of gas" with propulsion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Propulsion is what drives a rocket.  You are incorrect in a second way because the propulsion (driving force) fuel is not a gas fuel.  It is liquid.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would consider you stop making Columbia University look so bad and figure out how a rocket works before you start telling rocket people how rockets work.

       Ya know the idea of creationism and an eternal universe aren't in contradiction right? Same with creationism and evolution. Read up on James McCosh, president of Princeton from (1870-1890?).
