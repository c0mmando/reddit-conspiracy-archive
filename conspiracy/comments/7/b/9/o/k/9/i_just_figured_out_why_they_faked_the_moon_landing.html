        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve known for several years that a rocket can&#39;t travel to the moon due to the free expansion of gas into a vacuum. I graduated from Columbia Engineering with a 3.95/4.0 GPA so when I finally decided to stop listening to TV and do my own research the answer was obvious. It&#39;s a silly idea. Science has knows this for hundreds years but NASA keeps plugging along. [As a side note realize that none of the smart kids in science ever went to NASA, maybe JPL or Raytheon, but never NASA proper. They don&#39;t like real scientists at NASA and they don&#39;t recruit them] But why fake the landings? What&#39;s the end game? To make humans look good? To waste money? To beat Russia? How about none of the above.</p>

<p>The moon landings were the first use of video and computer data to create a fake event. Hundreds of operators and techs at mission control completely reliant on their instruments, billions of viewers glued to the TV. And all of it faked. None of it real. And everybody believed it because they trusted their piece. Whether it be folding up the parachute or testing the thrust or logging the flight path. All real people doing real things towards a result they believed in which happened to not exist. </p>

<p>The scientists, intelligent and trained at mission control, trusted the readings, acted on them with no way to know they weren&#39;t real. Same as the people watching on TV. Funny when I think about it now. One central computer at Mission Control. One video feed. Billions of people believing. So easy.</p>

<p>Make no mistake this is why we have Microsoft and Apple and the Internet. It is to make fake things look real. The Moon Landing Hoax was the first wide-scale application. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I idolized Rocket Scientists growing up. It&#39;s why I studied science. I know now they were duped but I don&#39;t blame them. You may think scientists know everything but they only know what they need to know, what gets them the degree, the job, the promotion, the award, etc... everything the gets in the way or contradicts is discarded. They didn&#39;t fake it but they also didn&#39;t bother to check if was real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The gaslighting campaign on the America people started immediately  after (((they))) killed Kennedy.  They faked the moon landing. They did 9/11 and all their fancy propaganda television channels were acting when they said Osama Bin Laden and Al quada did it.  It&#39;s a scary truth, but America has been overrun with Zionist traitors </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wrote this for another post, but the post was mysteriously deleted, so here:</p>

<p>The CIA is a subversive group. One of many government agencies that make up the deepstate. The deep state contains people that are on government payroll but often you and I could never prove that they are..  Contractors working civilian jobs and receiving government paychecks. </p>

<p>Since 9/11, nearly every single terror attack committed in America (and most in Europe) have actually been hoaxes perpetrated by the powers that be.  For example, the Boston bombing brothers were CIA assets working back and forth between America and Chechnya.  The CIA uses any means necessary to enact regime change in whichever country they choose, including the staging of hoax terror attacks.  The CIA knew exactly where the brothers were during the entire Boston bombing play.  That didn&#39;t stop them from entering peoples houses, forcing the owners out with their hands on their heads while the swat teams (((searched))) for the brothers. The brothers are both alive and in Chechnya.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s important to note that these events are very very real acts of terrorism. These events are special made to terrorize.  When people are terrified they are easier to control. They will be more willing to gobble up any comfortable narrative reported to them.  </p>

<p>Since 9/11 the Zionists/Freemasons/corporatists have lied about Muslim terrorism to terrorize us into paying for wars in the Middle East.  The list of these hoax attacks is so long I will not share the entire list as it would turn many people away before they even researched one.  It&#39;s common to hear, &quot;that&#39;s why I can&#39;t believe conspiracy theorists. They can&#39;t ALL be fake!&quot;</p>

<p>I am here to tell you that yes, they can all be fake. People do not go on random killing sprees of strangers for no reason.  Autistic kids to not kill random classrooms full of kids.  Millionaires do not randomly kill county music fans, Muslims do not blow themselves up for Isis. The demand for terrorists was much greater than the supply, so the CIA and legally protected media stepped in..  </p>

<p>Hoaxes = sandy hook, Boston bombing, pulse night club, Charlottesville, Barcelona, NYC etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason why that&#39;s being covered up is because we&#39;re in contact with several ET species and at least one of those species seems to have their own agenda. Most people would shit their pants if the truth would come out.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t expect the military to come out and say &quot;hey we&#39;re being visited by ETs and some of these ETs abduct people and there&#39;s nothing we can do about it&quot;.</p>

<p>Obviously the military would want to keep things quiet and would try to get some sort of defense active to protect Earth. This is one of the objectives of the secret space program.</p>

<p>And if you want to learn about the secret space program, search for lectures by Richard Dolan.</p>

<p>Also, you think my claim is a bit silly but I think it&#39;s a bit silly that you&#39;re posting in r/conspiracy and aren&#39;t even aware of the possibility of a secret space program.</p>

There was no &#39;real&#39; cold war or tension outside of the degree necessary to enact policies and advance internationalist agendas.

<p>Extremely important to understanding the history and existence of fakery and judeomasonic mind control is the soviet unions photomanipulations as part of the war propaganda effort. One of the biggest and most slanderous lie in history is still considered dogma today and was concocted on the basis of lies and photographic forgeries. </p>

Now to answer your question. We have sent other things to the moon since. We haven&#39;t sent humans simply because there is no need to. Why spend all of the resources sending ppl when robots perform better, without the needs of air oxygen and food. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your argument is inherently flawed because the contradiction you cite is incorrect. The conspiracy buffs, or at least speaking for myself, do not believe that the government is omnipotent. That would be incredibly foolish. I believe there is a monolithic conspiracy that involves a small, close-knit network of people that have infiltrated
Government and other influential organizations. I don’t think many people believe they are omnipotent. I don’t think it would be a stretch to say they have hidden technology that the general public is not aware of, but my point is the contradiction you cite is not a direct contradiction, or even one by definition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, when I read that ppl believe the gvt knows the world is flat, caused the vegas  shooting, time travel, dimensional portal at the great ziggurat etc. then yes some ppl believe they can do everything imaginable. Maybe it&#39;s not a contradiction for you, but for many it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m open minded to whatever any nut has to say. I&#39;ll even listen to what flat earther&#39;s rant about. I don&#39;t discount anything unless I&#39;ve seen it with my own eyes. </p>

<p>These guys though, they never get boots on the ground. How&#39;s about you guys get together, pool your money, figure out how to send a really simple rocket probe into orbit. You&#39;ve seen simple rockets that get to the edge. Ya can&#39;t figure out how to go a bit past? Have a camera pointing back at the earth, then you can see for yourself what&#39;s going on. Not too far from there to get to the damn moon if you don&#39;t have payload weight. </p>

<p>How about the moon landings. Well, it sounds pretty basic. If you&#39;d have a super telescope pointing to the moon, you should be able to see the landing site stuff. I don&#39;t care if they say, oh no telescopes are powerful enough. Well, same thing as getting your own probe into orbit. Quit the whining and make your own damn telescope. You guys are geeks quit playing video games and work on that stuff instead. </p>

<p>This is the only way these guys &#39;ll believe things is if they do the scientific research themselves. They don&#39;t trust nobody. Well do it yourself then. But they never do. </p>

<p>They go around saying they&#39;re so smart, but they somehow can never figure out how to get the seed millions themselves, to do the scientific research. Figure out how to make a million, start some chain store, get a bunch of locations. Eventually you make many millions which can get you billions. Now you can start this scientific research. </p>

<p>They never figure out how to win at business. Yet they go around saying they&#39;re so smart. How come you can&#39;t figure out how to make big money? It&#39;s pretty basic, go into a store, it sucks, you make a cooler store than them. </p>

<p>You beat them by having low costs. What makes products expensive? All the middlemen taking their cut. Figure an industry out where you can own all the processes. </p>

<p>You can start out small, things like meat. Everybody else is so expensive, but an animal eats grass, why&#39;s it cost so much. All that is, is raising livestock. Get a farm. Later on, when you get into restaurants, you own the meat, dairy, cheese, companies. Get a farm, grow the grain for your bread and pasta, toppings and spices. Now you can make pizza cheaper than the others who have to buy from some supplier. </p>

<p>Now where&#39;s your expenses coming from, fuel. You don&#39;t need petrol, alcohol can be a gas. Get that from weeds you&#39;d grow. They&#39;re already running flex fuel vehicles. Use that fuel in farming equipment and semi trailers. </p>

<p>It all starts with a bloody farm. With your store or 24hr drive thru restaurant, start with one location that looks like a national chain store. Costs money. Suck it up. Never go public with stock, so it&#39;s always you in control and can do what you want. </p>

<p>If that one location does well, get another. Eventually you have chain stores around the world. Later on, you get into other sectors. All these billionaires usually stay in the field they started in. They never branch out into other companies. </p>

<p>How you make money is have a lot of locations and never be greedy. Make a little bit from a lot of stores. Eventually you can play with the big boys in the world and beat them. Pretty easy to beat these guys. </p>

<p>Now you got money to do scientific research yourself and hire conspiracy geeks like you, that don&#39;t trust nobody. </p>

<p>They can&#39;t figure out how to network with other conspiracy guys to set up their own scientific research. For guys who say they&#39;re so smart, they sure can&#39;t figure things out about getting their own boots on the ground and seeing the truth with their own eyes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a good school. Top 10 in the world. The entire space program is a simulation costing billions of dollars and involving billions of people in a &quot;Truman Show&quot; style production. You don&#39;t want to believe it&#39;s a lie because it undermines the genius of man. It makes us monkeys who are good with our hands and not so much with the intellect. We are the TV people. We live inside the TV. We&#39;re also the Internet people hence the irony of me having this discussion here but so be it. The Space Program in general creates a reality that cannot exist and gets people to buy into it using computers and video. There is no real science behind it and I challenge you to find a professor at a 4-year college who will publicly defend it in an open forum. You will be surprised to find they all fade away when the question is posed from a skeptical scientific angle. They are happy to explain but loathe to defend.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean I&#39;ll gladly believe it&#39;s a lie. I&#39;m not in awe with NASA and space programs, not buying into anything and I can say nobody in my life does either. Just think it&#39;s a silly thing to lie about. At this point we have done cooler things than go to space. So to say humans aren&#39;t extremely smart is silly. Robots have been created that made up a language, cars are self driving, scientists are on the verge of reversing paralysis. So just because space programs are bullshit does not mean people are dumb. Also not sure how space programs have put anyone in a Truman style production haha. You try to sound smart but you are kind of dumb. Good day sir. Congrats on that awesome education. </p>

One computer system at Mission Control providing all the data, one feed showing all the pictures and billions of people not questioning any of it. It is the world I was born into. They say science is supposed to help us understand the world around us but it has been so corrupted that it&#39;s not much use anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The machine is stronger than ever. I bet you didn&#39;t know you can count the votes cast in the presidential election. The machine tells you to believe the TV and the feeds but it never tells you to do your own math. I did the math for the rockets and did the math for the election. I counted the votes and compared them to the population and the registered voters. I&#39;m probably the only American to do this. If Hillary and Bernie don&#39;t people to count themselves, they won&#39;t. That is the machine. It is the appearance of free will while being completely controlled.

We don&#39;t verify, we go with what we feel. Politics and Science are Religions.

    <div class="md"><p>In a real physical system and object can only do one thing at any moment. You are saying the gas would rather push the rocket than escape into empty space. You are saying that gas will move towards an area of high pressure (the ship) and away from low pressure (outside of the ship). No matter how much blast you create it disappears into the vacuum because everywhere in the vacuum is always 0 pressure and that is where the gas will always go. Rockets work in the atmosphere because you can have high and low pressure in air but you cannot have high and low pressure in a vacuum. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fake moon landing was to bolster the false cosmology the Vatican created with Copernicus and has continued to this day.  Outer space doesn&#39;t even exit.  We are in an enclosed terrarium and it&#39;s not a spinning ball.  They lie to hide the greatest evidence of creation which is our Earth and it&#39;s Biblical cosmology.  Jesus Christ is Lord and died for all of ours sins.  That&#39;s what every false religion and conspiracy and science is there to make you doubt so that you will be brought to the pit.  This is also why all the Elites worship Lucifer/Moloch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are way too many comments for me to sift through- but could someone point me towards evidence that the moon landing was staged? (Nothing from Wikipedia I don’t trust Wikipedia). Thanks I’ve honestly never considered that it was staged because no one could provide me a solid argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait:  Private Contract (read:  not government) rockets and payloads are sent to space every two weeks.  These payloads are sent to LEO and GSO.</p>

<p>Considering your &quot;rationalization&quot; of &quot;gas in a vaccuum&quot; would trigger at 70km, you are saying that ZERO PERCENT of our space travel is true.  Even the Space Station at LEO is at 400km.   </p>

<p>I think you are confusing &quot;expansion of gas&quot; with propulsion. </p>

<p>Propulsion is what drives a rocket.  You are incorrect in a second way because the propulsion (driving force) fuel is not a gas fuel.  It is liquid.</p>

<p>I would consider you stop making Columbia University look so bad and figure out how a rocket works before you start telling rocket people how rockets work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya know the idea of creationism and an eternal universe aren&#39;t in contradiction right? Same with creationism and evolution. Read up on James McCosh, president of Princeton from (1870-1890?). He may have been the first to talk about this. So your fake moon idea isn&#39;t satanic. Science enhances our understanding of theology, it doesn&#39;t dismantle it. </p>
