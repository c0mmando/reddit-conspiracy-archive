    <div class="md"><p>You always need to have your &quot;visors on&quot; so to speak. Don&#39;t ever trust one source blindly. Especially if they work for the Corporate Media, as Tucker does. Watch him, weigh his opinion, compare it to others. Personally, despite the fact I believe the MSM in this country to be nothing but Corporate Media Propaganda, I still keep tabs on it because even among Propaganda truth can be gleaned, even if the producers of said Propaganda don&#39;t realize it themselves.</p>

<p>When he had Gerald Posner (&quot;Case Closed&quot;) on about the JFK assassination, Carlson said he agreed LHO acted alone. Fuck, Oswald wasn&#39;t even one of the gunmen and I&#39;m sure Tucker Carlson knows it!</p>

<p>I still watch his videos sometime, though. </p>

<p>There are <strong>many</strong> factions of evil, and they are continually at odds with each-other as well as in cahoots with each other. So many different people/factions want to be a god...so many are participants in this rat race of control and authority.

And then there are others that honestly believe that they can use the system to make the world a better place...the useful idiots if you will. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve taken a bit of interest in Tucker Carlson as far as anyone in the MSM goes. In interviews he seems like a very intelligent down to earth guy who is walking a fine line between promoting skeptic views and keeping his job. At the very least at the mainstream level he&#39;s good at destroying SJW liberalism</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to think he&#39;s one of the few that tries to be as true to himself and to his viewers while keeping his job. I imagine that if he truly spoke his mind he wouldn&#39;t last long. I don&#39;t view him as controlled opposition;  I see him as opposition within the control.</p>
