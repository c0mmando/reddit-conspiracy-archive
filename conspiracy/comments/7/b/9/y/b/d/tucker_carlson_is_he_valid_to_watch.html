       I am vaguely watching over this reddit thread and the news about all the occurrences (vaguely = I'm glued to my fucking phone...) -- I've been watching Tucker Carlson but I do notice he is considered MSM... am I right?

       Is he worth watching?

       You always need to have your "visors on" so to speak. Don't ever trust one source blindly. Especially if they work for the Corporate Media, as Tucker does. Watch him, weigh his opinion, compare it to others. Personally, despite the fact I believe the MSM in this country to be nothing but Corporate Media Propaganda, I still keep tabs on it because even among Propaganda truth can be gleaned, even if the producers of said Propaganda don't realize it themselves.

       Yes. But, the one thing that bugs me is when he brings on obvious strawmen with shitty opinions just so he can easily "destroy" and "own" them. And tries so hard to find the right spot during the interview to laugh at them on his high horse. Too contrived and easy.

       You just need to see if the people you watch question the stuff you question or portray themselves as you would.. and that normally is someone to watch. Whether your opinion is left or right or up or down. Find similar personality and go with it. Who knows what is true and what isnâ€™t anymore. Just follow that twinkle in their eye !

       Best of a bad lot, IMHO. Do I trust him? No.

      <p>
       When he had Gerald Posner ("Case Closed") on about the JFK assassination, Carlson said he agreed LHO acted alone. Fuck, Oswald wasn't even one of the gunmen and I'm sure Tucker Carlson knows it!

       People should be skeptical of  EVERYONE who is part of the establishment...this includes Tucker, Maddow,  Trump, Hilary, etc etc...EVERYONE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with all that we see happening in the news these days...there is NO attention drawn to the foundations of oppression and tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are
       <strong>
        many
       </strong>
       factions of evil, and they are continually at odds with each-other as well as in cahoots with each other. So many different people/factions want to be a god...so many are participants in this rat race of control and authority. Sometimes they work together sometimes they are at each-others throats...sometimes they simply pretend to be doing either or. And then there are others that honestly believe that they can use the system to make the world a better place...the useful idiots if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lies will be mixed with truth. Truths will be omitted when exposing lies. Very few, if any, have the COMPLETE picture of what is really going on in the world and why.
      </p>

       Again...please stop stalking me in random threads because you are unable or unwilling to process the information and ideas that you asked me for. If you are so convinced that I am full of it, then go do the experiment and see for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep telling me I am full of it and "Stop" our conversation, and then you go and keep track of my comment history just to harass me in random threads...all while you willfully ignore things that are starring you right in the face...
      </p>
      <p>
       at this point I really can;t tell if you are trolling me or just having a mental breakdown...but either way, it is pathetic...

      <p>
       please get a grip before you do something you will regret....

       I just want the people you are talking to to be aware if your true intentions. If you beleive so strongly about it why are you afraid of me telling people what you beleive. I don't mean any disrespect I am just informing

       Pray tell...what are my "true intentions" as you see them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because in my assessment I have offered you only rational thought, pointed out provable truths and obvious deceptions, encouraged you to think for yourself and have been respectful to you even when you felt the need to mock me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also repeatedly told you that you can break off communication with me any time you want. YOU engaged me in conversation man. I am not afraid of you or anything you have to say. And if you honestly didn't mean any disrespect you wouldn't be bringing up the aspects of our original conversation in random posts that have nothing to with said conversation. And I'm not telling people not to listen to you...they can go view our comment history any time they want and see your obvious motivation for your comment...but I am not going to just stay quiet when someone like you starts throwing jabs at me publicly...

       I've taken a bit of interest in Tucker Carlson as far as anyone in the MSM goes. In interviews he seems like a very intelligent down to earth guy who is walking a fine line between promoting skeptic views and keeping his job. At the very least at the mainstream level he's good at destroying SJW liberalism
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd like to think he's one of the few that tries to be as true to himself and to his viewers while keeping his job. I imagine that if he truly spoke his mind he wouldn't last long. I don't view him as controlled opposition;  I see him as opposition within the control.

       I think for anyone to be successful making changes within such a corrupt system where individuals can be excommunicated for saying what amounts to blasphemy against the status quo; they would have to 'play ball' so to speak to remain in a position where they could say something to make a difference when needed.

       He drives wedges between people, fans the flames of culture war, and collects a huge paycheck paid for by the giant corporations that advertise on his show.

       Don't consume corporate media. There are plenty of fact-based alternatives. Wikileaks, Intercept, Jeremy Scahill, Matt Taibbi, Glenn Greenwald....
