       how long have you been paying attention to conspiracies and or researching into these sorts of things?  I’m an old timer myself. I’m glad to see people waking up but it seems like some here are very young. This is not a slight at any of you. I’m just a naturally curious human.

       Not enough room here to tell the story(or I don't have the time atm) or both:) The top 3 questions I get.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) are you really a pastor? Yes
2) did you really have this experience? Yes
3) What do you think they are? Nephilim

       I felt ripped off &amp; thought it was a fake and a waste until later on...I read stuff...and then they whacked JFK...And the Lincoln complaints resurfaced because of the obvious parallels to the century-earlier coup.

       I am 30 and work with a lot of people in their early twenties, I have heard off hand conversations at work about how Chester Bennington was killed and how vegas seems super weird.  Younger generation seems way more in tune with how fucked everything is than the generations before imo.  I think the internet has helped educate a lot of people that all is not what it seems.

       I deployed to the middle East 3 separate times while active. All I will say is there is a huge heroin epidemic here in the U.S. because of it. My best friend who joined with me saw other things going on while he was on a sub. They were always near South America, and he told me they would allow the drug subs pass by with out any kind of encounter. Oh also we do have a lot of contract companies in Afghanistan that are there for mining rare earth metals.

       I defiantly believe almost for a fact that our contractors do bring opium back to the states. None of my guys did. 
I'm a navy corpsman (battle field medic with the marines) so I supplied my guys with tramadol. Why? I was with EOD and my route cleareance team. We were struck by a lot of IEDs, just about everyone in my platoon was suffering from horrible back pain. 
But I never gave the heavy duty stuff out ( morphine/ valium auto injectors and fentanyl pops). Only time i had to use that was for guys that did lose limbs.

       Tramadol is pretty safe and difficult to abuse as far as opioid-class drugs go. We use it for dogs in veterinary medicine after ortho surgeries. What specifically makes you believe almost for a fact that drugs are being smuggled? (I believe it too, but this is my first chance hearing a first hand account about it)

       From hearing alot of stories from higher enlisted. But a big eye opener was and this is no joke but before we went out for the first time we had to sit through a class and a guy saying he was DEA told us not to drive through or destroy the opium fields. 
Of course we did with our MRAPs to avoid known spot of IEDs and we got into a shit ton of trouble from the top of the top. And we did this several times. Our platoon was pulled from doing route clearance for 2 weeks

       30 years now. I’m grateful I’ve had that much time to digest it, and then watch it change from the old school way to the internet way of things. Having decades to watch everything unfold gives you a grander perspective.

       I feel a little sorry for the rookies just waking up. They’re being bombarded with so much info and disinformation without the years of wisdom to sort it out. There’s a slow Keelung curve process to all of this. A wisdom is required. It’s like learning the piano. You dint go in to your first lesson thinking you’re going to come out playing like Rachmaninov. It takes years.

       Attended management orientation for new hire college grads in early '70 and for one week listened to speaker Robert Lefevre founder of The Freedom School. Wild CRAZY rants about the UN, Rockefellers, JFK, the FED, historical corrections. Forgot about it til after 9/11... Wow, if he could only be alive now.

       I bought into it and demanded we send troops to Africa to get the "bad guy", until I stumbled on a video of Alex Jones discussing this as "war propoganda".

       The fucking lightbulb just lit up. That was the context/angle of information I needed to light up my entire anti-establishment brain, that simple revelation changed my life forever. I became super skeptical of every event since then and consider myself an expert on the "New World Order", as I have obsessively been trying to learn about and expose these people ever since.
