My best friend who joined with me saw other things going on while he was on a sub. They were always near South America, and he told me they would allow the drug subs pass by with out any kind of encounter. Oh also we do have a lot of contract companies in Afghanistan that are there for mining rare earth metals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I defiantly believe almost for a fact that our contractors do bring opium back to the states. None of my guys did. 
I&#39;m a navy corpsman (battle field medic with the marines) so I supplied my guys with tramadol. Why? I was with EOD and my route cleareance team. We were struck by a lot of IEDs, just about everyone in my platoon was suffering from horrible back pain. 
But I never gave the heavy duty stuff out ( morphine/ valium auto injectors and fentanyl pops). Only time i had to use that was for guys that did lose limbs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From hearing alot of stories from higher enlisted. But a big eye opener was and this is no joke but before we went out for the first time we had to sit through a class and a guy saying he was DEA told us not to drive through or destroy the opium fields. 
Of course we did with our MRAPs to avoid known spot of IEDs and we got into a shit ton of trouble from the top of the top. And we did this several times. Our platoon was pulled from doing route clearance for 2 weeks</p>

    <div class="md"><p>30 years now. I’m grateful I’ve had that much time to digest it, and then watch it change from the old school way to the internet way of things. Having decades to watch everything unfold gives you a grander perspective.</p>

<p>I feel a little sorry for the rookies just waking up. They’re being bombarded with so much info and disinformation without the years of wisdom to sort it out. There’s a slow Keelung curve process to all of this. A wisdom is required. It’s like learning the piano. You dint go in to your first lesson thinking you’re going to come out playing like Rachmaninov. It takes years.</p>

<p>I bought into it and demanded we send troops to Africa to get the &quot;bad guy&quot;, until I stumbled on a video of Alex Jones discussing this as &quot;war propoganda&quot;.</p>

<p>The fucking lightbulb just lit up. That was the context/angle of information I needed to light up my entire anti-establishment brain, that simple revelation changed my life forever.
