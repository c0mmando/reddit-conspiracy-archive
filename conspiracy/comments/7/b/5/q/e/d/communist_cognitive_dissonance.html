    <div class="md"><p>Ok, if I have the same version in front of me that you do, the 13th paragraph deals with the relationship between debtor and creditor as an extension of the buyer and seller. Then, Marx explains how the debtor/creditor relationship is not necessarily linked to the exchange of commodities, because in Roman and feudal times it can be tied to labor and/or land. </p>

<p>So in your third point, you wrote that “(Marxists claim that) not all business is based in exploitation. But according to Marx...”.  Yes, the consensus among most Marxists is that shared ownership of the means of production diminishes the risk of exploitation. Also, note that Marx writes that the debtor/creditor relationship “is far more capable” of crystallization,” and “the same characters can be assumed independently..”  So even though you refuse to present a specific question through your open ended “according to Marx...” statement, Marx, in the section you referred to, expresses the possibility of exploitation through his use of “can” and “capable.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the exact section I was refering to. If there is shared ownership isn&#39;t everyone an owner? They cease to be workers and become owners. It&#39;s kind of a paradox..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine if you and a couple of your friends started a business. You work hard for your company and you all get a share of the profits. Ideally, you each would work as hard as you could to make your business succeed and then you would share in the profits. </p>

<p>The way the majority of companies operate now is that no matter how hard the guy at the bottom works, he doesn’t see an increase of the profits (unless the boss gives him or her a raise/bonus). Rather, the money will go to the CEO, president, and the other higher-ups. But if the worker was able to own a portion of the company through stocks, he or she would receive benefits more correlative to the labor expended. This also helps to answer your first question regarding incentive- when the worker has a stake in the profits, he is more motivated for the company to succeed. </p>

<p>Did this help?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you provide some references? I think you are strawmanning Marx&#39;s positions here. For example, Marx believed that autonomous workers would control the means of production and the state would disappear. He saw the state itself as entwined with the capitalist system. His theories (rightly or wrongly) predicted more worker autonomy than under capitalism and the dissolution of the state - the opposite of totalitarianism.</p>

<p>But I agree. Maybe posting about Odin and the greatness of our anscestreal monarchs would be more productive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine if you and a couple of your friends started a business. You work hard for your company and you all get a share of the profits. Ideally, you each would work as hard as you could to make your business succeed and then you would share in the profits. </p>

<p>The way the majority of companies operate now is that no matter how hard the guy at the bottom works, he doesn’t see an increase of the profits (unless the boss gives him or her a raise/bonus). Rather, the money will go to the CEO, president, and the other higher-ups. But if the worker was able to own a portion of the company through stocks, he or she would receive benefits more correlative to the labor expended. This also helps to answer your first question regarding incentive- when the worker has a stake in the profits, he is more motivated for the company to succeed. </p>

<p>Did this help?</p>
