I seem to remember plenty of people dismissing the WikiLeaks drops last year because they believed WikiLeaks = Russia. </p>

<p>Why does the &quot;who&quot; only matter if it involves WikiLeaks? Why does the public embrace some leaks and reject others? Why do people think this one is more righteous than the DNC/Podesta leaks? Is it just bc it involves rich people and where they&#39;re hiding their money? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>WikiLeaks and more specifically Assange has been LONG EXPOSED as a Zionist collaborator. That is not to say the information disseminated by them is FALSE. Merely well placed. Look no further then the complete and utter lack of intel leaked regarding Israeli Ops / Mossad/ Nyetanyahu etc. And if your rational response for that is &quot;well maybe they just dont have any dirt on them&quot; you need to readjust your perspective</p>
