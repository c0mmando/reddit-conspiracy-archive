       Lies:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         If people make more money, the prices will just go up and everything will be more expensive so it all equals out. No matter what we do, we suffer and pursuing more money is a hopeless cause. (In reality, too much or too little money in the economic pool is bad. America has too little. Pouring a shitload of money into our economy would drastically help everyone. We are probably many trillions below the optimal region. Once that money is poured into the general pool, the entire economy will genuinely skyrocket. There are great mathematicians who can figure these numbers out for us and knowing the cabal, I'm sure they already have.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We need to give tax breaks to the rich so that they can afford to hire more people. (They can afford to hire more people now. They just don't want to.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If you work like a slave, one day you will be rich and have your own slaves. (This only happens to a small percentage of people and slavery is never a good thing.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We just don't know how to make the economy work. (They know exactly how to make a solid economy that would lead to a wealthy planet. They have already done all the research for it but it is not their will to create a wealthy planet. It is their will to create a wealthy oligarchy and a planet full of poor slaves.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We have to go to war because they attacked us. (Most all wars are planned ahead of time. Military is not to protect countries from each other. They are to protect the cabal from the people.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Everyone makes what they deserve. (Half of the world makes $2 a day. All people deserve at least $3000 - $5000 a month after taxes to live in decency. All the people making less than that are only making less than that because they are being robbed by the cabal from under the table where nobody notices the robbery.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Capitalism gave us everything we have. (No. The people gave us everything we have. The people built everything. Capitalism is a system on which it was done by and that system can change as people see fit. Capitalism, Communism, and Socialism are all played out, old fashion systems that keep this planet poor and the 1% rich.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Punishment is an effective tool. (Actually it is a very destructive tool. Education is far superior to punishment. People are led to believe punishment works to justify the tyrannical punishments dished out against the civilian population by the government such as pushing a man in prison for 65 years over 1 crack sale where he can be used as a slave by corporations. Punishment can only work while there is a punishing hand over the victim but once the punishing hand is gone, the behavior resumes. The only way to alter bad behavior is by teaching the culprit how to achieve his goals in a more productive way that doesn't hurt anyone.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Taxes are used to benefit mankind. (Actually, taxes are used to further humanities enslavement. Most of it is poured for this while a small fraction is used to maintain the roads and other infrastructure. A lot of it also goes to people who don't need it such all the payments that pay for the interest rate on the Federal Reserve loans.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Without strict control, chaos would ensue. (This is a lie as well. People are just not used to living in real freedom. Real freedom does require more personal responsibility but people can be taught how to think for themselves very quickly. The easiest way to ensure the masses will be responsible in life is by creating a wealthy environment where people are actually content and not starving. There is no reason to break the rules for self-profit when the system is optimized enough to generate a life of simplicity for all where the path from going from nothing to a life of dignity is clear, straightforward, and quick. For example, people would gladly work a mandatory 5 hour work day, 5 hours a week if it mean living on the standards of about $5000 a month after taxes. 5 hours is much better than 8 hours and its only 5 days a week plus the $5000 a month is plenty to not only have most anything we want (more or less) but also enough to save for a rainy day. A system that pays $2 a day is surely going to lead the masses into committing crimes for profits such as kidnapping rich people to extort them like they do in Mexico.)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       All these lies were hammered into our heads since birth because it helps the cabal's cause.

       Making more money opens opportunities to be more self-directed. Of course this is true. You admit it yourself it happens, but only to a small amount of people. Theres nothing inherently wrong with inequality.

       Couldnt have said it better, however, there are some criminals which
       <em>
        deserve
       </em>
       punishment. Theres often no way to rebilitate, say, child rapists. We can try and try to teach them but eventually if they keep offending they deserve to be punished.

       Good point but I was actually refering to the 99% general population. We can't add the 1% in our model because they are outliers. For example, if we print out 100 trillion dollars and give it to the 1%, it doesn't help the 99% at all so basically I don't even count them.

       My theory is that we are all the owners of this world and that ownership is not real but caretakership is. Caretakership is when we keep something because we are using it but when we are done with it completely, we are supposed to give it away to someone else who needs it. As far as deserved wealth, let's just say everyone deserves a quality life of dignity. No need to have lambos and yachts but a life of dignity is something we can all image in a fair and balanced way.

       actually your both wrong lol The money we use is simply owed debt from last year to the federal reserve.  The only real option is to back our currency with gold or some other agreed upon thing.  We need to cut out the middlemen and regain control.  The debt ceiling can only go up until it bursts which is why we had that bad recession.  Look into how the federal reserve, which has nothing to do with govt, controls us from the inside.
