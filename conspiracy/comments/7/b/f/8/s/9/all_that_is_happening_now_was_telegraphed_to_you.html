       This 7 minute film opens with a goat in a FEMA concentration camp.  Wipe to a demonic puppeteer's hand with a ring with the letter 'S'. (Soros or Saud?)
The puppeteer controls a idiotic George W Bush puppet wearing a dunce cap.  GWB spins his head and transforms into a charming, clever, winking Obama wearing a graduation hat.  We know Obama was chosen by Soros as presidential candidate and we know his education was not self-financed.
       <br/>
       The video cuts to a young Alice (from Alice in Wonderland) holding an apple. There is a white rabbit in the background. Alice is surrounded by 12 half formed human shapes made of clay. Alice drops the apple, apple rolls, splits in two, and the two apple seeds enterwine to produce a lotus.  Alice was supposed to be the next president after Obama.  Alice is also a MKuktra slave, notice the white rabbit?  Remember Q Anon's riddle?  " Alice &amp; Wonderland HRC = Alice.  SA = Wonderland".
       <br/>
       Also keep in mind Alice is a maiden, the apple she is holding at womb level symbolizes a child, apple rolls down from her lap.  Alice the maiden is surrounded by 12 entities. Rember the all the hoopla in September about the celestial occurance involving the maiden giving birth, a crown of 12 stars?
  The seeds from the same apple combining to produce a lotus is a reference to the Antichrist.  He is said to be a product of incest, the lotus symbolizes royalty and enlightenment.
       <br/>
       Wipe to a desolate, lifeless America under Nuclear Winter.  Osama bin Laden wearing a CIA uniform and badge leads an army across an ocean of Oil.
Bombs/missles hit a Saudi palace

       A Coptic Egyptian mother weeps over a dead child dressed in mummy wraps.  Explosions in the background.

       Rember when weapons shipment from North Korea to Egypt were intercepted.  The CIA WaPo told you they were rocket launchers but there are 20 countries not under global sanctions willing to sell Egypt RPGs, why North Korea? Maybe it was something more dangerous?
Next imagery is Russian man holding a hammer and sickle drowning in biological goo.
       <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/off-guardian.org/2017/11/03/why-is-the-us-air-force-collecting-samples-of-russian-dna/amp/">
        https://www.google.com/amp/s/off-guardian.org/2017/11/03/why-is-the-us-air-force-collecting-samples-of-russian-dna/amp/
       </a>
       Rember last week when Russia was freaking out about the USAF collecting Russian DNA and RNA samples?  It was feared US was developing Russian specific biological weapons.
       <br/>
       Next relevant imagery is of the Antichrist passing through the birth canal, he stands in a trance on an Egyptian boat, carried down the river Isis (alternate name for the Thames river) A disgusting old hag locked in a desolate cathedral tower is in a state of anticipation and agitation at the approach of the Antichrist.  This hag is the Catholic Church.  As the Antichrist pass through the gates of the cathedral, the church crumbles and falls.
       <br/>
       Next is the dancing, transforming shaman who represents all the world religions.  At the approach of the Antichrist, the shaman leaps after and transforms into an enlightened state.
       <br/>
       The Antichrist next destroys the global financial institutions and and the broken, empty-headed person (humankind) gets up and follows the Antichrist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The meaning of the goat in the concentration camp is as follows: in Mathew 25: 31-46 it explains that at judgement God will separate sheep from goats.  The Sheep will be taken with him, the goats will remain to suffer.

       As to why... The creator says it just came to him, there is waaaay to much detail to be random.  Either this dude had some crazy prophetic vision or some wealthy luciferian financed and influenced the film.

       The symbolism here shows that humanity prevails and the new world order will lose. Look at the crumbling pyramids at the end, and the fact that love and peace (symbolized by Jesus) prevail.
