       The thing is Metcalfe's Law: the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for the value to be "drained" out of a wallet, either A.) the networks value has to decrease to virtually 0 or, B.) The CIA drains all wallets.
      </p>
      <p>
       If situation A happens, that means everyone stopped mining and transacting all at once. Not very likely, even in the event of a black swan (see Mt.Gox).
      </p>
      <p>
       For situation B to happen, you have to understand a bit of game theory. So, the CIA (or whoever) drains all bitcoins into their own wallet. Bitcoin in now worth nothing because its only useful for the one person, and that in itself makes it useless. So there is no motivation for situation B, only to watch the world burn. I doubt that would happen, IF it were even possible to begin with...

       I can generate a wallet (public receiving address and private key) on an offline computer. I can accept payment to that pubic key and no one without the private key can sign a message or transaction from my wallet without that private key.

       Yes, I can hand you hand generated codes on a piece of paper that store the value of how ever many bitcoins you deposit into the address. Nobody can touch your address unless they can break strong cryptography, which would indicate technologies far far far beyond human admitted capabilities.

       As
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox">
        Mt. Gox
       </a>
       showed us, trusting an exchange with the private key to your wallet containing any significant amount of bitcoin is probably a very bad idea. Mt. Gox was a fly-by-night operation that grew much faster than it's developers could keep up, but there's no reason to believe that GDAX or any other current popular exchange is completely invulnerable. It would be a huge pain in the ass, but it seems to me that if you want to trade on an exchange, it would be nice to use something like multisig so that you still own your coins even if the exchange is hacked.
       <br/>
       IMHO key control is a huge issue for the future of cryptocurrency. Most USD bank accounts are FDIC insured, so if someone hacks the bank and drains your account, you'll still be alright. If someone steals your bitcoin wallets private key and does the same, you're totally fucked. It's easy enough for technical people to protect their bitcoin with a hardware wallet, but that is a huge barrier to entry for your average person.

       Yeah, that's along the lines of a lot of the propaganda that gets spread to discredit what he's saying. Very little attention gets paid to the substance of his message, just "

       Of course I'm giving very little attention to the message.  It's not unique to him at all nor is it all that revolutionary.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have been talking about "bail ins" for many years now.  Others have said all our bank accounts are just numbers on computers, not backed up by even real paper money anymore and therefore they can be emptied out instantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       One could argue his past has marginalized him so much that he has to take ideas thought by others and put them back out there like they're his own. Which is exactly what he's doing here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact he's a legit psycho is just another reason I ignore this guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're just now hearing this message from him and thinking he came up with it, keep researching because it's far from new.

       I've yet to hear McAffee make a single irrational claim.

       He's in cyber security, it's his job to be paranoid. He admits to being paranoid. Which is rational behavior.

       I guess most people don't realize the grativity of the Vault7 leaks and the Intel hardware backdoors. Bitcoin (Cash) is already worth more than 100mm. It's likely going to the trillions and at that point the incentive to execute a hack becomes too great for Mossad and NSA goons.

       The thing is Metcalfe's Law: the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for the value to be "drained" out of a wallet, either A.) the networks value has to decrease to virtually 0 or, B.) The CIA drains all wallets.

       If situation A happens, that means everyone stopped mining and transacting all at once. Not very likely, even in the event of a black swan (see Mt.Gox).
      </p>
      <p>
       For situation B to happen, you have to understand a bit of game theory. So, the CIA (or whoever) drains all bitcoins into their own wallet. Bitcoin in now worth nothing because its only useful for the one person, and that in itself makes it useless. So there is no motivation for situation B, only to watch the world burn. I doubt that would happen, IF it were even possible to begin with...

       I can generate a wallet (public receiving address and private key) on an offline computer. I can accept payment to that pubic key and no one without the private key can sign a message or transaction from my wallet without that private key.

       Lmao, I mean if they can break strong cryptography in linear time en mass, we have more problems that just bitcoin wallets being emptied. Hahaha.
