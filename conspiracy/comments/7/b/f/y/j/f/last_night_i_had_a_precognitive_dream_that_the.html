       Ships everywhere, some looked like the Interdictor Star Destroyer from Star Wars came crashing to the ground. One of them that was about a half mile long came crashing to the ground right near where we were driving but we escaped. Lots of smaller fleet, USAF/USN (SSP) fighting alongside Pleadian, Andromedian and other star nations vs Reptilian/Pre Adamite/Archon/Cabal Alliance. 
The cabal turned out to be millions of years technologically behind these more advanced benevolent races. Some of the more advanced ships are biological.

       Sounds like your brain is inventing a story based off of the media you consume in your waking hours.  You don't know if its precognition, just that you had the dream.  I would wager a bet that recently you've been consuming a lot of media that is saying the same thing you had that dream about.

       I can get on board with that. However, how do you explain having recurring hostile takeover (by our government) and post apocalyptic world dreams since you were a wee tot of say, 4 years old. Dreams that include nothing that the child really knows about, including tech that apparently doesn't exist in this world. Asking for a friend.

       The word "precognitive" doesn't belong in your title.  Neither does the last sentence.

       And "something big" has always been "about to happen", every day, since forever.

       Nope, because my subconscious mind was processing my day, not yours. Maybe it's time to take a break from the global disaster firehose.

       Precognitive dreams exist, and this lines up with the events.

       We have satanic cabal of pedophiles and their dark alien archonic overloads, who've controlled media, science, and your mind for some part of your life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Monsanto, WHO, FDA, what have you. But this game is obviously up. This dream is a visionary example of the mosaics the mind creates to represent the true story happening now. Aliens are real, multiple different types shared world wide with no foreknowledge of others visions of them. Not to mentioned disappearing for days or hours with no recollection a mile or two or a whole country away.

       Secret space program is legit, we have free energy tech and the dark ones have tried to keep Humanity spiritually subverted because we are truly divine and Powerful. We have the capability to travel the Stars already in the end the need for oil.
