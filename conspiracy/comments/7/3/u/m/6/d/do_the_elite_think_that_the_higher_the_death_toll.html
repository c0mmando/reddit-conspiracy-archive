        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We all know that the left/right paradigm is a fake arena created to keep us fighting correct? Dems vs republicans? It&#39;s all theatre. All the sub groups that are also fighting each other is also theatre..antifa vs nazis? Give me a break...</p>

<p>Continuing, I Just wanted to make that known. This is not a politically motivated sub. Partisan politics have No place here.</p>

<p>You guys can&#39;t honestly believe that this is real? </p>

<p>Let me clarify:</p>

<p>People were shot, yes.</p>

<p>The victims are dead, yes. </p>

<p>However, who is this shooter and was someone aiding him in getting a duffle bag full of machine guns into fucking Mandalay Bay? A false flag doesn&#39;t mean the whole thing is staged. And the elements that are staged, are only known by a tiny fraction of people. The media pushes this and will call for gun control, mark my words. </p>

<p>If they can murder 3,000 people in a staged false flag terror attack on 9/11, you don&#39;t think they&#39;d authorize the murder of 60 people in a shooting at a country concert? </p>

<p>They can&#39;t have a <strong>new world order</strong> with an armed population. So they provoke and stage mass shootings, to coerce a majority of the population into endorsing stricter gun laws and regulations until we&#39;re left with pistols. It&#39;s that simple. It&#39;s crunch time for the elites. We need access to the same automatic firearms the military and police have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not if those in the military realize what their doing and decide that they would rather side with their fellow citizens and Americans rather then side with the financial and business class that would see them be chained attack dogs. Same thing with the police, their imagining power where there shouldn&#39;t be. I&#39;d imagine that what concerns the ruling class is that bringing in mercenaries and foreign military may not be enough if the US armed forces sides with the armed American people, hence rampant gun confiscation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I just don’t believe that the military and police wouldn’t side with the people but honestly you never know what could happen years from now. We have such an ingrained fear of powerful gov. here in America but we are slowly warming to the idea. Every time some massive tragedy happens they jump on the chance to use it to their advantage. I’ve never believed that the government had any thing to do with columbine, sandy hook, and other tragedies but you damn well better believe that they will find a way to use it for their agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, I completely understand when people say if we had less or no guns deaths would go down especially suicides, but I still believe we should just up and hand over all of our guns as if that would ever be possible in the first place. The real fight comes down to staying informed and aware of the sneaky shit our government do and unfortunately people harassing victims like the parents of sandy hook saying they were paid to fake it makes conspiracy theorists look like a bunch of nut jobs and everyone stops taking this shit seriously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because that&#39;s silly and impractical. We aren&#39;t rich enough to even come close to owning that with most gun owners. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t see us getting and enriching uranium with how the government controls it. So the hyperbole gets ridiculous there, as for the explosives part. Tannerite is out there and it basically does the trick, but even though this explosive has been out and easily accessible, there have only been a few accidents and deaths (even one bombing) with that. People aren&#39;t using this stuff irresponsibly, same with guns. </p>

<p>I like guns, I enjoy hunting because sometimes making enough money for frequent grocery store trips is taxing. I have a personal freedom for that one, and I kinda dig it. I enjoy being self sufficient.</p>

<p>What kinda fucking fairy tale world do you wanna be in where only the <a href="http://quotes.lifehack.org/media/quotes/quote-William-S.-Burroughs-after-a-shooting-spree-they-always-want-92707.png">police and military have guns?</a> That terrifies me, and guns are just tools, it&#39;s up to the user to dictate its use and the number of guns in our country and the amount of users actually working in harmony is astounding. It&#39;s basically the equivalent of the Vietnamese motorcycle chains in the cities, it&#39;s chaos but it works because everyone takes a responsible role.</p>

<p>Bad chemicals inside ones brain and bad ideas are to blame for the highest homicide rate. You can&#39;t charge a gun in the court of law or jail a gun manufacturer for creating a product. </p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t say anything about its usefulness tho. Nothing.</p>

<p>The biggest irony is that the one country with this special admenment is the country where you could argue indiviual rights are infringed the most.</p>

<p>Mass surveillance. No drugs allowed, no prostitution allowed Heavy   punishments for minor crimes compared to other countries, mass incarceration. Two party system which be designs eliminates fring views in politics. NSA patriot act.</p>

<p>It appears the 2nd was used to let naive people believe think they could rise up once it is neccessary. Knowing those people naive the &quot;tyrants&quot; just seized power in a different way and nobody noticed.</p>

<p>I would say the 2nd, therefore, is a failure and the usefulness in today&#39;s world appears questionable at best. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the average person, they are completely out of reach. Even large gun dealers might have 3 automatic rifles, and usually they&#39;re for rental only. </p>

<p>It&#39;s crazy to imply that Joe blow is going to go out and get a class 3 permit and then stock up on an arsenal of fully automatic rifles at a price tag of 20k a piece. Not only is the permit expensive, it&#39;s almost unattainable for a regular citizen. You basically have to be a dealer, and on top of that you must consent to your premises being searched at any time, for any reason by the atf. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s a bad thing, but to try and say that getting automatic weapons is as easy as walking down the street is a load of shit.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The former was a bomb made from off-the-shelf items - you can Google how to make the explosive and then buy the components in high street shops. There were no guns involved. In fact, all the terror attacks in the UK have been either with bombs or improvised attacks like running people over because - wait for it - the strict gun laws in the UK make it impossible to obtain guns. The UK does have a problem people making replica guns in to guns that can actually fire BUT in A LOT of cases these guns have ended up injuring the people that are holding them.</p>

<p>The latter was in France which - yes, I agree - is a country in Europe but Europe isn&#39;t a country in its own right. Each country has its own gun laws. That aside, the guns used in the Paris attack and Charlie Hebdo were smuggled in from the Balkan states where guns are everywhere and shooting each other is a fun pastime like it is in the USA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To give it some context - you can definitely buy guns on the dark web. My point is that guns in the UK are already very scarce. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s someone with a warehouse full of illegal guns trying to sell them. In the UK you&#39;d never get a parcel delivery company to legally deliver an illegal gun so the person selling it would have to hand deliver it. By doing that they&#39;d have to reveal they&#39;re in the UK. At which point they&#39;re pretty much signing their own arrest warrant. The simple fact that you can&#39;t but a gun in place like Walmart in the UK makes the whole supply of guns thing very difficult and &quot;you can buy it on the dark web&quot; is something the police in the UK are well aware of. Remember the dark web isn&#39;t some magical place - it&#39;s just another part of the internet that you have to jump through some hoops to get to. Also, while there&#39;s no UK law to compel you to report crime, u/illBoopYaHead has revealed he has material evidence of a crime being committed in a public forum. That&#39;s how it was easy for me to conclude he either doesn&#39;t know anyone with a gun - because if you&#39;re in the UK you wouldn&#39;t say that &quot;out loud&quot; - or isn&#39;t in the UK. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love how whenever Europe is brought up it&#39;s always UK compared to the US, to make the leap of less guns equal less murders.  </p>

<p>Left out of the argument are European countries like Iceland, Czech Republic, and Switzerland.  Where guns are plentiful and murder rates are very low.  In fact, theyre considered to be the safest countries in the world.</p>

<p>And the US is extremely large in comparison to most European countries.  Theres huge differences in gun violence between states. Moreso when comparing big cities to the rural areas.  </p>

<p>Like we could compare states like Vermont and Maine to Iceland and Switzerland and they&#39;re very similar in violent crimes.  </p>

<p>While cities like Chicago are more similar to violent third world cities in South America.  </p>

<p>The problem with the US is NOT the guns.  The problem is the violent gang cultures inside our cities.  That&#39;s where the majority of our murders are happening.  It&#39;s the culture that&#39;s the root of the problem. If they outlaw guns in this country those gangs will still get them like they do their drugs.  Even if by some miracle the gov was able to remove all guns from the country, then the gangs would just find other ways to kill.  Also, home invasions and rapes would go up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I absolutly care about facts. However I don&#39;t see a single fact sourced around any of these comments, just conjecture from all sides, yours and mine included. I&#39;d love to see some facts, I ma even change my opinion based on them. But it will be a hard sell as I don&#39;t believe that the government should be the only ones allowed to have weapons. America is very rural, and there are plenty of places people need guns to defend themselves because the police either can&#39;t or won&#39;t reach them in time to protect them during some kind of violent event.</p>

<ol>
<li>The suspect would be able to get guns up to the room using multiple trips (because OP said it couldn’t be done without multiple people)</li>
<li>The video footage has not been released YET. </li>
<li>I commented on one guys comment who was upset someone had given him an explanation for the differing google time stamps. </li>
</ol>

<p>None of that is mainstream ‘talking points’. </p>

<ol>
<li>OP presented a dumb scenario and I attempted to explain why I thought that was dumb. 
2 OP was freaking out because we haven’t seen the video footage less than 24hrs after the event. I pointed out we haven’t seen it yet. </li>
<li>The google time stamp thing is a well known phenomenon, whether that makes it valid or not is up for debate, but someone trying to explain it shouldn’t been seen as some sort of antagonistic debunking, rather someone trying to give you more info. It’s up to them to debate the validity of the explanation, but someone offering an explanation shouldn’t be seen as an attack. </li>

<p>This is just literal propaganda that I feel like a lot of people on this sub buy into. This divide is what they&#39;re trying to create, not to protect people but to boost sales of guns. People need to wake up. </p>

The entire comics industry and pretty much every form of science fiction on television has been subverted by social justice radicals; and all of those people will add their voices to Hillary&#39;s call for gun control.</p>

<p>They won&#39;t fight you in physical terms, no; but they don&#39;t need to.  All they focus on doing is making sure that their opinions are the only ones anyone reads or hears; and that way, when they want to call you anachronistic terrorists, the rest of the population immediately jump on board.</p>

I think they will justify the limiting of firearms sales (possibly even the type of firearm) by referencing events like yesterday.

    <div class="md"><p>Actually about 10 years ago they tried to reclassify the explosive category of ammunition. It was going to have the same classification as nitro glycerin. A good friend is an ammunition manufacturer. It would have made the retail sale of ammo impossible and the price of a box of 50 rounds of .223 would have gone to about $350-$400 (from roughly $20). So buying firearms wouldn’t be an issue, but firing them would have been extremely expensive.  I never saw it in any news media release and was only aware of it due to his repeated trips to DC to lobby against it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gun sales have been on the decline since Trump won. In the past, gun sales spike after mass shootings, so what happens is people invest in the gun industry after a mass shooting and that&#39;s what causes the spike. Not saying you&#39;re wrong, just adding some info to paint a more clear picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assault vans. Im sure you understand that the state does not wish to actually lessen murders and their only interest is control. In Europe especially, the desirability which attacks bring helps their agenda to implement a totalitarian police state. </p>

<p>There are an infinite number of alternate solutions we could try which may lessen the amount of violent attacks and there is no rule that we cannot try stuff without involving the state. We really need to start working together.</p>

<p>I had an idea about like having cryptographic tokens which you acrue digital signatures with to prove you are trustworthy. That way we know who is trustworthy, and we could organize events getting to know eachother and trust eachother at places like gun ranges.</p>

<p>The problem is that there is still people who judge people for frivolous things like being gay or being black or even using certain mind altering substances. We really need to work towards a culture that judges eachother objectively on only one thing and that is our actions and outward behavior.</p>

<p>If someone is polite and seems like they are responsible then we should trust them. But ofc if someone is literally hallucinating because they are so whacked out then they shouldnt even be trusted to drive a car. But my point is that there are drug addicts that when you meet them you would have no idea they are on anything because their tolerance is so high, and for them taking pills or something is not any more significant than drinking water or eating food.</p>

<p>The reason I mention this is because the state wants to control us and sell people their protection and the only way we can fight this is by subverting their authority and working together. It&#39;s why they push race baiting so much and why they try to divide people. Thats why they try to convince people that Trump supporters are all racists. </p>

<p>If we can learn to trust eachother and cooperate with eachother on a mass scale then we actually stand a chance but otherwise i feel like the worst is going to happen. Soon criminals will learn about 3D printers and then the state will need to monitor every aspect of our lives. There are concealable guns now which are printed from plastic and its only a matter of time before street criminals learn about this. Also 3D printers can be made with a glue gun and legos. </p>

<p>Europe is already lost. But we still have a chance to work together in America. The reason I mentioned Drugs is because the same arguments used against firearm ownership are used against Drugs. There are ways of hedging against drug users spreading their addiction that doesnt involve the state putting people in cages. Just like there are ways to lessen violence which do not involve banning the sales of firearms. </p>

<p>And also its important again that we tolerate eachother except for the things that objectively matter. Things like respect for human life, responsibility, level headedness. Things like what medications someone is on or their sexuality do not directly correlate to irresponsibility. </p>

<p>Also along with tolerance we need to lessen the stigma associated with Mental Health. People are so fucking crazy and they hide their craziness until they finally break. The problem is that when there are penalties for seeking help then people do not get the help they need. I dont want crazy people to have firearms but there needs to at least be a way for someone to clear their name so that they can earn trust even if they had done something stupid or been diagnosed with mental problems. </p>

<p>Too often there are black and white attitudes regarding the judgement of individuals. We cannot afford to make sweeping generalizations. Even if your life is perfect that doesnt mean other people havent dealt with adversity and those people deserve a way to earn society&#39;s trust. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The claimed shooter is the weirdest part about this whole thing.  This guy has zero criminal history, nobody who has anything bad to say about him personally, no history of any kind of political activity.  He even had a pilot&#39;s license, which requires a medical certification, which may have caught some kind of illness or physical rationale for the shooting.</p>

<p>Weirder yet, he was basically self employed as a gambler with a recent $20,000 win and appeared to live a life of more or less leisure, which eliminates the notion that he had some long-suffering employment gripe or work-related revenge motivation.  He wasn&#39;t apparently broke or in a financial crisis, either.</p>

<p>His father was reported as a career criminal and convicted bank robber with psychopathic tendencies.  The only real long shot explanation would be some kind of inherited psychopathic inclination, yet usually psychopaths have a long history of behaviors which indicate psychopathic tendencies (violence, theft, lots of ruined personal relationships).  He was 64, and I don&#39;t think psychopathy or other genetic mental illness is emergent in your 60s.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not impossible he could have developed a non-genetic aging-related mental illness, but at this point nobody who has been interviewed indicated he evidenced any strange behaviors or signs of mental illness.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really hard to see how this guy went from recreational gambling and cruises with his girlfriend to deciding to take an arsenal to a high floor and start shooting people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they will need to show footage of him bringing a lot of luggage in, link all of the guns to him forensically (fingerprints, serial number tracking) AND dig into his life enough to create a timeline and motivation.</p>

<p>Nearly all the mass shooters in recent history were quickly identified as people with emotional problems, relationship woes, political gripes or work/money problems.  So far this guy has completely defied these explanations.  </p>

<p>About the closest he comes to abnormal is being a successful career gambler and not a working stiff, but for the most part it works in his favor because it eliminates work and financial problem explanations. </p>

<p>Charles Whitman turned out to have a brain tumor, so there is always the chance of some organic brain disorder, too. </p>

<p>The accused shooter&#39;s lack of any obvious rationale for this would seem to open the door, at least slightly, that he <em>might</em> have been a victim of a conspiracy but it will take a while for the forensics on his guns and life to come out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post is quite rational. 
The problem with gun control is the citizens that are most likely to participate in an armed confrontation with the government are also the same people who stockpile and bury some of their weapons. Still better than nothing, but too many people have already stopped trusting the government and won&#39;t surrender their guns.</p>

<p>There are many conspiracies that are eventually found to be true, and it&#39;s good to always question and look beneath the surface. But many times, the simplest explanation is the correct one. Just because not everything is as it seems, doesn&#39;t mean that NOTHING is ever as it seems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A, B, and C just mean that people use these events to push for gun control. Obviously politicians will look for any opportunity to use for political gain, and it&#39;s not unreasonable for people to want gun control immediately following people being killed by guns. Media bias and political agendas that follow the events don&#39;t make the events untrue. </p>

<p>You really put stock into witness testimony following an intense situation like that? Seriously? How calm and composed do you think you would be if you&#39;re enjoying a concert and out of nowhere bullets start raining down? Would you honestly trust yourself to make accurate observations about your surroundings? Nobody should. There are always going to be inconsistencies with witness accounts during high pressure situations. I would actually be a lot more suspicious if everyone agreed. THAT would be weird as fuck. </p>

<p>The most logical explanation for people thinking there were multiple shooters is that bullets ricocheting off buildings sound like more bullets being fired. And when you&#39;re being sprayed with bullets from 30+ floors up, it probably feels like you&#39;re being attacked from all angles. Again, intense life or death situation, people are panicking, I&#39;m not sure why you would assume they could accurately pinpoint where the bullets are coming from. </p>

<p>The 2 broken windows is odd, I&#39;ll give you that. I saw the picture here but haven&#39;t heard anything else about it. I&#39;d like to know more information about that, assuming the picture is even real. Did the guy have 2 rooms? Not sure what the reason for that would be otherwise. </p>

<p>You mean like the two highly upvoted posts in this sub right now about how great guns are and how gun control is bad?  There are certainly some pushing the pro-gun narrative right now, and I don&#39;t see any concrete steps towards gun control.</p>

<p>This happens every single mass shooting, no actual gun control is passed, but there&#39;s a whole lot of political grandstanding and fear mongering by the pro-gun lobby.</p>

<p>you can easily get dufflebags of guns into any casino in Vegas.  they don&#39;t check or give two fucks because asking people what&#39;s in their bags lead to decreased sales.  also, there&#39;s a fucking convention center and most likely dufflebags of shit that&#39;s metal goes through there on the reg.  </p>

<p>2nd.  casinos are more guarded by cameras than fort fucking knox.  he was there for a damn week moving in and out.  if there&#39;s a conspiracy they picked the worst place on the planet to carry it out because there will be video 24/7 from super high def cameras to every jackass with a cell phone.  </p>

<p>3rd of they really wanted to get gun laws passed they could more easily get puppets elected to force it....  </p>

<p>4th. I don&#39;t even.... fuck is there a single event you god damn nits think was real?  holy shit.... everyone knew ten minutes after this happened it would take exactly one hour for shit like this to pop up without a shred of evidence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It actually makes a ton of sense. Here, let me quote at length from <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/guru.pdf">this essay:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is what I finally understood: all famous people are there to misdirect you. ALL OF THEM. They
didn&#39;t accidentally get famous. They don&#39;t accidentally get on TV or in movies or in books or on CDs
or on the internet. And they certainly don&#39;t earn their way into these positions, as is now clear. So how
did they get there? Why do you have to see them and hear them all the time? Why do you know who
they are? Because they were placed there. They were chosen to fill that position, and they were chosen
in order to misdirect you from the truth. </p>

<p>You will say, “C&#39;mon, that can&#39;t be true. All of them? I mean, they disagree with eachother.
How can they all be placed there?”</p>

<p>Look at it this way: say you wanted to control everyone in the world. Well, people are at different
levels. They have different interests and beliefs and levels of intelligence. So if you want to control
everyone, you have to place your guys at all these levels, on all possible paths.</p>

<p>If you are a football coach setting up a defense on the field, you don&#39;t put all your tacklers in the middle
of the field, or all on one side. You spread them out. You want to block all possible paths to the goal.
You have to defend against the run and the pass, the short ball and the long ball. </p>

<p>It is the same with government. If you want to govern people, you have to keep them on the path you
have chosen for them. That is how the governors understand government. You may think government
is about keeping people employed and building highways and educating children, but it isn&#39;t. It is
about “governing” them. Moving them around at will. Think of a governess. She keeps the kids out
of trouble and molds them into the sort of adults her employer or her society requires. Same thing with
the governors. They keep you from troubling them and mold you into someone who can make them
richer. That is what our society requires, and very little else. </p>

<p>[You]  will tell me that one side or
the other must be right. Given a certain question, they can&#39;t all be wrong, can they? </p>

<p>Well, if they are all paid to be wrong, they can. This is easiest to see from the so-called debates we
watch on TV. Whether it is political debates between candidates or manufactured debates on news
programs, we always see the question divided two ways, and the people on both sides speaking
nonsense. The truth is always avoided by both sides, as if it is a virus. Let&#39;s take a topic, say, gun
control. This is probably the hottest topic of the past two years. My knee-jerk reaction is to be against
gun control, if only because the governors are for it. If the government is trying this hard to sell me
something, I know it is not worth buying. The government has proven over and over it can&#39;t be trusted,
so I do the logical thing and refuse to trust it. But that doesn&#39;t mean I have gone out and bought a gun.
I am not a hunter so I have no use for a gun. I don&#39;t really think a gun is going to even my chances
against the government. But this is exactly what the pro-gun side seems to be arguing. And it seems to
be what the audience is hearing, since the audience is going out and buying guns like they are about to
be discontinued.</p>

<p>Here is what you never hear in the gun control debate from either side. This is what I would say to the
government when it sent in some stuffed shirt to promote gun control:</p>

<p>Look, I have no need for guns. Most of my neighbors have no need for guns, unless they are hunters. If you
want us to quit buying guns and ammunition in such outrageous numbers, why don&#39;t you quit scaring the shit out
of us with all these faked murders like Sandy Hook and the Boston Marathon? Why don&#39;t you quit arming the
police with tanks and machine guns? Why don&#39;t you quit using the army and National Guard to run suspicionless
checkpoints? Why don&#39;t you quit running drills in schools and small towns, with black helicopters and live
ammunition? Why don&#39;t you quit tasering people to death for minor infractions? Why don&#39;t you quit building
private jails to house people who have done next to nothing? Why don&#39;t you quit turning the DHS into a Gestapo?
Maybe if you guys quit acting like Nazis, we would quit buying so many guns. Has that ever occurred to you? But you never hear that. You often hear some variation of the argument that the Constitution gives
people the right to have arsenals of AR-15&#39;s, to protect themselves from the government. That isn&#39;t any
more sensible than the government line. </p>

<p>If we are going to debate the topic (rather than just allow that
what is, is what must be), we might want to make some rational suggestions, such as that it isn&#39;t
necessary for the government to be at war with its own people. We got along fine as a country for 225
years without a Department of Homeland Security, and it wouldn&#39;t be that hard to turn back the clock
just 14 years, to before 2001. None of this is necessary, neither the arming of the citizenry nor the
militarizing of the police force. If we got rid of a few bad people at the top, it would all end tomorrow.</p>

<p>As it goes with that topic, it goes with most others. Neither side is ever telling you the truth, because
they are both trying to make a buck off of you. The gun control people are trying to get more taxes for
“Homeland Security,” while the gun advocates are hoping to sell you a gun. Just imagine the total
market for domestic arms sales in the past five years. It boggles the mind. Which means the
government is probably playing both sides, as usual. I would be willing to bet that most of the money
spent on guns in the US since Obama took office has gone into the pockets of the same billionaires who
are profiting from Homeland Security. It is doubtful that most folks have ever thought of that. </p>

<p>Those who haven&#39;t should study the recent history of Smith&amp;Wesson. Did you know that
Smith&amp;Wesson was bought out in a hostile takeover in 2001, and that the government was involved?
Remember, 2001 was also year one of DHS. Coincidence? Did you know that the $200 million
company was bought for $15 million, and that this rock-bottom price was due to fire-arm regulation by
President Clinton? Did you know that after an initial plunge due to the Clinton regulation, their sales
have since skyrocketed? </p>

<p>Just a coincidence, right? Did you know that the buyer of Smith&amp;Wesson was a start-up company
named Saf-T-Hammer? We are told it was a maker of gun locks, but it wasn&#39;t. It was a start-up
company with no history of making anything. “Saf-T-Hammer never manufactured that lock
independently before buying out S&amp;W, and does not now manufacture it separately from the guns.”</p>

<p>This brings up the question of who does own Saf-T-Hammer. Well the company changed names to
Smith and Wesson Holding Group, which now has 83% Institutional Ownership. What does that
mean? It means the company is owned by institutions, mainly investment firms and banks. The two
biggest owners are the Vanguard Group and Fidelity Investments, but other owners include the Royal
Bank of Canada, ING, and Barclays. So my suspicion is proved true once again. The billionaire
investors are making money off you both ways: they tax you for Homeland Security, which scares you
into buying guns, and the money you spend on guns also goes to them.</p>

<p>This list of institutional investors of Smith&amp;Wesson rings a bell, since the top two appear on Project
Censored&#39;s 2013 list of the world&#39;s top investment firms:
 1 BlackRock US $3.560 trillion
 2 UBS Switzerland $2.280 trillion
 3 Allianz Germany $2.213 trillion
 4 Vanguard Group US $2.080 trillion
 5 State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) US $1.908
 6 PIMCO (Pacific Investment Management Company) US $1.820 trillion
 7 Fidelity Investments US $1.576 trillion
 8 AXA Group France $1.393 trillion
 9 JPMorgan Asset Management US $1.347 trillion
 10 Credit Suisse Switzerland $1.279 trillion
 11 BNY Mellon Asset Management US $1.299 trillion
 12 HSBC UK $1.230 trillion
 13 Deutsche Bank Germany $1.227 trillion</p>

<p>The number is managed funds. Notice that Vanguard and Fidelity are high on the list. Blackrock
bought out Barclays Investments in 2009, but Barclays still has company assets of over 2 trillion. Note,
that is company assets for Barclays, not managed funds.</p>

<p>Beyond that, all of these companies have been caught up in illegal activities in the past decade,
including the gigantic LIBOR and ISDAfix scandals, in which these people were caught fixing the
prices of just about everything. Many of them have been fined hundreds of millions of dollars, but they
still refuse to obey the laws. Most of them have been caught laundering huge amounts of money, but
again, they have just been slapped on the wrist and gone on as before. Vanguard was prosecuted by the
government under the RICO Act for illegally investing clients&#39; monies in offshore gambling sites.
They bought off the court.</p>

<p>You might also be interested to know that Vanguard and Blackrock are invested in Sturm, Ruger &amp;Co.,
a competitor of Smith&amp;Wesson. No matter what brand of gun you buy, they are raking in the money.
The gurus are screwing you from both ends. The people they are hiring to debate gun control in the
media on both sides are working for the banks. The escalation benefits them from all directions. </p>
