<p>I would think that the LV Casinos wouldn&#39;t want bad PR on how they let this slip (look at stock prices sinking today).  &quot;Oh, you can catch ole&#39; Rainman counting cards, but you didn&#39;t see a possible disgruntle gambler bringing a bunch of guns to his room?&quot;  How much did/does Trump have invested in casinos?</p>

<p>Odd part is we don&#39;t have the check in and milling about the grounds footage. Every instant he wasn&#39;t in his room he was on camera. All we have is an photo of an old drunk guy at a bar with his eyes closed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Being pedantic here but class 3 Is the dealers license.  It&#39;s a title 2 weapon, which requires a tax stamp from the ATF. You are correct about the fbi background check but you don&#39;t need a spotless record to pass it. If you can legally purchase a firearm from a licensed dealer, you can legally purchase/build a title 2 weapon. It just takes such an unbelievable amount of time for the few paper processors to process the stacks of applications that it seems like it&#39;s the background check is so thorough and takes so long. In reality the background check is the same one your local lincensed gun dealer calls in when you purchase a gun. </p>

<p>Las Vegas hosts a lot of trade shows.  I would imagine people are bringing in boxes and cases all the time, especially if you disguise them by putting them in something like a golf club case or a big outer cardboard box with &quot;samples&quot; on them.</p>
