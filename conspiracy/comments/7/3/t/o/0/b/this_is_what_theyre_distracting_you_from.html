       The shooting is either

       A) a product of the degradation of society 
B) real, with Paddick being another victim, or

       Absolutley.

       I'm just saying if it's "real" as in not controlled, then they still get to use it as part of the gun control narrative.

       Murders happen a lot in America.

      <p>
       I wonder how many less murders there would be if we weren't saturated with EMF waves and pharmaceuticals..

       That's how it connects, in my mind.

       Things like 9/11 are obviously manufactured, but things like this totally could have just organically happened.

       2nd amendment set Americans apart as free people.
      </p>
      <p>
       After witnessing and loving under oppression from the British crown, the authors of the constitution wrote the 2nd amendment with intent to maintain a “well armed militia,” capable of standing up to and removing a government that proves oppressive to its people.

       I'm not an anti-2nd-amendment person, but this is laughable. Our gun rights haven't prevented is from having this highest incarceration rate of any society probably of all time, including Soviet Russia during the gulag system. And we are "set apart as free people"?

       buddy you might wanna revise your argument there a bit.  I'm as pro gun as they come, but they do not allow us to be "free" they allow us independence from third party protection services.  the second amendment allows us to protect both ourselves and one another.  But it doesn't do shit to protect us from government rackets.    If they allowed us freedom, we wouldn't be paying taxes...  And like the other guy said, we wouldn't have so many people in prison.

       Yeah because all those tanks and planes have made easy work of Afghanistan and Iraq. At the end of the day, an army needs to occupy territory, and an armed populace makes that impossible.

       Beyond ignorant comment.  You're talking about the country that created modern guerrilla warfare with a standing army and LEOs comprised of citizen volunteers who have sworn Oaths to the Constitution.  A huge amount of them would mutiny on the spot if asked to fire on American civilians, a door-to-door confiscation of weaponry would involve tremendous amount of deadly risk on their behalf, and we outnumber them 300 - 1.  Just look at Vietnam, Iraq or Afghanistan for perfect examples of how civilians can beat the most powerful military force on the planet if you don't believe me.

       Because that's the only real way to protect yourself. It's basic really. Look at our neighbors down south. Citizens can't protect themselves against the government or the cartels. You think a hitmen is not going to think twice about shooting you if he at least thinks you're armed? It's not an obsession it's just the best way to protect what matters to you.

       How many mass shootings have happened in the US and how many in countries where guns are illegal? That's the whole point of the American mentality. FEAR. Y'all THRIVE on fear. Fear of race, fear of oppression, fear of privilege, fear of genders, fear of phobias, fear of going outside, fear of 'expressing yourselves', fear of viruses, fear of this, fear of your fellow citizen, fear of your neighbor. Y'all LIVE in fear. By arming people who are constantly AFRAID, you are literally giving them the legal opportunity to shoot each other. But what do I know? I just live in a peaceful island where guns are illegal.

       You're so proud that your government tells you that you cannot own a gun! LOL

       I'm not afraid of anything. I'm prepared. If someone breaks into your home, you will be helpless. I, on the other hand, will have my fate in my hands. Plus, going to the range and shooting my guns is a lot of fun. I thank God that my government isn't so tyranical that they have taken our guns, and I will never give them up! I feel sorry for you, honestly.

       EXACTLY. I mean, one could cross the road and be hit by a car. One could fall from ONE step and hit their heads and die. Does that mean I got to stop walking? If I live my life in FEAR or WHAT IF, then I loose the whole point of life. Which is to LIVE. You say you live FREE because you own a gun, I say I live free because I DON'T OWN a gun and don't want to, ever. Instead of working together to find a solution to BETTER your communities, so you don't have to be afraid of someone getting into your home and raping you, or steal from you e.t.c, we arm people 'just in case'. But by arming everyone who wants to be armed, we don't know to WHOM those guns go. People are loosing their shit lately. The mentality of the average human has changed drastically. We blindly follow science, religion, politics, governments e.t.c without using our OWN critical thinking. We let other people's opinions and narratives define us and our truths without questioning the motive behind an action. If you can peacefully create a COMMUNITY where people care about each other, help each other and love each other, and try to limit the amount of corruption that goes on, then you won't be AFRAID and trust me, you'll find yourself being happy without trying to find happiness. And by saying this, don't think there isn't corruption in my country or our governments. But we still haven't caught up with this American mentality that's being pushed worldwide, and so far, WE ARE FREE. And I say that and I truly MEAN it. We focus on morals on what unites us instead of what divides it. And this way, we don't have to worry about everything and we just live in the moment, our of fear. I'm sad to see how many people are so passionate about this pro stance on gun control. We want to exterminate war, yet we arm everyone who feels like it, with a gun. THATS SICK. And it's no wonder America has such a history with violence, corruption, war, death e.t.c. It's y'alls mentality and y'all stay believing you are the greatest country on Earth. Let me tell you something, when I was younger I was OBSESSED with America. I legit wanted to move there permanently. Not anymore. Growing up and learning about stuff and threw the internet, seeing what the American mentality has become and how most people think, It's making me appreciate the simplicity and greatness of my own little island.

       Those rights that all us second amendment and bill of rights guys tout as keeping us free are actually being used to keep us complacent.  Its an illusion.  If we didn't feel like we had the illusion of freedom then we might actually do something about it.  But so long as us Americans always "feel" protected by these illusory rights which do nothing to prevent deep state government subversion, then we can all go happily by in our lives, never worrying that our actual rights are being eroded day in and day out.

       Let's start with freedom of speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       You mentioned the 'deep state', so I assume you believe it exists, no?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you know? Where did you hear of such things? Did the deep state tell you via the MSM, or what?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think the deep state actors want you, all of us, to know what they are up to, or would they prefer you, we, were oblivious?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems obvious that 'they' would choose the latter, and that is why they have worked for generations to control the press and media, and they were able to limit and regulate the distribution of information and ideas for most of modern history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet changed all that, and presented unique challenges that they had not previously faced. Thus they have been working tirelessly to regain control of the dissemination of information worldwide, either through legislation, or by consolidating and constricting the traffic to private web entities that they control, and can censor at will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously they see free communication as a threat, but if the people cannot communicate, they cannot organize and mount any effective resistance, can they?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the people could resist, how might they resist?

       A tool's purpose is up to the user, the individual who wields it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any tool can be used for harmful purposes if the individual intends to use it that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       That same tool can be of great use and benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ONLY time you get to say what a tools purpose is when you yourself are using it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't speak for a tools purpose in the hands of others.

       EXACTLY. All those tools have multiple ways to be used, one which happens to be a 1/100000 that could cause death. A gun's ONLY purpose is to hurt and kill.

       It's looking like the guns used in this massacre were illegal, so gun control wouldn't have done much bud.

       If y u don't understand the "obsession" with guns that's probably because you should study more history. US isn't the only country where guns have been lawful nor is the only country that has tried to take the guns away from the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What most people like you don't understand, is what happens once the guns are out of the hands of the people.. hitler did it and many more tirants and dictators over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing to realize is that most guns used in these types of crimes are not obtained legally. The other thing to pay attention to is the militarization of police... when the police has tanks and think they are above the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately we only have 3 options and only 2 of these options are actually realistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) take all guns away from criminals (who usually own black market guns and rifles) take it away from the police and military and take it away from the people. So make all guns and ammunition on earth disappear.
IMPOSSIBLE.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) take guns from people who own them lawfully, and don't allow new guns to be sold. How do you take guns away from the criminals, how do you police them from acquiring more since they don't get them through legal ways anyway.
So all you do here is leave guns in the hands of the police and criminals, while law abiding citizens are stripped of their constitutional right.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) is to leave it legal for law abiding citizens. Do background checks for applicants (which is already required) reduce round capacity (which is already law in most states)
      </p>
      <p>
       Guns haven't stopped people from stabbing others, blowing them up, acid attacks, truck and other vehicle attacks, rocks, bats, etc.. you get the point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those at the top, like Hillary Clinton (who didn't even wait for the blood on the pavement to dry) to twist and turn this to suit her political agenda, people like her have dozens of armed security to protect them while screaming that others should hand their guns in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banning guns only suits those at the top, those protected by security with guns, those with gated mansions, those same people putting tanks into the hands of our police.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck that!
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to think like you, because when I was 15 my teacher said the same thing.. and at the time knowing much less about history and how it keeps repeating because people like you think it would never repeat again. Back when I was 15 it made sense because I thought everyone wanted a peaceful like like I did.. sadly the more I learned about history, the more I learned about how the guns end up on the black market, the more I grew up, the more I realized guns are not something we should put aside.

       still have some rights, whereever you are. As soon as the guns are gone (the 80 million de facto SOLDIERS here in America) they'll attack the population of the planet directly.

       The shooting will likely get people begging for more mass surveillance though. It's all part of the big brother part so it's not really a distraction.

       How many mass shootings have happened in the US and how many in countries where guns are illegal? That's the whole point of the American mentality. FEAR. Y'all THRIVE on fear. Fear of race, fear of oppression, fear of privilege, fear of genders, fear of phobias, fear of going outside, fear of 'expressing yourselves', fear of viruses, fear of this, fear of your fellow citizen, fear of your neighbor. Y'all LIVE in fear. By arming people who are constantly AFRAID, you are literally giving them the legal opportunity to shoot each other. But what do I know? I just live in a peaceful island where guns are illegal.
