    <div class="md"><p>Do you also hate stern then? Because Stern makes just as many dirty jokes and you don&#39;t know if Trump was being serious. How do you know that he was specifically staring at the 15 year olds and not the 19 year olds? </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that Trump isn&#39;t a sleazeball but I just don&#39;t feel that the evidence is overwhelming that he should be locked up in prison. Sleazeballs are still capable of passing laws which benefit you, and Trump just cut taxes so I cannot fully hate him.</p>

<p>But hey look, I unfortunately worked for a serial sexual harasser and I hate them as much as anyone else and Trump very well <em>could</em> be exactly that type of guy but then at the same time a few crass jokes really does not prove that. And like I said, even someone who i hate personally can still serve a purpose and the person I worked for paid me the money i needed at the time. But still I hated him and beat myself up everyday honestly for not finding a way to sue him or something, then again the girls he harassed willingly showed up for work and subjected themselves to that repeatedly and people really need to know how to adovocate for themselves.</p>

<p>Imagine if someone took every single joke you have ever said and published them out of context. Imagine the things they could paint you as. </p>

He looked directly at the sun for the solar eclipse, implying he comes from a planet close to its Sun and their eyes adapted. Due to this adaptation, they don&#39;t see red like us humans. Thus their skin weave looks orangish and off to us while the aliens see no difference.</p>

<p>This leads me to believe Trump is a horny alien with a human fetish rather than an incest pedophile.</p>

Do you understand that Epstein had Clinton fly on his plane over 20 times? Do you understand that Trump was outspoken against Epstein even though there was a lawsuit against him which tried to sour his name?</p>

<p>You are not being reasonable whatsoever. I admit that I cannot for sure say that Trump is not sleazy but there is evidence which supports that he is not an actual rapist or pedophile. However there <em>is</em> plenty of circumstantial evidence which implicates members of the globalist neoliberal establihsment as pedophiles?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. It&#39;s also funny how strong people&#39;s bias is who support the neoliberal establishment. They wont even concede the tiniest point when it comes to Trump and will go full on Kieth Oberman every chance they get.</p>

<p>It&#39;s crazy to how neoliberals are sooo fast to accept any allegation of rape yet Stephen Colbert literally goes on TV mocking child sex trafficking. Literally now neoliberals are conditioned to not take child sex traficking, ritual satanic abuse, and pedophilia seriously even when mountains of circumstantial evidence is presented. They will not even listen if you bring up the thousands of children rescued since Trump was elected and wont even concede that is a positive of his presidency, sick! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you.  People are conditioned to believe what the media says, but those days are over.  I want to know the truth, so I take what the media says and look in the other direction.  That is where the truth is at.  Another problem is that people are not used to doing their own research to figure things out for themselves.  </p>

<p>What convinced me regarding ritual satanic abuse is the interviews with children that were done years ago.  It struck me as odd that such young children, from different continents, can tell substantially the same batshit insane stories.  It is not like a child in Australia colluded with a child in the US or UK to get their stories straight.  </p>

<p>What is really going on is that we have groups of Satanists/Luciferians/Illuminati in different countries performing the same rituals.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you fucking serious? Of course it&#39;s disgusting to specifically seek out girls that are developed but under 18 yet. But it&#39;s also disingenuous to not admit that there are girls who are not of legal age yet they are <em>technically</em> attractive. And jokes about this issue point out the irony. </p>

<p>Again. Not saying that people who are <em>into</em> looking at or interacting with pubescent minors are not creepy but you&#39;re literally judging someone based on a fucking joke they said on Howard Stern. Do you also think that Stern is a horrible person because he makes jokes like that? </p>

<p>This holier than thou attitude and gotcha seeking is so toxic and poisonous to actually trying to prevent real creeps and pedos because it discredits actual sexual abuse. There are actual people who are torturing minors yet when people like you turn it into SJWism that turns people off to the subject as a whole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course people who seek out minors for sexual purposes are creeps, but if you only saw certain 15 year old&#39;s bodies you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell them from 18 year olds. Subconscious sexual attraction isn&#39;t rational or discriminatory towards anything else but sexual signals. </p>

<p>But that wasn&#39;t even what I am talking about. I&#39;m saying that Trump was probably joking so you are little advocating for a witchhunt</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNfyO80iLv0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNfyO80iLv0</a></p>

<p>That is a video of Uma Thurman on Stern. She jokes around about sleeping with him and having a crush on him. Do you really think she was being entirely serious during that show? People are expected to play along with Stern&#39;s creepy character and act like a silly goose. Therefore you don&#39;t know for sure that Trump wasn&#39;t joking.</p>

<p>Do you really wanna live in a world where people can&#39;t joke around anymore? What kind of monster could someone present you as if they had all your conversations recorded and presented something out of context?</p>
