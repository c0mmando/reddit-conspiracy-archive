       I think we should discuss proven conspiracies:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/70qvx7/updated_list_of_proven_conspiracies_and_hidden/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the cornerstone of the conspiracy community. You take all of the things we know are true, and then extrapolate from there. The problem is that most people haven't been exposed to this information, including a lot of conspiracy theorists. That is why I think a lot of people are able to be misdirected and distracted so easily with nonsense theories that go nowhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could also talk about this study on proven conspiracies and how many years a conspiracy can be kept secret, depending on the amount of people involved:

       Since this comment seems to be winning at the moment, it might help if you're more specific.
      </p>
      <p>
       The list of confirmed conspiracies is already discussed here frequently...I'm concerned that such a broad and open-ended topic won't be appropriate for a round table, which is meant to focus our energy on a couple specific topics.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You take all of the things we know are true, and then extrapolate from there.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, this is a tall order, and would require much more than a round table that gets stickied for a few days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any chance you can suggest one or two topics to focus on other than the vague notion of "proven conspiracies"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great idea (hence why we have a list of proven conspiracies), but I do believe it's in our best interest to focus on a few at a time, instead of trying to tackle everything at once, which can be a turn off for neophyte conspiracists.

       It seems that the most popular topic there is medical conspiracies. Human experimentation without consent, industry or government-influenced science, and bribed doctors who prescribe unnecessary medications to children. That should be quite an eye opener for people to see that this is going on and has been going on for over 50 years.

          From 1963 to 1966, Saul Krugman of New York University promised the parents of mentally disabled children that their children would be enrolled into Willowbrook in exchange for signing a consent form for procedures that he claimed were "vaccinations." In reality, the procedures involved deliberately infecting children with viral hepatitis by feeding them an extract made from the feces of patients infected with the disease

          Immediately after World War II, researchers at Vanderbilt University gave 829 pregnant mothers in Tennessee what they were told were "vitamin drinks" that would improve the health of their babies. The mixtures contained radioactive iron and the researchers were determining how fast the radioisotope crossed into the placenta. At least three children are known to have died from the experiments, from cancers and leukemia

          More than 30 years after Boyce and Almeida were released [from the "Fernald School of the feeble minded"], they found out that the school had allowed them to be used as human guinea pigs. In 1994 Senate hearings, it came out that scientists from MIT had been giving radioactive oatmeal to the boys - men now - in a nutrition study for Quaker Oats. All they knew is that they'd been asked to join a science club. Among those who attended the hearing was Almeida, also a member of the club. He says the boys were recruited with special treats: "We were getting special treatment, you know, extra dessert, we got to eat away from the other boys. We were getting extra oatmeal. We're getting extra milk." "But they forgot to mention the milk was radioactive," says David White-Lief, an attorney who worked on the state task force investigating the science club.

         Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines.
         <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/">
          All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic.

       There are a few options here. For instance, fraudulent scientific practices, unethical behavior by doctors and pharmaceutical corporations, etc. The topic of "MKULTRA" is only one tiny slice in the pie. Unfortunately, it seems that MKULTRA is the only thing many people know about human experimentation. An overview could be a lot more informative. We could easily ignore the topic of MKULTRA altogether and still have a massive discussion on human experimentation.

       We should self t a few topics for proven conspiracies like environmental contaminations and habitat destruction with an emphasis on regional development and industry. But we would need to generate a few lists of topics to hit of importance and decide which are the most damaging throughout history and currently.

       The focus being using the round table as a toolbar building effort along with community direction on civility. The outside influences when we conduct ourselves in public will always have a noise to signal ratio.
      </p>
      <p>
       Documentation should be more of a focus, and I guess i'll lurk more and take part in these, but we've lost a lot of community members due to reddits noise to signal ratio being for optics on topics. This is unavoidable, but disheartening.

       The round table is however already accomplishing these ends through our public discourse and cloud documentation. We just need to go through the best of each round table and update the list of proven conspiracies with the shiny things they provide.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a lurker, i'm already doing that. You've also gathered your own stats over the years. Really, we just need to present the round table as a staple of the community and use it to build. The optics of the place along with reddits ever present noise to signal ratio will always be problematic, but that's unavoidable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally wouldn't mind helping with the round table in the way of documenting them since i'm already doing that. All we really need to do is figure out a list of topics and keep building that to select from so we can increase the quality of our efforts. Organize a bit more.

       If we wish to speak about proven conspiracies, I highly recommend the first documented civilization on earth, the Sumerians.  They invented the wheel, mathematics, masonry, the calendar, government, and much much more;  despite all these discoveries they are left out of almost all history books and credit is given to the Greeks, Babylonians, Egyptians or Romans (when they just inherited the technology).  I could write essays about them, from their worship of the Anunaki, to their kings list (including kings prior to the great flood ruling for over 10,000+ years each).   An interesting coincidence is their location, so far we've found Sumerian artifacts in: Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Syria and Saudi Arabia - all of which have been plagued with chaos and war both currently and historically (possibly more so than any other region in the world).  Is it possible that the turmoil in the middle east is meant to destroy evidence and prevent researchers from uncovering our true roots?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm particularly interested in the theories that the Anunaki are aliens from Saturn/different solar system.  Some believe that they were the ones who created us by combining their DNA with that of homeosapians when they arrived on earth.

       We could also get back on topic. Sumerians, aliens, Saturn, and annunaki have nothing to do with my post. I'm sure someone else will come in here and try talking about flat earth as well. We should discuss the actual conspiracies that I have cited.

       Mostly archaeologists and scholars have pieced the history together. According to
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer">
        wiki
       </a>
       they developed the first writing system around 3300BC, with earliest Sumerian literary texts showing up around 2700BC, though the civilization itself is thought to be founded as early as 6500BC.

       We need to do cloning. I believe this is the keystones conspiracy. Best part is the evidence we can collect on it. (Im not talking clone replacement theory youtube vids)

        Executive Order signed in March of 2009.
       </a>
       This EO was to repeal
       <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2007/06/22/07-3112/expanding-approved-stem-cell-lines-in-ethically-responsible-ways">
        a previous EO by President George W. Bush
       </a>
       banning stem cell research outright.
President Obama does indeed say "and we will insure that our government never opens the door to the use of cloning for human reproduction. It is dangerous, profoundly wrong, and has no place in our society or any society." (He says it
       <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gs39k0IxZ0">
        at about 4 minutes, 30 seconds into this video
       </a>
       .)
It seems that there was a fear of cloning that exploded after Dolly the Sheep was successfully cloned and publicized. I think people heard stem cell cloning back around the time President George W. Bush signed the original order and assumed that cloning stem cells could somehow lead to human clones--which is why President Obama later mentioned it at the signing.
People forget that we've been cloning cells since the 50s when
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa">
        Henrietta Lacks' cells were cloned
       </a>
       . In fact, her cells were the first successfully cloned human cells. You know how they like to be 20-30 years
       <strong>
        ahead
       </strong>
       of modern technology. How is this not yet a confirmed conspiracy?

       I would love to hear more about this, I don't get think it gets talked about enough. I have heard of secret underground cloning facilities as well as possible android-like robotoids that exist. There seems to be a dearth of information on the subject and I think if it was a round table topic we could maybe shed some light on it.

       Out of Body Experience, transcendental meditation, psychedelics, non-physical realities, astral travel, lucid dreaming and other esoteric techniques of this vessel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Authors and videos to watch and discus:
      </p>
      <p>
       Tom Campbell (author of My Big T.O.E. 'Theory of Everything") who uses no psychedelics to achieve out of body states and visits these realms.  In specific, this part of this video shows a crude map of the places he's seen:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/y7-ZYAMFucc?t=3m14s">
        https://youtu.be/y7-ZYAMFucc?t=3m14s
       </a>
       He claims to have visited 20-30 PMR (physical-matter realities outside of "Our System") and a dozen or so NPMR (non-physical-matter realities).  It's all very intriguing and I appreciate how he stays 'psychedelic-free' to further his research and present it to the mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
       He visited the Monroe Institute (famed for coining the term Out of Body) a long time ago, and through transcendental meditation achieves these goals.  He claims he dreams with his son and carries out conversations with all manner of sentience.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many other authors with many other thoughts on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example Graham Hancock and specifically, his book Supernatural.  He discusses how humans throughout history have taken psychedelics (for many purposes) and that other planes  have co-existed along side ours.  He states in the book that there is another (or several) races evolving with ours in their realm.  He claims they were once the elves/fairies, who now have become the greys etc.  Regardless of his conclusions, the book has nice facts about psychedelics, their use, shamanism and other realms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example is Terence McKenna and all he has to offer in regards to other states of mind, and other places of existence.  Realms of indirect lighting, geometric domes, self-transforming machine-elves with no faces who are making objects by singing them into being.
       <a href="https://youtu.be/Eqn5FKISlTw">
        https://youtu.be/Eqn5FKISlTw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another example is Rick Strassman and his book, DMT, The Spirit Molecule:
       <a href="https://www.rickstrassman.com/">
        https://www.rickstrassman.com/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Other topics to discuss within this field are personal experiences through meditation or talks about DMT, psilocybin and other psychedelics.  I could share (they are easily available for anyone to search) an extremely easy tek for making DMT crystals.  A 10 minute trip to dissolve all that you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm suggesting a topic along these lines because it empowers us as individuals.  Focusing on the self and transforming our selves from within is most important in these times.

       This would be a great topic because it could pull in many ideas and theories about this subject.  Many here would like to discuss and share on this topic, without having their thread downvoted etc - I am sure the sticky and round table would be appreciated, interesting, and participated in by a diverse crowd of ideas.

       I think the CIA topic is critically important, as well as the influence of Rome/Vatican/Jesuits. But what really should be done is try to peice the WHOLE picture together. Who takes orders from who, how many primary factions there are, and who the MAIN source(s?) are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically: who are are the biggest enemies of our species, and how are they operating? AND: what can we do about it? Or at the very least, how can we mitigate what is coming as much as possible? Nothing is more important than this.

       I was rude, I want you to see how you were being rude. Implying that anyone wanting a society designed for the prosperity of everyone is ignorant is absurd and insulting. As if we have the choice between ruthless tyrants and incompetent fools. Is that how you really think?

       There will be no such thing. Not that I don't have hope but implying that any sort of change can come from a subreddit it's unlikely. Especially when they control our communication over it. All hail the King in Yellow.

       Just as you have supposed a will of conforming for me you have become the sheep as you see the failure of your voice to be a thread in a brittle garment masking an idividualistic view. Blame is not the game you should approach any unfamiliar mind with ideas of becoming. Focus more so on a stiffle of thought to which the most obvious reasons care not for argument but rather good. You may just be the opposition in this fight. Can you be sure you are on the right way? What proof do you have? Maybe I have no need for recognition. What makes you so entitled to pass judgement.

       Of course, i'm also a sheep but i see what's possible with threads like this, it could inspire a wolf to actually do something. You make it sound like there is nothing that can be done about the NWO. I'm certainly not on the right way and i never claimed to be. I'm only judging your pessimistic mindset.

       The Black Nobility own and run the Vatican, SMOM, Jesuits, KOC, and La Cosa Nostra. The European Monarchies like the British Crown are branches of Rome and they manage secret societies like the Freemasons which infiltrate government agencies and run corporations for the monarchs. The SMOM is the top military council and it works closely with the Orders of St John ran by Protestant monarchs. The Knights of Malta are the engineers of war. The royal and noble bloodlines are all working together as a global crime syndicate and part of the modernized Roman Empire. The Greek royal House of Glucksburg run the Greek fraternities and sororities and use initiates as their agents. The British Crown controls universities like Yale and Harvard and use them for recruiting Crown agents. Jesuits are Roman intelligence and infiltrators and use their universities for recruiting and training Vatican agents. Many Knights of Columbus are police officers, mayors, lawyers, and judges and they protect the Italian Mafia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Italian Mafia are enforcers for Rome involved in extortion, money laundering, murder, and drug trafficking; and they pay their dues back to the Sicilian Mafia which pay dues back to the Black Nobility. Court Jews like the Rothschild, Warburg, Walton, Wallenberg, and Dreyfus families serve the Roman Curia and royal courtrooms like Buckingham Palace and Stockholm Palace. The Holy See is the All Seeing Eye and operates as an intelligence network. The Latin phrase Novus Ordo Seclorum means New Order of the Ages and is on the US dollar bill and US Great Seal. The Vatican uses Latin as an official language and for documents. The Black Nobility and other royal families have been concealing trillions in private banks in Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland. The Swiss Guard protects the Vatican. The Swiss Cantons have been in contract with the Vatican for centuries and Switzerland is basically a papal state. Some top families in the Black Nobility include the Pallavicini, Colonna, Ruspoli, Sforza-Cesarini, Aldobrandini, Odescalchi, Torlonia, Gaetani, and Massimo families.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prince Carlo Massimo and Duke Leopoldo Torlonia are running the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Prince Carlo Massimo is the President of the Italian Association for the Order of Malta and is the one giving the orders. Prince Carlo of Bourbon-Two Sicilies is a top manager of the Society of Jesus. The Jesuits are Roman intelligence and infiltrators serving the Black Nobility authorized by the Farnese family's Pope Paul III. The Bourbon-Two Sicilies family are the continuation of the Farnese family and Farnesivs is engraved on the Jesuit's headquarters called the Gesu Church of Rome. The Colonna family are running the Knights of Columbus and Colombo crime family. Colonna means column like Colombo and Columbus. The Massimo and Gaetani families own and run the Gambino crime family and Philadelphia crime family. The Massimo family also own and run the Casamonica mafia clan or Roman Mafia and the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari which still exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Boncompagni-Ludovisi family run the Casalesi mafia clan which operates in their former dukedoms and also control the Bonanno crime family. The Adragna family of Sicily run many of the N'Drangheta factions along with the Gaetani family and the House of Adragna are part owners of Los Angeles crime family which was built up by the Dragna crime bosses like Jack Dragna. The House of Savoy own and run the Genovese crime family. Don Vito Genovese was from Naples and Prince Vittorio Emanuele IV of Savoy is the Prince of Naples. The Chigi-Albani family run most of the Albanian mafia like the Rudaj Organization. The Corsini, Medici, and Bonaparte families are the owners of the Union Corse or Corsican Mafia. The House of Windsor and German noble families run and finance various Neo-Nazi cults and Nazi propaganda while they also control many of the Jewish banking families. The House of Bourbon and Spanish noble families run most of the Mexican and South American drug cartels.

       Blaming all Jews as a scapegoat serves to divide and conquer. If someone investigates Zionism or the Rothschilds, sometimes they will get caught up in something like white nationalism and stop learning anything real. Or if you talk about your findings, if any Jews are involved you get labeled as a racist. Stay specific.

       Ummmmmm... I don't have any favorite conspiracies... but I guess cattle mutilation has always piqued my interest... cause no one can deny that it is happening... just no one knows
       <em>
        what

       is happening... might be too retro for this crowd though... cattle mutilation went outta style even before crop circles were en vogue.

       I think it's about time we actually discussed Conspiracy Theories. What they are, how they work, and their role in narrative control.
      </p>
      <p>
       People saying things like "Trump/Clinton is politics, not conspiracy. Let's get back to real conspiracy theories like Bigfoot" either don't know what a Conspiracy Theory is or are actively trying to shift the narrative... either way this needs to be talked about.

       I just did a ton of research and found the creation story of Archons and Christos Sofia and our lineage of us - Anthropos. Explains the duality in this reality among some other truths about negative beings and the Satanic bloodlines. Most of it comes from original Gnostic teachings and the explanation of Christ. Found the work to be awakening and about a lot of hard truths in this reality. Also shows how the Matrix is much more of a spiritual movie than marketed. Would love your thoughts.

       tldr first; Vatican City, City of London relationship, et al. (
       <strong>
        <em>
         We must identify the modern, operational enemy more clearly
        </em>
       </strong>
       .)
      </p>
      <p>
       After many years of truth seeking, I am up against a particular wall, which I think needs community input (despite
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       being a shadow of it's former self, oh how I miss the 2010
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       ... but I digress.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue: Following the trail of corruption, blackmail, and worse, I primarily end up in two places. Vatican City, and The City of London. I am having difficulty determining what the relationship is though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Originally, the Vatican was very opposed to the independence of England in the split... but that relationship is much less clear these days. According to Webster Tarpley, it was the Venetian black nobility who were advising Henry the 8th that helped cause the split in the first place, and according to the Larouchians it was the Venetian black nobility who migrated to London... but they were also highly tied to the Vatican as well, so what gives? Are they playing them against each other? Does one serve the other?
       <a href="/u/AhuwahZeus">

       seems to know a lot about the black nobility families, but he seems to be doing stream of conciousness dumps without backing up his sources very well. Dr. John Coleman is very interesting on the subject as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I am not discounting the general idea that most of us are already aware of, what I call the "three sister cities", where DC is the military seat of power, London is the financial seat of power, and the Vatican is the religious seat of power. Following the trails I have, I have mostly determined that all roads in DC end up in London or the Vatican, usually going through New York first (with very relevant exceptions, such as the Knights of Malta being prevelant in the wetworks side of the military/intel agencies), so for the time being I want to trace the modern connections (some looking back in time to give us context is worth it, but I think we should remain focused on modern times.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of room for good discussion on the subject, and plenty of opportunity for weaponized autism to dig a bit. For example, the Larouchians seems to think the English monarchy is very high up in the ranking, but some things indicate to me it is possible the central bankers have essentially siezed functional control through the Bank of England et al. On the other hand, the monarchy also has ties to the darkness in the western european lands as a result of their own residual monarchies (Guelph, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Netherlands, Luxemburg, Belgium (Dutroux anyone?) etc) as well as being one of the largest land holders through the  empire cleverly rebranded as the "
       <em>
        commonwealth
       </em>
       ". There is also some talk about the relationship between them and the Venetian black nobility, such as Dr. Colemans claim that they meet off the shore of Venice to decide the fate of the world every so often.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good scientific start for tracing the modern power structure in my opinion is
       <a href="https://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/1107/1107.5728v2.pdf">
        this paper
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So we know we need to focus on the bankers most likely, which also includes IMF, BIS, and the World Bank, and by extension this also means Switzerland.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, essentially I am backing up the request for the black nobility families, but lets keep it focused on the modern version of them.
