    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve entertained the thought before but I&#39;ve never taken a deep dive into any evidence/proof that Columbine was a false flag (mainly because in my internet travels I haven&#39;t come across that evidence; not to say it doesn&#39;t exist).</p>

<p>I could see the case, but I guess the reason I consider it to be real is that it was the true prototype. TPTB can take one real incident like Columbine, where 2 kids who were over-bullied finally snapped and murdered a bunch of people (perfectly in line with human nature), and create &quot;copycats&quot; of that one event already burned into everyone&#39;s mind. Got any links to share OP?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They weren&#39;t burnouts...</p>

<p>They were acting during all of that burnout weirdo footage and I am beginning to believe they both were doing it intentionally knowing their role in the soon to be hoax.. the suicide picture looks staged, with blood splatter that only would make sense if they were laying ontop of each other before shooting themselves.  If they faked their suicide where could they have gone? Where could they be now? An interesting and important question. Why did the police stand down for hours?</p>

<p>Listen to the 911 call that the librarian made.  The panic seems real, but the dialogue/script seems fake.  She claims she was hit with glass from one of the boys shooting a window out, yet she goes to the phone and calls 911 and yells for the kids to &quot;stay under your desks&quot; instead of booking it out of there...</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it something if people rarely, if ever, go on violent killing sprees of school children...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. For sure.  </p>

<p>If there was a group of people that faked school shootings in the past, it is likely that the same group would continue to terrorize/trick us today.  We wouldn&#39;t be afraid of school shootings if some dumb bitch in 1972 shot some kids bc she &#39;hated mondays&#39;....It wouldn&#39;t be relevant today, so they update their work by faking another.  I propose that several, if not all of these school shootings were done by the same group with the same goal..Scare tax payers into giving up their rights, money, and guns to a corrupt police state.  </p>
