       As I was searching Google, I noticed I never published modern History's most bombastic revelation by Last Prophet from March 20, 2013 ...
       <br/>
       [Note: posted 27 Sep 2017, censored shortly before reaching the 500 views threshold for Truth threads.]

      <h1>
       Illuminati leader REVEALS himself shortly before the BIG BANG
      </h1>
      <h4>
       End Times Paradox: the End of the Age is the prime time for firsts.
      </h4>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Name of current Illuminati LEADER: REVEALED WORLDWIDE first: EVERYBODY KNOWS HIM
       </strong>
       <br/>
       He uses several fake identities, two of them as "British Sir" and one as "American patriot".
       <br/>
       In the only identity where he appears in plain sight he uses his father's middle names because he can't use his real name: Alexander Adolf Hitler, the current Grand Master of the Ordo Illuminatus.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Solve:
       </strong>
       <br/>
       After reading this article, it will be clear what is the official public name everybody knows him as - [ _ _ TRICK] [ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ].
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Illuminati leader REVEALS himself shortly before the BIG BANG
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The ILLUMINATI secret society TOTALLY controls media, politics, "justice" and economy in the IV Reich.
       <br/>
       The imminent BIG BANG: "Obama"'s detonation, collapse of banks, supervised race war, ongoing loss of control of Arab, African and South American neo-colonies.
       <br/>
       The time came for the illuminati to reveal for the first time in their History the name of their current and most probably last leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accordingly to their religion's principles of "hidden in plain sight" and "endless deception", the illuminati leader revealed himself March 20, 2013, shortly before the BIG BANG.
       <br/>
       LAST PROPHET immediately got it. But did any illuminati member get who their current leader is (1)?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Several identities with different nationalities, endless array of roles
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The illuminati leader uses several identities with different nationalities, from entertainment to politics, interpreting an endless array of roles.
       <br/>
       His most important role in politics is "
       <em>
        he would be elected president of the USA WITHOUT having to rig the election using voting machines software, was it NOT for the fact that he plays the LOSER role in politics
       </em>
       ".
       <br/>
       Note that this role is exactly what you you might expect from illuminati's religion principle of "endless deception.
       <br/>
       One of his identities in entertainment was used to set the milestone officially raising homosexuality to nobility.
       <br/>
       The announcement of March 20, 2013 involves this identity and another of his identities in entertainment.
       <br/>
       The announcement has him in two roles: one with himself and the other with a "sex-bomb", matching what the human cattle would imagine about the illuminati's supreme leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       His official first name is [ _ _ TRICK], the identity he used the ONLY time that he played himself or "Number One", in 1995, in a role using ONLY his voice.
      </p>
      <p>
       The illuminati announced today that he will become, within days, the first man ever to [ M _ _ _ _ ] himself.
       <br/>
       And that that is the second role announced today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poster "Tom_Jackson" replies (2):
       <br/>
       <em>
        The name looks like PATRICK.
       </em>
       <br/>
       <em>
        The first man to ever [M _ _ _ _ ] narrows it a bit because, by my count, there are very few five-letter words beginning with M that make grammatical sense. A few are "marry" "merge" "match" "mimic" "model" "morph". Some that make less sense are "march" and "mount".
       </em>
       <br/>
       <em>
        So do we look for a dude named Patrick who marries himself?
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Last Prophet replies:
       <br/>
       Correct. He merges, matches, mimics, models and morphs but he ALSO marries himself, as announced today.
      </p>
      <p>

         Notes
        </em>
       </strong>
       <br/>
       (1) Only members of the highest grades of the illuminati secret society know who their leader is.
       <br/>
       Like any members of a sect, the illuminati members are not corruptible.
       <br/>
       But once again like almost all members of a sect, they are brainwashed into robotical behavior.
       <br/>
       That is why they are ALSO not able to get this message passed by the very highest levels "hidden in plain sight".
       <br/>

        BASICS
       </strong>
       <br/>
       We live in illuminati overtime, the last leg of Illuminati End Times.
       <br/>
       At this stage the illuminati BEAST tells to the beasts that "black is white" and the beasts robotically repeat it.
       <br/>
       Why is "endless deception" one of the goals of the illuminati religion?
       <br/>
       Illuminati begin by telling to the human cattle:
       <br/>
       1. - "Hidden in plain sight" is the truth: "We TOTALLY control media, politics, 'justice' and economy";
       <br/>
       2. - "Black is white" and have the human cattle robotically repeat it.
       <br/>
       The two previous messages can be reduced to "We TOTALLY control your minds".
       <br/>
       This proves the TRUTH of the illuminati religion.

       Alexander Adolf Hitler alias Patrick Stewart's family tree includes these public figures:
       <br/>
       - Adolf Hitler, his great uncle;
- Tim Kaine, one of Illuminati Grand Master's younger brothers, used the name Howard Ronald Stuart-Houston before stepping on stage.
       <br/>
       Kaine's resemblance to Alexander Adolf Hitler is undeniable;
       <br/>
       - first cousins once removed to half-sisters Angela Merkel and Hillary Clinton (daughters of the fuherer of the III Reich).

       You live in a simulated reality, staged by the secret society Ordo Illuminatus (illuminati).
       <br/>
       The illuminati or Ordo Illuminatis first stepped on stage as an identifiable organization in 1190: Ordo Teutonicus, admission requirements included proof of German nobility for at least four generations.
      </p>
      <p>
       In politics and media the simulated reality reaches 100%:
       <br/>
       - all members of all EU "parliaments" or from the US Congress and Senate fulfill orders dictated by Grand Master Alexander Adolf Hitler, grandnephew of the "Fuehrer";
       <br/>
       - media stories are the result of a script, except for local news and (almost all) natural catastrophes.

       Read again, the announcement involves his official public name and another of his identities in entertainment.

       I’m sure Stewart probably has/had a handler, and is more than likely an entertainment MK puppet ... but c’mon ...

        the

       guy is. Or who
       <strong>
        the
       </strong>
       woman is. The Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Soros’, they are all a facade. You will
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       know who the top of the ladder is.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think Patrick Stewart is telling the Aldobrandinis, Orsinis, Somaglias etc etc what to do ... then ... well, then I’m not sure what else to say.

       You need to look into the bloodlines of Cain and Abel. You need to look into Black Nobility and the Sumerians. That’s where the power laid, and where it still lies today.

       It HAD to be revealed shortly before the end, it fulfills an illuminati commandment proving their religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point the Grand Master himself has confirmed in public several times what Last Prophet exposed long ago because of the illuminati commandment to hide the truth in plain sight and still make sure the human cattle don't get it.
