    <div class="md"><p>Artillery bombing of South Korea, primary directed at Seoul due to close proximity and to inflict maximum casualties. The second focus will be on Air Defense. While South Korea has potent defensive missiles, it lacks a consistent power grid to run Radar for defense. I believe keeping power up to defenses will be a major goal.</p>

<p>If it goes Nuclear, the few nukes they have will either try to hit Japan or the US. The low amount of Nukes coupled with low success rate of missiles should only result in 2-3 missiles in a proper trajectory.</p>

<p>The US missile defense interceptors have approximately a 50% chance of success in interception. However, more than one interceptor can be launched and this would not be a problem unlike Russia which could over saturate our interceptors.</p>

<p>Therefore it might be more prudent for North Korea to not launch a Nuclear Missile and keep it in reserve. Major casualties would be absorbed by South Korea with a fierce air retaliation knocking out major North Korean military installations and artillery installations.</p>

<p>The duration of the conflict would be based on how fast the regime could be taken out. Ground combat would be undesirable due to high amount of low level troops. China also stated it would refrain from any conflict started by North Korea, thus it would be alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They would need to fear losing power or worse in my opinion. However, the prior dick measuring contest between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump forced China to encase it&#39;s North Korean policy in words.</p>

<p>China stated it will use the Mutual Defense pact in the simple meaning. China will honor the pact and go to war as an ally if the US attacks or attempts regime change unprovoked. However, it stay out if North Korea strikes first.</p>

<p>This helps to put a solid line of actions North Korea can perform and those it must not cross. Regardless of the outcome of a Sino-American war, the possibility should neuter the US in preemptive striking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Currently, KJU can&#39;t initiate an attack.  If he does, Xi (China) has told KJU that he will not defend NK against the United States.</p>

<p>Since he is insane, he may attack anyway.  He will attack the United States first since the USA has promised to destroy him and he needs to convince Americans of the destruction by nuclear war.  He will have to nuke us.</p>

<p>Since he gets stronger every day, it is imperative to attack him immediately with everything we&#39;ve got.  Lose 10 million South Koreans now, or 50 million SKs, Japanese, American later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NK will not use nuclear weapons. Kim Jong Un,  like all dictators/people in power, is solely interested in retaining power, building on that power and enrich himself and those in the elite. NK&#39;s wish to obtain nuclear weapons has to be seen as a deterrent against a world where NK is practically friendless and as leverage in the food-aid negotiations that take place on a regurlar basis. Not unlike Iran who have no intention to attack Israel, their government and military have no wish to die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Walking on eggshells for sure.  What you put forth makes sense.  </p>

<p>However, they do have &quot;friends&quot; so to speak in their foreign relation affairs all the way from some small African countries to Brazil.  China has stopped trade altogether and so has the US (last export was in 2016: less than $100,000).  </p>

<p>It really does seem like a stale mate though just retaining what power they have from themselves like you said.  Play the part of the madman it seems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And in the current political situation, the &quot;playing madman&quot; goes both ways. Trump&#39;s tweets, his adress to the UN and speeches at different recent rallies has left an impression of a volatile and unpredictable enemy which then leads to NK trying to follow that rethoric. Both Trump and KJU can threaten and intimidate all they want, there are generals and command structures in place that will never allow a war, be it nuclear or conventional, to break out. NK knows it would lose a war, possibly meaning the annihilation of the country, and the US knows it can&#39;t justify the massive civilian casualties a war would mean in South Korea.
  We are, as we have been through many years, looking at what constitutes diplomacy in the Korean conflict. And this goes for the Iran situation too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They will reduce or dismantle their nuclear program in exchange for food supplies and lifting of sanctions. China will, as it always have, press hard for these negotiations as they stand to deal with heavy consequences of a conflict. They have no interest in receiving the many millions of refugees from NK that a war would bring, nor are they interested in US gaining control or some form of control in NK, right up to the chinese border. And the world in general wants to negotiate. Nobody really wants a collapsed NK, with a hunger epidemic and massive a massive refugee problem possibly destabilizing the region. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Kill em all&quot; 24 million people, most of them innocent civilians already living under the most opressing regime in the world? I&#39;d say that was monstrous and morally bankrupt. You seem to believe that he will use nuclear weapons, why would he though. And inb4 &quot;KJU, he crazy&quot;, as I pointed out before. When you have total power over your country, when you are in a position to acquire whichever wealth that country has, why on earth commit suicide by nuclear war? The dumbass, KJU, isn&#39;t 40 yet, treated like a god, lives like a playboy, has what he needs. You need to analyze the situation at bit more imo. There will be no war and in a few years, NK will sign a treaty similar to the Iran deal. That&#39;s the rational thing to do, and luckily the world has an ability to act rationally when things heat up.</p>

 What you propose as a solution to a problem that&#39;s thousand miles from your safe space, doesn&#39;t take the everyday lives of millions of koreans into consideration. It&#39;s just &quot;muh america&quot; not considering  the fact that your mindset is based on hyperbole, fearmongering and a complete lack of understanding for problems that will never bother you or yours. I&#39;m not trying to debase or spite your love of country but you seem to forget that the US defence budget is the same as the following 17 countries on that list. NK is an ant to the US elephant.

    <div class="md"><p>I truly hope that you are correct.  But given that China is NK&#39;s protector, no one is going to attack them.  There would be no point.  KJU knows this so his rapid development of nukes isn&#39;t defensive.  </p>

<p>Since he already is protected, then he must intend these weapons for offense.  He is counting on us not coming to aid SK if he can hold an American city as nuclear hostage.  He is thus planning to conquer SK.</p>

<p>For these reasons then, we have to pre-emptive strike while we still can.  Kill them all, root and branch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a shoddy plan at best. China has grown very tired of NK&#39;s antics the last decade. China has only one goal at this point in time. Secure a steady growth of chinese economy. They can&#39;t make money off NK   at the same level as trading with the US. There will be no war with NK and by proxy China because, since Nixon, the chinese have had a much more pragmatic attitude towards the US/West. Capitalism permeates their brand of communism, and the only reason they reluctantly back the NK regime, is fear of the NK huddled masses in case of collapse and the strategic importance of having NK as bufferzone against US presence in chinese sphere of interest.
 His weapons are leverage against western embargos, a demonstration of NK power aimed at it&#39;s own population and a pacifier for your average despot in a world where he is truly alone. 
 A war would have only one outcome; massive SK/NK civilian deaths, the fiery death of all leadership in NK both military and civilian and ,compared, minimal damage to western intetests. Tell me again how KJU alone could make the decision of suiciding himself and all the elite without any resistance? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He thinks he can win.  If <strong>he gives us a choice</strong>: &quot;Let me conquer South Korea, or I will nuke Honolulu.&quot;,  then we have to let him conquer, or a major American city gets it right in the balls.</p>

<p>He fulfills the dream since 1950: the reunification of the Koreas.   He thinks we will back down.  If Hillary was in there, we would.</p>

<p>As an aside: Can&#39;t you just hear a pantload like Obama, who did nothing, saying: &quot;Hwah, hwah, hwah!  Didn&#39;t happen on MY watch!&quot;  Worthless pantload POS = Obama</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is as far from what is going to happen. Your actual knowledge of the world and how it works seems to be limited. Wasn&#39;t Hillary critisized by the republicans and the Bernie faction for being the candidate who was hawkish in foreign policy and ready to use military force? I&#39;m pretty sure it was. And your Obama agenda is totally irrelevant to our discussion, your attempt to get inside his mindset laughable. I don&#39;t really know where you get your news; but they are fake and leave you clueless in regards to reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean this in all honesty and good will. Don&#39;t let such stories disturb you, there is a bigger picture you miss. And exactly those kind of news stories seemed to circulate before Lybia, Afghanistan, Iraq to name some. Always used an excuse to invade or strike first and later proved to be false. I believe we are being lied to through the government and military intel/info and these stories are being used to, among other things, get a 700 billion dollar defense budget to be passed without resistance (700 billion? Really? Thats just obscene) and building a chronic fear in the population that makes us more inclined to accept war. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>NK has said openly that they intend to attack.  Unless you think that we&#39;re doing mock ups with actors and sets, they say this themselves.</p>

<p>They intend to demonstrate a nuclear device using a missile.  They will then warn that another one will be used against Tokyo or Osaka if we interfere in the &#39;reunification&#39; of the two Koreas.</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve repeatedly said throughout this thread. NK&#39;s nuclear endgame isn&#39;t war but rather negotiations. Seems like Tillerson and Trump are on par with Obama. Got some choice words about those two &quot;Neville Chamberlains&quot;? And can you please point to where you get your news and how these, surely, sourced news know the intentions of NK? Because your narrative sounds like bad YouTube videos shaped it. We can continue this discussion if you want but it&#39;s pointless of you to throw around lies/half-truths/disinfo. Repeating them numbly won&#39;t make them more real.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have seen no official confirmation of a hydrogen bomb ever being tested. Another lie makes the rounds. And this whole situation is still not about NK wanting a war, but assuring a deterrent in case of an attack  and a bargaining chip in future negotiations. If you knew anything about Iran you would know that it was exactly what happened there. Lifting sanctions,  starting trade again, releasing money held back in sanctions. All things obtained by giving up weaponization of nuclear materials and focusing solely on civilian use.   </p>
