       There is a suggestion that the earth started out small fitting in the Pangaea theory , other elements and that it is still expanding.  I found it intriguing, but I never went to far into it...it's still a controversial topic, apparently.  Here's a

       The earth is constantly growing and shrinking. It also gains and loses mass.  Maybe you need to read more.

       Ok, how do you get from plate tectonics to the earth is constantly growing and shrinking? And how much mass is the earth gaining/losing? The addition of 20kg due to an asteroid isn't what I would consider "growing."

       Plates form and expand causing the ewrth to grow, the collide and melt back it the mantle and it shrinks a little. Overall I believe the expansion is a little more. Something akin to 40000 tons o space debris is deposited on earth annually.

       Please go review plate tectonics. Your understanding of it is incorrect. The movement of the plates do not cause the earth to expand.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the space debris, 40,000 tons is quite insignificant compared to the mass of the earth. A fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a percent.

       The thing that made me look twice at this one was the Nazi's escape plan. They were going to straight up go to inner earth.

       And considering MK Ultra was a serious project involving Nazi scientists...I don't know. It must not be that batshit, or at least someone thought it wasn't.

       I'm not claiming the support of an authority, I'm linking to scientific documentation which you can review yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of linking to incorrect logical fallacies, why not outline what you disagree with in this paper:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/1999RG900016/abstract">

       Since you are incorrectly claiming it to be an Argument from Authority, you should surely be able to point out what you disagree with.

       Yes, due to evidence, analysis, experimentation and observation.  All of which point to a non-expanding Earth.

        These figures are the only available direct estimates of I/I0 for the Precambrian and argue against significant overall change in Earth’s moment of inertia since ~620 Ma. Moreover, they rule out rapid Earth expansion since that time by endogenous (noncosmological) mechanisms, particularly the hypothesis of rapid expansion since the Paleozoic [Carey, 1958, 1976], which requires I/I0 5 0.5 [Runcorn, 1964]. The figures for I/I0 determined here also argue against slow expansion by endogenous mechanisms. A proposed increase in radius of
0.50–0.95 mm/yr [Creer, 1965] gives I/I0 5 0.89–0.94, and the postulate that Earth’s radius has increased by 0.65 6 0.15 mm/yr for at least the past 600 Myr [Egyed, 1969] gives I/I0 5 0.91–0.94. The suggestion of Carey [1976] that substantial Earth expansion may have resulted
from change of phase of minerals in Earth’s interior to their less dense forms caused by a postulated secular decrease in G, i.e., Y ,, Y0, is not supported by studies of the morphologies of Mercury, Mars, and the Moon; those bodies also would have been affected by decrease in G but show little or no evidence of expansion [Crossley and Stevens, 1976; McElhinny et al., 1978]. Moreover, Mars Viking Lander and lunar laser-ranging data indicate negligible change in planetary orbital radii, which implies negligible change in the length of the year and in G [Hellings et al., 1983; Chandler et al., 1993; Dickey et al., 1994]. Hence the rhythmite data and the astronomical and
        <strong>
         astrometric observations together argue against significant change in Earth’s radius by any mechanism at least since ~620 Ma.
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       In short, geological constraints on the Precambrian history of the Earth's rotation in relation to the Moon's orbit show no significant change in the radius of the Earth for over 600 million yeas ... so.

       I would suggest reading the entire study to familiarize yourself with the methodology:

       If you read the paper it gives more context, that's why I linked to it.  If you don't understand the numbers, try reading the paper.

       Just because you don't understand the evidence doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  I'm sorry that you don't understand the study, it would really clear things up for you.

       If you want something you might be more easily able to understand, I would suggest looking into why functioning GPS makes it impossible for the Earth to be expanding.

       Everything in the universe is changing always, appearing and disappearing, expanding and contracting, like a breath of life. The earth only seem stable from a limited time perspective, but in a longer time span it definitely undergoes changes (whether or not this means size changes).
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say it's much more likely that the earth is hollow or porous like a skeleton or sponge (which respectively is hard and soft) than just solid. Even the human form contains more space than matter, and almost no one would be susceptible to believe this without the evidence to prove it.

       While thats a nice thought there is a difference between understanding that the Earth goes through changes or understanding the nature of matter and telling me the Earth is like a geode with an entire ecosystem inside of it.

       We know that the Earth isnt hollow, we fully completely understand this. Sure caves but its not hollow to the extent the above user believes it to be.

       Those are not flat Earth maps. The only way to show all landmass is on a flat object. If they just showed a picture of the earth, as a sphere, the countries on the opposite hemisphere would not be shown.

       That is a reasonable theory but the curverature of our eyeballs have nothing to do with it; it is the curvature of the atmosphere around the earth

       Since I don't have the resources to prove that the earth is NOT FLAT, I wanted to simply present this as "A Question" to facilitate a response from the community of ideas, from both sides of the fence. There are only 53 direct comments but there are more of you talking about this among yourselves, so that's exactly what I want to see.
         I, personally, don't think that the top 1% are planning on leaving us here because by the time the technology is available to them, it will also be available to us, as well...

       The U.N. map is NOT a flat Earth map. Its the most practical way to show all landmass on a flat surface. If you look at a picture of just a sphere, all you would see is one side of it.

       Just because the universe is expanding, increasing the distance between galaxy clusters, doesn't mean that everything within galaxy clusters is growing.

       Please go and read about plate tectonics. I don't think you fully grasp the concept if you think it indicates that the earth is "growing."
