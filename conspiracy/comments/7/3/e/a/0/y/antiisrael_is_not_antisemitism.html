&quot;Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ &#39;O Jews! If you claim to be Allah’s chosen ˹people˺ out of all humanity, then wish for death, if what you say is true.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first one.  Not the second.</p>

<p>It&#39;s actually interesting... Converts are some of the most highly respected and revered Jews.  HOWEVER, during the actual <em>process</em> of conversion, there is little support or help from the community.  Why?  Because to convert is a huge choice and one must go through all the steps through his/her own conviction, not because they are being pushed too from the outside.  If someone makes it through the entire conversion process, he or she is admired above others, i.e. Jews that are born into it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. It is a religious thing. </p>

<p>One of the most staunch supporters of Israel and Middle East wars that I know is a Christian evangelical woman. She apparently gets her ideas from the likes of Sid Roth and John Hagee. She says it is America&#39;s job to protect the Israelites because They are God&#39;s chosen people, and the wars associated with Zionism are ok because it has been predicted in the Revelations. She literally promotes war because she thinks Jesus will come at the end of it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a sick perversion of Christianity led by money-loving Satanic TV evangelical preachers. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I agree that anti-Israel is not antisemitic. But no one gets to say what a &quot;real Jew&quot; is. The tide is slowly turning, I believe. Almost all of the younger generation of Jews I know are opposed to Israeli statehood and are appalled with Israeli actions. Hopefully, with time this sentiment will continue to grow and lead to proper action here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, the same applies to all humans. Under that premise, there is no good human because everyone is not doing everything they can to stop everything bad that is happening. There surely is no good American because we cannot stop the evil people running our govt from killing people in other parts of the world. And I guess until all men stand up against rape, there is no good man? And all white people are bad because we aren&#39;t hunting down White Supremacist? </p>

<p>It&#39;s delusional to think that applies to one group of people and not yourself, whatever &#39;group&#39; you belong to.  You personally have no more control over the morality of your own government than any Jew does so quit your bitching.

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Of course it applies to all people. Until good cops stand up against bad cops, then there are no good cops. Until good white people stand up against bad white peole, then there are not good white people. Until good Christians stand up against bad Christians, then there are no good Christians. <strong>Almost every group and people in the entire world, barring Jews, understands this and does it because it is right</strong>. Only one religion/group has an entire &quot;don&#39;t mention our crimes&quot; industry in the form of the ADL; media perversion allowed by ownership; etc, and that&#39;s Jews. </p>

<p>I cannot believe that you can&#39;t see this. It&#39;s things like this that make me think that some Jews, perhaps even <em>most</em> (of the Ashkenazim) Jews, literally do not have souls. It&#39;s the only thing that can explain your blindness to all things good. </p>

<p>You carry a hell of a lot of bs blanket assumptions about people of which you clearly don&#39;t even know. What on earth makes you think that every Jew is in favor of Israel?! And Please tell me how they are supposed to singlehandedly stop Israel? Please tell me what some Jewish person in small town USA is supposed to personally do to stop Israel outside of boycotting Israeli products, speaking out against Israel and the atrocities they commit, and boycotting the paidfor trip to Israel? I would love to know what more they should be doing in your bs opinion that would then make them &quot;acceptable Jews&quot;. I get the impression there is no such thing in your world. </p>

<p>Everything you have said thus far is groundless and biased opinion of people you don&#39;t know. Because if you did, you would know exactly how disturbingly wrong you are in such bs blanket assumptions. </p>

<p>By the way, I&#39;m not Jewish what so ever. I just have common sense and shitload of Jewish friends who are utterly opposed to Israel that some of them have been disowned by their own family over it. </p>

<p>Now, what are you personally doing to stop your government from killing innocent people in other countries? because I got bad news for you... it&#39;s not enough, you morally bankrupt, soulless creature. </p>

<p>Argentina would have been awkward, with all the Nazis that fled there after ww2.</p>

<p>The Zionist plan for a Jewish state (possibly in Argentina) was hatched by Theodor Herzl in 1896. Hitler was 8 years old, and the Nazi Party wasn&#39;t formed until 1920.</p>

<p>Nazism died in 1946, yet Zionim is stronger than ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, as I said above, Zionism is stronger than ever, and you&#39;d be hard pressed to find any significant political movement, let alone a functioning State, whose philosophy, policies and practices are more closely aligned with pre-1939 Nazism. </p>

<p>Israel was founded on a philosophy of ethnic exclusivity and racism, brutally mistreats and oppresses those who are not in the &#39;special&#39; group, driving out undesirable outsiders; has created and enforces laws that favor in-group members; is extremely militaristic and expansionist under the guise of security and &#39;lebensraum&#39;, and is aggressively hostile toward its neighbors.</p>

<p>In fact, the main difference I see between Zionism and pre-1939 Nazism is that the latter was anti-Jewish, while the former is Jewish.</p>

<p>So yes, Nazism is alive and well in Israel. Just under a different name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>David R. Francis, United States ambassador in Russia, warned in a January 1918 dispatch to Washington: &quot;The Bolshevik leaders here, most of whom are Jews and 90 percent of whom are returned exiles, care little for Russia or any other country but are internationalists and they are trying to start a worldwide social revolution.&quot; The Netherlands&#39; ambassador in Russia, Oudendyke, made much the same point a few months later: &quot;Unless Bolshevism is nipped in the bud immediately, it is bound to spread in one form or another over Europe and the whole world as it is organized and worked by Jews who have no nationality, and whose one object is to destroy for their own ends the existing order of things.&quot; &quot;The Bolshevik Revolution,&quot; declared a leading American Jewish community paper in 1920, &quot;was largely the product of Jewish thinking, Jewish discontent, Jewish effort to reconstruct.&quot;In the Communist seizure of power in Russia, the Jewish role was probably critical. Two weeks prior to the Bolshevik &quot;October Revolution&quot; of 1917, Lenin convened a top secret meeting in St. Petersburg (Petrograd) at which the key leaders of the Bolshevik party&#39;s Central Committee made the fateful decision to seize power in a violent takeover. Of the twelve persons who took part in this decisive gathering, there were four Russians (including Lenin), one Georgian (Stalin), one Pole (Dzerzhinsky), and six Jews. To direct the takeover, a seven-man &quot;Political Bureau&quot; was chosen. It consisted of two Russians (Lenin and Bubnov), one Georgian (Stalin), and four Jews (Trotsky, Sokolnikov, Zinoviev, and Kamenev). Meanwhile, the Petersburg (Petrograd) Soviet -- whose chairman was Trotsky -- established an 18-member &quot;Military Revolutionary Committee&quot; to actually carry out the seizure of power. It included eight (or nine) Russians, one Ukrainian, one Pole, one Caucasian, and six Jews. Finally, to supervise the organization of the uprising, the Bolshevik Central Committee established a five-man &quot;Revolutionary Military Center&quot; as the Party&#39;s operations command. It consisted of one Russian (Bubnov), one Georgian (Stalin), one Pole (Dzerzhinsky), and two Jews (Sverdlov and Uritsky).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Soviet government, or &quot;Council of People&#39;s Commissars&#39; (also known as the &quot;Sovnarkom&quot;) was made up of the following, Wilton reported: Peoples Commissariat (Ministry) Name Nationality Chairman V.I.

The Extraordinary Commission of Moscow (Cheka) &#39;the Soviet secret police and predecessor of the GPU, the NKVD and the KGB was made up of the following: F. Dzerzhinsky (Chairman) Pole Y. Peters (Deputy Chairman) Latvian Chklovski Jew Kheifiss Jew Zeistine Jew Razmirovitch Jew Kronberg Jew Khaikina Jew Karlson Latvian Schaumann Latvian Leontovitch Jew Jacob Goldine Jew Galperstein Jew Kniggisen Jew Katzis Latvian Schillenkuss Jew Janson Latvian Rivkine Jew Antonof Russian Delafabre Jew Tsitkine Jew Roskirovitch Jew G.

Model Jew Routenberg Jew Pines Jew Sachs Jew Daybol Latvian Saissoune Armenian Deylkenen Latvian Liebert Jew Vogel German Zakiss Latvian Of these 36 Cheka officials, one was a Pole, one a German, one an Armenian, two were Russians, eight were Latvians, and 23 were Jews. &quot;Accordingly,&quot; Wilton sums up, &quot;there is no reason to be surprised at the preponderant role of Jews in the assassination of the Imperial family. It is rather the opposite that would have been surprising.&quot;&quot;The 62 members of the [Central] Committee were composed of five Russians, one Ukrainian, six Letts [Latvians], two Germans, one Czech, two Armenians, three Georgians, one Karaim [Karaite] (a Jewish sect), and 41 Jews. &quot;The Extraordinary Commission [Cheka or Vecheka] of Moscow was composed of 36 members, including one German, one Pole, one Armenian, two Russians, eight Latvians, and 23 Jews. &quot;The Council of the People&#39;s Commissars [the Soviet .government] numbered two Armenians, three Russians, and 17 Jews. &quot;Ac.cording to data furnished by the Soviet press, out of 556 important functionaries of the Bolshevik state, including the above-mentioned, in 1918-1919 there were: 17 Russians, two Ukrainians, eleven Armenians, 35 Letts [Latvians], 15 Germans, one Hungarian, ten Georgians, three Poles, three Finns, one Czech, one Karaim, and 457 Jews.&quot; &quot;If the reader is astonished to find the Jewish hand everywhere in the affair of the assassination of the Russian Imperial family, he must bear in mind the formidable numerical preponderance of Jews in the Soviet administration,&quot; Wilton went on to write. Effective governmental power, Wilton continued (on pages 136-138 of the same edition) is in the Central Committee of the Bolshevik party. In 1918, he reported, this body had twelve members, of whom nine were of Jewish origin, and three were of Russian ancestry. The nine Jews were: Bronstein (Trotsky), Apfelbaum (Zinoviev), Lurie (Larine), Uritsky, Volodarski, Rosenfeld (Kamenev), Smidovich, Sverdlov (Yankel), and Nakhamkes (Steklov). The three Russians were: Ulyanov (Lenin), Krylenko, and Lunacharsky. &quot;The other Russian Socialist parties are similar in composition,&quot; Wilton went on. &quot;Their Central Committees are made up as follows:&quot; Mensheviks (Social Democrats): Eleven members, all of whom are Jewish. Communists of the People: Six members, of whom five are Jews and one is a Russian. Social Revolutionaries (Right Wing): Fifteen members, of whom 13 are Jews and two are Russians (Kerenski, who may be of Jewish origin, and Tchaikovski). Social Revolutionaries (Left Wing): Twelve members, of whom ten are Jews and two are Russians. Committee of the Anarchists of Moscow: Five members, of whom four are Jews and one is a Russian. Polish Communist Party: Twelve members, all of whom are Jews, including Sobelson (Radek), Krokhenal (Zagonski), and Schwartz (Goltz). &quot;These parties,&quot; commented Wilton, &quot;in appearance opposed to the Bolsheviks, play the Bolsheviks&#39; game on the sly, more or less, by preventing the Russians from pulling themselves together. Out of 61 individuals at the head of these parties, there are six Russians and 55 Jews. No matter what may be the name adopted, a revolutionary government will be Jewish.&quot; </p>

<p>jesus, where did you get this bullshit? <em>nazi</em> as a word is around since the beginning of the 20th century... and nazis used the word for themselve, see e.g. <a href="https://archive.org/details/GoebbelsJoseph-DerNazi-sozi-FragenUndAntwortenFuerDen">https://archive.org/details/GoebbelsJoseph-DerNazi-sozi-FragenUndAntwortenFuerDen</a></p>

<p>Furthermore is &quot;the night of the long knives&quot; the night where the leaders of the Brown Shirts  (SA, Röhm putsch) where killed and not the RFB. And it was 1934 and not 1935.</p>

<p>How can anyone be so completly uneducated while carrying the nick &quot;WotansWolves&quot;? And still there are probably people which belive you -.-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously there are tons of idiots that conflate actual Judaism and random Jewish people with conspiracies but you&#39;re making a logical fallacy.</p>

<p>According to you we shouldn&#39;t point out that someone is a free mason because that is anti-mason. There are fraternal groups among the wealthiest of people and it&#39;s no surprise when you see certain behavior coming from wealthy Jewish people, because they may have ties to families like the Rothschilds.</p>

<p>Both google and Facebook are run by Jews? I have no idea whether that is a coincidence or maybe something more sinister. and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to call someone an antisemite for pointing that out especially when I have qualified that I don&#39;t thin that it really has anything to do with actual Judaism. </p>

<p>Part of being a conspiracy theorist is, naturally, identifying patterns. Ofc we need to be aware that correlation does not always equal causation but then again, where there is smoke there often is fire. It&#39;s a fine line and many get swept into paranoia and bigotry but as long as someone is careful there is nothing wrong with pointing out someone&#39;s affiliations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well guess who owns the media and in most people&#39;s mind what the media says rings true. </p>

<p>&quot;You can&#39;t call such-and-such actor Jewish how dare you anti-semitic. Israel anti-semitic. Phony virtue signalling anti-semitic. You must condemn historical figures our story version best even though you weren&#39;t born yet. How dare you say feminism is perpetuated mainly by lesbians who were secular Jews. How dare you criticize George Soros for funding black bloc ops.&quot; </p>

<p>It&#39;s all part of the mind fuck.</p>
