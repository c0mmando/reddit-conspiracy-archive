       Just look at what the fuck humanity is doing. You all know what I mean. 1% exploiting the 99% and we are just taking it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's so much to know and experience. Moon, pyramids, aliens, consciousness, life and death, holofractal, etc. My (and humanity's I'm sure) curiosity is infinite but it's just so depressing that I'll never get to know the answers to any of this because this degenerate society only cares about money and being better than your neighbour. I just fucking hate it. Ever since I was a little kid I've been obsessed with everything about what happens after death,  what we are, are there aliens, what was up with all the weird Gods of the underworld in Egypt etc, but I'll just have to die knowing it's out there and those dried out fucktards sitting somewhere in their super secret basement being blown by 5 year olds shitting on all of humanity know but refuse to get over themselves and have to ruin the planet. Add to this the fact that we are at the point where we don't know what to believe anymore, and they truly got us. Ridiculous. 1984

       To make it into the top 1% of earners, you only need to earn around $500,000 per year. It may sound like a lot of money, but it's really not, and it's not too difficult to learn a skill or start a business and work to reach this point. Focus your energy on working hard and getting here first, then decide if the 1% -- including you -- is actually responsible for exploitation.

       I don't know that it's inspiring but to me it gives me perspective to consider that things have always been this way... Our ancestors since time immemorial have existed under systems of control as insane as our own... So like them we can embrace it lament it or fight it or seek meaning in the absurd tragic beauty of it.  We are domesticated apex predators and we at least have the interesting distinction of witnessing what I believe is the perfection of "the nervous system" of civilization and it's complex systems of control.   It's terrifying but fascinating to see the ancient patterns blossom to absurd dimensions in the wake of this maelstrom of technological revelations...  Life is divine and we aren't necessarily meant to understand any of it, but like Hicks said in the end it's just a ride and it's a hell of a rush ;)

       Do you feel free with government up to their elbows into bitcoin and crypto currency?

       You are going to a system that depends on a different system controlled a delegate entity.  (Internet and electricity)

       How do you mean? Up to their elbows in what? Every time I hear a government officla talk about bitcoin it's clear they don't know what the fuck they are talking about. a lot like you.

       If internet and electricity fails we have bigger problems.  In such time you'll have to worry about carrying a bag of heavy metals to buy a piece of break while caring your gun and family with you hoping you don't get your arms chopped off by some guy carrying a samurai sword.

       Because we understand game theory and incentive mechanisms. The market is cracked wide open and if you continue making horse buggies in the age of automobile you'll go out of business. Simple as that.  You'll see these companies end up mining and becoming lightning hubs. When the internet came out, long distance phone companies had two choices.  Either fight it or deny its impact or embrace it. AT&amp;T embraced it and became one of the biggest internet providers. Sprint, MCI, ... yea.. bye bye!

       look at my history. I post in conspiracy and bitcoin/ethereum. I breath this shit.  I have a phd in conspiracy theory lol... i've been learning about this kind of crap since 2002. it's been a long time. Im sold on decentralized crypto currencies. Ask me any question about those systems and i'll try to help get a better understanding of them.

       You have to come to peace with it at some point. We don't get to choose our time and place of birth, and it's almost never a good time or place to be born. There used to be crap like plague and Mongol hordes and potato famine to worry about. And those people all had their own tyrants to deal with, usually with less protection than we still enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're gonna die sooner or later, and everyone will forget you within a few decades. Do whatever you need to do to be OK with that. I've got apple wine brewing downstairs, some canning to finish, berries to pick, and a few chapters left on this book. I don't care what Trump or the associated suits are up to this morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always recommend studying history if the modern world bores or disgusts you. Nothing like a little historical context to show you your unique place in the human experience. Lots of it isn't real, sure, but what is? :)

       As a dutch citizen i'm obliged to answer to this comment since I want to make sure you do proper research before doing something silly like taking a high dose and then wondering the streets of amsterdam. I've used shrooms several times in my life and one of my best and early experiences were still with really low dosage out in a field with as little stimuli as possible. High dosage of shrooms while it can be very illuminating can also be pretty scary this combined with the fact that shrooms tend to have the effect of lowering your IQ to that of your average primate can be a pretty risky situation. Always try to do it with a "tripsitter" or make sure you are in an environment where it's safe if you go bananas. feel free to PM me with any questions you might have regarding drug use and i'll try to inform you to the best of my ability.

       What a bunk of bullshit. What are you trying to scare people?  Every trip is individual and if that's what happened to you I'd suggest analyzing why instead of telling everyone else that it will happen to them.

       While I said "tend to have" the effect of lowering your IQ I was talking about multiple (10~) different trip experiences with people who were very experienced in taking substances which alter your perception of reality. When taking a big dose I can attest to the fact that it does seem to make you less able to make sense of your surroundings hence the term "lowers your IQ". But since you are obviously not able to read and comprehend multiple sentences I'll explain it more plainly just for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be fun, can be not fun be sure to read up kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also took my time to explain things more extensively in PM to the user in question, but I guess that holds no value to someone just trying to spread their own beliefs based on probably some things you read on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he said he wanted a high dose as an inexperienced user it triggered an alarm system inside of me which obliged me to respond to make sure he'd use his drugs responsibly and to the best effect, fuck me right.

       At what point in human history has this not been the case? There's nothing unique about us except that perhaps we're more idealistic than before. That can be a good thing but we have to proceed with great caution. We can't afford hasty, reactive decisions.

       This may be bad advice but this is where I am at the moment. There's nothing we can do to change anything. So you just have to come to peace with it and enjoy life. Just tune out from all the conspiracy stuff and go see how beautiful the world is. Go have a good time out with friends and cherish how amazing humans can be. See the good in the world and just enjoy life. Here's a video that all make me happy when I'm down.

       Watch Gleson. It is not a conspiracy but it helps me feel more human after watching it. Something about a man with ALS putting together a video for his son that he may never be able to have a meaningful conversation with helps puts things in perspective for me.
