        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>John Titor - &quot;Greetings. I am a time traveller from the year 2036. I am on my way home after getting an IBM 5100 computer system from the year 1975.&quot;</p>

<p>Mathematical Possibilities Regarding John Titor</p>

<p>So-called “debunkers” think the lawyer who represents the family associated with the character referred to as “John Titor,” is in fact the creator / author of John Titor based on a voice analysis. The fundamental problem with debunkers’ theories regarding John Titor is that said debunkers don’t seem to understand how the real world multiverse functions / operates. (A) Dimensional overlap. The lawyer representing the family may be channeling John. (B) The lawyer may have remote viewed John. (C) The lawyer may actually be synched with John through timespace (again, dimensional overlap). (D) The lawyer may simply be inspired by John and intimately familiar enough with John’s story, that the lawyer’s nuances, semantics and language are the “same” / similar, based on the aforementioned.</p>

<ol>
<li><pre><code> Similar to Rendlesham (a real, bona fied and absolutely one hundred percent real world event observed by the U.S. and U.K. Intelligence Communities), an advanced entity from an alternate future timeline may have broadcast information pertaining to John, into the mind of the lawyer. (A) Too many things about the future were accurate more than a decade in advance for the whole thing to be simply a “hoax.” (B) The IBM 5100 special feature had been a state secret and accordingly there has been some attempt by our government to cover up said fact. (C) Multiple incidents regarding attempts to obtain working IBM 5100s by alleged time travelers have been covered up by our gov, therefore again, suggesting some deeper hidden reality regarding real world time travel.
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code> It is theoretically possible that the “author” of the John Titor story may have intended to entirely “make up” thus fabricate the story by “imagining” it all, but that while “imagining” the “story,” it turns out the what has been “imagined” is actually real world hyperspace intel sensed, gleaned, thus picked up from the ether /spectrum of timespace, unbeknownstto the “author.”
</code></pre></li>
<li><pre><code> Truth is Far Stranger Than Any Work of Human Fiction Possible / Conceivable (A) Regardless of whether the John Titor story is true or false, debunkers are apparently ignorant to the mathematical and scientific fact that in terms of the real world. multiverse, real and actual John Titors do in fact exist, despite any stories to the contrary (B) The chrononaut phenomenon is one of actual, factual, Real World X-Files, Example: Project Pegasus, Camp Hero, Montauk, etc. In conclusion, the real truth is that the John Titor story can not actually be debunked because time travel is occurring, has been occurring and will continue to occur, in much the same way as John Titor&#39;s story, despite any elements of &quot;fiction&quot; from that particular &quot;story.&quot; Again, Truth is Far Stranger Than Any Work of Human Fiction Possible / Conceivable.

<p>This is a tad redundant. If extraordinary claims were supported by evidence it would then be &quot;extraordinary&quot; de facto.</p>

<p>The reality is people accept the same veracity of claims daily without being able to personally, or objectively verify the claims.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d love to get some evidence from any perception. If I were a time traveler I would just rattle off some facts that would later prove to be true.

<p>How would you do that in parallel time-lines or in a probabilistic universe? The mere mention would change the projection of the time-line.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Many things are outside your perception. Believing anyone else is not objective. Accepting an official word is an Appeal to Authority.</p>

<p>In that sense 99% of your world is probably not &quot;real&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like what you&#39;re saying is the more incredibly the claim I make, the LESS evidence I need to support it, because I can just claim that the entire fabric of reality has been distorted, thus I have no way to prove what&#39;s happened.

    <div class="md"><p>It &quot;sounds like&quot; within your perspective anything outside of your perspective is distorted. It doesn&#39;t take &quot;less&quot; evidence. It&#39;s merely pointing out equal evidence is treated with greater veracity in your perspective.</p>

<p>Again, from a time-traveller&#39;s perspective you are a fool [saying it doesn&#39;t exist or there&#39;s no proof of it], and they simply <em>know</em>. If a future or parallel version of yourself visited you , you would then <em>know</em> yourself. The rest of the world would claim you are mad because of their perspective. </p>

<p>Yet, via objective observation, you would have uncovered a mystery of the universe. Giving you a greater perspective of reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wouldn’t you find slightly suspicious the fact that the lawyer who represents the “Titor family” (provided it even exists) and the John Titor Foundation Inc. (or LLC) is based in Disney-created town Celebration, Florida?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the lawyer of John Titor is Larry Haber who&#39;s wife&#39;s maiden name is &#39;Tit&#39;shaw. They were the first residents of Celebration, Florida, a town created by Disney also known as &quot;Future Town&quot;!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if the real John Titor has over 300 pages of forum conversations that specifically say how he&#39;s going to change this time-line? But he doesn&#39;t. There is nothing. And because there is no evidence. The hoaxers and debunkers can safely ignore it all. Rendlesham.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So if anybody is playing the John Titor home game, here is where we are at.</p>

<p>Facts:
Oliver Williams is the original John Titor who talked with Art Bell as Rick from Ocean Springs, Mike from 2037 and John Single 7 from 2063. He&#39;s a fan of &quot;Demolition Man&quot; the movie and the webmaster of JohnTitor and JohnTitorFoundation. (Source:Razimus)</p>

<p>Oliver may have hired the Haber family for networking, security and legal in order to develop his story into a movie. Art Haber accidentally confirms this online.</p>

<p>Oliver Williams is a creative storyteller who may have prophetic abilities. His interview answers turned out to be true. Morey who wrote the posts also seems to have a prophetic ability. Or perhaps Morey was just relaying what Oliver told him. This does not mean Oliver is a time traveler. He could be an accurate psychic.</p>

<p>There are hints that Oliver may have been interested in an alien abducted guy by the name of Jim Sparks who has very interesting things to say about everything.</p>

<p>So on to the main elements of the John Titor story and what they may mean.</p>

<p>The IBM5100. I believe this is referring to an IBM secret program called Mercury in which they intend to fire U.S. employees and replace them with software and foreign guest workers. John is warning us about a future economic trend that will destroy us.</p>

<p>The Year 2000 Bug. (Source:Mike Mitreski) This may be in reference to then Secretary of the State of Florida Katherine Harris who selected George Bush to be President. Could this be about the Deep State Shadow Government? Again in 2004 with the mysterious death of the Bush I.T. Guru Mike Connell. Is this when we lost our Democracy?</p>

<p>The Racial, Civil and World War. It refers to so many things going on right now that it is hard to dismiss. Many Trump followers have been sympathetic to Russia and antagonistic toward the Alt.Left a kind of propaganda war going on in the U.S. and by social networking extension -- the entire world.</p>

<p>John Titor as John Single Seven&#39;s comments about not remembering Bill Clinton. Could this be a signal that time travelers would erase the Clintons from history?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Titor conspiracy has always been one of my favorites.. real or not, it gets the gears turning and it&#39;s fun to imagine. I certainly want to believe that he was a time traveler, and what&#39;s the harm in having fun with it? In my opinion It&#39;s one of the only conspiracies that isn&#39;t heavy and draining to research, and when I need a break from the heaviness I read a little more into the titor story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was always fascinated by the John titor story and hasn&#39;t thought about it in quote sometime. I saw a comment post yesterday about a posting from 4chan written on 9/11/17 warning people to stay out of Vegas, stay away from large crowds, and predicting a high casualty incident that would take place and then went on about what it was for andwhat wad gonna happen in the future. The only reason it made me connect to John Titor was because of the last sentence. &quot;This is my last message, don&#39;t expect me to return time any time soon - John&quot;</p>
