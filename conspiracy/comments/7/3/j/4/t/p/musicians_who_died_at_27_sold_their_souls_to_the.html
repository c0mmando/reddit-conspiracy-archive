        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Alright this may be a bit of a tin foil hat theory, but none the less I knew I had to share it. </p>

<p>This theory dates back to the early 1900&#39;s to Robert Johnson. There is a legend surrounding him that he couldn&#39;t play guitar at all, so he sold his soul to the devil and became one of the most influential musicians of the twentieth century, even being called the father of Rock and Roll. However, Johnson&#39;s musical reign was cut short when he died at 27 years old. The conditions of his death are disputed even now, but you could write that off as a campfire story. </p>

<p>I initially thought it was just a cool story, until I was listening to Jimi Hendrix one day. I knew he too died before his time as some would say, but I looked it up, and low and behold, he died at 27 as well. This is when I got a little bit skeptical, so I looked up &#39;musicians who died at 27&#39; and there was not just two names, but several of the most influential musicians who ever lived. </p>

<p>There is Janice Joplin, Amy Winehouse, Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain, and Pigpen from the Grateful Dead. All are considered musical geniuses and all died at 27. This leads me the deduction that these artist have at least some sort of conspiracy behind them, possibly a supernatural one. </p>

<p>Anyways, I&#39;d love to gear everyone&#39;s thoughts!  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to point out that the Robert Johnson crossroads story was originally circulated by a rival blues musician who was once a preacher but gave up being a preacher because music was more lucrative. He used his status as a former man of faith to make the whole crossroads thing sound legit.</p>

<p>The truth is, Robert Johnson disappeared for about 6 months and came back playing guitar like a legend. Selling your soul at the crossroads would be instant an instant fix for having no talent. Practicing and learning how to play the guitar takes time. If you have a natural nack for music, you&#39;re going to learn to play quickly if you spend most of your time practicing. 6 months and a passion for blues can do wonders. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well I can tell you as a guitar player my self that it&#39;s simply not possible to get as good as Robert Johnson in only 6 months. Also, the legend has further proof from Johnson&#39;s own songs where there is definitely something Johnson is lamenting over relating to the devil.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually I know people who got good at something within a short amount of time. Just because you can&#39;t doesn&#39;t mean someone else can&#39;t. Some people are just naturally gifted. It just takes a little time to bring that gift out.</p>

<p>Also, the subjects in his songs were popular in old blues music. A lot of blues musicians sang about religion, sin, murder, abuse, etc. and hid the messages in cryptic lyrics. More than likely &quot;Hellhound On My Trail&quot; was referring to something he did that would be considered sinful and he regretted. Probably adultery or something else along those lines.</p>

<p>The fact that the rival blues musician who literally turned his back on God for fame and fortune started the crossroads rumor makes me believe 100% it&#39;s just that; a rumor. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>honestly I think the record companies killed Hendrix.</p>

<p>his money was being stolen from him and smuggled out of the country, the IRS investigated him for money he was never given by his manager who took it.</p>

<p>common sense would say after Woodstock, after he came back to America and hit the big time he would&#39;ve started his own record label and competed with them very successfully based on his cult of personality.</p>

<p>at the time, trained musicians couldn&#39;t match his style and skill and type of playing, there was no easy economic fix to losing him to independence.</p>

<p>he would&#39;ve drained a lot of their money and resources just trying to compete with him and fill the gap in the market with similar music from their end.</p>
