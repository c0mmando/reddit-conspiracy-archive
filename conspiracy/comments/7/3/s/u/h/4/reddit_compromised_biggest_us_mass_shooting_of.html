    <div class="md"><p>Its pretty easy to &quot;game&quot; reddit by timing when you post things throughout the day.  You can look at metrics of each sub ( that are available at least ) and see the trends when most people are active and upvoting.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty confident saying that late Sunday night/early Monday morning is one of the least trafficked times of the week.  And considering the algorithm also works on age of post, people waking up and upvoting won&#39;t push those threads to the top.  So newer news articles being made hours later, as people wake up, will probably get much more visibility.</p>

<p>Even 58 people dying is a lot of people, it takes a lot to kill someone and the likely hood of each of those people dying to just one bullet already means that 58 bullets, shot at random, hit people at with deadly wounds. A high capcity magazine holds what, 30 rounds? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say I call bullshit, but I was very surprised by the numbers of dead and how many apparently suffered GSW to the head at that range and with automatic fire. I suppose the vantage point made head wounds more likely, but initially it made me think there was a lot of accuracy involved, something I found unlikely from a bump fired rifle as is being claimed. </p>

<p>I also found the variable rates of fire in the video I saw very strange. I don&#39;t know if echo could contribute to that or what but it made me think at first that there were two different weapons being fired at once and the video quality maybe made it sound continuous. </p>

<p>My concern is that it&#39;s a little too convenient with a country music festival being targeted. Mr. Trump was just handed an opportunity, I&#39;m worried what he will do with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shootings of this type are not a daily occurrence. Shootings where random crowds are targeted are not a daily occurrence. When crowds are targeted it is almost always gang related, as are most other shootings in the US. </p>

<p>Shootings occur daily, of course. It&#39;s a huge country with wild swings in demographic from area to area, and many of those areas are extremely poor without constant gang and drug activity. But those are something far different than this. </p>
