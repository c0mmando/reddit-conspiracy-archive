<p>This guy was fucking photographed at several radical leftist rallies and he just had come back from Dubai. Apparently he had converted to Islam recently to and the police found ANTIFA literature in his hotel room. </p>

<p>But anyway just look at how liberal mainstream media has been radicalizing people. People are brainwashed into thinking that Trump supporters are russian fascists and shit like that. You think that resisting authority is russian lol. </p>

<p>Its obvious this was an act of terrorism. He was literally trying to terrorize conservative white people. You have to be daft to try and deny that. </p>

<p>A look at this thread is a perfect example. You have multiple comments putting his roommate at the scene as an accomplice with ties to ISIS and &quot;Communists&quot;. </p>

<p>Yet she wasn&#39;t even in the country. </p>

<p>There was another thread very early this morning I saw that apparently put a much younger guy with the same name on blast. The comment was deleted when I saw it, but the replies were there. </p>

<p>Imagine if you share a name and basic physical description with someone who does something like this and then you get called out in multiple threads on varying sites. The consequences could be pretty significant and you go from being like everyone else to trying to clear your name.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep.</p>

<p>Clearly all the search engines are censoring. Bet close to 10% of the who were running away had their cell phones on record as they ran but I don&#39;t see those videos on the internet. Bet from 30% to 50% of people were recording the performance when the shooting started. But I only see one of those videos online and it was from a great distance. This is so different from 911 when we could see what was happening. Not anymore. Now we&#39;re supposed to blindly accept what media claims. I guess they learned with 911 to make sure we don&#39;t have clear video, many clear videos of what&#39;s happening. </p>

<p>BUT imagine this scenario. There&#39;s a conspiracy at work, and the body of this conspiracy is divided into small, independently operating cells. Lower level cells don&#39;t have much knowledge of the overall plan, but some might know that they do have to publish certain articles about a certain man around a certain date.</p>

<p>So these cells prep their articles using the engineered info that&#39;s been supplied to them by their handlers. And when they get the word, they release their already prepared, carefully crafted media pieces.</p>

<p>However, one cell screws up. (Can&#39;t have 100% quality control in these things.) They forget to switch the authored date that was placed there by whatever programming they were using. Oops, they showed their hand. But no problem, we can always blame google.</p>

<p>the fact that on the police scanner confirmed they were having to deal with many active shooters in several locations</p>

<p>Did they actually get visuals on multiple shooters? Or were they basing that off of 911 calls? Sound does a magical thing called reflects, there&#39;s a lot of confusion with scared people giving different descriptions of suspects leading to the belief there&#39;s more than one. Remember, eyewitness testimony is notoriously unreliable. Most peoiple fixate on the gun, not the person. </p>

<p>See above about eyewitnesses suffering from shock. No evidence - she could&#39;ve misspoke, or (as I&#39;ve seen speculated here) maybe it was the girlfriend who warned her. She never said it was a government agent. </p>

<p>According to police scanners they did, and they had a dead body at Tropicana as well. Not to mention they had multiple suspects, three Asian males in plain color shirts and cargo shorts, plus one white male, which I&#39;m guessing was Paddock. </p>

<p>No, like everyone else, I was listening on the broadcastify police scanner. They do not have timestamped links. </p>

<p>Lol, &quot;she misspoke&quot; - really? She seemed perfectly adamant to me and even went on in another interview to say there was a Hispanic man with her.

<p>You&#39;re only denial of these facts is &quot;she misspoke&quot; - absolutely no evidence for that bud!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bumpfire is really inaccurate. It&#39;s reliant upon your rifle sliding back and forth on the stock, destroying any possible accuracy. At most, it&#39;s best for wasting ammunition and shredding pumpkins. You&#39;d be better off shooting blindfolded, or with your feet.

In the Corps it was when two automatic weapons did their own version of &quot;Dueling Banjo&#39;s&quot;. One would fire 5-10 round then the other would fire 5-10 rounds. Sometimes they would over lap. This is what I heard from two different videos from the concert. It sounded like two different weapons. I have fired a bump-stock and one sounded different from the other but I would not say for sure it was a bump-stock. I did hear two distinctly different sounding weapons firing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>they are pretty clearly not the same female. open the picture up larger. Different boots, no belt on the one sitting on the curb, and also no strap on the back of her dress in the one going over the fence. </p>

<p>That being said. The weird things I did notice in the fence picture is, </p>

<ol>
<li>It looks like the one going over the fence is filming on her phone at the same time (it could be something beyond the fence and just looks like that). </li>
<li>The guy in the black shirt and black hat sitting behind the fence is still holding his drink pretty nonchalant about whats going on. </li>
<li>That lady to the left in the sunglasses holding up her bag of lunch. Weird. </li>

<p>Still pictures often do not tell you an accurate story, but I still find it weird that dude in the black shirt is still holding his drink. </p>

<p>I also disagree with your analysis of fight or flight. In a moment of panic, my instincts would usually cause me to squeeze that cup to help with steadiness/prepardness, or to drop it instantly to free my hands to be able to jump into action if needed. </p>

<p>Holding a short cup without spilling much would not be something my body instinctively prioritizes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah but Alex Jones, who admittedly has pretty good sources sometimes and is close with Trump, just said that local PD was aware of him and he had just converted to Islam. </p>

<p>Also ANTIFA announced multiple times that they are going to start killing people this fall. It seems highly likely that it had something to do with them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones is somewhere between controlled opposition and a carnival barker. There&#39;s no reputable source that the Vegas shooter was in any way Islamic.</p>

<p>Antifa doesn&#39;t kill people, you&#39;re mixing them up with the people they&#39;re against. Besides being against their MO, they haven&#39;t announced they&#39;re going to start killing people, they aren&#39;t a centralized organization with representatives that speak for them. This is a good way to ferret out that whatever outlet you&#39;ve been hearing this BS from is deliberately stoking tensions for financial or propagandistic reasons, and is thus untrustworthy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woooww. This is cognitive dissonance! Do you realize how many people have been attacked by ANTIFA? One of Alex&#39;s reporters just had a bag full of urine thrown at her face recently! </p>

<p>These people are communists which is inherently violent! Marxism is literally justification for stealing from rich people! How many people do you know that would justify stealing from a rich person or corporation? Thats not fucking ethical! </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/NgvPH">https://imgur.com/a/NgvPH</a></p>

<p>Look this guy was photographed at radical leftist protests several times. He was also photographed in Dubai. Its obvious what his fucking motive was and I wouldnt be surprised if he was in contact with ANTIFA members who egged him on!</p>

<p>But mostly he was probably radicalized by mainstream leftist media which tells people that all Trump supporters are Nazi racists that deserve violence. This is what the media wants people to do. They have succeeded in pushing a crazy person over the edge.</p>

<p>There were interviews with his friends and family to and they said he wasnt some typical gun nut. He was against guns apparently but he went and did this anyway. And there really was reports that police had already been aware of him because he made some radical Islamist comments. </p>

<p>And Hillary was trying to say that silencers would have made this worse. Silencers melt if they are attached to high volume automatic weapons and the people just froze anyways and didnt run. Smart people would have still ran. </p>

<p>Use occam&#39;s razor. This was obviously a left wing psycho that targeted conservative white people. Probably because antifa and leftist media convinced him that conservatives deserve violence. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Antifa doesn&#39;t kill people, you&#39;re mixing them up with the people they&#39;re against</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Look youre already radicalized! You think that white conservative people commit violence? These people were just fucking listening to fucking country music! They deserve violence? </p>

<p>Antifa has literally beaten up hundreds of people already and caused massive amounts of property damage. <strong>They are fascists!</strong> Or more correctly they are fucking communists! You think communists are fucking peaceful?! Their literal MO is to steal from rich people and redistribute wealth! You are brainwashed! Youve become a useful idiot! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one&#39;s been killed by Antifa.  Urine is not a machine gun.  Nice moving of the goalposts though!</p>

<p>Its not ethical for the rich to hoard the majority of the world&#39;s wealth, nor for them to rig the economy and corrupt the government in order to perpetuate that.</p>

<p>Those photos prove nothing, and the connections you try to make in your graphic are hilariously reaching.  There&#39;s no indication other than 4chan wanting it to be true that he&#39;s the one in that pussy hat.  The women&#39;s marches were not radical leftist protests, they were milquetoast liberal.  He was not photographed in Dubai - even your fever dream graphic doesn&#39;t pretend to show that.  There&#39;s exactly zero evidence he was in contact with Antifa, that&#39;s just something you want to be true due to your preexisting biases.</p>

<p>Mainstream media is not leftist, and neither mainstream nor leftist media wants people to shoot up concerts.  There is no actual evidence the guy converted to islam.</p>

<p>Hillary&#39;s comments have nothing to do with this discussion, and you dropping in that red herring just shows how deranged you are.  Not too surprising that you&#39;d add in non sequiturs when you&#39;re so quick to make up evidence out of thin air about the shooter.</p>

<p>Occam&#39;s Razor suggests this is the same sort of nut who does the vast majority of mass shootings, not that there&#39;s some convoluted and highly specific ideological plot with negligible evidence behind this.</p>

<p>White conservative people do commit violence.  For the record pretty much every demographic commits violence.  Just because the concert goers liked country doesn&#39;t mean they were conservative, and no where in my comment did I suggest they deserved violence.  Stop making shit up and putting words in people&#39;s mouth.  Take a deep breath.</p>

<p>Antifa has nothing to do with this, and besides property damage is far different from mass murder.  You&#39;ve been brainwashed by right wing propaganda, and sound like you&#39;re going to be a perfect little foot soldier for the powers that be when the shit hits the fan.  Stop imagining things and stop letting the elite dump their pr straight into your subconscious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a 64yo retired accountant with no military experience, terrorist connection or even police record, Stephen Paddock makes a most unconvincing suspect.
All the false diversion phonecalls (which caused the high kill count) and eight $20,000 automatic weapons are much more suspicious than any possible motives regarding the 2012 property liability suit against Cosmopolitan Resorts or ongoing divorce. The only other relevant information are a 2003 single engine pilots license and an Alaska hunting license. Again, both unconvincing. I&#39;m left wondering who made all the diversion calls?</p>

<p>No its not your responsibility to fix the reputation of of the sub, or anyone&#39;s but times like this is when real users need to dig for truth so these fucktards aren&#39;t running around making false claims, pushing false narrative that is basically dividing and ruining society.</p>

<p>It good to see boys on here actually doing some digging this last hour in this sub. I hope it continues and y&#39;all don&#39;t let them mess with you and your society.</p>

<p>Im Canadian. And this shouldn&#39;t affect me, but since flat earth on Facebook, and literally watching people believe the no sense no evidence claims is said.</p>

<p>And the fuck im letting my son grow up in a world where people think the earth is round and chess pizza means your a pedo.</p>

<p>Im ranting. Lol I haven&#39;t slept at all. Im gonna eat and shit and take a break, and I&#39;ll be back to sort these fuckers in out soon.</p>

<p>Take pride in finding the truth and not let a outside influence decide what kinda of country you have.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the simplest hypothesis proposed as an explanation of phenomena is more likely to be the true one than is any other available hypothesis</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would a guy with money shoot up a country music concert? Have you not seen how liberals become self hating? It&#39;s mostly white people saying that white people are racists and such. Did you look at the pictures?
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/gEoVI">https://imgur.com/a/gEoVI</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious this guy was a radicalized liberal. There <em>is</em> evidence that he attended several radical leftist protests. And look at the fucking media lately. Every other story on the news is about how Trump supporters are all evil nazis. Do you really think that rich people are somehow immune to radicalization? </p>

<p>On the contrary its actually white spoiled middle class Americas who are most vulnerable to leftist radicalization. They hate themselves basically. Look at ANTIFA. It&#39;s literally mostly spoiled white millennial kids. </p>

<p>If you cannot accept the obvious most likely motive god help your soul. Whatever your bias is must be extreme because the answer is right in front of you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit. What do you think the most likely motive is of someone who has attended leftist rallies and shot up a country music concert full of conservative white people?</p>

<p>Here is a copy paste of a 4chan post. Hopefully it shines some light. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Posting theories</p>

<p>Leftist?
(POSSIBLY DEBUNKED) Possibly spotted at anti-Trump rallies (This is still being investigated, PJW is skeptical)
A Stephen Paddock worked for NASA
Guy at anti-Trump rally had a NASA shirt on, looks like Steve, woman calls him steve in the video
MAYBE NOT DEBUNKED: See pic related, Steve Morph</p>

<p>Alex Jones FBI Hostage team source: Antifa literature found in hotel room after he was shot
Attacked a country music concert full of republicans
Anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution
Antifa undercover video from Stephen Crowder shows Antifa planning &quot;stabbing and shooting attacks&quot;, procuring assault rifles for attacks in next 2 months
AJ sources said it&#39;s going down in October</p>

<p>(Sky News, Witness Brianna) - hispanic woman pushed her way to first row of concert, said &quot;You are all going to die tonight&quot; 45 min before shots, kicked out by security</p>

<p>Brother and Niece say he was not religious - commie atheist?
GF (Marilou Danley) left the country recently for unknown reasons - maybe she cucked him and stole his gambling money</p>

<p>Yes i think Alex has standards for integrity. And you just admitted you have zero fucking evidence. Did you fucking see how many people were going up to him and getting in his face? DId you watch the whole fucking broadcast? Like fucking 6 people walked up to him and started yelling at him! His location was broadcast on twitter so this fucking comedian guy sought him out to fuck with him.</p>

<p>Youre literally so fucking crazy to think that everything alex does is staged holy fucking shit. You have no fucking clue. Youve just been brainwashed by fucking <strong>Stephen Colbert and John Oliver.</strong> I wouldnt be surpriised if they have turned you into a fucking goblin by now. </p>

<p>Directly fucking relevant. Hillary is ignoring that ANTIFA had been saying they were going to start killing people soon and literally took advantage right after it happened while people were still bleeding and said that silencers should be banned. </p>

<p>Your snarky sarcasm is not appreciated and you are only doing that because your ego knows that you have succumbed to cuckism and given up on freedom. This kind of things excites you doesnt it? You like seeing conservatives die and freak out about their 2A rights? </p>

<p>And &quot;silenced&quot; guns still produce noise and common sense would still dictate the people just get out of there. Most people froze regardless though even though they heard it. Clinton is full of shit and she loves watching white conservative straight males fucking die so she can fucking take their fucking freedom away just like you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m reading these comments and I’m glad to know I’m not alone in my doubts of what has been reported.  With that in mind, the reports did say there were multiple guns in the room.  Would this mean multiple types of ammunition? And if so then wouldn’t there be multiple types of casings in the room or in the ground? I’m just curious since news reports are only mentioning one shooter. If he was only using 1 or 2 weapons- then why so many in his room? Unless he has a habit of over-packing for trips. Just in case it rains or is hot or in case he had to go somewhere nice, a gun for each occasion. 
I know people will say he is crazy and not rational but if he is indeed the guy then as bad as this was, he was rational in his planning. They said he wired an alarm to alert him when people were coming to his room. That’s planning. That’s methodical. That is not an “over-packer”. </p>
