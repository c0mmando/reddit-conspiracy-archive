       It shouldn't be "Did these people really get hurt or killed?"
      </p>
      <p>
       The real question is
       <em>
        "Is this actually a lone killer, a targeted individual or an agent provocateur?"
       </em>
       If the government will kill a sitting president and thousands of people inside the twin towers, why the fuck wouldn't they kill 50 people in Vegas?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, not every single gun event is a false flag. Literally, everytime something makes the national news, the ridiculous accusations come out here. America is severely fucked up right now. Access to quality medical care is harder than purchasing a weapon. A girl shot herself at her high school last week. That's where we're at as a society, suicide AT school. Fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish this sub would get back to more esoteric or legislative debates, rather than all these "keyboard detectives" or posts about racism/feminism/homophobic bullshit agendas. Obama never took the guns. All these mass shootings are not about gun control. It's about feeling unsafe, not trusting each other and to avoid gathering in groups (that could easily overpower police...).

       Think centuries.  Gain an inch this century, a foot this century.  After thousands of years you've enslaved them with their own consent and you tell them to their face they are collectively apathetic.  They still believe they are vigilant.  Welcome to the nightmare that we call reality.

       Why?

       It seems that some refuse to believe any mass casualty event can't be the work of a deranged, angry person (or group), but
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       be orchestrated by a powerful cabal with a self-serving agenda.

       I could hear the people screaming from my back patio. The fear was real enough. The cops should get an oscar for their performance on the scanners. They were shocked and scared in a way like I could never imagine METRO being.

       No, you're wrong. The first question should always be "did these people really get hurt and killed?" As Sherlock Holmes said, it is dangerous to have a theory before you have the facts. Questions of fact should always precede theories--although the gathering of facts can and should be guided by theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       What kind of investigators say there was a murder with no body? What you want is to conduct a postmortem without any cadavers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course we don't have direct access to the morgue, but we have a lot of evidence of actors faking injuries and a ton of other things just never add up. So the logical thing to do is conclude nobody died.
      </p>
      <p>
       And once you see this happen over and over again, you assume it's true of the next major shooting event or terrorist attack; or the next one; or the next one.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, since you brought up JFK and 9/11, I'll offer you some links to people offering evidence that the JFK assassination was also a hoax and that nobody died on 9/11. You are welcome to do with that evidence whatever you want.

       That's a bit extreme. And also, like people asking for proof of Russian hacks, you can't have publicly released evidence of an ongoing investigation. Or you know, release information before the family is notified. My friend's mother found out her child OD'd on fucking facebook. Hell, we don't even know if we'll get to see JFK evidence this month, what makes YOU so entitled to crime scene photos?

       People are saying he had a fully automatic firearm. Those are not cheap or readily availiable. Shitty mac 10s can be upwards of $7,000. M16s can be nearly $20,000. Getting a transferrable machine gun takes many months.

       Usually any event that is covered by the controlled media is questionable because they only cover what they want their viewers to see/hear/read. There are shootings all the time which only get local coverage, when something is all over the mainstream it's part of an agenda.

       The mainstream media covers "small shootings" also, but only when it serves their agenda. You know, like a school, movie theater, street shooting, small hand gun on reporter, church shooting, oh also not just shootings but cars into crowds, small bombs, knife attacks, violent protest. What about the war crimes that the US commits on foreign nations, those aren't all over the mainstream, because it would be counter productive to their agenda.

       Of course, that's not debatable,
       <em>
        if it bleeds it leads
       </em>
       for ratings and also propaganda through social programming. My point is, an actual false flag is planned by powers above the media, in advance, and if any journalists worth thier salt actually do investigative reporting, they quickly end up suicided. Saying the media is pushing an agenda about gun control is a base level understanding of the manipulation and planning.

       I never mentioned a gun control agenda, just an agenda and I stated the media was controlled. In the end it's about control, our owners want us to become submissive to their every action. To believe whatever they tell us, to accept their lies, to sleep while they live. Trick the people into being slaves and they won't rebel.

       A false flag is simply an event that someone, the government for example, might use to push a certain agenda. It could be a completely artificial event where they rely on the media spreading their spin as gospel to convince everyone that it happened. This would be a hoax. Or it could be a real event where what the media says happened actually took place along with real victims and real footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example: Someone might call 9/11 a false flag to help enact the Patriot Act and make the Military Industrial Complex a ton of money in the ensuing conflicts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hoax False Flag version: 9/11 never actually happened, the media and government faked the footage and paid people to be witnesses. This effort was so convincing that everyone went along with the Patriot Act and war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Real False Flag version: 9/11 was an event which people think the government helped plan or execute. The towers actually fell, people actually died and Americans were so traumatized that they went along with the Patriot Act and war.

       To be clear, a false flag isn't just the government or media using a real event to push an agenda after the fact. It's a planned event, with false information preemptively set to mislead folks. A hoax is the same, except the event never happened.

       I agree that the people down on the ground weren't actors. But I've been to Vegas 40-50 times and the security is tight, you can't approach a bar without an ID stapled to your face. They have more cameras than money and can catch 1 individual counting cards out of 100,000 people playing.
      </p>

       The shooter with multiple automatic rifles is more than likely not just a random citizen who decided to go on a killing spree. It's too well pulled off.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for any paid actors, it's possible people on camera are crisis actors but they don't really need to be. If you create a real crisis you don't need actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandy Hook on the other hand, I've seen some pretty well put together videos suggesting that the entire thing never happened. That's a case where you'd need crisis actors.

       This is going to sound like a fucking stupid question, but I have to make the comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is another terrorist attack with a dead shooter. So there is no trial and no public/real investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In "A Noble Truth", they said they empanelled a grand jury to investigate the bombing.
       <strong>
        Why the fuck can't a grand jury be empanelled to investigate
       </strong>
       these fucking "terrorist" attacks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Only a very small percentage of the public believes their government would be behind these attacks. So I think they are effective and will continue to occur until some kind of real investigation takes place, or more people wake up. I don't think either is going to happen.

       One of your assertions is patently false. Most people here do
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       believe the entire thing is fabricated and bodies are faked. A small minority of people here appear to believe that. In fact, we can't even be sure if they are genuine. Those handful of people and this very post could be a coordinated smear campaign to make it look like there are a bunch of loons here denying that anyone was even shot. That's not the case. A significant majority of people here are questioning details, not the entire event.

       Fair enough, but I fear that it's not actual shills. It's the morons from YouTube comments that wandered in here around Pizzagate and never fuckin left.

       *full auto. The extra switch changes everything. There are no new tranferrable machine guns coming into the market. Its simple supply and demand.
