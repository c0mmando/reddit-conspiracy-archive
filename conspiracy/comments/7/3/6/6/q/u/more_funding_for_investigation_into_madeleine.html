<p><a href="http://archive.is/6bh3u">Madeleine McCann: Police given more funding for inquiry</a></p>

<p>Here’s a reminder of the <a href="http://archive.is/jfvIO">48 police questions Kate McCann refused to answer (and the one she did).</a></p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>On May 3 2007, around 22:00, when you entered the apartment, what did you see? What did you do? Where did you look? What did you touch?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you search inside the bedroom wardrobe? (she replied that she wouldn’t answer)</p></li>
<li><p>(shown 2 photographs of her bedroom wardrobe) Can you describe its contents?</p></li>
<li><p>Why had the curtain behind the sofa in front of the side window (whose photo was shown to her) been tampered with? Did somebody go behind that sofa?</p></li>
<li><p>How long did your search of the apartment take after you detected your daughter Madeleine’s disappearance?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did you say from the start that Madeleine had been abducted?</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming Madeleine had been abducted, why did you leave the twins home alone to go to the ‘Tapas’ and raise the alarm? Because the supposed abductor could still be in the apartment.</p></li>
<li><p>Why didn’t you ask the twins, at that moment, what had happened to their sister or why didn’t you ask them later on?</p></li>
<li><p>When you raised the alarm at the ‘Tapas’ what exactly did you say and what were your exact words?</p></li>
<li><p>What happened after you raised the alarm in the ‘Tapas’?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did you go and warn your friends instead of shouting from the verandah?</p></li>
<li><p>Who contacted the authorities?</p></li>
<li><p>Who took place in the searches?</p></li>
<li><p>Did anyone outside of the group learn of 
Madeleine’s disappearance in those following minutes?</p></li>
<li><p>Did any neighbour offer you help after the disappearance?</p></li>
<li><p>What does &#39;we let her down&#39; mean?</p></li>
<li><p>Did Jane tell you that night that she’d seen a man with a child?</p></li>
<li><p>How were the authorities contacted and which police force was alerted?</p></li>
<li><p>During the searches, with the police already there, where did you search for Maddie, how and in what way?</p></li>
<li><p>Why did the twins not wake up during that search or when they were taken upstairs?</p></li>
<li><p>Who did you phone after the occurrence?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you call Sky News?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you know the danger of calling the media, because it could influence the abductor?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you ask for a priest?</p></li>
<li><p>By what means did you divulge Madeleine’s features, by photographs or by any other means?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it true that during the searches you remained seated on Maddie’s bed without moving?</p></li>
<li><p>What was your behaviour that night?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you manage to sleep?</p></li>
<li><p>Before travelling to Portugal did you make any comment about a foreboding or a bad feeling?</p></li>
<li><p>What was Madeleine’s behaviour like?</p></li>
<li><p>Did Maddie suffer from any illness or take any medication?</p></li>
<li><p>What was Madeleine’s relationship like with her brother and sister?</p></li>
<li><p>What was Madeleine’s relationship like with her brother and sister, friends and school mates?</p></li>
<li><p>As for your professional life, in how many and which hospitals have you worked?</p></li>
<li><p>What is your medical specialty?</p></li>
<li><p>Have you ever done shift work in any emergency services or other services?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you work every day?</p></li>
<li><p>At a certain point you stopped working, why?</p></li>
<li><p>Are the twins difficult to get to sleep? Are they restless and does that cause you uneasiness?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it true that sometimes you despaired with your children’s behaviour and that left you feeling very uneasy?</p></li>
<li><p>Is it true that in England you even considered handing over Madeleine’s custody to a relative?</p></li>
<li><p>In England, did you medicate your children? What type of medication?</p></li>
<li><p>In the case files you were SHOWN CANINE forensic testing films, where you can see them marking due to detection of the scent of human corpse and blood traces, also human, and only human, as well as all the comments of the technician in charge of them. After watching and after the marking of the scent of corpse in your bedroom beside the wardrobe and behind the sofa, pushed up against the sofa wall, did you say you couldn’t explain any more than you already had?</p></li>
<li><p>When the sniffer dog also marked human blood behind the sofa, did you say you couldn’t explain any more than you already had?</p></li>
<li><p>When the sniffer dog marked the scent of corpse coming from the vehicle you hired a month after the disappearance, did you say you couldn’t explain any more than you already had?</p></li>
<li><p>When human blood was marked in the boot of the vehicle, did you say you couldn’t explain any more than you already had?</p></li>
<li><p>When confronted with the results of Maddie’s DNA, whose analysis was carried out in a British laboratory, collected from behind the sofa and the boot of the vehicle, did you say you couldn’t explain any more than you already had?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you have any responsibility or intervention in your daughter’s disappearance?</p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>A QUESTION SHE DID ANSWER</em>
Q. Are you aware that in not answering the questions you are jeopardising the investigation, which seeks to discover what happened to your daughter?</p>

<p>A. &#39;Yes, if that’s what the investigation thinks.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In your personal opinion the parents are responsible? </p>

<p>Don&#39;t you think that if rich and powerful people are behind this, they may have tried to blame the parents? Isn&#39;t it possible she simply refused to answer <em>all</em> questions if she thought the police was corrupt? Why is the police broadcasting this, isn&#39;t it highly unusual?</p>

<p>Blaming the victims in high-profile child abuse cases is standard practice, as in the Hampstead cover-up, or in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outreau_trial">Outreau</a>, or the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satanic_ritual_abuse">&quot;moral panic&quot;</a>. </p>

<p>Why would the mother seek so much attention if she was truly culpible?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not attacking your implications, I&#39;d honestly like your take on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In your personal estimation, are the parents responsible? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but there are a couple of way of determining this. They were responsible for the care of their children and shouldn’t have left them in the apartment alone. Not sure where I stand on them being “responsible” for her disappearance. Though there are too many unanswered questions for it to be ignored as a possibility.</p>

<p>If she thought the UK and Portuguese police were corrupt, why continue to campaign to keep their investigation open? I imagine it’s being broadcast because it’s become such a high-profile case. Why do you think it’s unusual?</p>

<p>The parent may continually seek attention as Financial incentive for the “find Madeleine” fund. Why wouldn’t she help the police if she wasn’t somehow culpable?</p>

<p>They actually reminded me of a connection to Philip Edmonds. Apparently he was “acquainted” with the McCanns, and is the nephew of Margaret Hodge (a UK politician linked to child abuse scandals).</p>
