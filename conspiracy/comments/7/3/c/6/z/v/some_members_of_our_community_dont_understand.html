       I mean, yeah, circumstantial evidence is a type of evidence in criminal trials. But to get a conviction, you need a lot of it. You can't just be like "Here's a picture of two guys, they must be conspirators." You need to build a case around the facts, a case which isn't contradicted by any other facts. And you need more than a "preponderance of evidence." You need sufficient evidence of sufficient quality that it convinces a reasonable person beyond a reasonable doubt.

       You are correct but one does not need evidence Beyond A Reasonable Doubt to begin an investigation. Only for a conviction. That being said, there are many investigations that have yet to be started or have been squelched at the beginning without proper procedure.

      <p>
       Where are those investigations?

       Having a realistic motive and the means and an opportunity to actually have committed a specific crime are all considered "circumstantial" and are probably more important in determining who isn't a prime suspect, rather than who is, but they can and do make a great deal of difference in how someone charged with an offence is perceived by any judge or jury.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes more than that to convict someone but not as much if the suspect doesn't actually have a clear motive or it's questionable if they could have acquired the means or their window of opportunity seems too brief tenuous for them to have carried out the crime.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No it's not. The word "circumstantial" only refers to evidence. The classic example of circumstantial evidence is testimony by a neighbor that he saw the defendant enter a house at such-and-such time, then leave the house at a later time, where the murder in that house is believed to have happened between those two times. That's not
       <em>
        direct
       </em>
       evidence that the defendant committed or was involved in the killing. It's
       <em>
        circumstantial
       </em>
       evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, that piece of circumstantial evidence is not very strong if it hasn't been demonstrated that a crime was committed in the first place. Evidence that the defendant was in a particular place at a particular time doesn't mean the defendant committed a murder if the person who died died of natural causes. The most important thing you have to do when trying to prosecute someone for a crime is to establish that
       <em>
        a crime was actually committed.
       </em>
       Without that, the defendant never actually becomes a defendant because there has to be proof of a crime before an indictment can be handed down.

       Yes but most people here at r/conspiracy can distinguish between someone like George Webb who uses crowdsourcing to collect mountains of circumstantial evidence proving government conspiracy and some random guy looking out his window, seeing an example of strange atmospheric distortion during sunset and then concluding that there must be a hidden planet about to crash into earth or that the earth is flat.

       I'm beginning to believe that most "people" here at r/conspiracy aren't even people. At least ones that aren't being paid to be here.

       That's a good mindset to have when visiting a sub that shares ideas. 'Any ideas that disagree with mine are being pushed by paid shills!'

       Now this may be hard to understand because our accounts seem to be similar in the amount of time as active, but I've been lurking on this sub for years. I even mentioned that when I first started this account. That being said, your account is only two months old so you may not understand how this sub has changed. And it has. Pre-election vs. Post-election are the difference from Night and Day.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub did not used to be an echo chamber. There were ideas thrown out from all sides that people didn't immediately down vote just because they disagreed with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the word "shill" didn't get thrown around nearly as much. But people have infiltrated this sub. There's no denying that. You can bring in your sarcasm to the argument or you could just comment on what the original point of this post was. Please, add to the conversation rather than detract from it.

       Sorry I'm not one of those posters that bothers to preface my comments with an announcement of how long I have been around here. I actually agree with you that there are bots and trolls with agendas on here. I'm just sure we disagree on who's who.

       I would argue that it's actually very difficult to pinpoint who is who in this particular circumstance. Within just a few minutes of me posting this, the post was downvoted. I mean, to the point where someone didn't even have the ability to read that quickly. To me, that seems indicative of bots. As far as shills, that seems much harder to prove.
