<p>&quot;Circumstantial evidence has a reputation for generally being weaker and less valid evidence than direct evidence. It is interesting and necessary, however, to emphasize that it is simply incorrect to assume that direct evidence is always stronger or more convincing than circumstantial evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>Â &quot;Unlike the incorrect examples perpetuated by television shows, movies, and novels, a majority of convictions are based solely on circumstantial evidence if for no other reason than this type of evidence is more commonly encountered at crime scenes than direct evidence.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, yeah, circumstantial evidence is a type of evidence in criminal trials. But to get a conviction, you need a lot of it. You can&#39;t just be like &quot;Here&#39;s a picture of two guys, they must be conspirators.&quot; You need to build a case around the facts, a case which isn&#39;t contradicted by any other facts. And you need more than a &quot;preponderance of evidence.&quot; You need sufficient evidence of sufficient quality that it convinces a reasonable person beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct but one does not need evidence Beyond A Reasonable Doubt to begin an investigation. Only for a conviction. That being said, there are many investigations that have yet to be started or have been squelched at the beginning without proper procedure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having a realistic motive and the means and an opportunity to actually have committed a specific crime are all considered &quot;circumstantial&quot; and are probably more important in determining who isn&#39;t a prime suspect, rather than who is, but they can and do make a great deal of difference in how someone charged with an offence is perceived by any judge or jury. </p>

<p>It takes more than that to convict someone but not as much if the suspect doesn&#39;t actually have a clear motive or it&#39;s questionable if they could have acquired the means or their window of opportunity seems too brief tenuous for them to have carried out the crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No it&#39;s not. The word &quot;circumstantial&quot; only refers to evidence. The classic example of circumstantial evidence is testimony by a neighbor that he saw the defendant enter a house at such-and-such time, then leave the house at a later time, where the murder in that house is believed to have happened between those two times. That&#39;s not <em>direct</em> evidence that the defendant committed or was involved in the killing. It&#39;s <em>circumstantial</em> evidence.</p>

<p>However, that piece of circumstantial evidence is not very strong if it hasn&#39;t been demonstrated that a crime was committed in the first place. Evidence that the defendant was in a particular place at a particular time doesn&#39;t mean the defendant committed a murder if the person who died died of natural causes. The most important thing you have to do when trying to prosecute someone for a crime is to establish that <em>a crime was actually committed.</em> Without that, the defendant never actually becomes a defendant because there has to be proof of a crime before an indictment can be handed down.</p>

<p>This part in particular, I think, is relevant to a lot of the threads on this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This from a legal dictionary...</p>

<p>&quot;Circumstantial evidence is most often employed in criminal trials. Many circumstances can create inferences about an accused&#39;s guilt in a criminal matter, including the accused&#39;s resistance to arrest; the presence of a motive or opportunity to commit the crime; the accused&#39;s presence at the time and place of the crime;&quot; </p>
