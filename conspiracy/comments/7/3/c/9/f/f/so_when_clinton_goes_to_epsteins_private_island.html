    <div class="md"><p>DJT was pretty public about disavowing Epstein, and in an interview long before he was a candidate, showed a little distaste for Epstein&#39;s penchant for &quot;young girls.&quot; Sorry, not trying to find that clip.</p>

<p>BUT, I&#39;m totally with you, and it&#39;s completely believable that the lawsuit has merit. Even if you want to believe Trump is beyond this, he probably wasn&#39;t beyond it with a few drinks in him (or other substances), around others doing the same thing, on a remote island, etc. etc. – and JE and others probably have video that no one will ever see. I think he and Ghislaine Maxwell did a lot of work securing the children/teens that would be used in blackmailing politicians and celebrities, and DJT isn&#39;t immune.</p>

<p>New York magazine interview of Trump - cor 2008 or 09</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He&#39;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I remember that. It&#39;s the way he said it (on video), the fact that DJT has said that about EVERYONE at some point in his life, and that he barred Epstein from his properties. I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s innocent, but he did try to separate himself from JE; to claim it&#39;s because he disapproved of his lifestyle could be one reason, but it could be just as true that it&#39;s because JE had dirt on him.</p>

<p>Trump went a documented 0 times.</p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: And as for the mythical &quot;Katie Johnson&quot; narrative, that has been debunked 12 ways to Sunday. It was created by the Clinton campaign when focus groups told them that Bill Clintons rapes were hurting Hillary&#39;s campaign. So John Podesta went to a civil court to fill out a fake claim of rape by a fictitious &quot;Katie Johnson&quot;. Why wasn&#39;t it filed in CRIMINAL court? Because criminal court requires proof. Anyone, by contrast, can file a claim in civil court. I, for instance, can accuse YOU of having assassinated Abraham Lincoln and signed my name on the document as &quot;Albert Einstein&quot;. And that&#39;s exactly what happened in the &quot;Katie Johnson&quot; affair. It was thrown out of four civil courts, because when they tried to contact &quot;Ms. Johnson,&quot; the address she gave turned out to be fake, as was her phone number. In fact, everything written on the document was fraudulent. But it was enough for the Clinton machine to muddy the waters and create a false equivalency between Bill Clinton&#39;s documented real-life, authenticated victims (who&#39;ve been around for decades) and Trump&#39;s shadowy, invisible, just-appeared-for-the-campaign victims . . . who conveniently melted back into the Ether after the election. It&#39;s sad that the worse you can do to Trump is to accuse of him REAL shit the Clintons did. </li>
