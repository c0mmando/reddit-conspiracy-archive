       Katie Johnson had named Trump and billionaire Jeffrey Epstein in a $100 million lawsuit, accusing them of having solicited sex acts from her at sex parties held at the Manhattan homes of Epstein and Trump back in 1994 (when Johnson was just 13 years old):

       Trump killed Mossad's ISIS proxy army when he defunded it.  Not the behavior somebody under the control of Israel, that's for sure, and if he was on board with everything the media would not be attacking him like they do.

       I was under the impression that Trump's name NEVER showed up on the flight logs for the Lolita Express when the plane went to Lolita Island.  Would the original poster be able to provide a link which shows that his name was on the list?

       Did Trump know Epstein? Yes, for several years.

      <p>
       Did Trump manage a modeling agency that employed underage European girls? Yes.

       I haven't heard of his name being on the list either.  I wouldn't mind pinning that on him, I will call him on it.

       When Epsteins brother was deposed, he testified that Trump was on the plane once but didn't get off at the island, instead staying on the plane and going to NYC. The flight logs didn't back up the claim.

       DJT was pretty public about disavowing Epstein, and in an interview long before he was a candidate, showed a little distaste for Epstein's penchant for "young girls." Sorry, not trying to find that clip.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT, I'm totally with you, and it's completely believable that the lawsuit has merit. Even if you want to believe Trump is beyond this, he probably wasn't beyond it with a few drinks in him (or other substances), around others doing the same thing, on a remote island, etc. etc. – and JE and others probably have video that no one will ever see. I think he and Ghislaine Maxwell did a lot of work securing the children/teens that would be used in blackmailing politicians and celebrities, and DJT isn't immune.

       Yes, I remember that. It's the way he said it (on video), the fact that DJT has said that about EVERYONE at some point in his life, and that he barred Epstein from his properties. I'm not saying he's innocent, but he did try to separate himself from JE; to claim it's because he disapproved of his lifestyle could be one reason, but it could be just as true that it's because JE had dirt on him.

       The lawsuit got some attention, but the woman withdrew citing death threats. So anyone who didn't want to believe her didn't and the whole thing was glossed over pretty quick. Neither candidate wanted to talk about Epstein, so no one pushed it.

       The timing is really suspicious, though, let's be honest. Why didn't she just blackmail him all these years? Why didn't she sue when Epstein was convicted? It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.

       I don't understand this guilt by association thing when it comes to epstein. Has anyone accused anyone other than epstein of having sex with girls under 16 on the island. I would happily take a private jet to my friends island and stick to coke and hookers that were old enough.

       I believe your defense of people who actually are untouchable is kinda laughable.

       Bot trying to be a dick, but you've seen how many scandals Clinton's tend to get into, Mena, WhiteWater, Boys on the Track, Vince Foster, etc.

       No, we have plane manifests proven that Clinton ditched his secret service detail and went to Pedophile Island dozens of times. Hillary went a document 6 times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump went a documented 0 times.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Footnote: And as for the mythical "Katie Johnson" narrative, that has been debunked 12 ways to Sunday. It was created by the Clinton campaign when focus groups told them that Bill Clintons rapes were hurting Hillary's campaign. So John Podesta went to a civil court to fill out a fake claim of rape by a fictitious "Katie Johnson". Why wasn't it filed in CRIMINAL court? Because criminal court requires proof. Anyone, by contrast, can file a claim in civil court. I, for instance, can accuse YOU of having assassinated Abraham Lincoln and signed my name on the document as "Albert Einstein". And that's exactly what happened in the "Katie Johnson" affair. It was thrown out of four civil courts, because when they tried to contact "Ms. Johnson," the address she gave turned out to be fake, as was her phone number. In fact, everything written on the document was fraudulent. But it was enough for the Clinton machine to muddy the waters and create a false equivalency between Bill Clinton's documented real-life, authenticated victims (who've been around for decades) and Trump's shadowy, invisible, just-appeared-for-the-campaign victims . . . who conveniently melted back into the Ether after the election. It's sad that the worse you can do to Trump is to accuse of him REAL shit the Clintons did.
