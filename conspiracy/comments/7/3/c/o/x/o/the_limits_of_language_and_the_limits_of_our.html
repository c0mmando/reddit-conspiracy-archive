<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Ludwig Wittgenstein famously said, “The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.”</p>

<p>I am obsessed with language. The more I expand my language (or languages) the more I expand my worldview. Did you know that our identities literally shift with the language of our choice?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hf.uio.no/multiling/personer/kjernegruppe/pial/articles/identities-in-action.-a-nexus-analysis-of-identity-construction-and-language-shift.pdf">http://www.hf.uio.no/multiling/personer/kjernegruppe/pial/articles/identities-in-action.-a-nexus-analysis-of-identity-construction-and-language-shift.pdf</a></p>

<p>Our worldview is shaped by language, and our minds extend as far as language can extend. Language is both a freedom and a barrier, depending on how it is used.  Language can be used to open minds or it can be used for control. Language is power. </p>

<p>This post will go in many directions, but the conspiracy is ultimately how language can be used for control. The only way to break out of this control, well, is to understand both the power and limitations of language.</p>

<p><strong>First Things First</strong></p>

<p>Before I write this post, I want to explain my views on language as an English teacher. This is extremely important, so I hope you do not bypass this part. </p>

<p>To me, there is no “bad” language. Formal and informal language are necessary in different contexts. Slang, humor, and other aspects of language all hold a purpose. Language is not inherently good or bad. Language is a tool (I hold the same view with technology). </p>

<p>I tell my students that they have to learn various modes of language so they can function in different environments – the way they would talk to the president is not the way they would talk to a friend. Further, it’s important to value one’s own home language (whatever that may be), but it is also important to learn and dissect the language of power. The more one is able to shift different modes of language, the more they can adapt to changing environments.</p>

<p>So, with that being said, I kind of laugh when I see grammar “Nazis” go crazy on Reddit, a more informal message board. However, I could completely understand someone abiding by strict rules of grammar for their master’s thesis. It is also funny that many mock others for misuse of spelling or grammar, but they are often unaware of more miniscule mistakes they may make. For example, someone may criticize others for their misuse of “its” and “it’s”, but they may put a preposition at the end of a sentence, which is considered a “no-no” in the grammar world. Did you know, for example, that many ‘rules’ of modern English come from Latin?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_influence_in_English">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_influence_in_English</a></p>

<p>The ‘not ending a sentence with a preposition rule’ is one of them (I’ll explain why if anybody is interested). Latin was considered &quot;pure&quot; by early Linguistics. The point is, it’s really arbitrary (or is it?), and some of the rules of English can be absurd at times.</p>

<p>Still, the point is that formal language is not always necessary, and I do not believe anyone’s language is inherently good or bad. However, I believe that development of formal language is necessary for understanding the power structures in society, who ultimately use this formal structure of language. In reality, a person who truly understands language can shift in and out of different modes to suit the purpose of the situation. </p>

<p><strong>Power Structures of Language</strong></p>

<p>Now that I have explained that I do not think any language is inherently good or bad, I wanted to start with something that is really freaking me out. </p>

<p>‘They’ are now claiming that grammar is, well…racist:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/21/college-writing-center-proper-grammar-perpetuates-/">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/21/college-writing-center-proper-grammar-perpetuates-/</a></p>

<p>From the article,</p>

<p>“For example, linguistic and writing research has shown clearly for many decades that there is no inherent ‘standard’ of English. Language is constantly changing. These two facts make it very difficult to justify placing people in hierarchies or restricting opportunities and privileges because of the way people communicate in particular versions of English.”</p>

<p>While it may be true that language is constantly evolving, I find it disturbing that standards of language are being compromised.
Now, I do absolutely believe that, at times, language can be used as a system to oppress. There are many examples of this in history. However, we have two options here:</p>

<p>1)  Help all people learn all aspects of language and all modes of language. For example, an oppressed person may not know English well. A good teacher can help this person learn the standards of language, and they can rise above.</p>

<p>2)  Eliminate standards of English and downgrade it to a point where there is no oppression built in to any language.</p>

<p>Neither of these are perfect options. The first option presupposes that there is an elite group that will always be in control. My argument is that this elite will group will do whatever they can to limit the language of the “common people,” and there will likely always be an elite group, whether we like that or not. </p>

<p>I am totally against number two though. By completely downgrading the standards of language, we will limit the worlds of the common folk. </p>

<p>I think we should fall somewhere in between. We should recognize how language can be used to control by those in power, but she not downgrade language to  “the lowest common denominator” so to speak. </p>

<p>Before we go further, I need to explain something. All languages are built on systems – semantics, syntax, phonology, grammar, etc. Every language system has these items. Further, “grammar” is not inherently good or bad either. It is a system to make communication more understandable and common amongst one group. No matter what language you explore, these common systems will exist.</p>

<p>If we remove systems of grammar, we start to remove clear systems of communication. It’s quite simple, and here is a classic example to show this:</p>

<p>I like cooking my family and my pets.
I like cooking, my family, and my pets.</p>

<p>The simple comma rules saves us a lot of trouble in communication. </p>

<p>Further, when we remove a universal standard of a language, we remove those who have access to a universal understanding. For example, if most articles are written in standard English, then anybody familiar with standard English can understand them. More complicated subjects, like quantum physics, for example, cannot be “broken down” into simple language. Instead of doing that, we should teach all people the standard so they can access any topic. </p>

<p>If we start taking away rules of English, claiming they are inherently racist or bigoted, then we start breaking down something that unites us. No matter what race, ethnicity, class, etc., the majority in the United States are encouraged to learn standard English. What if that changes? Well, it seems to be…slowly.</p>

<p>So, while I cannot deny that power structures exist in any language system, I feel the benefit would be to provide all with access to the different levels of power versus denigrating a language system to meet the needs of the most limited speakers.
In education, teachers should be encouraged to bring language and power to their students. If more are able to understand the language of those in power, then it is more likely that change can occur. </p>

<p><strong>Tainted Language</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to start with a strange thought I had here. Now, I know that students have always giggled about words such as “butt” or whatever, but I actually feel the English language has been “pornified.” Let me explain.</p>

<p>Every word has a connotation, or a deeper feeling behind it. For example, the word delicious has a positive connotation, and the word poor has a negative connotation. I feel that many ‘neutral’ words are now being sexualized, and I feel this is due to an over-sexualized society.</p>

<p>Finger, hard, wet, stiff, come, and many more have shifted from neutral connotations to more sexualized connotations. How do I know? Well, when I read this words in class, students always giggle and shift eyes. </p>

<p>Isn’t that a little disturbing to anyone? Before (maybe 20 years ago), those words would have been relatively neutral, but now they have taken on inherently sexual meanings. I contribute some of this much to the music our youth listen to, with over 90% of top billboard songs being about sex:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/92-top-ten-billboard-songs-are-about-sex/337242/">https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/92-top-ten-billboard-songs-are-about-sex/337242/</a></p>

<p>This isn’t just about the sexualization of language though (though most things seem to be about sex these days). It is quite disturbing that language seems to be more simplified. While I’m not against texting as a mode of language, it is quite disturbing that more and more are using texting (or other similar means) as the ONLY mode of language. While many seem to be adapting to both text-speak and formal language, I worry that MANY are not adapting to both modes:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/9966117/Text-speak-language-evolution-or-just-laziness.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/9966117/Text-speak-language-evolution-or-just-laziness.html</a></p>

<p>Before you argue with me, the people who are more likely to switch between different modes of languages are rich, and the people who struggle with this are poor. The “Language Gap” begins in infancy:</p>

<p><a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/september/toddler-language-gap-091213.html">http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/september/toddler-language-gap-091213.html</a></p>

<p>So, again, there is nothing inherently wrong with texting (or anything like it) itself. Still, it seems to divide people further, specifically the rich and the poor.</p>

<p><strong>Loss of Language Lovers</strong></p>

<p>Even if we move beyond the rich and poor, though, there are some serious issues with language across our country (Yes, this post is veered toward the US):</p>

<p>1)  There is a long, steady decline of literary reading:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/07/the-long-steady-decline-of-literary-reading/?utm_term=.35ad08426cb8">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/07/the-long-steady-decline-of-literary-reading/?utm_term=.35ad08426cb8</a></p>

<p>2)  There are serious issues in test scores, specifically in reading, science, and math across the country:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-12-06/math-a-concern-for-us-teens-science-reading-flat-on-test">https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-12-06/math-a-concern-for-us-teens-science-reading-flat-on-test</a></p>

<p>3)  Many of our students are just not prepared for college:
<a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-04-27/high-school-seniors-arent-college-ready-naep-data-show">https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-04-27/high-school-seniors-arent-college-ready-naep-data-show</a></p>

<p>Now, these articles have many different causes and many different effects. What I am trying to say though is that it seems ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS that in the age of information technology that our students still cannot adequately read. They still are not being prepared for college. </p>

<p>This makes absolutely no sense. Students spend a huge chunk of their lives in schools, yet they are not being adequately prepared for the real world. I mean, university students are struggling to read entire books! </p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/university-students-are-struggling-to-read-entire-books-a6986361.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/university-students-are-struggling-to-read-entire-books-a6986361.html</a></p>

<p>There is something wrong here, and it goes beyond technology (though I feel that is a huge culprit). Our students are literally losing their languages. Language is the essence of all subjects, even math. If our students are not reading, they cannot learn. </p>

<p>How does a student learn to read? They have to read.
How does a student learn to write? They have to write.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Americans are not book lovers anymore. They have lost their love for language:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/the-decline-of-the-american-book-lover/283222/">https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/the-decline-of-the-american-book-lover/283222/</a></p>

<p>I tell my students reading is a discipline. Many of them are into sports, and they understand what discipline means. In order to learn how to read, one must have a quiet environment of peace where they can do so. Can students really do that today? Do students have alone time? Do they have quiet time, even in a classroom? I would say no, which is why I have devoted time to letting them read in complete silence daily without the beep of text messages. </p>

<p><strong>Technology and Its Role</strong></p>

<p>Just like I do not think language is inherently good or bad, I do not think technology is inherently good or bad, and I have written much about this (check my post history). You may not have read 1984, but you probably have heard of newspeak:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak</a></p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, many are claiming the structure of language is inherently racist or bigoted (or insert propaganda word here).  In my opinion, they are trying to limit language. From the Wikipedia article:</p>

<p>“Newspeak is the language of Oceania, a fictional totalitarian state ruled by the Party, who created the language to meet the ideological requirements of English Socialism (Ingsoc).[1] In George Orwell&#39;s world of Nineteen Eighty-Four, Newspeak is a controlled language, of restricted grammar and limited vocabulary, a linguistic design meant to limit the freedom of thought—personal identity, self-expression, free will—that ideologically threatens the régime of Big Brother and the Party, who thus criminalized such concepts as thoughtcrime, contradictions of Ingsoc orthodoxy.[2][3][4]”</p>

<p>Further, I feel technology in some ways may be limiting our language to meet ideological requirements, and further, it is a way of controlling language.</p>

<p>Now before you tell me you read online all of the time, it seems that “screens” may actually be impeding our ability to read longer texts (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/reading-paper-screens/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/reading-paper-screens/</a>).</p>

<p>“ Even so, evidence from laboratory experiments, polls and consumer reports indicates that modern screens and e-readers fail to adequately recreate certain tactile experiences of reading on paper that many people miss and, more importantly, prevent people from navigating long texts in an intuitive and satisfying way. In turn, such navigational difficulties may subtly inhibit reading comprehension. Compared with paper, screens may also drain more of our mental resources while we are reading and make it a little harder to remember what we read when we are done. A parallel line of research focuses on people&#39;s attitudes toward different kinds of media. Whether they realize it or not, many people approach computers and tablets with a state of mind less conducive to learning than the one they bring to paper.”
In other words, maybe people are reading online, but they certainly are not reading something with depth, length, or complexity online.</p>

<p>Further, for many of you who do read books on technology, how hard is it? I know for me, I get very distracted. I have had to ensure that when I read on my tablet that notifications for social media are off. However, does our youth have the self-control?
Even if you disregard that particular article, the fact is that people are not using the endless world of the internet to learn and read. They are using it to entertain themselves to death:</p>

<p><a href="https://quote.ucsd.edu/childhood/files/2013/05/postman-amusing.pdf">https://quote.ucsd.edu/childhood/files/2013/05/postman-amusing.pdf</a></p>

<p>Moreover, people are no longer exploring the world through language. They are exploring the world through visuals and virtual reality. While that is ultimately not a bad thing, it means that less time is spent on language itself. If people are spending less time on language, they are using language less, and they are less likely to communicate effectively. They are less likely to learn something new. While language isn’t the only mode of learning, it is a very important mode of learning. All modes of learning are important, but I am worried as the use of complex language decreases. Quite simply, less complex language means less complex thoughts. </p>

<p>Finally, reading allows imagination or creative thought. Do all these visuals allow that?</p>

<p>We have the world at our fingertips, but most are spending time with this endless amount of knowledge on porn and cat videos and propaganda YouTube videos about how language is racist and bigoted and YOU should stop using language altogether :) (only kidding…of course)</p>

<p><strong>Language and Power</strong></p>

<p>Language is power. The more effectively someone can read, write, and speak in a multitude of modalities, the more they are likely to be successful in life. There are thousands of studies on this, but here is one:</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/inside-school-research/2011/04/the_disquieting_side_effect_of.html">http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/inside-school-research/2011/04/the_disquieting_side_effect_of.html</a></p>

<p>Is it any wonder those in power would want to limit the language of the common people? </p>

<p>In the same way, language can be used to fool or limit. Think about tools such as propaganda, misinformation, disinformation, groupthink, etc. Propaganda techniques are widely used in internet forums (or in life in general). If people do not understand the tool of language, they become a tool of the power language.</p>

<p>As George Orwell said, “But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.” </p>

<p>To go even further, though, language can limit our world views. I remember hearing that the definition of enlightenment was being able to see a tree as it is (or a mountain or whatever) without the confines of language. That kind of blew my mind:</p>

<p>In some ways, it is possible that language can make us fall further from God, or the ultimate truth, whatever you believe that is:</p>

<p>“Silence is the language of god, 
all else is poor translation.” 
― Jalaluddin Rumi</p>

<p>If you really want to influence people, though, you talk to them in a language they understand:</p>

<p>“If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.” 
― Nelson Mandela</p>

<p>That seems like a nice quote at first, but think about how celebrities or advertisers talk to their audiences. They appeal to what is in their hearts. For example, celebrities may promote slang that appeal to youth, or advertisers may promote misleading language to manipulate their audience.</p>

<p>The point is the power of language is limitless. However, if we do not want to be controlled by it, we need to recognize its power and limitations. In fact, that’s what teachers <em>should</em> be teaching their students (If they are or not is another conspiracy altogether).</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>As much power as language has, I feel it can limit us from spiritual experiences:</p>

<p>“It&#39;s embarrassingly plain how inadequate language is.” 
― Anthony Doerr, All the Light We Cannot See</p>

<p>There is probably so much that cannot be explained in language. 
However, I believe that it is my duty as a teacher to help my students reach their full potential with language, so that their understanding of the world can understand. If they cannot understand what the word “spirituality” means, then how can they really learn about it?</p>

<p>One can argue that the word spirituality could limit one’s spirituality altogether, but then it just starts to get crazier and crazier. The point is that I believe language opens our worlds and our minds. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, more and more are condemning language (or structures of it) as something evil. More and more promote learning and language itself as boring and useless. More and more condemn those who read for pleasure. </p>

<p>I will end with one more quote:</p>

<p>“A man with a scant vocabulary will almost certainly be a weak thinker. The richer and more copious one&#39;s vocabulary and the greater one&#39;s awareness of fine distinctions and subtle nuances of meaning, the more fertile and precise is likely to be one&#39;s thinking. Knowledge of things and knowledge of the words for them grow together. If you do not know the words, you can hardly know the thing.” </p>

<p>― Henry Hazlitt, Thinking as a Science</p>

<p>Your limits to language are the limits to your world. </p>

<p>PS: Literacy translates from language to language. If you become fluent in Spanish (your native language), it is 1,000 times easier to become fluent in another language. It&#39;s that simple!</p>

<p>This may not be related but I was we would all keep our currenr languages but form some hybrid language that we all speak.</p>

<p>A large reason people can see the US dropping bombs that kill people and not care is because they don&#39;t speak the same language. If that Syrian person was screaming in an interview &quot;please stop doing this!&quot; in perfect English they would have more empathy.

<p>Do we consider a certain language sounding intelligent and another language not sounding intelligent?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure many people consciously and subconsciously think of some languages as more intelligent as others.</p>

<p>But we seriously should all be able to speak the same language. This isn&#39;t me pushing some &quot;one world and one government&quot; shit because I want everyone to retain their current language and culture..but knowing what someone is saying would definitely help reduce propaganda and fake translations while also increasing empathy and understanding. </p>

<p>I think language is identity and culture. You take away someone&#39;s native language, in a way you take away their identity and culture.</p>

<p>More complicated subjects, like quantum physics, for example, cannot be “broken down” into simple language. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A disagreement with this statement. Physics can easily be broken down into simpler tongue but it&#39;s another aspect of keeping it out of the hands of common people. Astrophysics reports even direct whether data should be permitted among <em>learned</em> or <em>unlearend</em> readership.</p>

<p>Math is a language itself. It&#39;s used to express the concepts in physics, but the same expressions can be done in simple vocabulary. It appears, if anything, a willful effort to speak in babble for the masses when its translated. Either that or the simpler concepts are veiled even to those who think they understand the math.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Essentially the same question applies to language. The power of the trivium is well regarded in history and in years past was a cornerstone of learning. Many naturally excel in life without learning these methods <em>by the book</em> but have a natural ability to employ the principles found in the theoretical construct.</p>

<p>Essentially, society would benefit simply by acknowledging and teaching philosophical truths. If one applies most of classic philosophy to modern narratives they entirely fall apart. There is then no real barrier between the languages. The separation between the inclusive systems is obvious and the unwillingness to trade information apparent. </p>

<p>Unlikely the common person can live in that world, as fragility has become a popular method of being today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this long and thoughtful post. As a speaker of two languages (fluent in one) and a teacher of English abroad, I can certainly attest to the importance of language. It&#39;s the foundation of civilization.</p>

<p>I&#39;m lucky enough to spend my days equipping children with information that allows them to access a whole new world to them--the world of English; whether they use this information or not is out of my hands, but I can make the delivery as fun and interesting as possible. In this line of work I can truly, positively affect the future.</p>

<p>Learning a second language is one of my biggest accomplishments. It alters your way of thinking, changes your personality, your interface with the world. Shows you a you you&#39;ve never known before.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard that learning a third language can be easier depending on what the second language was, but never that learning a second language is 1,000 easier once you are fluent in your first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The question of transferability of literacy skills is in large measure related to how literacy is defined. The response is both affirmative and negative, and each will be considered in turn.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes&quot; Responses. Definitions which limit literacy to encoding/decoding skills and functional abilities generally involve rather low-level skills and are generally agreed to transfer. These include prereading skills of directionality, sequencing, ability to distinguish shapes and sounds, and knowledge that written symbols correspond to sounds and can be decoded in order and direction (Lessow-Hurley, 1990). Other skills include activation of semantic and syntactic knowledge; recognition of some rhetorical devices, and knowledge of text structure (Mace Matluck, 1982); learning to use cues to predict meaning (all languages are redundant) (Goodman, Goodman, &amp; Flores, 1979); awareness of the variety of purposes for reading and writing (such as directing behavior--STOP!; providing information--ingredients of a food product, or news stories: describing a process such as how to set an alarm clock, and so on) (Hudelson, 1987); strategies, such as experimenting, hypothesizing, creating, constructing meaning; and perhaps most important, confidence in oneself as a reader and writer-especially important when the L1 is viewed negatively in the society (as with many Spanish speaking children in the U.S.) (Hudelson, 1987).</p>

<p>Evidence for the transfer of these kinds of literacy skills is abundant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link.  I guess we simply have different definitions of &quot;fluency&quot;, especially when you look at the study linked which focuses only on reading/writing and the ability to &quot;decode&quot; literature.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I agree.  But we aren&#39;t talking about mere literacy, we are talking about &quot;fluency&quot;.  The study clearly states that it&#39;s discussing <em>&quot;literacy skills related to decoding tasks of reading and writing&quot;</em> and that <em>&quot;Part of the discrepancy among the illiteracy statistics cited is due to differences in definitions, which range from the ability to encode and decode written symbols to the ability to interpret events and experiences in a social and political context.&quot;</em></p>

<p>But the question I&#39;m asking is related to your initial statement:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you become fluent in Spanish (your native language), it is 1,000 times easier to become fluent in another language. It&#39;s that simple!</li>
</ul>

<p>You&#39;ve quantified how much easier it is to learn and become fluent in a second language (not merely be able to decode it).  Which even the study linked seems to focus on talking about functional literacy.  </p>

<p>I mean, you can just say you were exaggerating in order to drive home your point, because there is literally no evidence that it is &quot;1,000 times easier to become fluent in another language. It&#39;s that simple!&quot;  My point is that when this kind of hyperbole is part of the conclusion of something attempting to present itself as an academic look at something, it borders on paltering.</p>

<p>I could have went into a whole different direction with just that one statement.</p>

<p>My statement isn&#39;t wrong in a generalized way.</p>

<p>Like anything it should be explored and examined and broken down.</p>

<p>Since it wasn&#39;t the entire point of my post, I wasn&#39;t as concerned as sourcing it like the rest. In the future I&#39;ll be a little more tedious to source my claims.</p>

<p>“If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.” ― Nelson Mandela</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wonder how often we&#39;re manipulated using our own language against us? This is a two-edge sword. On the one hand it&#39;s great advice to convey information, and connect with people. I&#39;ve often used analogies of something ordinary to explain something technical to friends. </p>

<p>But on the other hand, in the wrong hands. (Like you said, it isn&#39;t inherently good or evil.) You could use it to basically be a sociopath.</p>

<p>I was homeschooled and raised by an English Major mother, who was no stranger to making sure I knew all the big words. Growing up, I thought it was difficult to socialize. I always attributed it to being a shy guy in general, on top of being homeschooled. But thinking about it further, there was so much &#39;jargon&#39; and colloquialisms from being a part of the system that I had to pick up on. The part about neutral words being sexualized really nailed it. I always found it ridiculous how teenagers could derive some sort of perverted humor from harmless words like that, and I am still baffled today.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t grow up with slang or the language of the public school system, and I learned English in a rather structured form, albeit I don&#39;t always have the best grammar, and I don&#39;t strive for it. </p>

<p>I used to think it was cool growing up, that I could participate, and understand adult conversations with the Adults my parents socialized with one minute, and then switch to socializing with friends my own age at the drop of the hat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing specific, just figured you might groove on the concept as an alternative to traditional grammar. Linguistics was my jam twenty-odd years ago; I&#39;m rusty and not immersed enough to engage in a meaningful way on the subject anymore. </p>

<p>The mathematical representation aspect is what piqued my interest at first. Seemed so much more inherently obvious than the traditional grammar I was (disjointedly) taught in high school. I think the following excerpt speaks to that distinction. </p>

<p>From the wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chomsky distinguished between grammars that achieve descriptive adequacy and those that go further and achieved explanatory adequacy. A descriptively adequate grammar for a particular language defines the (infinite) set of grammatical sentences in that language; that is, it describes the language in its entirety. A grammar that achieves explanatory adequacy has the additional property that it gives an insight into the underlying linguistic structures in the human mind; that is, it does not merely describe the grammar of a language, but makes predictions about how linguistic knowledge is mentally represented. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To quote from this article on the &#39;White Horse Dialogue&#39;: &quot;To use an attribute to show that attributes are not attributes is not as good as using a nonattribute to show that attributes are not attributes. To use a horse to show that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to show that a horse is not a horse, Heaven and earth are one attribute; the ten thousand things are one horse.&quot; The non-woman is argued to be a woman, thus ultimately undermining the social reality of woman as independent biological reproductive existent and force, a phenomenon which still anthropologically translates into the coherent and operable concepts and units of womanhood that have so facilely, in conjunction with empirical scientific advances, materialized into the world&#39;s present human population dynamics and numbers.
&quot;The ten thousand [transgender etiologies] are one [woman].&quot;
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_a_white_horse_is_not_a_horse">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_a_white_horse_is_not_a_horse</a>
The logical purpose of such illogicality would be natal population control wherever needed: control the logic, control the process, control the empirical outcomes. Traditionally defined biological women and men in their impoverished billions are thus rendered into an amorphous, pullulating blob or chaff called bare life, a human biological terra nullia; what Italian philosopher Agmamben has called &#39;Homo Sacer&#39;: the barest human life, the intrinsic organization (and therefore rights) of which is unrecognized and/or unperceived by the advancing liberal ethos of transgender and related non-empirically-based illusory &quot;rights.&quot; Such are the future ghost people who will inherent the lands of the biological ones presently treated or declared as ghosts, inexistents, etrangeres in their natal lands; the same logical legerdemain that argues that the Palestinian people do not and never have existed is operative in the declarations that &quot;the ten thousand things are one horse;&quot; &quot;the ten thousand foreign origins of Israeli Jews is one single origin that surmounts that of the non-existent autochthonous Palestinians;&quot; it is the logic that seeks to make biological women strangers to/within their own bodies and social spaces.</p>

I would like to hear your thoughts on the next evolution of language , I&#39;ve heard some type of visual - symbolic - hologram, or even what if we skipped language altogether and move to a john whyd ham &quot;chrysalids&quot; style thought forming process?</p>
