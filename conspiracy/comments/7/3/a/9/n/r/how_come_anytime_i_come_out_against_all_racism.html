       I don't get it; in my eyes people who choose mates or basically anything at all in life based off either race or advancement/loss of social class are equally as evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       women who only date black men are equally as racist as white supremacists who only date Asians, are equally as bad as people who marry only for social class or leave previous relationships to 'move up' in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       its all the same to me. the system is the problem, not race itself. social class is the deepest issue and the direct cause for racism in the modern world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know people don't like it because I tell them its wrong to leave someone because your higher status, its WRONG to indulge in hedonism (and if you want that, you should do hard drugs and say fuck it, its more pleasurable than sex and in the end, just as destructive to society in the long term, even if the effects on society aren't visible so quickly)
      </p>
      <p>
       why do people so vehemently protect the idea that their inherited familial social position is justly earned? why cant they accept they have 'survivors bias' and agree that there should be more competition in their own fields? and that social mobility should be a SINGLE INDIVIDUAL LIFETIME GOAL and NOT A MULTIGENERATIONAL ONE?
      </p>
      <p>
       sure, it would mean: lower paychecks, less prestige/power, harder to get a job in a traditionally closed-to-outsiders group.
      </p>
      <p>
       but those in specific are societies problems, NOT the solution.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love heroin -- but I know its bad so I turned away from it -- I know I will probably NEVER be happy again without it, but it was wrong so I stopped. period.
      </p>
      <p>
       I view relationships and life/business the same way. its a hard black/white with little grey area in between.
      </p>
      <p>
       what I am arguing is not that inter-race relations are bad, but that the sub-stereotypes and motivations for almost ALL relationships are inherently bad. the well has been poisoned, and the motive is rarely love for an individual and true loyalty, but all about social positioning and achieving independent political and economic goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       all this does is serve to preserve the nature of hierarchy -- even if feminists, for example took over and 'destroyed the patriarchy' all they would do is install a 'feminarchy' instead, which would be equally as vile and destructive.
      </p>
      <p>
       sure from their point of view, life would never be better, but for everyone else its the same old rat race bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to end the rat race entirely -- at least its artificial components. id like to reduce it to the 'law of the jungle' where true superiority and ingenuity always win, and nobody is able to protect wealth or power from a random outsider who is better than them coming in and destroying everything they worked so hard to create.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could argue what I'm arguing for is communism, but I don't think it is. I do believe in social Darwinism -- but ONLY in an absence of artificial constraints and regulations put on the individual human. Once you introduce those artificial constraints, it become decidedly 'Artificial Selection' where winners are chosen and hand selected by non-meritocratic methods.
      </p>
      <p>
       race is a weapon the upper-class wields over the lower class. it is not inherently the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       as long as our own genetics make it on to the next generation, we win, period. it doesn't matter what the kids look like so long as they are ours.
      </p>
      <p>
       and lack of social mobility inherently serves to increase the power people have in high social status to take whomever or whatever they want from anyone else, thus leading to spirals of self destruction in those individuals whom have everything they live for stolen and taken away from them by unfair means.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is by no means a problem spurred by racism, at its core, but as classism. although racism itself is equally as bad and just another form of classism really.
      </p>
      <p>
       if jobs were plentiful and education available equally to all races, nobody would care. if people would love each other for who they are and not what society says is fun, pleasurable, or fashionable, or profitable...
      </p>
      <p>
       there would be no issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       and above all, if certain social classes of people didn't dominate economics and politics, there would be no issue at all; at least not on this specific subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       people wouldn't care, it wouldn't be a 'race' to the finish,
      </p>
      <p>
       it still would be there to some extent, there would still be failures of all races, but if the game wasn't so badly rigged against us all at the lowest rungs, only an extreme minority would hold such views.

       I guess it doesn't matter that they do. I just don't know why other people don't see it the same way I do. I feel it would be beneficial for everyone if they did and wanted a true end to racism and classism,
      </p>

       and a true push for a truly classless society, or at least a society where class was only determined AFTER proof of meritocratic capability to perform such function.

       It's like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Every day, person A beats the everloving shit out of person B. One out of every 50 years, person B hits back a single time, before getting the shit beaten out of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are saying, "Person A should really stop beating the shit out of Person B" and you pop into the conversation to say, "Yeah but really they

       slavery could be seen as an issue of social class -- which is where it began.
      </p>
      <p>
       eventually racism got into slavery but only MUCH later in history. slaves were just as roman in rome.
      </p>
      <p>
       slaves were a class of people, and the fact that in America, they were only able to get black slavery legalized for a time, made it racist after the fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       black slavery accounts for a startlingly small portion of slavery in history actually -- it is first and foremost a social class issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       if the social class that took advantage of the slaves wasn't there to begin with, and everyone had equal social standing things would be a lot different.
      </p>
      <p>
       it wasn't a lot of people who even owned slaves, only the extreme high class could afford it, which in turn damaged the profitability of the enterprises of poor whites who couldn't compete just as much as unfair regulations today damage everyone of low social status.
      </p>
      <p>
       it was particularly brutal and wrong -- but when
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       was slavery better than that?
      </p>
      <p>
       my argument is that person A is being TOLD and INFLUENCED to beat person B. and that not only should BOTH of them stop hitting each other, they should be targeting person C and removing them from the equation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I argue that by resolving issues of social class, you resolve issues of racism between persons A and B, outside of limited cases of inherently stupid, violent angry people who are jealous.
      </p>
      <p>
       in such a world there would be no need for laws like affirmative action, because everyone had an equal shot regardless, and equal education availability up to that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       people could happily intermarry and do whatever so long as it didn't harm society and they were successful, nothing bad would happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       instead, after slavery all they did was unify the underclass and turn even whites into slaves with sharecropping. the north didn't really fully abolish slavery until years later as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       even early black freemen argued the importance of education and self worth to tackle racism, and focused on opportunity and economic equality, and political self-empowerment over racist hatred of one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue the same thing to abolitionists -- although I wouldn't state it like you did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say that slavery is a form of inherent classism, and without tackling that classism you can never truly defeat it without replacing it with something equally as vile.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue that empowering the former slaves and educating them and building an equal society where everyone at the bottom has a fair chance is the only way to eliminate racism entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       make it so its not a competition between groups anymore, so that the most people are happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       the only reason that gets to people is because it hits close to home and begins denying groups some of their own privileges. It means they aren't special, they weren't inherently successful, and often were in fact scumbags and traitors for achieving success via the methods they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       nobody likes that. its why the idea of wealth redistribution is so abhorrent in many people's eyes. wealth redistribution is a direct threat to society -- it threatens forcible change in ways that may not benefit the individuals doing very well right now.

       probably not. I come off as very antagonistic its true.

       I expect it to be the case because it seems absolutely obvious to me. I feel you'd have to be dumb not to see it.

       but I'm very immaterialist. when I discovered the world was not like me, I became disgusted by everyone and everything.

       to me, literally none of this matters, to me, since I was a small child, this has been my deepest dream. to give the disenfranchised complete power over the enfranchised and end their hierarchy in total, replacing it with a new one by any means necessary.

       since I was a kid I saw how this shit affects people, being incredibly intelligent and poor. I always hated people that became 'superior' to me with LESS natural talent, intelligence, skill and ability purely on the basis of financial advantage or race.
      </p>
      <p>
       its led me to some dark, suicidal/homicidal places in life, and even to dehumanize my opponents. I would have no problem throwing people into re-education or even death camps to absolutely enforce it among people whom were unwilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel people will NEVER be able to give up such advantage in life, will never willingly accept being outcompeted when they KNOW it would happen FOR A FACT if most of the 'weeding out' didn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       such people absolutely need to be removed. preferably not by force, but that may eventually be necessary if they are unwilling to compromise on their own benefits from society.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a world without social mobility, theft and murder become the only solutions in the short term. without tight knit, strongly religious communities compelling people to act outside of their direct interest, and HARSHLY enforcing things against their independent interest, there is little glue to hold people together.
      </p>
      <p>
       instead, what happens is those whom have a monopoly on economics and social power get what they want, and everyone else loses.
      </p>
      <p>
       it doesn't matter what color the faces in charge of such hierarchy are -- just that a non-meritocratic hierarchy exists to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       things like 'continuity of government' absolutely prove this.
      </p>
      <p>
       the power class is absolutely unwilling to lose power to someone else regardless of the who or why of it. even if they KNOW they are wrong they don't care, because they win.
      </p>
      <p>
       if everyone had equal access to the same levels of hedonism, there wouldn't be much issue. the problem is unequal access to resources and opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       and the only way to fix it is to rig the system so that EVERYONE is equally as fucked (i.e. you cant pay for college in cash more than one time after you fail, impose the same restrictions on paying customers as financial aid, few second chances, if your fucked, your FUCKED, even if your daddys a trillionaire and you have a trust fund enjoy the one way ticket to poverty!)
      </p>
      <p>
       or alternatively, expand the funding to equalize second chances, even if the rich have to entirely pay for it beyond their desire to. even if you have to have the military roll a tank to their property and start shelling it, or kick them out of the country and force people like bill gates to hand over huge companies like Microsoft to other people (and at the same time, break it up into smaller companies)
      </p>
      <p>
       the double standards in society have to stop. it is not ONLY genetics but a combination of genetics AND environment that create us as who we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       in a different world, we would be different people. and the goal should be to mitigate these issues as much as possible, so the best people always get the best jobs, regardless of who they are, or who got there first.
      </p>
      <p>
       most times, the people who got there first are long dead, and whatever superiority they had is gone in the new generation.

       I want to state firmly that just because I'm against classism does not mean I am against free enterprise or trade.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm merely against the methods and requirements to get into such free enterprise or trade, and the limitations placed on individuals of low social class, and inherently lower opportunity levels and second chances these groups get.
      </p>
      <p>
       if every trust fund baby who used drugs lost all their money, they would be just as bad off as poor drug users, and in my eyes that would be inherently just. because a lot of them do, but they get special second chances nobody else does because they can pay in cash and we cant.

       I speak from the position of someone who was a heavy drug user for years, btw, and ive witnessed trust fund baby addicts and shit because I was close friends with the middlemen/dealers. Ive been to college multiple times and seen/faced these challenges first hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive known criminals who were able to utilize wealth for the best of lawyers with the most connections in the area, and get away with (virtual, not literal) murder that if I had been caught for id be in prison for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       shit like dealing cocaine, and avoiding having their car impounded, avoiding legal consequence and getting off scott free because the paid the right person, whereas my poor town lawyer protected me a lot, but not at the same level.

       It absolutely is, and if you were to ask them if they were emphatic or know what empathy is, I guarantee you they'll see yes and point to their activism and defending of people they deem worthy of defending
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Empathy is the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from within the other person's frame of reference, i.e., the capacity to place oneself in another's position.

       Id also like to add, if you check my post history, most of my posts outside trolling are focused on harm reduction and trying to encourage people to quit, as well as seeking support for myself.

      <p>
       I want to help people who suffer and have problems man. that's what I'm after. and from my point of view social class and suffering is the main root cause of the opioid addiction crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       and other users and recovering addicts have agreed with me on some of the root causes of why and how it happened, and my basis that fixing issues of social opportunity and social class are the only long term solution to end or at least combat the problem and get people off for good.

       It's because you talk about ideals and vague problems without offering solutions. You also disregard the issues your desires for society offer and you disregard the smaller issues involved in your complaints. You belittle multiple struggles and throw them under other issues or appear to not notice them at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Easy example: You're pissed you would lose all your possessions if you get caught, but the rich guy does not. However, this rich guy is the child of a man who is friends with the area's DA, the judge, and most of the cops due to their past histories. You also justify this because the father of this boy worked to create these relationships in case his son ever got in trouble. He's able to beat the idea of "justice" by influencing those who could/would administer it.

       You ignore the idea that checks and balances are there because those who rise to power can allow their beliefs to affect their decisions, such as not hiring qualified workers based on race.
      </p>
      <p>
       You talk about ideals and ignore practicality. That's most likely the reason.

       Your entire opinion in this thread can be summed up as "If people weren't evil, the world would be better."

      <p>
       IMO, your statements disgust me because you ignore the fact that people can and do work together to get an advantage over others. You ignore what the world IS and talk about what you think it should be, as if it were so simple. You talk about the issues of the lower class as if it was entirely the lower class's fault. You talk about the advantages of the upper class as if the issue lies in a simple belief system.
      </p>
      <p>
       You discuss these issues ignoring the POWER of INFLUENCE and it's value. It doesn't matter if your product is better if I influence people to hate you. It doesn't matter if I do drugs if I befriend the DA and judges. It doesn't matter if I beat my wife if I keep her quiet.

       You're complaining about my shitty yard to me when my neighbor's 2 dogs keep shitting in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what you sound like, at least to me.

       I don't know you enough to tell you how to specifically deal with all your emotions and thoughts. I'd suggest finding something worth doing, then simply working your butt off for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's spreading your viewpoint without turning people away, I'd suggest studying more about it or about communicating with the public.
