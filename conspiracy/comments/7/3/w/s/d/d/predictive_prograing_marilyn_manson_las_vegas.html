<p>Hi i am not really into conspiracy like there is some truth but i am fascinated by the coincidences that people manage to find. </p>

<p>People told me about predictive programming involved with the Marilyn Manson concert incident and the Las Vegas shooting. They said the guns falling and crushing manson were predictive programming leading into the shooting (ik skeptical cuz although i am huge manson fan he isnt very popular and barely anybody under age of 21 cares about him.)  </p>

<p>Anyways he has a new album coming out &quot;Heaven Upside Down&quot; nothing out of the ordinary for manson. However, he has released 2 official singles from the album and the lyrics really struck me today as i was listening to them (i like hi music i listen everyday). Here are some very haunting lyrics i heard that were just too relevant to what happened to las vegas.  </p>

<p>From <a href="https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-we-know-where-you-fucking-live-lyrics">We Know Where You F***ing Live</a>  </p>

<p>He opens the song &quot;Lets make something clear/We are recording this as it happens&quot;. What struck me tho is later he ends the second verse &quot; <em>Time to just kill this fucking crowd/Scream as fucking loud</em> .&quot; And he ends the song repeating &quot;I love the sound of shells hitting the ground&quot; over and over. </p>

<p>Ok continuing to his 2nd single <a href="https://genius.com/Marilyn-manson-kill4me-lyrics">KILL4ME</a>  </p>

<p>I didnt think anything of this song until the pre-chorse which goes &quot;<em>Your hotel hall won&#39;t be so vacant</em> / and i can tell that you ain&#39;t faking/ because i take death threats/ like the best of them&quot;   </p>

<p>Thats all i gathered from these two songs. I want to say i dont think Manson personally is involved with any of what happened in Las Vegas but i will say that his album was originally scheduled to be released in February and was mysteriously postponed and he re-wrote many of the songs. Also its very coincidental to me that two huge guns fell on him as he was performing <em>at a concert</em> .  Just wanted to share with the conspiacy community. I love the theories they are really thought provoking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was very much a fan of Manson as a teen. He was a great guy with ambitous ideas but sadly drugs drugs drugs really took a toll on him. But really listening to his early works it all very much explains human behaviour to a T very insightful. Unfortunately his music is now just about women he dated pretty much on a level of Taylor Swift...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t find anything eerie about that. The lyrics are pretty vague and generic. Now if the song went...  </p>

<p><em>Out in Las Vegas on the 32nd floor<br/>
Got a death toll on my mind<br/>
Maybe fifty or more<br/>
No one saw it coming<br/>
No, not even my bro<br/>
Now everyone is running<br/>
Now I&#39;m the star of the show</em>  </p>

<p>...That would be eerie. </p>
