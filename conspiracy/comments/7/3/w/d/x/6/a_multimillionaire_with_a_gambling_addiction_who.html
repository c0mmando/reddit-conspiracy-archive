       I'd be interested in seeing a movie wherein a man brings an armory with him to a Vegas casino, but only decides to actually use those weapons after losing a large sum in the casino. I can see the opening of the movie now... "Well, here I go on my trip into Vegas where I plan on gambling on nothing else, but I better be sure to bring enough firearms for an entire squad just in case I want to go on a killing spree and one rifle isn't enough to satisfy me."

       There's a great theory to get legislation/etc. imposed to have metal detectors 1st installed at hotels which benefits xyz Casino Corp.

       </em>
       xyz metal detector corp pretty wildly.

       Then they merge and go onto to impose that all schools/hospitals/gov't buildings implement and so on and so forth.  I'm sure I'm not quite explaining it right, but whatever.

       How would a casino benefit from having metal detectors installed? And, if they would benefit, why wouldn't they have already done it without any legislation?
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand how the producers of metal detectors would benefit, but the casinos... I don't think so. People don't like metal detectors, scanners, and other stuff like that, and casinos don't want to annoy their guests.

       The casinos don’t benefit. The stockholders/owners of the detector manufacturers do though... .. the act of terrorism is about forcing legislator to legislate. Force the casinos to buy and hire and “train” new employees. Who cares about casino profits, right?

       The casino lobby is bigger with deeper pockets then the detector manufacturing lobby. Not sure this holds water it would piss off alot of well connected people. It wouldn't even be 100% garunteed that hotels would decide to put metal detectors in. They would have to get past Sheldon Adelson.

       Yeah but this would be creating a new company that is basically guaranteed large contracts from hospitals, schools, etc..

       If Sheldon Adelson were offered the opportunity to hold a large share of this new company do you think he would have a problem with putting metal detectors at his casino?

       Currently there is no implcation of any motive, and truth be told, there may never be enough evidence to proclaim a motive.

      <p>
       That IMO is the toughest pill to swallow for people in general.  If we dont get all the answers, we let our imagination run wild, and we get tons of conspiracy theories.  Sometimes they pan out, most often they do not.

       A spark was needed to re-ignite the gun control debate and now we have one. Not entirely dissimilar from how quickly that issue flared up right after Sandy Hook and that I expect to see plenty of coverage that will try to use this incident in the very same way.

       It was becoming easy to buy ammo again after years of Sandy Hook related shortages.  22 was impossible to find for
       <em>
        years

       .  It wasn't cheap, but after DJT was elected, it was becoming common to find it on the shelf again.  It certainly wasn't everywhere, but I could get it.

       I still haven't seen any video with a strobe light, but it's certainly possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's think this out. Let's say the guy has a brain on his shoulders.  He wants to create the most carnage possible. That means he has to fire for as
       <em>
        long
       </em>
       as possible without being interrupted. That means he needs to create confusion and keep the police busy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were unverified reports of gunshots at other casinos.  There were unverified reports of flashes of light from other floors in this same casino. There appear to be several times in the videos where he has to be teleporting back and forth between different firing positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say he calls in multiple false alarms from burner phones, saying that there are shooters at other hotels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's also say that he sets up strobe lights ahead of time.  They remain on during the incident.  You could do this at the end of hallways and stairwells with windows, or rent rooms on other floors if you had lots of money.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had two firing positions, you could set up some semi autos with drill motors and cranks. That would certainly explain why there are sounds of variable rates of fire and sometimes gaps of several minutes between fire. He's setting up the devices and loading them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also plausible that this is all bullshit and there was more than one shooter.

       The windows dont open on the Mandalay Bay. The only broken windows are the 2 from the same room on the 32nd floor. So you think the shooting actually came from somewhere else, then they fixed that window during all the shit and cameras on the building, and wanted people to think it came from the 32nd floor instead of the 4th for whatever reason?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they cover up where the shots came from lmao? "Lets do the shooting from the 4th floor, then immediately fix the window, then make it look like the shots came from 32 instead of 4 hahahaha, they'll never expect it"!

        Why would they cover up where the shots came from lmao? "Lets do the shooting from the 4th floor, then immediately fix the window, then make it look like the shots came from 32 instead of 4 hahahaha, they'll never expect it"!

       Light travels faster than sound.  You’ll see the shot a good second before you hear it.

       Mkultra is probably the sole reason of all of these shootings. Random acts of psychopathy or psychosis might account for some throughout history but for most cases, I'm enclined to believe it's all orchestrated and that these shooters are being mind controlled.

       Aurora is probably the most blatant. I feel so much pain for that guy. Just look at how out there he is in trial. Then his many failed suicide attempts while incarcerated. Him smearing feces on the walls of his cell. Just imagine the horror he must go through. Yes of course i feel bad for the victims too but in my mind, he is a victim aswell. Then there is the guy from columbine who spoke out about it only to be forcibly taken into psychiatric care, mkultrad, and came out a vegetable. Shocking footage exists showing him talking to Moore in the film in seemingly perfect health, then years later a complete vegetable not able to form sentences.

       Don't know anything about if the medicine was expensive or not. His name can easily be Googled, there's quite a big conspiracy theory regarding him. don't want to say it here out of respect for his privacy.

       You weren't supposed to. They were just whatabout-ing you to make your idea seem implausible when it's really not. "Oh so you think EVERY instance is like this? What about this instance that you probably never heard of?" As if pointing to a case of terrorism that isn't a false flag proves that false flag terrorism could never happen.

       You said "MK ULTRA is probably the sole reason for all of these shootings." The question is which ones are you referring to? Because there's a mass shooting every few months, and that's been true since the 80s, so there have been hundreds of them. Since MK ULTRA was shut down in '73, I'm particularly curious how the 16-year-old Clovis High School student who shot six people was influenced by it.

       So you think MK ULTRA still exists because it works, despite the documented facts that it was shut down years ago because it

       work?

       One of the whole reasons why "The line of revelations is crossed"
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the Bible even mentioned when these assholes would cross the line and despite wealth, they are trying to bargain with Satan by bringing as many consciousness or "souls" down to their dimension as they please a rule given by God himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       But God will not let mind control for malevolence pass, there are horrors that I can't even speak of that I know that his army is capable of, his army does not judge or decide the fate of an innocent but turn malevolent, you become their playthings in the duration of time itself, before you are handed over for judgement.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I can, I want to trade cards for some good people who chose the wrong fate, "Prisoner exchange" that sort of thing. It really depends on what the BFG up top decides to do, he is literally the ultimate morality of good, and understands evil to its core, and how it can lead to whatever the fuck you are seeing in the world right now. That's why he is to be respected at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, since aliens are basically war gods, we know what funny shit is going on down here and it is unacceptable. There are humans who have inner good spirit, despite turmoils and shits they went through they are still kind. And there are malevolent, 1000 year conscious spirits, give them riches, a good face, and they can manipulate everyone into becoming Satan's bitchs, out of fear that they will have to go back to their own dimension
      </p>
      <p>
       Wasn't Mars nuked for being assholes? Were the giants (bad ones) completely eradicated/genetically altered because aliens chose the evolution of non assholic species?

       Oh yeah, mandela effect, let me put it straight. Said people decided to look at life like paintings inside the temple of walls of antarctica, collectively, many powerful, people, with the control of the media to release similar content in the media reinforcing the fact that it's there. Next, we have those black walls, (i love the round thingeys) that are impermeable to radar, sonar, infrared, x ray, any electronic devices in general. Human consciousness is very unique and can exist at multi dimensions... Even with the observer effect we see that if it is not observed it is uncertain, but when observed it becomes absolute. So essentially, by solving very complex puzzles that require you to LOOK at ALOT of different points on earths histories and locations, it essentially timelocks everyone to the point of revelations. That big planet in the sky is a tank, for the fish they caught online.
      </p>
      <p>
       So essentially some time can be altered, great, some tiny miniscule events can be altered without the intervention of people I don't even want to mess with, because they will fix it ANY way they can, or try to protect themselves for the suffering of others, not my problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       My problem is that one motherfucker hiding under the surface of antarctica or wherever the bible said he was, he will come out and make you worship him and shit and you guys can do that fine, but all he is looking for is things to burn for his illusion in a hellish dimension which we created for sadist, psychopathic fucks. My job, is to break the machine, since the beginning of time itself despite my lack of knowledge of how much I may have caused since the beginning of time itself. That itself is a gift from God, but the spirit remains the same every fucking time, fack. I would like these machines or sadists to realize they are brooms with the handles replaced many many times, and somehow you stuffed a bit of humanity inside yourselves to feel like everyone else but you are really not. Out of 13.5 billion years you don't think advanced aliens know how to really work the machine until it explodes for the rest of time to create energy for the heaven for the people you made suffer? Your infliction of hell for 80 years or less is incomparable to the rest of time itself. Your are all just literal batteries. You are just a clockwork droid hellbent on making others suffer for the rest of time itself while someone has to make a big decision. What defines a species is how much value you place on a sentient life form, and think of revelations like chemotherapy, except the many cancers of this world are going to have a lot of a worse time based on the data we have gathered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a messenger, and possibly a future monster fighter but hey, what's the universe if you can't inflict ancient polar good and positive life experiences on as many sentient beings as you can, just do your best.
      </p>

       Think league of legends, there are champions and minions. By eliminating the other teams minions, you get rewarded with new equipment etc. But the real direction of the game is determined by the champions who exist on a completely different level. The minions, though if the champions get bored get attacked by their mana costing abilities but hey abilities look cool don't they? That's the whole reality everyone's in. Lovely isn't it?

       You should be afraid because someone went all the way back in time to fix this shit and to teach you all a fucking lesson that the value of sentient life is not what defines somebody, it defines an entire fucking species. Something no one will ever get because you are all encoded with a ridiculous amount of conditioning and reciprocal altruism.

       Has anyone ever attempted to tell you that your government is spending money to find the cure for mortality because they are scared of what comes next, and their understanding of dimensions and consciousness? Only the ones that truly understand this topic of discussion and reach for one goal, to destroy evil that exists within all of your species will be rewarded accordingly. At least you don't burn in a literal dimensional hell. To be honest, you are scaring me with your government indoctrination, and your lack of reasoning, bargaining or maybe its generations of conditioning that can change a species completely.

       I have not claimed anything about my beliefs. You on the other hand are making wild assumptions both about who i am as well as what's going on. You speak of things like you know them and, if you honestly do know "the truth", you do not make a compelling case as to why your views are the truth. You just keep shouting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will ask again: Even if you believe the diagnosis to be false, has anyone in you life ever suggested that you suffer from schizophrenia or some other mental illness?

       Your words are only as credible as you are. I'm willing to find the truth if you are willing to explain why you of all people know this truth.

       IMO with all the watching of the peasantry the Government does there is absolutely no realistic chance that people can plan this shit without the alphabet agencies catching wind.
      </p>
      <p>
       This leads me to conclude that either: aforementioned agencies are literally behind these events, or when people plan this shit they let it happen because it is advantageous to them. Probably both honestly.

       What about the Bath School massacre, was tha MKUltra? 40 schoolchildren killed in Michigan, plus some teachers, by a truck bomb, allegedly by a local politician frustrated by losing an election? Sounds like exactly the thing that would called a false flag here. If only it didn't happen in

       Look man, people are just awful sometimes, sometimes their brains are just broken, and sometimes they have dehumanized another group to a dangerous level because of some ideology, whatever the reason, and then sometimes some crazy shit happens, and a lot of people die needlessly.  No larger motives, no organization in control, no one benefiting, just people dead. It's a tragedy, but it's part of humanity.
      </p>

       It's a very strange picture on the whole but doesn't "official narrative" imply a fabrication of some kind? Things still need to be confirmed either way. Thus far the "alternative" narratives have been that the shooter was a different guy named Dealey obsessed with anti-Trump sentiments (leftist terrorist) or the motivation offered by ISIS (Muslim terrorist), each with nothing to back it up.

       My point is what is the point of this post...what other facts exist that the "official narrative" is ignoring? Does this sub exist solely to create perfectly contrarian viewpoints and never believe anything we are told?

       I would say false flag of some kind too but Paddock is a pretty shitty choice for a patsy it seems. A wealthy, apparently apolitical older man who used to work for Boeing? Wouldn't you utilize some down-and-out zealot?

       Theories are being built on the backs of pre-set agendas that look to find facts to support them, not facts leadings to theories, which is an absurd problem. And the outright creation of facts is happening too, basic fake news really. The "sources" of these so far? Far right Twitter and websites and literal ISIS.

       Every replay of something that happened before is a narrative.  Even if it is all truthful one narrative can focus on the five minutes a guy was checking out the skittles and then just suddenly end there and another gets into details about how he blew the brains out of the cashier.  Everything in life is a story.  This basic invalidity is probably the most common mistake made today.  It also leads to the slippery-slope counter-argument used to shut people down by saying that something implies something else (when by logic it does not unambiguously do so) and therefore another thing cannot be said because it leads to this other horrendous thing.  In the last months I've seen a hell of a lot of political arguments being put out that something equals something when logically it in fact does not.

       I agree with the bulk of what you've said. My issue is not with people speculating on messageboards or in the public sphere, it's political websites printing speculation as fact (Infowars is a huge offender, now and always, but what do we expect?) and rather obvious campaigns that aim to convince people of unconfirmed, clearly political things-- in which notions to the contrary are aggressively shot down, "you're just an MSM shill" and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreso I'm just always disturbed by the tone of the discourse among conspiracy-heads, people who seem to take sides and turn information-discovery into yet another team sport. Unavoidable in the wake of tragedy, I suppose, but we should be better.

       I don't think that it depends on who is saying it.  I propose that its difficult to know the exact mentality of another person and so it does not imply a fabrication since logically does not follow unambiguously.

       MK Ultra was junk science at best, outright criminal behaviour at worst. Feeding people hallucinogenics and exposing them to sensory deprivation and the like does not produce Jason Bournes and never did. The whole idea that there are Manchurian candidates running around as a result of the programme is just fiction.

       Yeah, I'm probably too old for this sub. I'm just nostalgic for the pre-internet days of the conspiracy theory, when people used to put a bit more effort into coming up with believable theories. (Not all, of course – who can forget Charles Berlitz's
       <em>
        Philadelphia Experiment

       ?) Now, it's just absence of evidence equals proof of coverup, and anonymous, referenceless posts are considered reliable sources.

       With particular respect to MKUltra (which I see come up a lot in conspiracy posts), I think a lot of people who talk about it are probably too young to even remember the Cold War and they just don't realise how basic and micky mouse a lot of the tech and thinking was.

       MKUltra was nearly 50 years ago...god only knows what they're doing now.  The CIA has already demonstrated that they didnt have a change of heart since then, so I think it's reasonable to believe worse things could be happening behind closed doors.

       Well, that's one viewpoint. The other is that the Cold War was a weird and wonderful time, when each side was deliberately trying to cause the other to waste time and money chasing pipedreams, while at the same time throwing piles of money at shonky research of their own. Since then, things have become more grounded in reality and constrained by stronger legal protections and financial oversight. There's simply no evidence that any successful Manchurian candidates were ever created, which is no surprise considering it's so much easier to fuck the mind up than programme it. I think the days of astral travelling and goat staring are well and truly gone, and intelligence agencies would rather spend their money on developing technology to assist trained agents to do their jobs than to try to create human killing automatons. Why waste money producing self-medicating PTSD sufferers when you could be investing in miniature insect-like drones that could theoretically be used to bug people or to deliver tiny doses of poisons?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, the diehard conspiracist has to believe in MKUltra so that they can lay the blame for random acts of violence like yersterdays at the feet of the "Deep State" instead of where they belong – at the feet of troubled individuals.

       Yes, there are stronger legal protections around now than there were in the days of MKUltra. They won't always be successful, but if people know they can be held personally liable for the things they do it can help to curtail some of the more egregious abuses. The various legal proceedings brought against Jon Yoo may well give future Attorney-Generals pause for thought.

       What Cold War was occurring during the medieval period? Is there any evidence that our leaders have improved?
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, there is parallels in the Clockwork Orange to cult deprogramming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brainwashing does occur, and if it can be proven that it occurs, it cannot be proven that a claimed victim of brainwashing is stating some objective truth.

       No, I'm not out of my mind, I just have not seen a single piece of credible research that it is possible to "program you into a killer". Given how mickey mouse and crude MkUltra was and how complex the brain is, the chances of getting a reliable assassin out of such shoddy work is zero. You subject someone to those conditions, you don't get Jason Bourne, you get unstable delusional individuals who you're not going to give important assignments to. Your own link notes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "dissociation is associated with decreased psychological functioning and adjustment. Other symptoms sometimes found along with dissociation in victims of traumatic abuse (often referred to as "sequelae to abuse") include anxiety, PTSD, low self-esteem, somatization, depression, chronic pain, interpersonal dysfunction, substance abuse, self-harm and suicidal ideation or actions.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If you really think the CIA is going to spend lost of time and money producing suicidal PTSD drug addicts and then send them out on critical assigments, then you're the one "out of your fucking mind".

       You don't think its possible to be programmed into a killer? What do you think the military does legally on a larger scale? ask any war vet with PTSD if its possible . The fact that the bourne series, manchurian candidate , fight club etc even exists proves its real.... Hollywood is a psyop in the first place.

       What, do you mean have I read the ravings of the MKUltra fanboys, those conspiracy theorists who like to imagine a world where the "Deep State" and the "elites" use programmed assassins to carry out false flags every second week in order to change public opinion on gun control instead of just hiring a PR company? The trouble with people like you is that you're so desperate to buy into all this hokum that it's blinded you to how gullible you really are.

       Have you ever been tortured physically, mentally, psychologically, or spiritually? Do you have experience with dissasociatives, hallucinogens, or neuroleptics? Have you ever been removed from society by radically minded people for months or years?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have/do and I have witnessed others experience the same thing. I just got lucky to escape with my mind mostly in tact. I know little of MK Ultra, but brainwashing I have significant experience with and properly executed it is creepy how effective it is. Don't doubt the government's ability to brainwash in entirety or the malleability of the human mind, thus the possibility that people can be controlled by programming done years ahead of the planned actions by the handler. Use your brain, I don't wish my experiences upon you, but if you'd been through what I have you'd see the feasibility of these theories.

       I agree with you wholeheartedly. You can definitely reprogram someones ego using psychedelics, language, torture, shock, and the like, fairly quickly. As I'm sure you know many people use techniques like this to reprogram their selves. I'm sure intelligence agencies are aware of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do however agree with jim653 in that there are no known cases of people who have been somehow influenced to be reprogrammed after a trigger at a later date a la Manchurian Candidate.

       I understand that there are no definitive or even good examples of a triggered action or changes in the mind following an event. I do believe that the US government, ISIS, the collegiate system/public school system, cults, black lives matter communes (they exist), therapeutic boarding schools, wilderness "therapy" programs, some therapists/psychiatrists/psychiatric hospitals, corporations, and even cultural shifts are deliberately designed with the intent to use brainwashing, repetitive phrases/actions, torture, drugs and rhythmic noises to involuntarily alter the way a person sees the world and thus change how they interact with it. As far as full blown personality changes, loss of memory, or engagement in extreme abnormal behavior due to to a trigger intentionally placed; that is something I do believe has been achieved, although not perfected to a science, and I've witnessed nearly "A Clockwork Orange" reactions to seemingly benign stimuli in peers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw girl on LSD receive a text from ex and turn into a violent sex fiend who tried to mount every guy she saw before suddenly attacking them, ultimately running away after literally tearing clothes off into 2 feet of snow naked; the police we called to help find her she assaulted in the same way and she remembered nothing when she awoke tied down to a hospital bed. Between her ex brainwashing her (long awful story) and being on LSD when he contacted her after being released from jail, it triggered a violent reaction that could be cost her, her life or someone else theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent 3 of the last 9 years living inpatient in private luxury highly acclaimed psychiatric hospitals where some people clearly exhibited abnormal reactions and personality shifts to seemingly benign stimuli in a countless number of cases. If my father uses a specific tone of voice my mind goes blank and I become suicidal immediately for a short amount of time usually hours or lesd, thus I avoid him given he doesn't take my experiences seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a friend, no longer will I speak to that devil, who always reeled people in and turned them against anyone but him unless he wanted access to your girlfriend, because friends "share", or your drug connections. I got 6 months sober once and when I came back from rehab he immediately got me the strongest cheapest pain pills I ever had so I'd need him again. I remember how he used pronouns like we, our, them, their, they're instead of individual pronouns like "I" to make you slowly become dependent on him and buy into his beliefs about others. I took shrooms once and he stayed sober, he said he wanted to take me to a secret special place, I went into deep woods and he began to try and basically tell me what I thought about our friendship and how important it was we stick together and not trust others. I ran out of there so fast.....

       I was in wilderness Mormon rehab where they break you and rebuild you and if you resist they punish you including physical punishments and deprivation of nutritional needs. You could not talk about anything but approved topics, no swearing, no saying the name of any religious deity, no talking about anyone who wasn't present, depression and mental health were said to be myth, suicide was an attempt to escape them not life or emotions, 100 miles from the nearest town there was no escape, they lied to your family about your past and made you write a list everything they saw as a sin as well as who you committed the sin with or against, drawing was prohibited, as was unapproved writing and they read everything you wrote, you always had to be in sight of staff, you had to yell the number they assigned you when you went to the bathroom every 5 seconds max so they knew you weren't running away, yes you were a nameless number out there, a guy got a kidney stone out there and they told us he was taking for 5 days before him briefly to hospital where they demanded he not receive painkillers the doctor said fuck you to those Mormon fucks and gave him fentanyl, there was a schizophrenic guy in our group who didn't understand where he was and definitely didn't understand their rules yet they held him 16 weeks because he might be faking to get released and he became a danger to everyone by the due to confusion and subsequent anger/violence, a guy locked himself in the case manager's truck somehow and was violently ripped out the window, held down by 3 staff and beaten while they held pressure points inflicting severe pain, they destroyed your relationships with family so that on phone calls your parents expected to hear the truth but were told it was all a lie ahead of time, my girlfriend at the time had supposedly (ultimately she was cured with experimental treatment) stage 3 terminal brain cancer and I was not allowed to communicate with her because we had engaged in sin/sex together, I was 20 at the time and Dr. Phil off the air recommended this place for me to get severe depression and anxiety help, they didn't believe in medication, let me tell you it fucked me up for years that place, and believe it or not they aren't one of the worst Utah programs for young adult or teenage mental health treatment. I've seen enough close up brainwashing and brainwashed people to know anything, and I mean anything, is possible given time and knowledge of the mind. Beware these people seem trustworthy until you've been drugged, your signature to accept treatment has forged and they've dragged you into the middle of nowhere with no way of knowing what was going happen over the next 6 months. I know how evil this world can be, lay low, hang to your spouse and pets, and if you have to kill before they take you, if someone wants change enough to pay them 100k they'll come for you illegally and once they have you, its a bad ride if you even survive, yes people out there.....

       Extreme abuse and torture can lead to dissociation, almost definitely. The issue with DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER is that that can only happen if the victim is under about 9, because any time after that the personality/identity of the person is stable, so you will only end up with someone dissociating, not splitting. DID does not make you easier to brainwash, provided the MK Ultra thing was true, they could brainwash without that person suffering DID. 
DID is pretty darn hard to live with. I find it difficult to believe that the government found children to do this to, and raise, and keep alive (suicidality, self harm and substance abuse are massssiiivvveeee issues for dissociates) long enough to send them to their deaths on a mission that would.... That's a fucking hard thing to convince someone to do, pretty sure there'd have to be a gun to your head in the first place. Not only that, getting a dissociate to do something like that... Stinks of bullshit to me. We're unstable, but we're largely not killers. 
However, like the whole brown brown thing with child soldiers, I suppose if you kept them fucked up on drugs, they'd be slightly more willing to do as you say. Ultimately, very undecided on this theory, but please leave dissociative identity disorder out of it.

       Thank you. In that case, it'd make a little more sense for him to be a dissociate because of his father, but then how would MK Ultra jump in on that? And also; why?

       I don't see how Ted Kaczynski can be used as some sort of proof of MKUltra; on the contrary, it shows just what a dangerous joke that sort of "research" was. How is it in the CIA's interests to create such uncontrollable fuck-ups? Kaczynski is about as far from Jason Bourne as you can get.

       The tests that Ted Kaczynski undertook while at Harvard were literally the impetus of MKUltra.

       You really think they ended that program? They learned from it and moved on to a new program.  They repeat this over and over and by now have super advanced tech and procedures and chemicals that can do things that we can't even imagine until we find out about it.  Now you can keep deluding yourself that the most powerful nation on the planet doesn't have stuff like this and well beyond but that's just you being too scared of what the implications are from this.  That's ok I guess.

       There's always the one conspiracist who has to trot out the old "you can't handle the truth" or "your cognitive dissonance prevents you from seeing that a government can do bad things" line.

       Of course they moved onto new programmes and new reasearch, because the mind-control stuff of MKUltra was always rubbish. But if you want to believe in the face of zero evidence that the US Government is controlling the minds of sleeper assassins just waiting to go out and murder scores of people so that a few more people think about gun control, then you're the one deluding yourself. You probably also think they've perfected an invisibility shield and Superman strength too.

       Even drugs known to public. Example:date rape drugs where you can command. They obey. Later they have no memory. This is not even CIA or conspiracy. But helps one to remember how easily plausible it is to have people under control. Common criminals do it. Higher level criminals are higher level because their crimes and evil machinations are even more sinister. You, being someone who doesn't dwell on evil everyday can think of pretty horrible stuff. There are people more evil and more smart than you. Now we see some possibilities, not too far fetched, especially considering cult practices already exposed.

       Imagine a world wherein you're a government worker and it is your job to identify someone for the CIA/FBI/etc. to manipulate into doing terrorism. What sort of person would make the best targeted individual in this case? Well, the plan would be to have him kill a lot of people with firearms, so what kind of person would you choose to target? Someone with no firearms and a history of violent crime? Or someone who owns many and has a clean record? I suppose you might choose someone with a criminal past if it didn't conflict with the narrative you were hoping to build, but I would think a clean record would be better so that the media can paint whatever intentions into the killer that they find useful.

       I see the theory as being some CIA/ deep state program fried his brain and this was the result. Not that they specifically engineered him to do this. More like it would just be an unfortunate side effect of some program gone wrong.

       I'm not, I'm just here to speculate. 😀Brain tumor would be plausible, but it doesn't explain the access to and training with fully auto weapons. Mental illness seems pretty unlikely because that doesn't just start randomly in a middle age man.

       Tumors can do weird shit, man. The brain is a delicate arrangement of nerves and fatty tissue. My ex had a genetic tumor disease and I've had a lot of experience and research into what would happen if tumors formed inside his brain, spinal cord etc. And it's not pretty. It can reduce impulse control, affect hormone production, and outright change personality e.g. someone who is kind to someone who is impatient, confused, or cruel

       The guy that shot up those people in the '60's in Austin from the clock tower had a brain tumor. Football players and wrestlers with CTE go on homicidal rampages. This is not only possible, but is the probable scenario that I'm leaning towards.

       When people panic and start becoming MOVING TARGETS, which I imagine happened pretty quickly, no I don't think I could hit 600 targets.   500+ wounded 60+ dead.

       I've been at large concerts such as this, and even with the urgency of an active shooter it would take a while for 22,000 people to disperse. (Especially in an area where the exits would have started bottlenecking pretty quickly.) Not too out of the question that he would have had a good amount of time in which he was firing at a dense group of people.

       I've been to two huge rock fests at this exact festival ground. It is not littered with exits by any means, and the ones that are there have multiple collapsing tables separating them into lines. With the chaos, lack of exits, and debris from the tables likely being turned over during the panic it's easy to believe that the crowd would have stayed tightly packed for a not-insignificant amount of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       To add to that, the festival ground is 770 feet x 560 feet of the "people allowed" area, with much of that also occupied by retail space or other barriers for restrooms and VIP areas. 22,000 people in less than 430,000 sq feet works out to around 19ft per person, but most of them are tightly packed in the area near the stage, and then would likely move as a group towards the a limited number of exits. While panicked, with injured/dead bodies littering the ground.

       Did you look at the ground? The area where people were attending the concert had lots of concrete below foot. Even one bouncing .223/5.56 round can travel trough a torso and still lodge or move through another torso, leg or arm. After a round ricochets it tends to tumble. A tumbling round tends to cause more flesh damage and more internal damage. A tumbling round may lose much of its velocity, but that also has a relation to distance after ricochets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of the stated round, at a 45 degree down-angle, the round can pass through a torso, bounce, then strike another person.
      </p>
      <p>
       With just this knowledge, it's not hard to understand that one individual can send 250+ rounds of ammunition down range and cause damage to more than 400 targets.

       Thank you - the speculation here is all based on really random bits of
       <em>
        factual

       information with no regard for understanding how the situation would have been on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trampling injuries and deaths are horrific,  but it would be bound to happen in a situation like this at any sort of bottleneck in an escape route. Even a path 10 feet wide can become a death trap when you try to force thousands of panicked people through it fearing for their lives. A single trip up can cause a pileup and the people behind the bottleneck sure as hell aren't going to wait for you to get up... they'll do anything they can to get away.

       With his firing position, his target, his weapons, and his method of employment, the kill count could have been much higher in a much shorter period of time. 500 yards isn’t that far, especially with such a large target area and his method of employment.

       The Marine Corps trains all Marines to hit a “B” Modified Target (black is the size of the average human torso and head, with an average shoulder width of 19” if my memory serves me correctly) with 10 rounds at 500 yards. When I first enlisted, we did it with iron sights, and later in my career we did it with an ACOG (4x, but not way to compensate for elevation or windage other than elevation and mill lines, respectively). To be fully honest, if you followed your training, hitting black at least 8-9 time’s out of 10 was NOT hard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now do that with ~23,000 “B” Modified Targets grouped tightly over a large area, from an elevated position, with an automatic weapon, or a weapon modified to shoot in an automatic fashion. It’s not hard to imagine how an untrained individual could hit a large number of “targets” in that scenario. The guy wasn’t trying to shoot a flea off an elephants ass from 500 yards.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m just expressing my point of view from my experience. I’m not saying I don’t have plenty of questions, but I find this part of the story very believable, even for somebody without a military background.

       Possible, not as likely. Like you said, a skinned knee would show up as an injured person in this incident. I would venture to guess that a considerable amount of injuries from this event could be directly attributed to the mass hysteria created within the crowd, such as trampling and what not. Not going to take a guess at percentages though.  Most injuries classified as “minor” I would likely attribute towards second and third order affects as opposed to gunshot wounds though.

       I've done the math above. Considering a fully open area with no stage, no retail, no security, no VIP areas etc, even the smallest adult in the group would have had less than an arm length on all four sides of them. With the grandstands, stage, retail, bathrooms, vip areas etc that's significantly reduced. And they're all going from a known location (crowded at the stage) to a known location (the limited number of exits not equipped to handle 22k people at once). Anyone that's ever been to, or even watched video of a concert (which I assume this guy would have) you know what is going to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the way this ground is laid out, there's not 10-15 exits like you'd have at a stadium or arena, there's like 2-3 in roughly the same place on the east side where literally everyone would be running.

       Here’s where we can have a little fun though. I’ve read a few rumors that this guy actually had a variant of the m240 medium machine gun, which I’m pretty familiar with. Fires a 7.62x51mm round. Older variants had an adjustable gas plug, which would allow you to adjust the rate of fire between 650-950 rounds per minute. Think about the amount of damage 600+ “.308” rounds could do in a minute? (That’s the actual rate of fire, but if you go full cyclic, you’ll overheat the barrel, warp it, and quickly cause a major malfunction). Realistically, you’re going to have a 200 round belt, and with controlled bursts (sustained or rapid bursts), and could eat through that belt in about a minute or two?
      </p>
      <p>
       Max range: just over 3,700 meters
Max effective range with a T&amp;E: 1,800 meters (probably didn’t have a T&amp;E)
      </p>
      <p>
       On bipods, on a table, with sandbags or some kind of support to control the recoil, I would say you could easily have an effective range of 800-1,000 meters for a trained machine gunner.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy isn’t a trained machine gunner though. But, like I said previously, he has a very “target rich” environment with a lot of targets over a large area, his lanes of fire can be as indiscriminate as he pleases, has “ideal” enfilade fire... you could put a trained individual behind that weapon in that scenario and easily have over 200-300 killed, or you could just as easily put a 13 year old girl behind the trigger firing indiscriminately and still have 20+ killed.

       We had ELCAN m145s forced upon us, which is a magnified optic made specially for light and medium machine guns. Opinions between myself and my friends on the practicality of said optic was unfavorable. Having a magnified optic was nice in theory, and was good for observation, but by default, machine guns are meant to be area target and suppressive fire weapons. The most basic “burst of fire” is a 6-8 round burst while firing a “sustained rate of fire.” When the firing pin hits that first round, you no longer have a perfect “picture-sight alignment”... that’s not what machine guns are made for, and it’s not what we are trained to do.

       A soldier is trained and practices to use their weapon with drills and repetition. I don't see a civilian being able to pull off this type of training on their own just for time reasons alone. He would have to had a lot of range time over the last 6 months.

       Yes, ricochets are very plausible, and just as dangerous. The guy that posted that comment seems to have a pretty good grasp on the dynamics of ballistics. Tumbling rounds, even at a slower velocity, are very capable of creating a lot of damage to soft tissue.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of the venue grounds looked to be like it was Grass and dirt, in which case, at the trajectory the gunmen was firing, majority of the rounds would bury themselves into the dirt. But there was a lot of concrete, barricades, and other hard surfaces that a round could ricochet or fragment off of. Fragments wouldn’t necessarily cause a whole lot of damage in my opinion, but ricochets could.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never fully realized how often ricochets occurred until we did a live fire exercise at a training area on the Big island of Hawaii. Granted, the impact zone consisted of almost nothing but lava rock, so the likelihood of a ricochet was pretty likely, but it seemed like almost every tracer that went downrange hit the ground and then immediately shot up in some sort of strange trajectory. Some continuing in forward manner, some going straight up, some coming back towards us at an upward angle. Many would take an awkward, unpredictable spiraling action. What really tickled my brain was when I sat back and thought that the belts we were using were a 4+1 round to tracer mix, so for every tracer I could visually see, there were another 4 rounds flying around out there somewhere that I couldn’t see. Hop on YouTube and search something along the lines of “machine gun tracers” and I’m sure you’ll find some pretty neat videos that would enthuse Star Wars fans... but then think, there are 4 more rounds between each tracer round that you can’t even see.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve been a bit long winded tonight, and keeping with that spirit, I will also touch on another dynamic of “ricochets.” That being the belief that the gunman could’ve been using an AR with a bump-fire mechanism of something of the like. If it were an AR-15 variant, firing a 5.56mm round, there’s the likelihood of a different type of ricochet. Although it might not be as prevalent in this situation, it’s pretty interesting. The 5.56 round is relatively small, interchangeable with the .223 round (just not the other way around if my memory serves me correctly, chamber pressure?). It is a high velocity round though. It has a tendency to tumble once it hits soft tissue, dramatically slowing its velocity, and it’s been known to “ricochet” off of a bone within a person’s body. Plenty of stories out there regarding this size of round entering a person’s body and exiting in a place that doesn’t quite make sense.

       I’ve said elsewhere that scopes on machine guns only goes as far as the first round of an indivisible burst. Doesn’t matter if you’re on a tripod or not, you’re not keeping perfect sight picture, sight alignment through the duration of a controlled burst. Considering the size of his target area though, that doesn’t really matter. It would almost seem like a big cone of fire could benefit him just as much as a tight cone of fire considering his target.
      </p>
      <p>
       A tripod in and of itself is not going to control recoil or gun movement. The tripod would need to be firmly emplaced in some sort of ground or material that could soak up some of the energy, such as sandbags, or dirt, a coffee table from a hotel room isn’t going to do the trick. This guy obviously put a good amount of planning into it though, so if he legitimately had a tripod, I wouldn’t be surprised if he had some sandbags or something similar to give the tripods a good foundation. Guy would also need good shoulder placement and pressure, but if he went did the aforementioned steps, I guess that wouldn’t be far outside the realms of possibility?
      </p>
      <p>
       Considering the range and size of the target though, the scopes were unnecessary.

       Well assuming it was a full auto m4/m16 or bumpfire ar15, which barely have recoil anyway.. a standing tripod is quite heavy and would definitely reduce gun movement alot.

       I could fully see that and would agree with you. Would be entirely sufficient enough for this scenario and equally as damaging.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of an actual tripod, I could fully see him using that setup but with the “weight bags,” “shooting rest bags” (or whatever you want to call those things) on top of a common table found within a hotel room.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, a “scope” via the media could mean many different things. I automatically think of a magnified piece of glass, but I suppose mainstream media would considering a holographic sight the same thing.

       One thing these "amateurs" seem to miraculously pull off having weapons that don't seem to misfire or jam. And/or they seem to clear them with proficiency. But clearing a weapon although relatively simply must practiced to do it effectively in the real world under combat conditions. Could this be why so many weapons? One jams he just picks up another where as a soldier will clear his single weapon.

       Light and medium machine guns can be fired both from the attached bipods, or from tripods (platform as you describe it), the latter being more controllable and accurate. By sound alone, you wouldn’t be able to tell which method he used to employ the weapons.
      </p>

       In regards to two weapons firing at the same time, until proven otherwise, I’m not going to believe it. I’m going to believe it was a sole gunman, and the “sounds of two separate weapons” firing at the same time I will rebuttal with “echoes off of other high rises within the area.”

       I was thinking some sort of setup to get him killed. Do you think that would happen? At least in movies, there are plenty of times where someone is killed, and made to look like he one victim killed the other, while another walks away unnoticed. I feel like this doesnt get questioned right away and they just instantly solve the case.

       The brother he hadn't communicated with in 6months and even then it was a some short text? They didn't talk at all from the way he made it sound doubtful the brother would know exactly what he had been up to.

       Possible scenario, a guy in unrecoverable debt gets offered a deal - play the patsy, debts forgiven with additional lifetime payoff, enter a "witness protection" program, and never be heard from again.

       You know, I wonder if those crisis actor ads are some kind of signaling device. It lets people lower down in the hierarchy know that something's coming up without giving them a specific date (for security purposes).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if a patsy were to be "disappeared", it makes sense to make sure their significant other is out of the picture when things go down.
      </p>
      <p>
       And also, I'm betting the guy's suicide was by "high powered gunshot to the head". Makes faking a positive ID on the shooter that much easier.

       It's already been proven he went to a bunch of radical leftist protests:

       I'm sorry, but that seems too convenient. You could very well be right, but your evaluation is much to cut and dry for me. Gonna take a lot longer than 24 hours and a bunch of inconsistent and unverifiable media nonsense to draw some credible conclusions about this one.

       Wow Streisand effect! Imgur might have some kind of image sensing algo to take down sensitive media.

       Anyway this guy was confirmed to have been at several radical leftist protests. And he was confirmed to have been travelling in Dubai. Apparently also local police were already aware of this guy because they keep track of radical Muslims and this guy had made some comments or something.

      <p>
       The answer is right in front of you! Why are you denying the least complicated theory?

       The ad wasn't for "crisis actors". The ad they're talking about was a post by Crowds on Demand. It's a known, established business that hires people to create crowds on demand. Many people here think the actors they're attempting to hire may have been used in other cities where similar Crowds on Demand posts were discovered prior to multiple different crises. Your attempt at discrediting the idea by bringing up 4chan is irrelevant, Crowds on Demand is a real business that really hires "actors" from craigslist and there really was a posting up for Las Vegas a little over a month ago. That's not the same thing a troll from 4chan making an ad looking for "crisis actors".

       Definitely a possibility. Although I do have this personal imagining that all these conspiratorial operations actually utilize positive rather than negative motivators. There's less chance of creating enemies and better results in compliance and mission performance.

       I was at a bar last night with people on their phone reading their phones and saying there was two shooters maybe it was fear, addraneline, paranoia going on to spread misinformation. I don't know, I wish I did because I like being correct. But there is no "being correct" with conspiracy theories. This seems weird because as it was happening I was drinking at a bar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what I "know". The shooter doesn't fit the profile of spree killers. The shooting took place when most of the nation was asleep. There was panic and confusion which leads to misinformation. The killer was already dead when the police got to him. I will only look at this and wonder, "what the hell actually happened?".
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also a sub where you have a pedophile who claims "love is love" and people believing that there is a huge network of high powered pedophiles looking out for each other and covering up for each other or blocking investigations. This is a sub where people who believe the biblical apocalypse is in the works. I don't buy the latter, but I do believe some conspiracy theories have a grain of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's weird that gun nuts the nation over were paranoid that Obama was going to violate their second ammendment rights and the current regime seems to be have the precedent to do exactly what Obama seemed to have no intention of doing.

       Alternate theory (disclaimer, no data whatsoever to back this up, purely imaginative):
      </p>
      <p>
       The accountant job and high stakes gambler persona were cover for his real job as a highly paid assassin. Someone wanted him dead and this was the coverup on the hit.

       Yes, it would be. A definite flaw in the theory. Sort of debunks it, as they say. Descriptions of him make him sound like a perfect hit man though. Ah well.

       <p>
        "Public records show Paddock owned two planes and was a licensed pilot."
       </p>
       <p>
        "Donald Judy, who was his next-door neighbor in Florida until two years ago, said the inside of Paddock’s home “looked like a college freshman lived there.” There was no art on the walls and no car in the driveway. Just a dining chair, a bed and two recliners. Paddock was constantly on the move, carrying a suitcase and driving a rental car whenever he stayed at the community near Cocoa Beach.
       </p>
       <p>
        “It looked like he’d be ready to move at a moment’s notice,” Judy said.
       </p>
       <p>
        "Judy said he never flashed his wealth, often wearing khaki cotton pants, with a polo or other collared shirt, and never driving anything nicer than a standard rental car."
       </p>
       <p>
        “He was weird. Kept to himself,” said McKay, 79. “It was like living next to nothing. . . . You can at least be grumpy, something. He was just nothing, quiet.”
       </p>
       <p>
        "The couple kept their blinds closed, but sometimes Paddock would open the garage door, revealing an enormous safe the size of a refrigerator."

       Yes. But CIA doesn't make the kind of money he had. Over 2 million net worth? According to another article he had not held a regular "job" for 30 years... accountant at LM.

       My theory: at one point this guy cut a deal with someone who will greatly benefit from this shooting (maybe the Corp anon John on 4chan was implying).
      </p>
      <p>
       The deal is, like in the movies, was that he will live a dream super rich life with all he desires until he reaches age 64. Then he will pay his debt and execute this horrific attack.

       He's obviously a career criminal and inherited the psychopathy gene from his father. "Accountant"? The only accounting I bet he did was washing his dirty money into clean money through his extravagant gambling. The family knew what he was up to, that's why they're being so weird. I bet there was foreshadowing that he'd do something bad, but nothing to this extent.

       100 year anniversary of the October revolution...shot up a country music festival. Brother acting strange when he said no political motive, appears to be left wing himself. Definitely hiding what he knew of his brothers beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       reports of antifa literature everywhere in his hotel room, also reported to be a recent convert to Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       all points to this guy being a commie loser who converted to Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the next step if you didn't know. They don't use black and red flags for nothing. Communism and Islam will be merged in the coming revolutions, and the hammer is going to hit hardest in Europe. It's a natural fit for these people, and Islam will offer some relief from the pure degeneracy of leftism. they'll merge their hardcore communist beliefs of smashing western European civilization with the tenets of Islam and the radicalism of Islam. It'll be the cool thing to do for these kids, and any white who converts will get a pass in the coming purge.

       I'm half way though the Kimmel vid...I'm 100% convinced now he's a patsy chosen for his total normalcy.  Vegas is Kimmel's home town and with the medical stuff he's talked about in the past, WITH congressional Democrats help, I'm convinced it was chosen for that reason, to give him more skin in the game.

       Oh so you understand reality? Tell me why, humans keep fucking people over no matter what their real intentions are.

       You should be afraid because someone went all the way back in time to fix this shit and to teach you all a fucking lesson that the value of sentient life is not what defines somebody, it defines an entire fucking species. Something no one will ever get because you are all encoded with a ridiculous amount of conditioning and reciprocal altruism.
