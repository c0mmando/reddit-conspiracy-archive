       Officially he is still the "alleged" shooter
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I have my doubts. Paddock himself could have also been a victim, after all police entered his room almost an hour after the shooting began, only to find Paddock dead already to an apparent suicide.

       How does this prove that he shot the guns though? Occams Razor says you're right, but there's still the possibility that he was killed and left there for LEO to find

       What kind of evidence would satisfy you?  They say he was in the room with all the rifles, already dead from apparent suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they say his finger prints are all over the rifles and he has gunpowder residue from firing, would that do it or would that be assumed to be false since it would come from MSM?

       This is going to be important. Vegas has metric shit ton of cameras and he had been checked in since Thursday. If the public is not shown video footage of his movements after the investigation is over, that will be a pretty big indicator that something is up.

       I seem to recall two separate rooms with windows blown out. What's the significance of the second room, if he only used one? Trying to piece all this together just like everyone else. I think the only true conclusive evidence would be video camera footage, if available. I've never been to Vegas, but it would seem every floor would have multiple cameras filming every inch of the hallways, considering the amount of money won/lost in these hotel/casinos.

       Most modern guns can be broken down and rebuilt in minutes.
I think for an AR15 there's a couple push pins and it just dissembles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Barrels can almost always be removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       For shotguns there's often a screw cap at the end of the tube, once that's unscrewed the barrel just comes right out.

       Source? I heard 10-12. Regardless, this is getting
       <em>
        expensive

       . Even assuming he was using a bump stock and not automatic weapons, this is getting up into ten's of thousands of dollars worth of weapons and ammunition (assuming he had "thousands of rounds")

       Wtf! That's insane. I didn't know there were so many guns involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       He could have them broken down and then just kept refilling a suitcase and taking parts up? But what the hell. One person can't really use more than 2 long guns at a time.

      <p>
       Seems like 2 rifles would be just as dangerous and less crazy. But then again, dude was probably crazy.

       Most rifles can't be disassembled with just a few clicks and a shot gun would have done nothing from that range. An AR-15 is not an automatic weapon. Too much media and too many movies

       I really only added the bit about a shotgun for pure education. I'm sure a slug would still be lethal at that range, but it's not worth speculating really.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I only said the AR can be disassembled 'with just a few clicks'. (I said a couple push pins which for any AR I've handled is true)
      </p>
      <p>
       Most require tools, and it's not very hard to sneak hand tools in a bag.. so it's safe to say he brought the guns in pieces and uses tools to reassemble them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have read that he was using a bump stock which we know makes it easy to shoot fast. If he had that much $$ and guns it's also possible he had trigger modifications as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also pretty easy to convert an AR to full auto though. But from the videos I would guess a semi automatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will ask though, I didn't say anything about full automatic in my comment so I'm curious where you got that from..?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like you were trying to make it out like I knew nothing about guns and only know from 'hollywood' and to show I'm wrong, without really reading what I had said.
      </p>
      <p>
       But naw I'm one of those people that get bothered when people in movies shoot guns and there's no slide action! That happens all to often. 
That or the revolver that never runs out of ammo..

       I would like to see footage of the 32nd floor hallway from before the shooting started. Did someone/people gain entrance into his room? He was a frequent gambler, maybe he just so happened to be the person staying in the room the shooter/s needed to carry out attack. If he brought up all those weapons, in cases or broken down, he would have had a ton more luggage brought up than a few day trip would require. He being dead in the suite is simply not enough to convince me.

       Most require tools, and it's not very hard to sneak hand tools in a bag.. so it's safe to say he brought the guns in pieces and uses tools to reassemble them.

       I have read that he was using a bump stock which we know makes it easy to shoot fast. If he had that much $$ and guns it's also possible he had trigger modifications as well.

       It's also pretty easy to convert an AR to full auto though. But from the videos I would guess a semi automatic.

       I will ask though, I didn't say anything about full automatic in my comment so I'm curious where you got that from..?

       It seems like you were trying to make it out like I knew nothing about guns and only know from 'hollywood' and to show I'm wrong, without really reading what I had said.

       But naw I'm one of those people that get bothered when people in movies shoot guns and there's no slide action! That happens all to often. 
That or the revolver that never runs out of ammo..
