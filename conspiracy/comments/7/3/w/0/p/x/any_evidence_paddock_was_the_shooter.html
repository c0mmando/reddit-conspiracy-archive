<p>Two rifles mounted on tripods instead of moving one to the other window..? More than 19 guns and only two had scopes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really only added the bit about a shotgun for pure education. I&#39;m sure a slug would still be lethal at that range, but it&#39;s not worth speculating really.</p>

<p>Also I only said the AR can be disassembled &#39;with just a few clicks&#39;. (I said a couple push pins which for any AR I&#39;ve handled is true)</p>

<p>Most require tools, and it&#39;s not very hard to sneak hand tools in a bag.. so it&#39;s safe to say he brought the guns in pieces and uses tools to reassemble them.</p>

<p>I have read that he was using a bump stock which we know makes it easy to shoot fast. If he had that much $$ and guns it&#39;s also possible he had trigger modifications as well. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also pretty easy to convert an AR to full auto though. But from the videos I would guess a semi automatic.</p>

<p>I will ask though, I didn&#39;t say anything about full automatic in my comment so I&#39;m curious where you got that from..?</p>

<p>It seems like you were trying to make it out like I knew nothing about guns and only know from &#39;hollywood&#39; and to show I&#39;m wrong, without really reading what I had said.</p>

<p>But naw I&#39;m one of those people that get bothered when people in movies shoot guns and there&#39;s no slide action! That happens all to often. 
That or the revolver that never runs out of ammo..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would like to see footage of the 32nd floor hallway from before the shooting started. Did someone/people gain entrance into his room? He was a frequent gambler, maybe he just so happened to be the person staying in the room the shooter/s needed to carry out attack. If he brought up all those weapons, in cases or broken down, he would have had a ton more luggage brought up than a few day trip would require. He being dead in the suite is simply not enough to convince me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand it&#39;s likely he wasn&#39;t using automatic weapons but was probably using bump stocks since the rate of fire seems to vary wildly which an automatic weapon wouldn&#39;t do</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really only added the bit about a shotgun for pure education. I&#39;m sure a slug would still be lethal at that range, but it&#39;s not worth speculating really.</p>

<p>Also I only said the AR can be disassembled &#39;with just a few clicks&#39;. (I said a couple push pins which for any AR I&#39;ve handled is true)</p>

<p>Most require tools, and it&#39;s not very hard to sneak hand tools in a bag.. so it&#39;s safe to say he brought the guns in pieces and uses tools to reassemble them.</p>

<p>I have read that he was using a bump stock which we know makes it easy to shoot fast. If he had that much $$ and guns it&#39;s also possible he had trigger modifications as well. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also pretty easy to convert an AR to full auto though. But from the videos I would guess a semi automatic.</p>

<p>I will ask though, I didn&#39;t say anything about full automatic in my comment so I&#39;m curious where you got that from..?</p>

<p>It seems like you were trying to make it out like I knew nothing about guns and only know from &#39;hollywood&#39; and to show I&#39;m wrong, without really reading what I had said.</p>

<p>But naw I&#39;m one of those people that get bothered when people in movies shoot guns and there&#39;s no slide action! That happens all to often. 
That or the revolver that never runs out of ammo..</p>
