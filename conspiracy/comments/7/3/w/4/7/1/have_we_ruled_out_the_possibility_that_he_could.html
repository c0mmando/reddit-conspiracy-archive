       I'm in the same boat as you. I feel kind of crazy for suggesting it but it could've been done so easily by almost anybody.  I highly doubt there was only one shooter and I highly doubt he was a shooter at all. From someone that's been watching this story develop from multiple platforms since 2:30am EST...

       Yes I was up all night as well keeping updated in real time. It was all too obvious at the time that there were multiple shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also what would the need be to shoot out more than one window in the same suite? The vantage points are essentially the same from way up there. 30 feet over from that high up doesn't make that much of a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       AND on the police scanner last night they apprehended multiple suspects. What of that?

       It would seem like much more work to shoot out a window than just replace a magazine, or just grab another one of your 19 GUNS laying next to you and keep shooting out the same window.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a tactical standpoint it doesn't make much sense to blow out another window. You'd just stay low and keep shooting out the same window.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also why the need for 19 guns if you're only going to set up 2 shooting stations and run back and forth between the two?
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as other reasons for thinking there were multiple shooters, there is a mound of circumstantial evidence pointing to multiple shooters. what about this guy screams lone wolf gunman to you, just the fact that he was the only one found dead in the hotel room? So far we have no motive and he's dead. He can't tell us his side of the story because we don't know.

       There were reports on the police scanner last night of a shootout on the 32nd floor where they identified two shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       They made 2 additional arrests last night (via police scanner) of two suspects. One at a motel 6 and one in a random "lot" that they requested a tactical team for backup.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lack of media reporting (you could almost call it a blackout) during the event leads me to believe that today they're still in the dark about most of the events that actually occurred. There's more than this just keep searching.

       Yes I will try. In the mean time though search for police scanner recordings from last night and don't be afraid to question what the media is saying. I downloaded the CNN app last night because I thought it would be able to tell me something I didn't already know, but it was SO FAR BEHIND on reporting what was happening in real time. Literally when there were reports of 100s injured and 20+ dead last night the media had only been reporting 2 dead and 24 injured for hours because that's what one hospital had been reporting. I have gotten all of my information from police scanners and first hand videos and information from people actually there.

       The chatter on the police scanners confirmed two shooters. Also 2 more suspected shooters. Also suspected car bomb in another casino. Multiple witnesses heard shots from different directions.
      </p>

       Really, there's more evidence for multiple shooters then the lone wolf narrative.

       I agree with this. Having 19 guns for 1 guy doesn't sound very practical. Why would he risk it? The likelihood of getting caught prior to the act is insanely high with that size of arsenal. Wouldn't it have been easier to take one or two guns and a bag full of loaded magazines?

       He’s running from window to window with his old ass 74 year old body? In the dark since obviously you can’t see inside the room. And he’s never owned a gun or had mil service? Yeah sure.

       This was my first thought when they found him dead. And then all the background not checking up just reiterates this further.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the scanner audio, there apparently were 2 gunmen, the police had no CCTV over the 32nd floor (don't know if it was later established). They had a shootout in the hallway of the 32nd floor where an officer was shot. No visual description of the shooter.

       I actually (second degree of separation) know someone who has counseled children of MK Ultra recruits and Satanic Ritual Abusers. Supposedly they were targeted by recruiters because they practiced SRA and the govt knew if they had no problem harming their own children then they would have no problem killing other people.

       theres cults all around rural america and canada right now that have abused children for generations. basically  born into a family that abuses you and the higher members all have connections with government, im sure this goes on all across the world too not just north america........ but yea also they can just kidnap random children and train them to be killers through trauma induced programming

       could have been dead already.  some military trained Gunman shoots into crowd, makes it look sloppy.  police wait for the signal and breach the room.  Our fallguy is dead on the floor and the cops claim he shot himself.  you only need the cops who "discover" his room to be in on it.  MY question is what rifles did he have and what kinds of bullets?  Doesnt it make more sense to bring one or two backups to your main weapon and a shit load of ammo?  Why have 10 rifles? did they all use the same ammo? did he have ammo for all of them?
This is certainly fishy.

       Janet airlines are a classified government airline that runs between McCarren and Area 51 and other top secret sites. Mandalay Bay happens to overlook the tarmac due east or about 45 degrees off the line of sight to the concert. I have no specific theory, but the proximity is eerie.

       I was just thinking this.  "He" fires 3 clips out the window, it takes the cops 90 minutes to figure out where he is, and when they get there he's dead.  Dozens of guns (which, how many were actually used?  Certainly only a few, right?  If just 3 bursts of fire...), Anyway - dozens of guns, and a corpse, with no particular motive at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we
       <em>
        assume
       </em>
       he was the shooter because he was the one dead in the hotel room with all the guns? Reeks to high heaven if you ask me.

       There may be a lot of ways to prove this but the lack of motive is a huge issue in develop a case and reason this guy supposedly did this. He's a multi-millionaire with everything to lose. The likelihood that he "snapped" seems very low to me considering this was a very planned out attack.
