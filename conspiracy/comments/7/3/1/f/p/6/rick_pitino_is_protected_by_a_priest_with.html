       Rick Pitino is a great example of someone insulated by the Catholic Church regardless of what they do. The priest Pitino is associated with and the parish that priest pastored have connections to sexual abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rick Pitino is close friends with Father Ed Bradley. Pitino has spoken about Bradley in interviews.
       <a href="http://www.startribune.com/rick-pitino-on-minnesota-struggles-i-asked-father-bradley-to-say-mass/361425011/">
        "I'm living and dying right now,” the elder Pitino said on his weekly radio show. “I asked Father Bradley to say mass...for my son."
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://archive.courierpress.com/news/farewell-father-holy-names-bradley-is-leaving-here-to-serve-as-school-chaplain-in-owensboro-ep-44567-324904961.html/">
        Bradley's friendship with Pitino goes back to the time Bradley was a monk and teacher in New York, and the relationship has grown through the priest's chaplaincy of the UK and U of L basketball teams.
       </a>
       . After moving to Louisville,
       <a href="http://www.masslive.com/sports/2009/08/report_louisville_coach_rick_p.html">
        Pitino often brought Bradley on team trips. Bradley often prayed with the team before games and was a fixture near the Louisville bench
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.masslive.com/sports/2009/08/report_louisville_coach_rick_p.html">
        In 2011, Pitino told police he had been drinking in a Louisville restaurant and had consensual sex with Karen Sypher in August 2003. The police report said the 56-year-old coach denied allegations by Sypher that he raped her after the restaurant closed and at another time somewhere else. He said he later gave her $3,000 for an abortion.
       </a>
       . Pitino's close ties with clergy were not affected. Actually, Bradley drives a car allegedly given to him by Pitino, though you won't find that in the news.
      </p>

       <a href="http://archive.courierpress.com/news/farewell-father-holy-names-bradley-is-leaving-here-to-serve-as-school-chaplain-in-owensboro-ep-44567-324904961.html/">
        Bradley came to Henderson, Kentucky, in 1995 to serve as parish priest of the Holy Name of Jesus Catholic Church. Bradley's journey took him, in 2002, to Vatican City, where he studied and taught for months at the Pontifical North American College in Vatican City. While there, he celebrated mass in the private chapel of Pope John Paul.

        In 2005, Ralph Patterson of Henderson was a 47-year-old associate pastor at Holy Name Catholic Church in Henderson was arrested in a sex sting in Newburgh, Indiana.

        Two years after the scandal, Bradley was named Henderson's Distinguished Citizen of the Year by the Henderson Chamber of Commerce in 2007.

        The director of the Henderson County Chamber of Commerce at that time was George Warren

       <a href="http://www.cityofhendersonky.org/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/463">

       Before Bradley arrived in Henderson,
       <a href="http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1993/Priest-Sues-Church-Over-Alleged-Sexual-Abuse-by-Priests/id-681cd8417ae3e4d656cd69ff0c4d9325">
        Rev. Gary R. Hayes, also a pastor in Henderson, Ky., and claimed he was abused by a priest in his childhood, and filed suit in 1993. The lawsuit charged that the priests ''conspired to create a sex ring of children'' who could be sexually abused. The alleged abuse spanned seven years and occurred in parishes in New Jersey and Rhode Island.
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://owensborodiocese.org/_documents/diocesan_directory/2009_Directory.pdf">
        Gary Hayes was ordained in 1990.
       </a>
       . Two years after Hayes brought suit against the Catholic Church, Bradley was moved to Henderson. I can't find record of where Hayes was pastor, but the Henderson, Kentucky, Parish has only one church, Holy Name of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ed Bradley, confidant of Rick Pitino, was moved to a parish with a priest who alleged sexual abuse only to have a scandal involving his own pulpit. Further, Pitino has been involved in sex scandals, but he continues to travel with a priest.

       Now that you've called in backup?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is literally a series of cut-and-pasted-together articles which you tenuously try to string together in some kind of coherent way.  You fail to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       The woman you say accused Pitino of rape appears to have been indicted for extortion instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       You make a big 'oo-Catholic-Church-is-boogeyman" type title to lure people in and then create patchwork of copy and pasted articles to make it look like you did research to support what is essentially a nothingburger.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have literally even SWITCH CHARACTERS half-way through this flimsy write up:  from 'Rick Pitino" to some guy named Bradly to some guy names Ralph Patterson; ALL SEPARATE PEOPLE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you switch stories YET AGAIN to some guy named George Warren who is completely unrelated to any of the charges and is not under suspicion of any misbehavior whatsoever.  Other than by this slanderous and calumnious post.
      </p>
      <p>
       You literally jump from idea to idea, story to story, schizophrenia-style in a failed attempt to connect any of this to the Church.

       Pitino has had a ton of rumors of mafia and Mossad connections swirl about him in the Commonwealth of Kentucky over the years.  Later business connections from his university employee of several key figures of the Bluegrass Conspiracy who were likely CIA or in the employ of Alan Hyde's cocaine smuggling ring which was essentially the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is interesting that the FBI has inadvertently blown his cover and job without yet filing a charge against him.
