Where&#39;s the truth? Our system is not working but the can keeps getting kicked further and further with no end in sight. Pick a side, you pick a side, and you pick a side and now there&#39;s even more division between us when we can&#39;t see the real division is us vs &quot;them&quot;. </p>

<p>Where are the Robin Hoods of the internet? White-hat hackers are some of the only people that could make a huge impact on society over night, but nothing...we get nothing when they could wipe debt out in a second. Where are our heroes? Where&#39;s someone I can truly say look at them, now they are leading the charge for a better world. We have none... </p>

<p>Ancient Knowledge is being hidden from us in underground warehouses stock full of it. We the people demand access to this knowledge! But will we ever get the chance? Could we storm the Smithsonian or the Vatican and take it for ourselves? There&#39;s more of us than them.</p>

<p>The world is a stage, and we are all being entertained. The elites and deep state pulling the strings of the political faces to bring us more crap toasted crap! I&#39;m fucking tired of being lied too every single day, especially since WE know there&#39;s more to this than their telling us...</p>

<p>Where and when do we ACTUALLY begin...</p>

<p>Become a member of the committee for which ever party runs your town or city to help pick who becomes judges and local officials that actually effect your life</p>

<p>If you care about child sex issues get involved with public advocacy groups that actually help people- social work groups and charity’s, volunteer and make sure they do their jobs </p>

<p>You know? Actual stuff</p>

<p>And if you REALLY care about child issues maybe become a fucking social worker and do some work on the issue instead of posting on Reddit </p>

<p>They&#39;re watching us, all of us. They&#39;re trying to consolidate the surveillance state all over the world. Our only hope is to locally practice the &quot;Scorched Earth method&quot;</p>

<p>Sun Tzu taught this </p>

<p>The Russians used it to repel invasions from both Napoleon and Hitler, the modern worlds two greatest conquerors. </p>

<p>We gotta burn this baby to the ground. But in a way that isn&#39;t the way they&#39;re doing it..</p>

<p>I know that sounds dumb but.. we can&#39;t just sit around reading. We have to shake people in the streets and beg them to see the evidence. Reference their children. Threaten them, idk what people will do, but it will get ugly no matter what. </p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to get caught up in the negativity, to feel a little hopeless at times; spread positivity instead. Behave impeccably, even toward your enemies, so that they are not alarmed. Show people that we are not so different from each other; exhibit behavior that contradicts the false dichotomies presented to us in the MSM. And most importantly:  <a href="https://youtu.be/hSIQTHVqMas">Don&#39;t let the man get you down.</a></p>

<p>Change is actually the one constant factor, its just not the type of change you and i want to see.</p>

<p>Instead of getting more and more frustrated, angry and depressed (been there, done that) we must reflect on ourselves; what changes are we able to make? what little control do we have on our own lives? how can we expand control of our &quot;own&quot; lives? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the same advice I give out. </p>

<p>Real change starts at home- the way we treat our families, how we educate our kids, how we conduct our lives. Live to a high moral standard. Fill your life with others who do the same. Gain independence from the big systems where you can-  avoid unnecessary debts, buy locally from people in your town, start to grow some of your own food, take full advantage of whatever academic alternatives are available for your kids, avoid lifestyle diseases and their associated drugs, learn to fix things yourself. Be prepared to take care of your family for a few weeks in case of emergency. </p>

<p>It&#39;s too easy to fall into hopelessness with these huge societal problems bearing down on us. Don&#39;t let the problems you can&#39;t control, rob you of your ability to control the things you can! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Things don&#39;t usually have an obvious beginning and end. Most of the time, it is only when we look back at history, that we decide when things began and ended.</p>

<p>This along time ago, and has been repeating the same strategies that have been proven to work.</p>

<p>Things are now coming to some kind of head now, but people have been pushing it from both sides the whole time. The more pressure, the more people will start to stand up and make a difference.</p>

<p>Us humans are animals, and the way we work in groups makes our animal tendencies even more obvious. This can be a horror, like with riots. Yet the mob mentality can also work for the good. Churches used to be a place to rally around as a mob, and do good works.</p>

<p>The big question now, is who&#39;s leading us and where are we going? Divide and conquer, and cognitive dissonance are being used against us very well, but people are still waking up. When we truly rise as one, it will be amazing. For now we need to focus on not getting pulled into their game, and to lead with love, never hate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because the concept we have of revolution is a violent one. We&#39;ve gotten that concept from media and education controlled by the same people that we would revolt against. Our entire social system is built around such revolution being almost impossible. We have it placed in our heads that that&#39;s how we have to go about this, it&#39;s set up for us to fail. Violent revolution sounds sexy because it&#39;s been sold to us as the sexy solution to our &#39;elites problem&#39;, and it&#39;s been sold to us by those same elites because that way they can predict how it&#39;ll go down, and have taken the steps to ensure it doesn&#39;t depose them. Light, love, being nice to one another, and getting rid of this me-vs-you attitude is how we have to go about this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the same advice I give out. </p>

<p>Real change starts at home- the way we treat our families, how we educate our kids, how we conduct our lives. Live to a high moral standard. Fill your life with others who do the same. Gain independence from the big systems where you can-  avoid unnecessary debts, buy locally from people in your town, start to grow some of your own food, take full advantage of whatever academic alternatives are available for your kids, avoid lifestyle diseases and their associated drugs, learn to fix things yourself. Be prepared to take care of your family for a few weeks in case of emergency. </p>

<p>It&#39;s too easy to fall into hopelessness with these huge societal problems bearing down on us. Don&#39;t let the problems you can&#39;t control, rob you of your ability to control the things you can! </p>
