       Sounds like you should visit a doctor and get checked for schizophrenia before deciding it is anything else.

       I'm not saying that's the case but elimination would be advisable.

       That's not what this is. I've had numerous psyc evaluations. It's not auditory hallucinations. It's actual people, like when you speak to customer service reps over the phone you can tell what the persons is by their accent, for example, black, Indian, Latino, etc. I have people in my head that speak my parents native language. They helped me become bilingual.  I now fluently speak Albanian. I know it's hard to believe, but the illuminati exists.

       Thanks for the link, the technology is possible. I'm living proof. Ams these people are not satanic in my head. Some are Christian, and all the other major religions. Most, if not all the science people are atheists, and I like to debate with them why science is atheist. They should be non-religious because you can't prove if there is or isn't a creator.

       No, they can't enter anyone's brains they want. If they could, I guarantee, they would be doing it to everyone.

       Yes, their job is to read anyone's mind they want. They have no boarders, they are everywhere. You can't tell they are in your head, unless the people who they answer to tell them to announce themselves.

       Granted, it is part an agenda to control what people do and how people think. But, that different from actually reading people's mind--besides, that is accomplished most effectively via body language and the ability to read micro expressions in relation to specific kinds of stimuli.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short, if you were to go live in a cabin for a month--completely off grid--and exercise both your brain and body everyday in a disciplined manner [using any combination of methods you want], I promise you would regain control over your own body sans-voices.

       You don't know the half of it.  I'm actually part of the secret society that has taken over your body.  If you want to know what we're actually doing in here, get yourself a .pdf copy of the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion.  From there, you'll see, it's Zionist, all the way down.

       See a doctor. Not because I believe you're "crazy" or anything but a good one will be the biggest ally you can have. If you do end up needing mental health care they'll be able to point you in the right direction or provide it themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you're given a clean bill, what better advocate is there for what's going? Bringing in an objective evaluation from someone with enough knowledge to rule out the other possibilities leaves only one left.

       The shrooms will let your mind confront the voices on a different level, they are finally starting to do/release information about research on Psilocybin. Magic Mushrooms are one of the many things that help man kind become what it is today. It opens your mind to a different prospective if used correctly. Im not very good at describeing it but look up some viedos on youtube, im on mobile and cant link any atm.

       Iv never experienced a bad trip myself but I have helped people through them. A few of the times the next trip when they where having bad feelings (the iffy) we will set up a super chill area and talked about his previous bad trip. One friend ended up seeing what his bad trip was trying to tell him by talking about it with a close friend. Being on the mushrooms while talking about it made a massive difference, his addiction was to alcohol. And he has been alcohol free since. From what iv noticed through my psychedelic adventures is most trips have some sort of underlying message that is placed there by the subconscious mind, if you find it or not is up to you.

       I don't like to toot my own horn, but I have a certain way about myself that everyone likes. (The IT factor, is how the spies want me to word it.) And it's not a front, remember these people in my brain refer to themselves as spies. The get to learn your ins and outs.  When you behave a certain way in public, and the same way in private and you have whatever it is they are looking for. And it takes Luck.

       You think this sub is populated by Trump supporters, and you don't "identify", therefore you think you'd make a joke/troll. Fair enough.

       <em>

       don't have the level to be doing it here. Don't beat yourself up, see the humiliation as a positive learning experience, and try again in a few years.

       Thanks for the link, the technology is possible. I'm living proof. Ams these people are not satanic in my head. Some are Christian, and all the other major religions. Most, if not all the science people are atheists, and I like to debate with them why science is atheist. They should be non-religious because you can't prove if there is or isn't a creator.
