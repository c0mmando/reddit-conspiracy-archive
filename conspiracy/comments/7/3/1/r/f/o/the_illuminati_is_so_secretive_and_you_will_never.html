It&#39;s actual people, like when you speak to customer service reps over the phone you can tell what the persons is by their accent, for example, black, Indian, Latino, etc. I have people in my head that speak my parents native language. They helped me become bilingual.  I now fluently speak Albanian. I know it&#39;s hard to believe, but the illuminati exists. </p>

Most, if not all the science people are atheists, and I like to debate with them why science is atheist. They should be non-religious because you can&#39;t prove if there is or isn&#39;t a creator. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Granted, it is part an agenda to control what people do and how people think. But, that different from actually reading people&#39;s mind--besides, that is accomplished most effectively via body language and the ability to read micro expressions in relation to specific kinds of stimuli.</p>

<p>Long story short, if you were to go live in a cabin for a month--completely off grid--and exercise both your brain and body everyday in a disciplined manner [using any combination of methods you want], I promise you would regain control over your own body sans-voices. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Iv never experienced a bad trip myself but I have helped people through them. A few of the times the next trip when they where having bad feelings (the iffy) we will set up a super chill area and talked about his previous bad trip. One friend ended up seeing what his bad trip was trying to tell him by talking about it with a close friend. Being on the mushrooms while talking about it made a massive difference, his addiction was to alcohol. And he has been alcohol free since. From what iv noticed through my psychedelic adventures is most trips have some sort of underlying message that is placed there by the subconscious mind, if you find it or not is up to you.</p>

<p>Pro-life tip: when trolling in the future, use another account, not one you&#39;ve already relied on to post other lame jokes.</p>

<p>Also try to make it funny. This is plain stupid. I&#39;m afraid you might not have the intelligence required for this.</p>

<p>You think this sub is populated by Trump supporters, and you don&#39;t &quot;identify&quot;, therefore you think you&#39;d make a joke/troll. Fair enough.</p>

<p>But again, this takes a certain level of intelligence and discernment. If you don&#39;t have what it takes for r/PoliticalHumor, you <em>certainly</em> don&#39;t have the level to be doing it here. Don&#39;t beat yourself up, see the humiliation as a positive learning experience, and try again in a few years.</p>

<p>In the mean time, can I offer you a coloring book? Or perhaps suggest you try Facebook? You might be highly successful at those activities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your first paragraph is all speculations. Not true. And..</p>

<p>I&#39;m going through the worst years of my life right now, and you have the nerve to insult me. The spies say probably 00.1% of the population will go through something this extreme. Don&#39;t expect most common people to believe you. I&#39;ll just take the high rode and let you insult me last, you bully, you. Haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link, the technology is possible. I&#39;m living proof. Ams these people are not satanic in my head. Some are Christian, and all the other major religions. Most, if not all the science people are atheists, and I like to debate with them why science is atheist. They should be non-religious because you can&#39;t prove if there is or isn&#39;t a creator. </p>
