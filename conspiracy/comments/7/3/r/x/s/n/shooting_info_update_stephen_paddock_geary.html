      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On October 1st, 2017, a mass shooting occurred where her companion,
        <strong>
         Stephen Craig Paddock
        </strong>
        opened fired on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay toward a concert happening across the street. Entering his room, Police
        <a href="https://news.am/eng/news/413077.html">
         found him dead from suicide
        </a>
        .  Las Vegas Sheriff says Stephen used a window-breaking tool to
        <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/mandalay-bay-hotel-room-windows-stephen-paddock-las-vegas/">
         break the windows out
        </a>
        of the corner-suite first before shooting.  They were alerted to his room by a smoke alarm that had gone off because of all of the gun smoke.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to a young woman who was celebrating her 21st birthday, about 25 minutes before the shooting began,
        <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanMcKinnell/status/914755192444272640">
         she claims to have heard a woman who was yelling that everyone at the concert was going to die
        </a>
        and was later escorted outside of the concert. The woman has been alleged to have been Marilou, however they are reported to not be the same woman as
        <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/861232/las-vegas-shooting-mandalay-bay-marilou-danley-strip-dead-gunman-suspect">
         Marilou is reported to have been out of the country at the time
        </a>
        and according to Police is no longer a person of interest.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the shooting took place,
        <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4940594/Gunman-companion-Marilou-Danley-detained.html">
         she was apprehended, detained and their home raided
        </a>
        .

       Look that's just political hitjob shit because of his politics.  It was her roomate that she lived with, not her husband.  Geezus fuck guy.  Stephen was registered sex offender too.  He's dead now, Geary is not.

       police already released her name as person of interest.  the problem is that people are falsely saying it's her husband because it was easy to find a bunch of his social media being pretty liberal.  but the actual shooter was her roomate/companion that she lived with, stephen.

       "that is who she was warning the people at the concert about."
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you explain how she was warning anyone at a concert when the police detained her and confirmed that she was outside of the US during the entire incident, thus clearing her of charges? You seem to be talking about someone completely different.

       Does anybody understand the living situation? Is it a love triangle gone bad?
-Marilou is still married to Geary (who sources say is politically liberal, which caused 4chan to push that he was the shooter)
-but she lives with/ is companion of Paddock (who sources say is right wing, is a sex offender, whose photo looks younger than 60)
-she warns people about something about to happen: did she know of a plan or did she know paddock was unhinged and had weapons after (possibly) a lover's quarrel/breakup between them?
- just trying to figure this out, sources are suing she's married to one and rooming with/companion of the other, like it's super common.

       Id seen them here but it was around the same time that some were posting incorrect pics and info on Geary being the shooter - and the pic of Paddock was either wrong or way out of date, and both things have already been changed or deleted where I saw them.
Things are updating so fast, I'm just trying to catch up and rationalize living situation and motive, sorry!

       Kill her, kill her husband or some other lover, maybe, or even himself, but to plan and carry out the murder of whole slew of ordinary people simply going to a country and western concert? Hardly something any jilted lover would do or we'd all be in some pretty serious trouble all of the time.

       Where, if you look @ 4 seconds, very carefully, in the upper-left, you see what might appear to be muzzle-flashes for the shots, which seem to be coming more from a 4th floor location rather than 32nd floor.  There was a lot of scanner activity mentioning 4th floor suspect as I listened to this live.

       Does the release of information concerning the shooter and his roommate not seem just a little bit
