<p>Geary is Marilou&#39;s husband, but Marilou lived with roomate Stephen.  Geary was not involved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On October 1st, 2017, a mass shooting occurred where her companion, <strong>Stephen Craig Paddock</strong> opened fired on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay toward a concert happening across the street. Entering his room, Police <a href="https://news.am/eng/news/413077.html">found him dead from suicide</a>.  Las Vegas Sheriff says Stephen used a window-breaking tool to <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/mandalay-bay-hotel-room-windows-stephen-paddock-las-vegas/">break the windows out</a> of the corner-suite first before shooting.  They were alerted to his room by a smoke alarm that had gone off because of all of the gun smoke.</p>

<p>According to a young woman who was celebrating her 21st birthday, about 25 minutes before the shooting began, <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanMcKinnell/status/914755192444272640">she claims to have heard a woman who was yelling that everyone at the concert was going to die</a> and was later escorted outside of the concert. The woman has been alleged to have been Marilou, however they are reported to not be the same woman as <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/861232/las-vegas-shooting-mandalay-bay-marilou-danley-strip-dead-gunman-suspect">Marilou is reported to have been out of the country at the time</a> and according to Police is no longer a person of interest.</p>

<p>After the shooting took place, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4940594/Gunman-companion-Marilou-Danley-detained.html">she was apprehended, detained and their home raided</a>.</p>

<p>Can you explain how she was warning anyone at a concert when the police detained her and confirmed that she was outside of the US during the entire incident, thus clearing her of charges? You seem to be talking about someone completely different.</p>

<p>&quot;According to the Independent, the Las Vegas gunman has been indentified by police as Stephen Paddock, a &#39;64-year-old white male&#39;. A manhunt is underway for a &#39;person of interest&#39;, believed to be his roommate, identified as Marilou Danley.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anybody understand the living situation? Is it a love triangle gone bad?
-Marilou is still married to Geary (who sources say is politically liberal, which caused 4chan to push that he was the shooter)
-but she lives with/ is companion of Paddock (who sources say is right wing, is a sex offender, whose photo looks younger than 60)
-she warns people about something about to happen: did she know of a plan or did she know paddock was unhinged and had weapons after (possibly) a lover&#39;s quarrel/breakup between them?
- just trying to figure this out, sources are suing she&#39;s married to one and rooming with/companion of the other, like it&#39;s super common. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does the release of information concerning the shooter and his roommate not seem just a little bit <em>too fast</em> and <em>too detailed</em> from the way it more usually is with the cops taking more like three or four days or longer to start naming names and giving out any background information until they know they&#39;ve covered all the bases? </p>

<p>Do you think they have the names of all of the dead and wounded or the scene from the shooters location fully and forensically examined before pretty much declaring this an &quot;open and shut&quot; case?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wasn&#39;t the room charged on Danley&#39;s credit card according to the initial reports? Isn&#39;t that why they were looking for her before the tie-in with her actually being the woman that warned the concert goers they were all going to die? Wasn&#39;t she the one that rented it? Would they have rented the room to him with her credit card? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This started from this video: <a href="https://v.redd.it/bu0hdm8iidpz">https://v.redd.it/bu0hdm8iidpz</a>  Where, if you look @ 4 seconds, very carefully, in the upper-left, you see what might appear to be muzzle-flashes for the shots, which seem to be coming more from a 4th floor location rather than 32nd floor.  There was a lot of scanner activity mentioning 4th floor suspect as I listened to this live.  </p>
