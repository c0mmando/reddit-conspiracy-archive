       Niether of those points are evidence. The supposed crisis actor Craigslist ad is a completely standard kind of ad that could be found in any major city. Very commonly used to fill seats in award shows or boost crowd numbers at protests. Also, do you really think a top-of-the-line government conspiracy would hire Craigslist randoms at $20/hr to pretend to get shot at?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your second "evidence" was that the police requested witnesses not post positional info on social media. This is standard for any terror attack and is very important. There could very well be someone communicating with the attackers giving strategic advice found on Twitter/Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being this quick to jump on the false flag bandwagon delegitimizes you.

       My thoughts as well.  Granted, of course, it could also be some sort of Mossad/U.S. b.s. similar to the "Taliban id cards that were found on the scene of the 911 terrorist attack, so let's go after them!", so who knows what's going on actually.

       OK... That's really ominous...
I wonder if it was a random crazy person or if she actually had prior knowledge? Why would someone who knew in advance want to be in such a dangerous place though? I hope that this gets figured out.

       Well..
      </p>
      <p>
       First off..False flag doesn't mean no deaths.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second..there probably wasn't many deaths and certainly not just one crazy shooter as there were reports all up and down the vegas strip of shots fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are concerns I have that anybody it's real though:
      </p>
      <p>
       The gut standing there saying the bullets are fake..and spreading his arms wide screaming shoot me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The local hospitals being filmed and no one bleeding
      </p>
      <p>
       People being seen before the event telling everyone about the shooting that's about to happen
      </p>
      <p>
       More bad acting on the media
      </p>
      <p>
       No blood in the streets
      </p>
      <p>
       Dubious Facebook accounts being used as proof of these so called normal suspects
      </p>
      <p>
       Multiple cell phone footage of people laughing and saying it's fake
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus I just flat out do not believe media in anyvway. Matter of fact..things like this are so blatant you have to prove to me it's real

       It's about Gun Control.  If there's enough of these, the people will agree to all sorts of strict gun control laws and eventually, we won't have weapons to defend ourselves against government tyranny.  That's the point.

       There are no cell phone videos of people actually being shot or with bullet wounds. 1 very very professional photo released of a dead family. People are going in every direction.  There are not that many exits at a concert venue.  People would be stampeding for the exits.  All the videos show people just laying on the ground and casually crawling/walking through active gunfire.  50+ dead and 200+ wounded is a lot of fucking blood.  There's no blood except on weirdos giving interviews to news smiling saying dumb shit like we're all Americans my man. Yeah no you would not be that calm after seeing that massacre. And how about the fucking freezer in the street? Not a chance in hell there's a chest freezer randomly about in an outdoor concert venue that you just wheeled out through the masses and down the street that is closer to fucking shooter. There would be an area of mass casualty, not just a few popped off here and there. This was an automatic rifle, obviously low caliber given the number of injuries and not casualities. This is fake AF guys. Even faker than Charlottesville.

       It was an automatic but he wasn't close to everyone down there for one. Spray and pray basically. So I can see the situation happening exactly how it did. It's one thing to question the shooter or the motives but clearly people died. Don't be that cold it's cool to question but I can't fathom how you think that many people were involved in a completely one hundred percent fake event. That's the same as saying people in the Twin Towers didn't really die. "The jumpers were just holograms guys!"

       I was literally at a Jason Aldean concert a month ago.....
      </p>
      <p>
       All I'm saying is that the only pictures of anyone bleeding/getting shot/dying etc is that one highly staged, instantly released photo of the family on the ground.  There's nothing really around them.  It doesn't add up to the rest of the footage.

       Most of the footage I saw was during, that picture seemed to be a little after people had gotten away from the area. And they seemed dead. Never thought about if it was a family just saw two bodies, some blood and said hmm they must be dead because they are the only ones who didn't leave.  If I was there I would have moved with the crowd around me. And this was in comparison to the videos I saw before, which all were packed with living running ducking crouching people. Just like how real life would be.

       I'm not saying they were all actors, but there was probably a solid amount that were. The professional photos of people running are very clearly staged. There's no one behind them. No one around them.

       A few real shooters and a staged fake shooter.

       What the hell would possibly give you the idea that our government isnt willing to kill innocent people.  Millions and millions of innocent lives have been lost by decisions of people in power and for some reason you think that because 50 people actually died there cant possibly be any government involvement?

       False flags does not mean staged deaths. False flag simply means an event orchestrated to be blamed on someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       False flags are used and proven to be used historically. It's a really common tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       So..we must discern if an event is a false flag..and if it consisted of fake deaths..all real deaths or some fake and some real.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media will alwa6s lie though and if a non false flag shooter kills a few people with a pistol you know it'll turn into lots of people and used a machine gun.

       Just giving some reasons why you could be wrong here. 
1. You said cellphone vids are nearly non existent. I say who the hell would be thinking lets grab my phone and video this? All the while bullets are screaming past. Plus 20k plus people they have yet to process what videos were taken. Which im sure is alot. They just maybe wanted to use clearest but not as graphic videos knowing they will be shown to everyone.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         People scattering in every direction,even though there is a lack of exits. I say well no fucking shit they are going every which way. What is it supposed to be an orderly single file line. Theres a fucking dude raining lead down on you. 20,000 people are going to scatter. And yes they had to break their way out in many case from the sounds of it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Freezer in middle of venue. Not sure what or where you are going on that one. But i say.  Beer cooler or something to that affect.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Lack of blood. They arent going to show the upmost brutal shots of the carnage on tv. Its not allowed and even shitty news sites know better than that.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Lack of death. 300 yards away plus the height distance those bullets lost a lot of momentum getting there.  Bullets dont fly for forever. And its not like all the dead were in one area. A place that has that kinda capacity to have 20k plus ppl there. 58 bodies will look relatively small in that area and even 500 plus bodies injured will still appear pretty small
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Keeping calm. Alot of people were probably drunk and weren't quite aware of the real shit happening to them. And no one has ever done what that guy did. Alot of people thought it was gunfire from within the crowd. So they ducked not knowing that it was actually from above. Also people have weird reactions to extremely stressful situations like that.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Its like you wanted to see all the carnage dead bodies and all. But also wanted to see an orderly evacuation at the same time. So from all what i gather from your statement. Had it happened anything like what you expect ot should. Then I'd call it a false flag.

You disregard the loss of innocent life to forward your bullshit, ego brushing theories because it's all you fucking have to commit your pathetic lives to. Grow the fuck up. Bad shit happens sometimes, and it's fucking tragic you mentally retarded fucks!

I'll tell you who..the fucking lowlife degenerates in this sub... You fucking cunts deserve more than death. If there's a hell, I hope you end up there.

       No my friend...you're trying to compensate for the guilt your feeling right now for disrespecting the deaths of 58 innocent people. You might not even realize your feeling this. Denial is a real thing. One day you'll realize that your actually a piece of shit. There's a difference between virtue signaling, and respecting the lives of 58 people who were literally just murdered. Grow the fuck up you dumb cunt.

       I will make this simple for you because you are so fucking dumb. I have a different opinion than you because I don't instantly believe all the bullshit the news feeds me. You want to make a the argument about supposed disrespecting victims because A) you have no opinion or argument of your own and B) You want to smear everyone here who has a different opinion than you. Sorry I am not apologizing for having my own independent thoughts. If that is what you say is disrespecting them in some way............ so be it.

       I am done with you. Rent yourself a gun and buy yourself a bullet. You my friend are lower than whale shit on the bottom of the ocean. If you were my kid I would probably put you in a sack and throw your dumb Mongoloid ass off a bridge. I don't even understand how you can function. Do you wipe your ass from front to back? How do you feed yourself? Do you sniff air duster all day or something? Please stop messaging me you have no facts. You didn't even have an argument. All you do is attack people who don't agree with you.

       I don't think the guy who they said did it, was the one who did. I think there might have been more than one shooter. I think his age, economic status, and no prior history or mental illness  make him not fit the profile of a mass shooter or suicidal person. I think we will  not see any video of him in the hotel prior to attack. I don't think any kind of video of the the attack while it happened either. I don't think they will show an interview with his gf/roomate. If they do she will talk about how crazy he was because he is supposed to be a lone nut. Who is 64 old man but carried a duffel bag full of guns without anyone noticing him. They news won't talk about ISIS or Antifa taking credit for this. They will spin it towards gun control and then attack Trump when he tells them to fuck off.

       I've watched multiple videos of the shooting, and you can clearly hear only one weapon firing...until police arrive in other videos.

      <p>
       Half of those factors are too vague to even judge whether someone becomes a mass shooter...for one, you don't have to be a young buck to accurately fire a weapon. For that matter, he was in his 60's. A person that age is still very capable of handling a firearm, and in fact a person that age is likely more capable as they are likely more trained...dude...60 is not that old man. You sound like a young, naive child.

       No one...literally no one has stated that he carried a duffel bag of guns. You're making up facts now. They've stated that he had guns in the hotel room. No word on how he got them there. It's likely they were transported there in normal luggage like a normal guest.

       Wow...dude...ISIS takes credit for shit all the time, just because they can, and the reports of Antifa taking credit for this are laughably false...also, please don't focus on this last point because you can't logically respond to the rest because that will only show that you have no leg to stand on...

       Dude, I don't give a fuck whether you agree with me or not. You act like you watch the news and that is all the evidence there is. You haven't seen all the evidence just all the evidence they want you too. Guess what Fukashima is still spilling radioactive waste into the ocean and you don't hear one word about it because the news covers what they want you to hear about. Genocide is happening right now, slavery still exists. Just look it up slavery exists in the year 2017 but guess what, its no news worthy. If you want to believe the news, the same people who told you Sadam had WMDs and that Hilary was gonna win the last election go ahead. You are so arrogant by trying to say the Conspiracy you believe in is correct but mine is wrong. I didn't know you were a fucking expert on the acoustics of gunshots taken by shitty cell phones. ISIS doesn't take credit for things they are not involved in. For example the Somali guy shooting up the church or another Muslim running people over in Britain recently. As for his mental health and economic status are both relevant for me. I work in mental health and almost all mass shooters are not over 30. You went from just insulting me to trying to arguing with me while still insulting me. In reality your just some asshole regurgitating what you heard on the news.

       Since you think you saw all the footage there is to see about this incident. Try looking at this video were it allegedly looks like a person shooting from a much lower level of the hotel. It could maybe be a strobe light. Also the cops were saying multiple shooters before they turned to the lone gun money narrative.
