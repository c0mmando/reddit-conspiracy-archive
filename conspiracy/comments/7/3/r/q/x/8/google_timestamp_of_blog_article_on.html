        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>According to the MSNBC Youtube Live news broadcast, the Las Vegas Mass shooting in Las Vegas started around 10:04 pm PST Oct.1 (Vegas&#39; timezone is PST). Around 2 AM Oct.2 PST I googled the name &#39;marilou danley&#39; and here&#39;s the result:<a href="https://imgur.com/a/2GCp8">https://imgur.com/a/2GCp8</a>. If the shooting happened only 4 to 5 hours ago, how did this article detailing her alleged involvement get a time stamp of 8 hours ago? A screwup on Google&#39;s time stamping algorithm, or something more sinister? Also that whole blog site seems shady af.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah someone closer to the source on the ground could have heard that she was being sought by police at an earlier time than others. From what I have pieced together she is a roommate or girlfriend or associate of the shooter. Also a hysterical woman apparently tried to warn the crowd 45 minutes before it happened so maybe that was her. Maybe she tried to tip off the police earlier and that is why they were seeking her before it happened.</p>

Maybe you can take a look at the HTML source of the article that the google result links to and grab some origin or publishing timestamps.

<p>This is fuckin weird. 06:50:01 PDT  assuming 24 hour time would be about 4 hours from now (2:50 AM PST, as PDT and PST time are the same). If it were 6:50 PM it would be even more ahead of time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many CMS&#39;s like WordPress will ping Google to let them know there is new content.  I have seen them crawl it within minutes of publishing and in results within an hour or two.  Google is much faster these days than even 3 or 4 years ago.</p>

<p>I am not sure about the timestamp thing.  One would assume that it would be spot on exactly when it crawled the page. But whenever something happens like cough Sandy Hook cough and the timestamps show foreknowledge some &quot;engineer&quot; posts some vague explanation.  It is even more interesting when google and bing show the same timestamp as preplanned. </p>

<p>That little &quot;2 days ago&quot; on your google searches is NOT accurate. It&#39;s an estimate based on the last time the site was crawled compared to the current changes.

<p>This is the Department of Computer Science at Old Dominion University.  It&#39;s not some joke.  Website publishing dates are not cateloged.  Even this system is still only an estimate, but it&#39;s closer than Google.</p>

<p>The ODU website states that this computation is very resource intensive, hence why Google doesn&#39;t do it for the millions of websites its crawler cateloges each day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nonsense? Can you offer an exact reason for the discrepancy other than &#39;estimated time&#39;? I do a little software engineering on the side of things and tend to scrutinize little details like timestamps of articles. It seems that instead of addressing the links myself and u/MetalManiac619 posted directly (where exactly did we post a link to <a href="http://www.odmp.org/officer/23260-deputy-sheriff-william-durr">http://www.odmp.org/officer/23260-deputy-sheriff-william-durr</a> ?), you instead vaguely generalize the whole issue without offering a specific reason other than &#39;google timestamps are estimates&#39;, and divert attention to another article we did not post. That little &#39;carbon date&#39; python script you linked estimates the creation date based on &#39;making requests to the different modules (Archives, backlinks, etc.), in a concurrent manner through threading&#39;, in addition to grabbing timestamping in the HTML source of the page. So in other words, we&#39;re just relying on other quoted timestamps which does not get to the crux of the issue: why is there a timestamp discrepancy in the google reported timestamp for the two links myself and u/MetalManiac619 posted?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this was capped of some major media outlet I&#39;d be more inclined to believe it wasn&#39;t just a technical glitch or error. How the hell did this random Philipino blog get access to clandestine information? That&#39;s something you&#39;d expect CNN, BBC, or Fox News to have access to, not tagalog.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Tagalog (/təˈɡɑːlɒɡ/;[6] Tagalog pronunciation: [tɐˈɡaːloɡ]) is an Austronesian language spoken as a first language by a quarter of the population of the Philippines and as a second language by the majority. Its standardized form, officially named Filipino, is the national language of the Philippines, and is one of two official languages along with English.&quot;</p>

<p>Concerning the blog article and blog website itself, it sets off my shady website alarm. I don&#39;t know how they managed to access Marilou Lou&#39;s information, or why they would even bother to post an article concerning her (was she well known in the Fillipino community, or something else?). As well, certain Fillipino websites are notorious for being fronts for scams and more sinister stuff such as human trafficking and sex tourism.</p>
