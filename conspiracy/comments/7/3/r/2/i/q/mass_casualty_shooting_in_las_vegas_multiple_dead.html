       - This will be my last edit as it is 4:30am and I’m fairly tired. LVPD Sheriff says only one shooter, and thus the lone shooter narrative (he even used the phrase lone wolf)  for this tragedy has been born. And of course the shooter is dead. I think the wise among us realize what has happened here.

       The unfortunate thing is that they people seem to be trained and actually good shots. In both of those circumstances the perps were awful shots and in the bank robbery one basically complete morons and did everything wrong. These guys seem trained and coordinated.

       Those back robbers, if I'm thinking of the same instance as you, had the advantage of having significantly superior firepower and body armor for the times. The cops didn't have a chance until they got some better equipment from, IIRC, nearby gun stores and SWAT. Then they cleaned house.

       I'd suspect some kind of break-in is also going on with this event too, given there are way too many juicy targets in that regard. Multiple teams in this instance. Two or three are causing chaos to keep the police busy, and some other team is blowing into vaults. Might not even be stealing bulk cash, but transaction records and various ledgers which are likely just as important for big casinos these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       However if that guess is right, I'm not sure if the unseen group is going to make the news like the ones doing all the random shooting.

       There has been prior precedent for this kind of thing before. An attack for terror alone can be anywhere, but attacking a place where all the money tends to be concentrated tends to have a dual motive. And casinos are super-secretive about their financial dealings, it's just how they operate. I'm going to stick with my hunch that there's more to this crime than what's in the news.

       Where are they obtained from in the first place? A middle-of-the-night smash and grab at a gun store? Stolen from a burglary on the off chance that the owner just so had an automatic weapon? Smuggled from South America? Illegally converted?

       All of the above, making fully automatic weapons illegal does very little to prevent criminals from obtaining them. I'm sure the majority of them are converted or smuggled in. Either way, they're still being used in gang/drug related shootings in places like Chicago and Detroit.

       Wow how many of you spellbound imbeciles are there?  I can't believe there are so many fairy tale lives being lived out atm.  It is not some mythical event to possess an automatic weapon in the US.  Motivated individuals can and do obtain them, and some of those individuals use them for nefarious purpose.  The only bumping this guy was doing was off an 8ball as he reading his fucking Vietnam weapon.  That's exactly what his weapon sounded like.  Some automatic shit poppin off like you hear in them Vietnam videos.

       I'm not sure what connections you have, but they are pretty hard to come by. Pistols and shotguns are easy. But finding an actual machine gun with no real connection to the market is near impossible. You probably have a better chance of being robbed an skilled than ever seeing one.

       These people operate above the left/right paradigm. It may be to further push gun control laws. Armed citizens is what
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       worries them. I’m not saying this was a false flag as I really don’t have enough info yet but if there’s a motivation for any element of the CIA / FBI or rogue elements it might be this. Remember the deep state is a completely separate entity to the shadow government, the intelligence agencies and rogue faction within said groups.

       Not really. First of all, whomever was firing was not trained properly to use that weapon. He was holding the trigger down and emptying the magazine in one pull, which renders an automatic kind of useless at the range he was allegedly firing
       <em>
        (hundreds of meters to over 1000m likelyt)
       </em>
       To me it sounded like an AK platform, probably firing from drum magazines - they're kind of a pain in the ass to reload especially if you're in a hurry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believe it or not had he been firing a semi-automatic weapon it could have been more deadly. Automatic 7.62 at that range, and with no proper control of the weapon will just send rounds tumbling into the distance off target.

       Actually,it is that easy.

      <p>
       The shooter had the high ground,which every military in the world seeks out for its tactical advantages. Especially when conducting an ambush into a target rich enviroment,,which is basicly what this was.
Of course, with aimed fire, it might be difficult to hit a specific target,but that wasnt the case here. All he had to do was point his weapon down toward the crowd,then spray and pray.

       It's not like they were directly below him, they were more than 1400 feet away, which if youve ever fired a weapon is not an easy shit even with the best conditions, and this guy unloaded fully automatic fire at them. Not as simple as shooting fish in a barrel if the barrel is more than a thousand feet out

       With a crowd packed that tight together, even a semi experienced long range shooter would have no problem keeping the spray in an area that is hundreds of meters wide. One sand bag and a 6 power scope and he would have no trouble if he had practiced a little. Its scary how easy it really is to do something like what this guy did. No gun laws short of mandatory weekly house inspections with metal detectors would ever stop someone thats not an idiot. These people that do these shootings piss me off beyond belief.

        Not really. You can't legally purchase or operate a 'machine gun' manufactured after 1986, so everything 1986 and prior can be purchased with an extensive ATF process and 'tax stamp'. They are limited stock, so they costs thousands of dollars - anyone that buys a weapon like that is not using it to go on a killing spree, they're for hobbyists. This was either an illegal weapon, stolen, or illegally tampered with to make a particular semi-auto an 'automatic' - which a lot of people do, but the weapon isn't safe or reliable if you do that.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not to mention, there has not been a single use of a legal fully automatic firearm in a crime in recorded history.

       From the sound of it fireing it wasn't full auto.

       It's a semi-auto with one of thise doohickys that pulls the trigger as fast as you can crank the doohicky.

       Because the cadence of it varys exactly like that.

       The only people that use fully automatic guns are amateurs and people trying to make a scene. The CIA wouldn't use fully automatic guns in any situation. They're wildly inaccurate. They only make sense (from a professional perspective) up close, a la the Vector.

       I don't know from where you take this kind of information but it's all BS. While yes, most of Spec Ops soldiers use semi automatic fire for almost all situations, full auto fire it's also very used in Spec Ops: Supressing enemies especially if they are a big group, CQC when cleaning rooms/buildings, etc... You should read about the CAR-15

       seems, to me, this is what most people there think.  But I'm not saying it is or isnt.  10 fully auto rifles would cost a shit ton going through legal channels and take a shit ton of time to get the stamps for them and fbi and atf would know you have them.  10 ar15s with bump stocks wouldn't be nearly as costly and could get that stuff at pretty much any gun store.  :/  super sad shit.

       The audio makes it sound like two or more guns are being fired at once, but this could easily be echo or something, I'm no expert, but I do shoot automatic weapons at the ranges here in nevada, I'm guessing all the buildings and wide open space below just made it sound that way, but when I first saw one of the videos, sounded like two automatics firing into the crowd, not sure.

       Super illegal if owned illegally. You can legally own machine guns. It’s just over 15 grand to own one. Not to mention you have to pass an additional check from the ATF.

        super
       </em>
       illegal. There also aren't meth labs making hundreds of pounds of meth around victorville, because it's illegal. Super illegal.

       You can make a poor mans full auto using a bump fire stock for cheap. Slide fire is the best, I have shot full auto and it is very close in terms of being accurate, as far as shooting accurately with auto fire goes, especially if you use a bipod.
      </p>
      <p>
       These videos are legal semi-autos using slide fire stocks.

       No, not saying everything is fake.  Think logically.  Never believe what talking heads say.  Analyze the shoddy first hand evidence that has been publically released.

       Alex Jones said his sources said he had just converted to Islam and local law enforcement was already aware of him. Alex actually has good sources but youre probably too closed minded to even consider that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway ANTIFA was fucking threatening to kill people this fall so it seems likely it was them. Although obviously it could have been other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       A huge fucking problem honestly is that the Media and politicians use these kinds of things as a way to gain control. If only they would just be rational and outdoor concert venues would just develop better security practices.

       He has good sources sometimes! Your using ad hominen now just because youve been radicalized by leftist media to not believing anything which comes from Alex Jones. He literally has good sources sometimes even if he is wrong about some other stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway even if you dont believe him this guy was obviously targeting conservatives. He was photographed at several radical leftist protests.

       Leftist media is constantly trying to hammer it into people that all Trump Supporters are racist and all white people are evil nazis. It's honestly not surprising that crazy people take it literally and then do horrible things. Use occam's razor. Its obvious why he targeted a country music concert. This guy's friends and family apparently said that he was against guns to. I think it's pretty obvious this guy was motivated politically at the very least. Maybe even ANTIFA had influence on him or radical islam.

Your account is 66 days old and you've posted 3 times all of which are on the same free karma sub r/freekarma4u Whatever you're pushing, whoever you are, you're a fucking scumbag for using this tragedy, no matter how questionable, to ask for money.

       It's a free country mother fucker. I'm exercising my 1A to support the 2A, and hopefully warn people about radical leftism. Antifa really has fucking been threatening to get violent lately and there is nothing fucking wrong with Alex Jones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think how many people you know who would justify stealing from a rich person or a corporation. That is basically what leftism is all about, and it's a way bigger problem than racism. It's
       <em>
        richism
       </em>
       . Antifa has been justifying violence like crazy and saying they were gonna start ramping things up this fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the fuck do you think that guy shot up a country music concert?
       <em>
        Probably to kill conservatives.
       </em>
       You're just fucking mad because I'm telling the truth and your delusional view of reality is caving in on itself.

       good lord please people, dont snap chat a scene of terrorism. We dont need web quality 15 second videos that disappear in 24 hours of some of the most valuable footage available. High quality footage is not only important for the historical document but also to help find clues and identify faces.

       Proof they are/were fully auto? Very rare and expensive weapons even in LV. Semi auto can be fired darn quickly and if you bump fire it can simulate full auto fairly well.

       Words are important so incorrectly labeling the weapons is a dire mistake.

       Devils advocate, again. The thing about the craigslist ads is that they were posted before the event. They could be anything, they could be for a TV commercial or even a legitimate training exercise. But we know they were posted beforehand, and I think that's why people weigh so heavily on them. We know the government has lied in the past to push agendas; we know about secret courts and illegal wiretapping, and we know about a current push to re-legalize said wiretapping.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe it's as much people are believing what they want to believe as it is not trusting a source you know you can't trust and has an agenda to push. They're taking the facebook thing at face value, which in comparison looks 'like the word of god'.

       You're right, the ads could be anything. But in this thread right now are people who will tell you that this is obvious evidence of a false flag operation and all of the victims are paid actors. Once the seed of possibility is planted you'll see grieving family members being called liars and two hour YouTube "documentaries" that people smugly post links to in comment sections telling users here to wake up and see the influence of Hillary Clinton and the Illuminati.

       The CL ad is proof that manufactured outrage is a political tool.  If a "cause" is willing to hire people to create the appearance of a protest, all involved are human garbage.  In this case, there is no need to use actors (aside from a key witness or something like that.)

       Because we're in a political climate where the government doesn't care about the will of the people. Look at the referendum vote in Catalonia. Look at the fisa courts, which pretty much everyone agrees are a violation of rights. They want to push this again, and as operation northwoods proves, they are willing to kill people to push an agenda. You should be proud that everyone is questioning everything.

       Questioning everything, even in a sub for conspiracies, doesn't excuse the fact that this isn't questioning at all, just blatant declarations and assumptions without any critical scrutiny whatsoever, just jumping on things that seem to confirm
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       narrative. That you never come to the conclusion something
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       a conspiracy means that either
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       is a conspiracy, or that perhaps you're not as astute as you think, and aren't critically analyzing the situation to determine it's veracity but are instead just looking for confirmations of your biases.

       I think the answer is that it's far easier to collect evidence as if it were a false flag AS ITS HAPPENING rather than wait until its over, speculate, piece together something you find compelling, and then submit it to the world when everyone is, more or less, over it already.
      </p>
      <p>

No, its not great to question everything undoubtedly and to think way ahead of time that you're looking at a conspiracy, but, as was mentioned above, we live in a time when its probably a good idea if SOME people reacted that way and archived information as it was happening. Its seemingly already impossible to get anyone who isn't conspiracy-minded to give this any real consideration, anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
It helps the community and damages its credibility at the same time.

       Or, or, it's possible people are investigating as best they can and publishing as much info as they can. Drawing conclusions at this stage is stupid regardless of your perspective. We can entertain and explore an idea without completely subscribing to it.

       My comment is saying that you're all just assuming these bits of published info are automatically true without critical scrutiny, benefit of the doubt, or consideration of other options... nor is there much information to the contrary being gathered and counter-analyzed against your position.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really simple - there's no scrutiny here, just assumptions. That isn't a scientific inquiry, it's groupthink.

       isn't a monolith and what you're describing as throwing in the towel happens on an individual level all the time.

      <p>
       Some conspiracies do get revealed in time.  Other suspected conspiracies have their disclosure dates extended indefinitely for reasons of national security.
      </p>
      <p>
       Less will be revealed if incongruities aren't immediately pursued before loose ends are cleaned up.  The alternative is to passively absorb whatever information secondary sources curate for you.

       It's not immediately suspected of being fake per se, but its likewise not automatically accepted as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The goal is to be skeptically open-minded. The "everything is a conspiracy" mindset is as counter-productive as the "nothing is a conspiracy" mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its better to evaluate the evidence available and draw logical conclusions. At this point in time, its too early to tell. There are lots of social media posts, and reports about alternate shooter locations which are possibly due to fear, adrenaline and shot echoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than lurkers, this sub is a closed loop where we can discuss these sensitive topics without offending anyone and draw on our collective knowledge to suss through the info.
      </p>
      <p>
       Be patient with the comments, as many are bots or trolls. The core group on this sub is quite logical and pragmatic, and don't take offense when someone makes a good counterpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are usually a handful of possibilities in any mass casualty event:
      </p>
      <p>
       Totally true-really happened exactly as described (most crimes and murders)
      </p>
      <p>
       Partially true-really happened, but info about how or why was altered or distorted for various reasons (directing political policy)
      </p>
      <p>
       Not true-didn't happen at all (hoax)
      </p>
      <p>
       Most events fall into the "partially true" category; and example would be an MCE where the shooter used a pistol and shotgun, but the media reports it was an assault rifle to garner support for increased gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also other metrics for carefully analyzing these types of events, but this reply is running a little long.

       well said. I right now am a skeptic waiting to hear more information before I draw any kind of conclusion. yes there are some details about it that don't quite click at this time but does that mean its a fake thing? no. lets keep gathering information and find out what we can before we grab our pitchforks and start screaming false flag. keep in mind that false flag or an organic mad man off his rocker that people have died and there will be a lot of emotions involved in this event and discussions of it. so people will react wildly one way or another when talking about it.

       It depends on the evidence presented vs the "official story" which isn't always the truth. Could this be what the story says? Absolutely. But the rational thing to do is to remain skeptical of what we're told and what comes out as well as conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me, this is where I'm currently at:
      </p>
      <p>
       No muzzle flashes on any of the videos that catch the building, particularly the floor they're saying this happened from. This could indicate weapons fire from another, possibly closer location. Could also indicate more than one shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no break in fire- at least not one that indicates changing a 30 round magazine rather it indicates a belt fed machine gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are just a couple observations. As this unfolds, keep a close eye on the facts they give us and see if that holds against your own observations of common sense.

       My answer to that question is the fact that the Smith-Mundt act was repealed a few years ago...making it legal for the government to create and present false events as true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why repeal the one act making it illegal to propagandize citizens of the United States, inside the borders of the USA, unless that's exactly what they intend to do? That's a rhetorical question, by-the-way.

       The ad was put up by Crowds On Demand. COD is the same company that had ads up in Orlando before the Pulse shooting, as well as ads before the Boston Bombing. Type in “Crowds On Demand” in the r/conspiracy search bar. You’ll find plenty of info on them.

       am expensive non-disclosure for being part of a conspiracy theory? WHAT? I can't even wrap my head around how you'd think that'd work... "OK so I illegally was asked to sign this saying that I won't tell anyone that I pretended to be a victim of a terrorist attack" It's illegal to hire anyone to do that sort of thing, and so illegal to enforce a non-disclosure. I'll put it in a small scale so it makes sense. Can a weed dealer get his customers to sign a non-disclosure, ensuring no one rats him out? of course fucking not

       I'm not sure what to think about this "crisis actor" theory, but when it comes to expensive non-disclosure agreements, it isn't always the threat of money/things being taken away - what would you keep silent about for a million bucks? How about ten? AND the threat of your money/things/life being taken from you in addition..

       sure maybe for a handful of people, but if you're getting hundreds to play along, chances are one of them will know the law, or know someone who knows the law, well enough to say thats all bullshit that is 100% illegal. that doesn't even include the morons who would just brag to all their friends even if they signed something.

       Contract would be unenforceable in court. Only way that it would be possible to keep a huge amount of people quite is with a fuck ton of money, or by killing them. If your going to kill later them then there is no point in hiring actors and might as well just do a false flag. If the government is willing to fabricate a whole event like this or sandy hook they would just do a false flag and skip the high cost of paying a ton of people to be quite. Its not like we are talking about a government that has any true moral standard's, and the dead can't talk so there is no chance that they can expose it if they actually kill everyone.

       The assumption that the Craigslist ads have anything to do with this is ludicrous. Like you said, there is no way to keep everyone quiet and no way to make sure hundreds of actors are killed at the event so hiring actors for something like this would just be stupid. I cannot understand how some of these people think like this. Maybe people just want to feel like detectives and link two things together, I just don't know.

       Two reasons they wouldn't want that:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         They think the terrorists are holding their weapon in one hand and their smartphone in the other, frantically searching the Internet for "tactical" intelligence
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Something fishy is going on they wouldn't want recorded/broadcast (having learned the lesson from 911 and all the contradictory material still floating out there to this day)

       They say it every time, they even said that yesterday when there was the lone idiot in Edmonton, I think they still said it after they caught him to. I think the fear is that these people may have a guy with a cell phone sending them information, although they would probably have a police scanner of their own if they are local.
      </p>
      <p>
       They could probably just get a Bluetooth headset connected to a phone to communicate with the information guy if they have one in the group, who could be on a phone call with them the whole time.

       were relaying what they were hearing on the police scanner, seemingly as it risked being useful to the shooters (that's what they're saying on r/undelete). As if the criminals couldn't download the app (or own a scanner) themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tend to be very skeptical/reluctant at this systematic shutting down of crowd-sourced efforts; at the very least it implies the State and State-sponsored media should be the only competent/responsible enough to report.

       It could also have something to do with them not wanting people to realise how I'll prepared or confused that they become during terror attacks. Dosent inspire confidence in the ability to prevent and contain the attacks.

       Not reporting on publicly available information in real time doesn't erase that information from existance. If criminals want to use publicly available information to help evade police, they're going to do it. They don't need to rely on amateur journalists reporting on social media, they can get the publicly available information from the same sources those people got it. "Don't report on police radio because the bad guys might hear it"? What? If they cared to know what police are doing and planned this in advance, why not just assume that they themselves are listening in on publicly available information like that?

       to be fair, that is standard operating procedure ever since the '70s, when during the hostage situation at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich the local TV stations broadcast the approach of police forces on the roofs. The terrorists saw that on live TV and demanded a withdrawal of all forces.

       They are referring to the attacks that happened in Paris where the news footage caused the terrorists to know where the police were and ended up with them getting shot. It also happened in eastern Canada when an RCMP officer was killed because people were tweeting locations of how cops were outside their house etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't always assume something is fishy, sometimes they just have genuine concern for the people on the force. Plus during a time of crises like This, they wouldn't know how many active shooters there were. If you listened to the scanner it sounded like the police were super confused so they may have thought there was multiple people armed.

       Probably confusing because the shooter was up like 30 floors, so had a large area he could hit. And I'm guessing people heard echoes too

        Fenethylline is metabolized by the body to form two drugs, amphetamine (24.5% of oral dose) and theophylline (13.7% of oral dose), both of which are active stimulants. The physiological effects of fenethylline therefore seem to result from a combination of these two compounds, although this is not entirely clear.

      <p>
       I think it's pretty equivalent; anyhow the pharmacological effects are utterly equivalent. True the wiki says Captagon
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       considered to have fewer side effects, although I don't really understand why as Captagon is metabolized as amphetamine.

       they basically let them in, despite being obviously suspicious as hell.

       i wonder if they have "catcher in the rye", or if they're gonna be drugged during trial, like james holmes. wait, did they apprehend them, or did they conveniently shoot them dead?

      <p>
       if it is a false flag, it makes me wonder if anyone specific at the concert was a target, buried over the civilian casualities, or if it's to push an agenda or get media views yet again. or just cause scared people are easier to manipulate/don't complain.

       Were you listening to the scanner as it was going down? Probably not.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the media was barking about one shooter, the LVPD was talking about upwards of 4.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the lady who ran to the front of the crowd screaming “you’re all gonna die”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or how about just like every other false flag in history, there was a lonewolf shooter who of course ended up dead so he can’t talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dispatch repeatedly called out a shooter walking into The Bellagio, what happened to that guy? What about the 4 folks who left a suspicious vehicle near the scene?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, do some research, learn what a false flag is and why they occur, and then circle back to the conversation, skippy.

       What I really love about you OP is who you devoured and ran with the likely real false flag: a tweeted screenshot of a Craigslist ad anyone could fake.

       And other comments have pointed out that's a popular 4chan troll tactic. But boy you sure took the bait.

       Yeah, there was a post here talking about a Crowds on Demand post directed at Phoenix (speculating it had something to do with Arpaio and his pardon). I saw that one too while trying to turn up the old topics, but there were even more talking about Las Vegas as well. Like this one:
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ujrmw/crowds_on_demand_in_las_vegas_prepare_for_a_riot/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ujrmw/crowds_on_demand_in_las_vegas_prepare_for_a_riot/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are others as well. Try a google search limited to reddit.com (since reddit's own search system is terrible), include the phrases "Crowds on Demand" along with terms like "Vegas" and "conspiracy" and you should be able to find more. A lot of the posts speculated this would be connected to the McGregor Mayweather from the end of August, so adding "McGregor Mayweather" with the other terms should get you some interesting results too.

       Someone, or a group of people, from here need to respond to one of these Crowds on Demand ads, go along and see what happens. Would help to solve this mystery. Because if they're getting any old person to be involved in these types of events then you'd think that'd be dangerous for them as someone would speak out, even if they'd had NDAs slapped on them, someone would have a conscience and say something, surely? Or at least, they'd run the risk of someone saying something. So I think it'd be v informative to have some people properly investigate this crisis actor thing. I'd do it but I'm not in the US.

       I replied to one a long time ago, after the Orlando shooting, it was some sketch company, G4 I believe. Even if they aren't involved in stuff like this, I'm pretty sure they were involved on the profiting end of 9/11 and are generally a scummy lot.

       Its on this subreddit if you search for it. But I probably posted it with a different account. But honestly its probably a nothing burger at the end of a long tunnel that I don't feel like digging through so yeah sorry, no links.

       The awful truth that few want to accept on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       is that violence like this is real. Mentally disturbed people exist, and when they have access to weapons, they sometimes use them. I know it's comforting to think that it's a conspiracy and that these crowds aren't real, but the ugly truth is that reality is not always scripted.

       I think the crisis actor thing is a conspiracy in of itself started by the powers at be who noticed the internet digging too far into things, so to discredit the conspiracy culture they added nonsense like crisis actors to the culture to deter conspiracies from being acceptable in discussion.

       Thanks. So basically he was injured in Brussels, somewhere in Boston when that went off and in the same country when an attack happened in Paris.

       At best he survived two attacks. Still freaky but way less amazing than surviving 3 or 4.

       Thanks for checking it out. I am a longtime lurker here and that was my first comment here. This sub is not really a place where I want to get into my personal opinions (negativity, downvoting, divisiveness, hatred) but I wanted to mention that. His whole existence is like part of the evidence of false flag events so I felt like mentioning it.

       I like how you responded calmly and were able to lay out your logic and reasoning for why you think these people are not paid actors.

      <p>
       Just kidding, you resorted to childish name calling, most likely because you don't have any actual facts to support the government's story.

       No actually the name  calling is  appropriate, because Sandy Hook truthers are truly the worst people ever. There's no saving them, with or without logic. It's been tried. So it's best just to point and laugh.

       While I certainly can agree. It looks like people died on this one. I would need some evidence to show that it's faked. I do hold out that will surface we are only few hours in. I'm sure there will be weeks worth of investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The NWO is angry. They are not getting the WWIII they want. Their quest for a one world currency is being side stepped by the BRICS. So them killing innocents would not surprise me.

       Plus. There were calls for crisis actors in Vegas just recently. So. We shall see what that turns out to be.

       No it isn't. I was responding to a very very deep conspiratorial belief that it didn't happen. I don't personally believe no one died. I believe it happened in full and it was planned and another False Flag to push gun control and marital law. Now go back to your vanilla reality of "good" and "evil" and when you wake up and realize that reality is fucking horrifying join us on r/conspiracy.

       Really? So prominent bankers calling for cashless society and movement toward continental currencies/world reserve currencies aren't a step towards a world currency? Why not? Makes sense. I'm all for a one world currency. Just not controlled by the NWO.

       Yes it is. A false flag is something that happens but is used to push another hidden narrative. The action happens. The narrative and what actually happened is kept secret to produce whatever the planned solution to the initial planned problem was.

      <p>
       Here's the actual definition:
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        The contemporary term false flag describes covert operations that are designed to deceive in such a way that activities appear as though they are being carried out by entities, groups, or nations other than those who actually planned and executed them.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's derived from pirate ships flying different flags to get in close before attacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying "the action happens" is such a cop out. You're now covering all the bases here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also then you're admitting the gunman did indeed fire from his hotel room and suicide prior to the police breach. A real false flag wouldn't go down like that.

       Oh my lord. You guys are terrible at this. Instant response times. Goes right for Israel and the Lizardman. Perfect reddit formatting. I don't believe Jews run the world lol. So. I dunno where you're going with that. Your argument is so bad and literally makes no sense as I presented no information saying this is a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply pointing out to the poster people do die in "false flags". I'm not sure if this is a false flag. I have no evidence. But I did add actual discussion explaining a bit about false flags. Which is bad news for you guys over in the Air Force bases. Or whatever you serve. Haha. You're losing. You guys botched this one.

       Not an actor. Just because you think it is scripted based on pure speculation doesn't mean it is. Try looking up the definition of confirmation bias.

       Why would they need to?  Even if it was false flag, any crowd will do.  The only person needing hired at that point is the shooter... Hiring crowd members for something like this seems completely pointless.  Even counter productive, because it opens you up for questions...

       Sinple: the Craigslist ads are all faked from 4chan or this place. The way to prove them would be so ridiculously easy yet magically no one has. We've had a few people try and claim they had a friend who got replied and just like the supposed posts looking for people it's all unverifable claims and imgur posts. This place refuses to accept that mentally ill and/or fucked up people do violent thing sometimes, and until it does it will remain a laughingstock.

       They are most likely fake, false flages themselves posted by the alt righters in advance of political protests so they can "find" the "Smoking Gun" and claim those Antifa protests are all fake.

       That post was made around the time of DACA protests being organized in Las Vegas. Likely nothing to do with this.

       Or the posts are made by people who know alt-right people or conspiracy people will pick up on them and make the claim that there are crisis actors.

       You have to look at the result to determine who is most likely to be behind it.  The result here is that conspiracy people look crazy.  So the question to ask is who would be motivated to make conspiracy people look crazy?

       To be clear, I'm only speaking from anecdotal experience but these guys haul off the disruptive people so fast and so efficiently that I doubt they actually ever speak with or hear a word from the people they're throwing out. They would never have the opportunity to understand what is wrong with the person they remove before hauling their ass on the sidewalk.

       Both are anecdotes. I guarantee you that there are tons of people who have been told that they will die for their sons while in Las Vegas. I'm from fucking Boston and get told that by the religious weirdos occasionally.

       True. But was this concert a paid admission concert? I understand all the weirdos on the streets doing it. But a woman actually paying admission to get into a show and doing it seems unlikely

       While it's awesome that you haven't experienced that, it doesn't make what the previous poster said any less true. I've lived in Vegas for almost ten years now. I don't often go to the Strip anymore, but I've been approached by people saying similar things. There are legit nutjobs all over The Strip at any given time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally they are religious crazies that say you're going to burn in hell. However I've been told numerous times by random people that I would die that night.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes it comes from someone who's had too much to drink, others from someone who gambled a little too much and want to ruin your night. Sometimes it's a homeless person that you didn't give cash to. In all cases it's largely ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       It definitely happens. In this, specific, case though, the woman just happened to be right.

       I can confirm this.   Las Vegas might be the poor mental health capital of the USA, it both attracts and makes crazy people.  I worked there for a while last year in a capacity that required much contact with Las Vegas residents including homeless, my life was threatened on an almost daily basis.   I was also offered hooch on an almost daily basis,  not on the strip mind you but at public libraries, stores, and movie theaters by complete strangers.

       Out of all the hundreds of shows I've been to I can't recall ever been told I'm gonna die by a crazy person. Crazy ppl like that usually don't goto shows randomly. Maybe this show was free admission and ppl can just walk in off the street but a rational thinking person who pays for a ticket to get into a show isn't gonna spew some nonsense like that around

       Sherrif just said during a press conference that she was out of the country and is no longer considered a person of interest. Paddock was in possession of some of her IDs, possible used them when checking into the hotel.

       Did you see the interview with the girl who told that story?  That was a drunk mexican lady that got into it with some chick in front of her.  The mexican chick was with her boyfriend and the 2 of them were kicked out for being belligerent.  It's at that point she said the line. I think it's just an effed up coincidence.

       It sounds like he/they had been there for a while in the same room. It would take some time to get all those guns and ammo into the hotel without raising suspicions. They probably weren't all compact little M4's either. Measuring on google earth the shorter shots to the venue was still 300 yards.
      </p>
      <p>
       But on the other hand, that's a lot of fish in a huge barrel. Spray and pray would still be devastating.

       I can't help but believe a 21 year old on her birthday is too drunk to be considered reliable. Probably got in a small shoving match and got threatened while drunk and the story kept changing in her mind as she got more and more attention. Her hamstering probably went from "she said she'd kick my ass!" to "she said she'd kill me!" to "she said we'd all die!" to "She was the terrorist!"

       Gun control. CIA have been trying to get gun control restriction for so long, and this is how they intend to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       CIA has discovered a while back that mind control involves trauma. By orchestrating (through operatives) or sometimes LETTING these mass shootings happen, it inflicts a psychological shock wave into the minds of millions of people. And while they are in this state of shock and panic, the CIA and media will happily push the gun restriction narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Search up Operation Northwoods, it was same style of mass-event tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at it, it's working. So many people are posting things like "ban guns", even thought it's totally against the constitution. The CIA wants to ban guns because it does not want any civillian guerillas or anti-governments to form in the future, in response to the criminal activities &amp; political interest of the US-CIA government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the pattern of CIA policies. It deliberately allows the formation of terror groups such as taliban, al qaeda, and ISIS. It funds both sides of the war in order to create mass chaos and subdue civillian population into psychological submission on reliance on government policies. As a justification, the US military will invade here and there, steal resources, possibly traffic humans or drugs. Oil stolen from Iraq, Opium stolem from Afghaistan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do politicians know about this? Of course. But they are all blackmailed puppets caught in compromised sex acts. They cannot do anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA is utilitarian. It does not give a shit about morality. And if you must know, the earliest CIA researchers were Nazis who were brought in after World War 2 through Operation paper clip. They were the ones who invented Trauma based mind manipulation and mind control.

       If the CIA wanted this, don't you think they could strong-arm some key Republicans into supporting gun control laws? They're capable of orchestrating all these attacks but can't get Joe Bob (R) from Texas to vote for the "Obama takin ur guns" law? This is fucking stupid.

       No cuz then republicans would then lose votes. What they want is the civillians to push republicans into making policy change, therefore the people wouldn't be able to blame politicians once they regret banning guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pushing on republican into voting gun control wouldn't change the opinion for gun control by the masses. US citizens as a whole would only abandon gun control after repetitive traumatising events such as mass shootings.

       First of all, you post the worst sources imaginable. I saw the actual interview with the birthday girl. A different girl and her boyfriend got into an altercation with some people and said, "you and your friends are all going to die!" and was escorted out. This all according to one 21 year old girl. Stupid shit like that happens at concerts everyday. If that even happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally nothing about any of that says CIA. Try apply even the slightest bit of logic to your thinking and tri to have a little bit of respect for the people who just died. It's wild, retarded, unfounded speculation like what you're saying that creates paranoid killers. Congrats on making things worse.

       If someone thinks one theory is fucking retarded that doesn't mean they question nothing. It means they think you're putting no actual thought into what you're saying and SERIOUSLY can't discern between reputable sources and bullshit.

       how is all of this more believable to you then just some dude snapping and killing loads of people? im honestly surprised these mass shootings dont take place more often. and i definitely don't believe theyre all just made up. humans are fucked up and do fucked up things. especially when guns are involved, its very easy for delusional people to just point a pull a trigger.

       This is what I was thinking as well too, especially since whenever these shootings happen everyone and anyone has some sort of "useful information" that ends up having little to no relevancy when the facts are sorted out. Sucks that so many people think of these kind of events as a false flag simply because they don't understand how much misinformation is spread by the public/officers in the initial hours after.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember during the San Bernardino shootings someone mentioned an explosion a few blocks away being a terrorist explosive device, but eventually it was discovered someones water heater exploded miles away.

       This didn't used to be a place where we claimed people didn't die in false flags.  People didn't say that about 9-11.  It started with Sandy Hook and now it's every single one.  It was a dumb theory then and it has never been a good theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact it reeks of disinformation spread by alphabet groups to divide the conspiracy community and make them do insane shit like harass grieving families and turn the public against the idea of conspiracy theories.  You are feeding into that and hurting the cause by supporting these nonsense ideas.

       Crisis actors and staged events are definitely real; thinking the government wouldn't dare perpetrate one goes against the information we already have about government conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, however, there's literally no data that has surfaced suggesting this was staged.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could very well be a false flag (the radio scanner activity last night told a vastly different story than the media narrative), but it's seriously doubtful that people were just LARPing their injuries.

       Definitely?  Do you have a single piece of proof that would let you use the D-word?  Because I've read a shit ton on the subject and I definitely would not say they are definitely real.

      <p>
       I don't think the government "wouldn't dare" use it as if it's such a heinous tactic.  It's just a horrible tactic that would get them caught immediately.  It requires you to ensure that everyone in the chain from victims to EMTs to doctors to funeral directors and morgue workers to all be involved in this fraud.
      </p>
      <p>
       False flags make sense and have occurred because they can involve only people who work for military and intelligence agencies to pull off.  Crisis actors hired off of Craigslist?  Emergency workers and hospital staff?  If you just think about it for a second you can see it would never work.

       A group like this, in combination with a coordinated and controlled media narrative, can easily be used to manipulate the public perception just as well as an actual incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that after Sandy Hook and the countless investigations into the data, the public has demonstrated that simulated tragedies won't pass a legitimacy test without adequate documentation and logical consistencies.

       Yes.  I am aware that crisis actors are real.  Like I said, I have read a shit ton on the subject.  A group like that could definitely not be used to manipulate public perception about an actual incident.  There are too many uncontrollable factors involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no proof that crisis actors have ever been used to simulate anything.  There's not even solid evidence.  The best you have is a grieving father who was caught laughing, which people do at funerals all the fucking time, and some people who have conflicting stories about a high stress day.
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys never respond to the complicit emergency workers that would have to be involved because there is no answer to that.  It makes these things impossible.  It doesn't matter if the media was 100% government run, which it is not.

       EMTs, cops, fire fighters, nurses, doctors.  These injured and dead people are being pushed through the entire casualty management system.  We're talking dozens or hundreds of people interacting with each injured or dead person.  None of whom blow the whistle.

       Yes, I know where I am.  I can't stop you from pushing these conspiracies but I do genuinely feel that they are hurting the community.  They are pushing our community to attack family members and giving the media ammunition to attack all conspiracy theories by lumping them in with these ridiculous ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have looked into the crisis actor theories.  I've looked at all the photo evidence of the Boston Bombing with the hoodied man and people supposedly dumping fake blood on each other.  I am not convinced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again.  The amount of people necessarily involved in these conspiracies would be enormous.  You're talking about every cop on the scene, every EMT on the scene, every firefighter, every nurse, every doctor who saw these "fake" injured people.  Every single one of them would have either have to be fooled by the fake injuries or agree to go along with the conspiracy.  It is literally impossible.  It's not just implausible it could not have happened.  Not without a single person whistle blowing.

       You are wasting time and energy on a theory that could better be spent on something plausible.  Spending more time on Building 7 or JFK would be a better use of your time.

       Did anyone hear, when there were less than 9000 listeners, before Zebra 20 was in the stairwell leading to floor 32 - when someone called in a man in fatigues walking into an RV, possibly with a gun and everyone basically ignored him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention, did anyone hear from Zebra 20 after he was called to SWAT base by "Ghost"?

       after they breached the room, there were definitely more automatic firing in another location on broadcastify, maybe cops but very odd if only 1 shooter as this was probably 40 minutes after the breach and confirmation of 1 suspect down.

       Idk pretty interesting to hear but anticlimactic. Man in fatigues never got any closure so that's still a curious thread to pull on.

       Its all very odd. Theres a huge discrepancy in the amount and lengths of shots.  10.08pm was first dispatch.  11.13 or 11.15 they blew up his door.  Officials  say 4 or 5 bursts, singers there say at least 12.  There was a man in fatigues going into an rv dispatched,  but is being ignored.  This dude doesnt really fit the profile....neither did oswald.  Remember??   Remember during sandy hook the tracked a guy in cammo into the woods and nabbed him?  But never explained it???

       (Original comment posted by OP) The ad was put up by Crowds On Demand. COD is the same company that had ads up in Orlando before the Pulse shooting, as well as ads before the Boston Bombing. Type in “Crowds On Demand” in the r/conspiracy search bar. You’ll find plenty of info on them.

       When thousands of people have been listening to the scanners and have all heard the same thing. I believe they lost the fucking shooters and are trying to downplay.

       Exactly. To me, the “multiple shooters to one shooter” angle is a red flag. Listening to the scanner and they have not once said there was only one suspect.

       Being honest though, if these guys are genuinely trying to figure out a situation as dire as this, I'm sure there will be changing story lines as everyone is caught in the craze trying to piece together what's happening and how to stop it.

       This happens all the time though. Right after a shooting happens, people panic and begin seeing shooters everywhere. People mistake police for shooters. People mistake people running away from the shots as shooters chasing others. People get confused where the shots are coming from and assume they're coming from multiple directions. That why like 99% of the time there's a "multiple shooters search", it turns out to be a lone gunman. It's not a red flag - it's typical.

       I think there's a distinction to be made between someone (who has a reason to create this hypothetically) intentionally pulling down to one shooter and the media doing it, the latter of which can happen both with and without agency.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side note, if there was a entity (that I'm assuming is of a profile that would require some semblance of secrecy and would prefer for this to not be questioned, so basically not natural terrorists) performed these shootings simultaneously in multiple places, and the game plan was to just say "one did it lol" as their game plan, that would a comically bad plan.  Further I don't really get why they'd pull it down intentionally, it seems counterproductive to what I imagine someone would like to portray imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying there haven't been comically bad plans, just saying its more probable (four hours after it happened, ofc) that its the media pushing it with or without agency, just based on all of this and how much the media falls over themselves for the number of reasons they do

       Isn't that how you execute an operation and blame it on a cut-out/fall guy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Draw your cutout into a group, come up with a plan and then convince the cutout he's the guy they're invested in performing the operation.  Only the operators know the guy really can't be counted on, so there are backup/secondary operatives who guarantee the mission goes down.  The whole thing is planned so that the cutout is nearly guaranteed to get killed, thus making the "lone gunman" narrative impossible to question and the conspiracy's evidence dying with the cutout.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying this actually happened, but since this modus operandi can be applied after the fact to nearly every lone gunman shooting, it becomes kind of standard conspiracy theory logic.

       Okay, so here is how it works because
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has very strong opinions without knowing jackshit about any of this works.
      </p>
      <p>
       People confuse SWAT and heavily armed officers for additional gunmen; in the campus stabbing a couple months ago or whenever that was, there were reports of multiple gunmen there too, even though it was just a dickhead with a knife, for the exact same reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same reason why there were reports of gunmen in adjacent casinos; visibly armed cops clearing the area, civilians call them in.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the police kill the
       <em>
        actual lone shooter
       </em>
       and suddenly people stop dying, and they tell the press, of course everyone reports on it simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
       These "strange things" have reasonable explanations if you just think for a second. Every fucking time,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       leaps from ignorance to grand fucking criminal conspiracy.

       There's also potentially hundreds calling police/talking to media etc. recounting their version of events. It takes time to figure out all that information. It's also better to assume worst case and act on their being multiple shooters just incase.

       Your probably right, not like the government has a problem killing people elsewhere. If it is a conspiracy it would be a false flag where they hire a gunman or recruit a crazy guy and give him a gun then shoot a bunch or real and innocent people because hiring a army of people to fake a whole attack would cost a lot of money, and why would the elites actually care enough to hire actors instead of the alternative.

       Serious question; If they are using machine guns, shouldn’t the death toll be in the high hundreds by now? Seems like the death count is very low for multiple machine gunners... which of course is good, less death the better, but it strikes me as odd, the videos posted sound like a war zone 😔

       Would be miraculous if this "2" number they keep saying holds, at least 100+ shots fired into a compact crowd of 30k, most wearing short shorts and tank tops, no cover in general.

       Sheriff just said during the press conference that they're looking at 20+ dead and 100+ wounded. Apparently there's video somewhere of a girl talking about a woman coming into the front row about 45 minutes before the shooting started saying that they were all going to die.

       Far distance and lack of knowledge on how to actually shoot a automatic probably. Plus death toll is 22 now, probably going to skyrocket over night as people die in hospital or are found over the next few hours.

       Competent people rarely go off their nut and shoot places up.

       Oh, totally. Leaving some of his choice life moments out of the equation, he seems like a fine dude. I'd certainly be honored to fight alongside him if ever there is a fascist coup d'etat. All that said, given his Trump endorsement, his legal trouble involving his violent and bizarre antics, but also considering and weighing in the historical genocide of his own Armenian family genocide at the hands of fascists, he's kind of a mixed bag politically speaking, so I'm not certain for which side he'd fight.

       Yeah, he was also 400 yards from where the shooter was. You could be a foot away and not know what's going on. That doesn't tell you anything about whether it's a false flag or not. I'm not suggesting this is a false flag, but if there are dots, we should be connecting them.

       The dots have been connected. The dude killed himself. You don't buy it? Will there ever be massacre where we accept the official FBI release? I blame J. Edgar Hoover, who as its founding director undermined its reliability by manipulating its trust to target and harass Americans, our celebrities and our most prominent civil rights advocate. No one has trusted them since. Comey? Out with him. No good. Sad. Mueller? This guy is breaking my balls!

       He is purportedly an eye witness. Take it for what it is worth. It means little to me, but it might be vital to a legitimate investigation. Ask yourself what it might mean to this community, commonly intent in their formulating their own independent opinion, despite the widely accepted information available to them, as was the case in Sandy Hook, 9/11, etc.

       Are you just putting words together in sequence? What I'm asking you is why you take his presence as an eyewitness to mean it couldn't possibly have been a government-sponsored event.

       I don't think it's a false flag. I don't think Sandy Hook was fake. I don't think 911 was rigged. But your conclusion isn't supported by the record.

       While concise, my statement was plenty coherent and that you disagree with it doesn't make it nonsense. I merely stated my opinion as I'm free to do under the freedom of expression you so dearly claim to value while lashing out at those with whom you disagree.

       LOL you changed it from "you're an asshole." OK, let's try this again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your ORIGINAL POST was "DB's presence confirms this is not a false flag." You claim to have subsequently answered HOW his presence confirms it is not a false flag. You have not done so. I'm not even really interested in your response except to the extent it stirs you to the realization that you can't derive the background of the event from some instagram celebrity's presence.

       I don't misunderstand the term. I simply don't believe it was a false flag and even if it didn't persuade anyone here, today, I still expect that the typical gun nut community will value the eye witness testimonial of Blizerian and their gun nut ilk. Also, Blizerian didn't use the term at all, so you're mistaken there.

       I was referring to your words here, "Blizerian is misunderstanding the term." Blizerian did not use the term at all. I alone used the term in my own persuasion. Just because it doesn't speak to you doesn't mean no one is listening.

       Yes. Is the emphasis meant on "

       FOIA wasn't a joke when it exposed the FBI's own founding director as a tyrant who manipulated the FBI and abused their power to for a widespread harassment campaign against American celebrities, the civil rights movement and against the best interest of black Americans. Hell, even the FBI can't claim the FBI is a good thing, so I'm right there with you, man.

       In this video? I didn't hear him say anything like that. He was early on the scene so maybe he had a chance to be a first responder, but when he got back to his room he realized that SWAT was already handling it.

       if im not mistaken, i could swear I hear more than one automatic weapon. it doesnt sound like any M-16 or AR-15. Its much heavier. I believe during the second volley of fire you can hear yet another weapon.

       His rate of fire changes even within the same ... fire cycle? Not sure what the term is, but as he's unloading whatever he's firing you can hear a variable rate of fire. Points to bump firing to me.

       With the weird varying rate of fire Im gonna guess it was a bump fire stock, or a shitty conversion that was able to run away when it got too hot and out of spec.

       Two different rates of fire can be accounted for by echoes and the "crack" of the bullet followed by the noise from the gun firing.

       The rate of fire is not consistent. And it's not winding up or down. It varies through.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most likely this is due to the bump firing technique others have posted about. It involves removing your trigger hand front the gun and locking it in place, then using the recoil and reboot of the rifle off of your shoulder back in to the rigid trigger finger to fire another round.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd never heard of it before last night. But in watching a video of it it makes sense to me that this is probably what you're hearing. The placement of the finger, the movement of the body as he fires and adjusts aim, could all create a change gun's recoil travel distance altering the rate of fire.

       If that's the case you should hear an echo of every single shot. Granted there is almost a second delay between the shooter and the point of impact, some of that sound overlaps as it bounces off of buildings at varying distances. What I'm saying is you wouldn't hear shot, shot, shot, shot, echo, shot, echo without hearing 3 more echos afterwards. 1 shot, x echos. But it will always be the same multiple of echos, unless a few skyscrapers duck for cover.

       Bullets also make a cracking noise as they fly through the air, it is from them moving faster than the speed of sound. You will hear that before the actual gunshot.

       Yeah echos add to the effect but I thought you could hear 2 distinct patterns. Its not a high rpm gun slower probably a longer action say a 7.62x51 round. He probably switched between loaded guns but the weird part was they both sounded FA. If this was done with a bumpfire device then that market is toast.

       Everyone thinks they are a hero, I imagine they have metal detectors there which is what makes people sitting ducks at big events. I'd assume a lot of that crowd (especially country fans) carries guns, but probably left them in the car because of security, even if they all had guns, you'd be insane to return fire at building with thousands of innocent people and likely be shot by police or certainly arrested.

       As pro-gun I am, I don't condone carrying firearms at a concert.  Mixing hundreds of people, confined spaces, alcohol, and energetic young men with guns is not a good mix.  Carry a gun requires great responsibility and self-awareness, and determining when/where it is and is not is part of that responsibility.

       Yeah I'm sorry but anyone pretending they'd stick around to go fistacuffs with a shooter while selflessly body shielding a crowd of people is fucking misjudging themselves. What kind of cunt shames someone for trying to save their own life?

       I'm so confused because I watched that video,  he was just on the news and his narrative on the news doesn't  match this video.  He was in his vehicle driving home and on the news he is saying he saved his buddy that was shot and transported 4 wounded in his truck and one died in his arms.  What really makes me wonder,  it is completely different than this video where he talks about a womans brains falling out.  Idk, but its disturbing me.  The whole thing is sick.

       Yes, you are correct in both regards. There were multiple posts about craigslist postings from a company called Crowds on Demand in Las Vegas and it was speculated by many here that those postings were for crisis actors for a planned tragedy at the McGregor Mayweather fight. Seems this could fit the bill too.

       It was over a month ago at this point. I have no idea how to find those topics, but searching for "Crowds on Demand" along with other words like "conspiracy", "Vegas", and "McGregor Mayweather" may help. I used
       <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;amp;q=%22crowds+on+demand%22+vegas+conspiracy+site%3Areddit.com">
        this search on google
       </a>
       and turned up a few examples, like
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ujrmw/crowds_on_demand_in_las_vegas_prepare_for_a_riot/">
        this r/conspiracy thread
       </a>
       that includes a screencap of the group's craigslist post.

       You can also search "Crowds on Demand" without Vegas and notice how every single post corresponds to the location of a major political rally (there are literally hundreds of posts in every major American city). Those posts are made by alt-righters in advance of their Nazi protests so they can point to it and say "look! Soros plants!" when liberals show up. It's a fake false-flag.

       I said they were thought to be hiring crisis actors for a planned tragedy. In other words, they'd be hiring people who would be interviewed on local news immediately following the event. I never said they were committing the terrorism themselves, nor has anyone else I've seen. That's a really funny strawman you built there.

       This is sad, to me. There are countless "players" (not crisis actors) who play around with this world like it's their very own sandbox. Just about all of these schemes revolve around controlling, containing, limiting, and dumbing-down the masses. There are billions of dollars up-for-grabs for just about any agenda out there, and these players? They all run their schemes without a single care if you live or die - these are megalomaniac, psychopaths. There are true maniacs running this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, when something unusual happens - which has significant legal and financial implications, a rational first question is: was this just a crazy person? Or was this a game of one of those psychopaths of one of our psychopath owners. Not only is this a reasonable question, it's been documented history for as long as history has been kept. There are countless examples of false-flag attacks. These lethal "games" have been going on for a long time. And yes, getting back to "crisis actors" - they have been used in every one of these events, and are a required element. So, if you find a crisis actor, then you have a small bit of evidence that this may not be what it appears to be at face value.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, we can just go your route - sit in front of MSNBC, zone out, and take everything they say as fact... right?

       I do think the whole "crisis actor" bullshit in the conspiracy realm has been hand fed by the groups that benefit from making these places seem insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we only had real conspiracy discussion here, it would be too easy to convert a lot of people and make them understand how much actual fuckery, documented, undeniable fuckery has went on and still goes on in this world on a large scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if we mix in hologram planes, crisis actors, flat earth, etc, it discredits everything and makes most people want to keep far away so they are not branded a tinfoil hat nut.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure 5% of the people here really believe the crisis actor nonsense, but since 95% of posts talk about it, I have to assume that there are other forces at work to insert this so heavily into every good thread.

       Actors who are paid to act as though they have just experienced a shooting or something of the like. The Sandy Hook parents are actors, and not particularly good ones. They can be seen multiple times laughing and joking about the "death" of their child.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it curious that there are users in this thread actively trying to downplay the notion of crisis actors, which in the case of Sandy Hook has been proven beyond doubt. I'm not at all saying that they have been used in this incident, merely pointing that users who want to attack people in regards to Sandy Hook theories may not be entirely trustworthy.

       crisis actor was originally a term for people who worked with police, emergency services, military and security services organizations doing mock-up training drills of horrific situations like plane crashes and mass-shootings.
      </p>
      <p>
       their job is to scream and cry and fake-bleed everywhere and generally act like anyone would in a high-intensity, crisis-type event, to allow the trainees the chance to get a feel for what actually responding to a school-shooting or something ACTUALLY feels like, irl, and to be able to perform more effectively when it happens, because they know what to expect.
      </p>
      <p>
       its a legit job, and it has some crossover with the actual acting profession, in that it pays better than being an extra, and requires similar skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       at some point, some bright spark came across a casting call, and decided that crisis actors were actually actors being hired for media-covered events that were fake (((false flag))) operations being pulled off by obama/elitists/jews in order to manipulate americans in one way or another
      </p>
      <p>
       the usual target for these allegations are tied in with gun rights, so the sandy hook massacre right, was a "false flag operation" cynically engendering support for obama to destroy the second amendment, and all those distraught parents you saw crying on the news?? they were "crisis actors" taking money in order to destroy your right to bear arms as a proud American patriot.
      </p>
      <p>
       well and good.

       the bit that gets me, however, is that the US government has NEVER been shy of killing people, either foreign or domestically. That they would even
       <em>
        consider
       </em>
       such an unwieldy and falsifiable method as inventing a bunch of children to fake-murder, forging birth certificates, staging a massacre at a school, getting the reporters involved, having a bunch of fake funerals, and then paying the
       <del>
        parents
       </del>
       crisis actors for the rest of their lives to keep up the pretense when they could just have some crazy fuckwit go in and ACTUALLY shoot up a school??
      </p>
      <p>
       you know what governments care about more than gun laws?

       MONEY.

       I have nothing against questioning authority and the official accounts of events, but when the vast majority of those types of comments here are based around a method that can be dismissed with a half-effort of critical thought, the claim of "crazy" seems to stick. Wanting so badly for this to be a thing that simply logic is dismissed... is crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, the comment I originally replied to actually makes sense, and I don't have many reasons to say why I'd conclude it absolutely isn't wrong.

      <p>
       The others.... a child has the capacity to explain why they don't make sense.

       Oh okay. So you're  subjectively drawing the where you want, without any sort of substantial proof. That's called a confirmation bias.  You see them as intellectually weak simply because  you don't agree with them. Cool, good to know that's why you're here: to try to shit on people.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't even have the truth. So please shut the fuck up and let people discuss what they want and how they want to.

       "The others"- dude you're so full of shit. You're just looking for comments that confirm your view  while dismissing others as 'crazy'

       You're aware that people use those kinds of services for like...everything, right? Movie fillings, reality TV shows, grand openings. Fucking youtubers put out Craigslist ads for crowd extras. Y'all are reaching high to think there are hundreds of average Joes hiding entire plots of mass shootings for some money. Crisis actors are always the weakest thread to follow in these mass shooting posts.

       Yes they do.  Most of the people "blowing it open" are also part of the deep state as well.  They always control both sides.  Eventually this will all be common knowledge and will be used to fuel the "revolution" that they will guide into their new synthesis.

       Someone with a lot of power feared losing that power. So they coerce someone with less power than them to enact terror on the American people despite lacking a clear political message to send with their irrational violence. Because terrorizing American citizens helps this sort of person maintain and expand their political power, not only over Americans but around the globe.

       gotta be honest, if shit like this is done by the government, I don't think the orders are coming from the president or anyone near him, much less someone like Trump (especially if we're sticking with the line that he's an incompetent fool).

       I can however see deeper power structures pulling something like this off in order to push his hand.  "Oh you don't want to do what we say about Syria/Russia/NK?  Look at what we can do and how easily we can do it. You will obey us."

       He was 65, after sixty-five years of shit, it might not take much for you to snap and go out thinking 'I want to be remembered'. Kids like attention, if you don't nurture that good behaviour, they're going to act-out. Some people don't grow up.

       First of all, it's always likely that someone snaps. I think anyone with an IQ over room temperature can figure out how to kill a lot of people if they really wanted to.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it is also true, and documented that sinister groups linked to and funded by our government or certain radical political beliefs are all over the internet trying to radicalize weak minded people that are in a bad place. There are many places you can go seeking answers, seeking help, seeking to vocalize your rage, where these snakes are waiting to brainwash someone into committing a mass violent act.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be that an angry bitter man snapped and wanted to inflict pain on as many as he could, it could also be that he was pushed over the edge by trained operatives that fed his rage and loneliness, we'll never know.

       It could just be a disgruntled guy that lost at the tables in Vegas. He's not going to be accurate at 300 yards with a sub-machine gun, but with a densely packed crowd he doesn't have to be. 9mm is lethal at that distance, as I'm learning. But the talking heads lie to us enough that I'm going to question their story.

       No political, religious, or sociopolitical motive, no side to point blame at, can't blame the left for lack of gun control because he used illegal guns, can't blame the right because he wasn't targeting minorities or the left. This is an odd situation. I can't see it being a false flag because there's no agenda gain in this attack.

       I'm sure that there's more info to come, and there's also speculation that he used something called a gat crank for the auto fire. That would make both the weapon and the modification legal to own.

       It's a perfect scenario for pointing the blame squarely at guns though. The movement to ban guns outright has always been talked over due to other factors in previous shootings (ISIS, mental health, white supremacist groups, drugs, etc.) But this time, the worst shooting in American history, there is nothing in the way and all the focus can be placed on guns themselves. It's Christmas day for the left.

       Well to be fair it probably was politically motivated and he was shooting at a country music concert which means he probably was mad at conservatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway there are sources saying that he was ANTIFA and had just converted to ISIS. Just be honest with yourself.. its probably political. ANTIFA said they were going to start hurting people this fall anyway.

       This is a prime example of humans being bad at statistics. You can read about this in the book "fast and slow" thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       They ask you to consider a male, they ask you to guess which occupation this male belongs to based on set characteristics, farmer or libertarian. all of them are things you might associate with a libertarian, well read,  introverted, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost everyone that takes the test says the male is clearly a libertarian, without considering the fact male farmers outnumber male librarians 10-1, so obviously, you'd be more likely to find someone with that set of characteristics farming.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you just did is the same. You didn't consider the other factors here.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was a 65 year old, wealthy, retired white male. This demographic is overwhelmingly conservative, if we were going to take a shot in the dark, statistically, it's more likely he's a conservative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a thought - wait for more information before you start making wild and absurd accusations, and the fact you think a 65 year old retired white business owner was somehow involved with ISIS is even more hilarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS claims every attack that happens because they know dumb people will believe it.

       By mental gymnastics, do you mean statistics and math?  And I'm not saying he wasn't - I'm saying wait for the actual facts. Also, that concert was full of Hispanics too. It's perfectly likely he wanted to kill as many people as possible, locally. A massive open-air music event would be a clear target if someone wanted to do that.

       By mental gymnastics, do you mean statistics and math?  And I'm not saying he wasn't - I'm saying wait for the actual facts. Also, that concert was full of Hispanics too. It's perfectly likely he wanted to kill as many people as possible, locally. A massive open-air music event would be a clear target if someone wanted to do that.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Stephen Gorham Paddock, Jr., 71, of Colorado Springs, passed away on January 24, 2013. Steve was born on July 28, 1941 in Cleveland, Ohio to the late Stephen and Helene (McNally) Paddock. After attending high school in Dallas, Texas, Steve graduated from Georgia Tech in Atlanta, Georgia. He worked in Aerospace engineering for over 40 years and retired from the Boeing Aerospace Company in 2002. On October 31, 1964, Steve married Louise "Lou" McConnell and together raised three children.

       I'd have to see credible proof of the Islamic comments thing. But this was an interesting little tactic you used here, did you think I wouldn't catch it?  After you made the dubious claim (he made Islamic comments) you said the police were aware of him, trying to make it seem as if the police said he had made Islamic comments.

       Indeed, the police were aware of him, and here's what they said:

       Try harder. Youre obviously going through some pretty severe mental gymnastics just so you can deny the obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some conservative media has been bad at times but never has it got to the point which liberal media has recently. Literally all of them are calling Trump supporters and conservatives nazis and racists and even hinting at punching them in the face or telling people to end relationships with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have been making people paranoid and targeting weak minded liberals. Liberals are much more often people with mental disorders or personality disorders. Conservatives are much more likely to be responsible or familiar with safe handling of firearms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sure at some point there has been conservative media which was bad in the same way but that was probably some fringe thing. Fox news never tells people to go out and kill people. Meanwhile we have CNN and MSNBC comparing Trump supporters to nazis and saying they are all racists and fascists which need to be stopped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its no fucking surprise they pushed someone over the edge finally. Radical leftism appeals to people with mental disabilities and they know this. Regular leftism appeals to people who are disenfranchised so its obvious that the media has been trying to push people to do violent acts. You are fucking blind if you cannot see this.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I just included what Alex Jones said because i thought others might find it interesting. You can choose to not believe the part about him being islamic if you want but I still think its a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly. Youre being ignorant if you dont acknowledge the most obvious motive is shooting conservatives. Why would he pick a country music concert? Maybe it turns out to be something else later but you cannot deny that the simplest explanation would be that he wanted to killed conservatives, and probably white people at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       How the fuck was he supposed to know that their were a bunch of hispanic people there? Average person usually associates country music with white people and conservatism. Also this was supposedly an even which had something to do with christians. So maybe that had something to do with it..
      </p>
      <p>
       Again. If you havent noticed the constant race baiting and radicalization which liberal mainstream media has been broadcasting lately you are being obtuse and disingenuous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again if you deny that the simplest motive is to kill conservatives because it was a country music concert you are being disingenuous.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an obvious motive staring you in the face yet youre trying as hard as you can to find something else to believe in because it hurts your ego to believe that liberals could do anything wrong ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also just fucking google "trump supporters racist" or "trump supporters nazis" to see how the media is trying to signal to people that conservatives deserve violence. Its fucking obvious and you fucking know it.

       Fbi hasnt debunked anything. They have a public and a private face and Alex claimed to have had inside knowledge. I dont care if you believe it or not and I'm not even sure if that part is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the pictures of the guy in the pussy hat are not Paddock that does not disprove that this was probably a hate crime against country music  fans specifically, because they are perceived to be mostly white and conservative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll concede that Conservative media sometimes goes to far, like with abortion, and that mainstream media in general is designed to subvert the general population. I'll also concede there might have been violent psychos that were inspired or motivated by conservative media. But
       <strong>
        currently
       </strong>
       liberal media is objectively more radicalizing.
      </p>
      <p>
       No question about it. They are literally telling people that they are in a war with Russia and that we must overthrow our government, and it's remarkably similar to 2003 when both sides of the mainstream media convinced people to support overthrowing Iraq's government. This is incredibly radicalizing and many users on r/politics literally think any other opinions must be coming from a Putin agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainstream sources may not
       <em>
        explicitly
       </em>
       call for violence but they directly call or compare Trump, Trump supporters, white people, conservatives, libertarians, anyone calling for less immigration and anyone calling for more freedom and independence (like states rights) to fascists, nazis, KKK, racists, xenophobes. The understanding is that groups like Nazis or the KKK are "crossing the line" and therefore deserve violence (like a punch in the face) or their rights infringed upon such as free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keith Olberman literally just called the NRA a "terrorist organizaiton" even though they are nothing but a group of people who defend American's right to defend themselves. Ironic because he's using projection to deflect the obvious fact that the las vegas shooting was probably a terrorist hate crime against white conservatives. Olberman also defends terrorist by insinuating that immigration does not lead to increased terrorist attacks like in Europe.

       Olberman's latest vid where he calls the NRA "terrorists." He also calls Trump a nazi and a "russian agent."

       They don't explicitly say go out and kill Trump supporters but they are constantly race baiting and telling people that Trump is a leader of nazis and white supremacists. A common line they say all the time is that "not all trump supporters are white supremacists but all white supremacists are Trump supporters." Do you understand how this fucking radicalizes people, especially weak minded liberals that their only political opinion is they want handouts from the government?

       say something. That means anyone who doesnt say the magic words is autmatically a racists. I personally lost a friend becuase I agreed that ANTIFA were violent. They are conditioning people to perceive people as racists just for calling out radical leftism or
       <em>
        not

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Completely ignores that ANTIFA starts the violence and that people have to defend themselves. They are demonizing Trump supporters and praising ANTIFA as non-violent actual anti fascists when we all know that ANTIFA is nothing but violent communists!
      </p>
      <p>
       There are literally hundreds if not thousands of more examples. You see they are not explicitly saying go out and kill Trump supporters but they are putting them into categories like "racists" or "fascists" which automatically justify violence against them. You cannot deny this and it's objective fact. They are conditioning people to excuse violence against Trump supporters because they are sub human or demon-like racist or nazis.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        They are telling people also that all Trump supporters want violence against minorities.
       </strong>
       This is enough for lots of people to justify violence against them or infringe upon their rights, like free speech. I've even seen the Young Turks making fun of free speech by saying the
       <strong>
        freeze peach
       </strong>
       meme.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also i dont have time to link all the times that "The Young Turks" have insinuated violence against conservatives, libertarians, or white people but they do it continuously.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are comparing
       <strong>
        fringe
       </strong>
       "conservative" media like stormfront to
       <strong>
        mainstream
       </strong>
       liberal media. What makes radical leftist media so insidious is that it's presented as the de facto status quo. It's presented as the mainstream reality. Fox news surely doesn't match CNN or MSNBC in terms of radicalization and people like Tucker Carlson even debate against ANTIFA members and Carlson took the position that
       <strong>
        no one deserves violence for speech.
       </strong>
       You are bending over backwards to try and defend neoliberal authoritarians that try to destabilize and dive the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       But even "alternative" "right wing" or libertarian media often tells their audience not to incite violence. Alex Jones, who you wrongly hate so much, continuously tells his audience not to be violent towards liberals. He has many crazy listeners and they have done things wrong before but that's not because Alex is telling them to do so. And the radical neoliberal globalist media twists his words and even his supporters's words.
      </p>
      <p>
       They made Roger Stone to look violent when he was simply warning people that impeaching trump could lead to violence. He even said that he does no condone violence! Yet the media twisted his words which then could even have the negative effect which they are criticizing!
      </p>
      <p>
       Look how radicalizing leftist media causes people to commit violence towards Alex himself! They turn people into literal fucking goblins! There were multiple people that attacked Alex that day and this is only one example:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkW_x2MNf2w">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkW_x2MNf2w
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So. I understand how you can say that conservative media has historically negatively influenced people in the past and they certainly have unfairly inspired prejudice against people like drug addicts, or women that get abortions. But almost always conservatives are smart enough to tell their listeners that violence is never okay, especially recently as the liberal media has begun to escalate their calls for violence!
      </p>
      <p>
       And just because trailer trash has low iqs that ignores how conservatives usually have more money and are more successful. Billionaires are often conservatives or libertarian.

       <p>
        Paddock booked rooms overlooking the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago in August and the Life Is Beautiful show near the Vegas Strip in late September, according to authorities reconstructing his movements before he undertook the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

       Sure it's possible he was targeting other gatherings. It's also possible that he was a gun runner, as well as other theories. The police made a statement about how they were investigating "radicalization" so that partially confirms Alex Jones's source that said literature was found in his hotel and even pictures showed a notepad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you completely discredit Jones but that's actually being unreasonable and you probably have such a knee jerk reaction because you have been conditioned by mainstream shills like Colbert or Oliver. Alex has been right numerous times and people actually do seek him out to leak information. He also has some degree of integrity even if he is known for gratuitously exaggerating and using hyperbole.
      </p>
      <p>
       An example of his exaggeration was when he had a member of the Navy Seals on his show who said that the gunfire sounded like multiple shooters yet the Seal said that with the caveat that in an urban environment the echoes make it confusing and impossible to say for sure. The next day on air Jones said that "I just had a navy seal on who said it definitely sounded like there was more than one shooter." This is the kind of truth bending Alex is capable of but he still has an amount of integrity and rapport with his listeners.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example he is known for famously predicting 9/11:

      <p>
       Also Alex Jones is not racist like everyone thinks he is hes a fucking suuuuuuuper open minded guy and got super stoned and drunk on Joe Rogan's podcast. The reason that liberals are trying to paint him as a racist is because he is just the only one with balls enough to call out radical Islamists on air. But he also features Muslims on his show sometimes and they even talk about how fucked up parts of the fundamentalist culture are. Anyway it's ironic because liberals used to reject dogma but now defend it with regards to Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Anyway, my point is that it's likely someone really did contact Jones claiming to be Nevada Hostage Rescue.
       </strong>
       I can't verify his source but even Alex's employees questioned him on this while they were broadcasting and Alex has defended this source numerous times. I don't know if he verified them or not but i doubt that it was a bold faced lie. Mainstream media can afford to lie through their teeth but alternative media has to have some form of trust with their audience and Alex is ironically somewhat credible on a personal level.
      </p>
      <p>
       That taken into consideration plus the police's statements about investigating radicalization makes me think it's likely they found some sort of literature or hints that he was into Islam or ANTIFA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again that literature could have been a plant. This man could have been trying to orchestrate blame being put on Liberal media. It's possible that he was thinking about doing the same thing but reverse by attacking the other concerts you mentioned. Have you seen any of the forensic psychologists talk about this? The common theme in their analysis is that men usually have a motive, especially older men, when they do these kinds of things. His insanity could be multilayered and multifaceted.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also other theories like he was a gun runner. And there is no security footage that has been shown yet so that leaves a lot of questions. Apparently this guy had his own cameras as well. The whole thing leaves a lot of questions unanswered but I don't think my original theory was disingenuous as, again, the obvious first layer would be to look at the victims and speculate that he was targeting that group of people for a reason. I didn't mean for that theory to be the end all be all to this story but I think it was the obvious way to look at it from the first dimension of analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless liberal media, especially mainstream neoliberal media, is poignantly radicalizing and divisive. It seeks to paint conservatives, white people, or especially libertarians as the enemy. The fact they are targeting libertarians and capitalism, which in essence is just free trade, should be a huge red flag they are trying to brainwash people and get them to submit to authority, while also demonizing anyone who does not submit to authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you seen people saying that state's right's and low crime rates are dog whistling terms for racism? That is irrational and shows how
       <em>
        scared
       </em>
       the neoliberal establishment is of liberals realizing they would benefit from decentralized power. Trump getting elected proves how centralized power is vulnerable, like in our case, to the political pendulum. States rights would allow people to have their cake and eat it to but the neoliberals want control of the bakery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at this clickbait shite that tries to lump states rights in with random racism and even tries to demonize people that criticized Obama as racists:

      <p>
       Liberal media even calls anyone against mass immigration racists or xenophobes. There are perfectly rational reasons why someone might not want open borders. Crime rates are real verifiable statistics yet countries literally do not record the origin or ethnicity of criminals to mask the fact that immigration is correlated to rising crime rates, which is especially noticeable in small European countries. It also does not help immigrants that are already in a country if that country loses stability because of immigration.
       <strong>
        The bottom line is that neoliberal politicians know that immigrants are likely to vote for socialist policies which give them more power and immigration causes a runaway authoritarian snowball effect.

       The only right wing media which comes close to what the neoliberal establishment is peddling as mainstream, is extremist websites like storm front. Even Alex Jones has decency and tells his audience to respect people's rights. If you actually watch his show you will hear him constantly telling his listeners not to take the law into their own hands and always be model citizens, and its safe to say that since the Sandy Hook debacle, which he is apologetic for, he is careful to encourage his listeners in a healthy way and never to engage in violence. Meanwhile people like Rachel Maddow are telling their listeners that they are at war with Russia and to stop being friends with Trump supporters.

       Remember Iraqi WMDs? How are you not having flashbacks? I feel like its a case of Deja Vu. The mainstream neoliberal media is trying to tell people to overthrow their own government (regime change) based on a false narrative which would surely result in violence and a power vacuum. Except instead of ISIS gaining control it would be brutal authoritarians enacting a totalitarian police state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go look at r/politics. They are literally convinced that anyone that speaks out against them are Russian Agents. I have literally been accused of being an agent of Putin
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       times. That's fucking ridiculous and if you don't call that radicalizing brainwashing I don't know what the fuck is.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is that yes, this latest shooting could be more complicated but it's still not off the table and neoliberal media is going to cause acts of violence in the future if they haven't already. And I am not some tribalist either. In fact, I am liberal, but I am the real kind of liberal, the kind that actual believes in
       <em>
        liberty
       </em>
       (You know word which liberal is derived from).
      </p>
      <p>
       Liberalism actually used to respect freedom of the individual before it was fucking subverted and hijacked by
       <em>
        actual Russians
       </em>
       in the 1960s when the KGB planted agents in American Academia to traffic collectivism and blame the individual's freedom as a cause for inequality:

       Marxism is really nothing more than rationalizing violence and theft with jealously. That is why it's so dangerous. It's the same spirit which compels people to steal from corporations or rationalize theft or violence against rich people who they wrongly perceive as their oppressors. Sometimes things really should be free like with information property but if ANTIFA had its way there would be people forcefully entering your home and demanding to sleep there and redistribute any possessions you have worked for.

       The fact is your conspiracy has been irrefutably debunked at this point in relation to the recent mass shooting.

       Cool you just admitted that i win. The reason you don't like reading it is because all of it is fucking true. And if you would have bothered to look, I conceded that it's possible that he wasn't only targeting conservatives, yet I provided irrefutable evidence that mainstream liberal media is
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       more radicalizing than mainstream conservative media, and even Alex Jones is much less radicalizing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also
       <em>
        hasn't
       </em>
       been completely debunked and did you know  that all 3 of the concert stages he targeted were facing Mecca? Did you know that the police had made a statement they were investigating "radicalization"? This corroborates Alex Jones's source within the HRT team that said they found ISIS and ANTIFA literature, although I conceded it's possible that he left that writing there on purpose and could have a multi layered motive to make different groups look bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway I should expect nothing less from a
       <em>
        radicalized
       </em>
       liberal such as yourself. You cannot bare to look at evidence that you are wrong because it's like holy water to a demon possessed individual such as yourself. Or should I say it's more like blasphemy which challenges your deeply ingrained dogmas.
       <strong>
        You have been conditioned so hardcore by neoliberal mainstream media that you actually support CNN doxxing redditors that say mean things on the internet.
       </strong>
       You don't care about free speech and all you want is death to the infidels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just know that, even though many real liberals like myself keep our mouths shut in the workplace and such; when you open your mouth talking about how Russia "hacked" the election, or you talk about impeaching Trump or supporting neoliberal  authoritarianism, we cringe on the inside and make a mental note that you are a total dumbass. You think that you are in the right and everyone supports you but there is a
       <em>
        silent majority
       </em>
       and the neoliberal status quo won't last for long.
      </p>
      <p>
       And btw all your comments are giant blocks which use a bunch of quotes. Funny how you're only a fan of that writing style when it reinforces
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       violent dogmas.

       The sheriff and the author of that article are liars. That article said there were no other political references or evidence of extremism even though the same Sheriff said they were investigating extremism earlier, and he is a confirmed liar and the FBI stands behind him in every fucking press conference and makes sure he doesn't spill the beans. That article clearly lied when it said Paddock hadn't been to any countries lately because there were pictures of him in
       <strong>
        Dubai
       </strong>
       dated to only a few months ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, the case seems much more complicated now with the new evidence that is emerging. There was a helicopter close to the mandalay bay that was giving off a transceiver signal of southwest airlines then joined a group of 7 sightseeing helicopters when it left the rooftop.
       <strong>
        Paddock's fucking hard drive was stolen from his home after it was made into a crime scene. And his brother was busted for child pornography and his other brother for drugs.
       </strong>
       Who knows what kind of political evidence there might be on that missing hard drive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, the whole thing seems much more suspicious and there is evidence of organized crime, including Paddock's family, and even private helicopter pilots being involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately after this event happened my intention was to draw attention to the victims and the possible political motives of shooting up as country music festival, because the neoliberal progressives would not even consider that he may have been targeting conservatives, which is very hypocritical because you know they would be up in arms
       <strong>
        if he had shot up a rap concert.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, it seems that the Las Vegas HRT did really contact Alex Jones or at least someone claiming to be them, because he even admits now that they could have been feeding him misinfo or trying to hint at something else.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you actually look into this case it's very confusing and there are a bunch of possibilities, but considering the radar evidence about the helicopters I think it was probably a heist that set up Paddock as a distraction  and fall guy. The place where the helicopter landed is connected to the Mandalay by a series of hallways and corridors. Ever seen Oceans 11?

       Repeating yourself doesn't make you look any more intelligent. That article is full of conflicting information with what Sheriff Lombardo already said. And you are acting like it's impossible for someone to think that Trump may be doing the right thing with the stock market but still target conservative country music festival goers or still be radicalized from
       <strong>
        neoliberal regressive failstream media.

       I voted for Trump. You are an embarrassment. "Support for a true president"? He claimed he was going to be the president of ALL the people yet he has been so divisive. I supported him so much that I had a bumper sticker so don't even try to label me a shill. You are a disgrace to any level headed person who voted for Trump but has the sense to realize that he is not being the president that he said he would be.

       strange how theres always some catalyst the first year in office. Its weird in 2017 you make a controversial joke on fb and get a knock at your door the next morning, mass surveillance of suspected terrorists yet shit like this still happens right on time. I wonder what the motivation of this security breach is? Radical islamists? North Koreans? Home grown White Terrorists? How can we use this tragedy to our advantage?

       They are echoes bouncing off the hotel and other large structures in the area. What I did notice though is a couple of flashes coming from the top left of the hotel building. It might just be reflections/glare, but it looked like it was coming from the same spot throughout the video.

       Also they are out in the middle with no cover whatsoever that they don't even know what direction to go or are already wounded therefore can't move, nobody really knows how you would react if it was you in real life, I know instincts would tell you to run and take cover but here is all open to the slaughter

       I know how I would react because I was in the military, then I was a contractor, then I worked in law enforcement. Get low, move unpredictably, find cover, and either look for an escape route or look to engage and turn the tables. I don't expect civilians to calmly think these steps through in their head in the middle of a situation like that but I don't see any urgency or attempt to do anything from most of the people in the videos. They're just randomly milling about or standing around.

       They don't realise the shots are coming from above. They think there is someone in the crowd shooting and thus are trying to stay low to the ground thinking that will keep them from the shooters view. Most people would not be so quick to realise the shooting was coming from high up.

       Reposted from a different thread I commented on, but it applies. If ever in a situation like this always remember -- distance is your best friend. Not reacting is the absolute worst thing you can do. Get away as fast as possible. LEO friend told me this and it always rings in my head when I see people freeze. Act, retreat, survive. I pray none of you ever need this advice, but don't forget it.

       Nobody prepares for something like this. It wasn't meant to be a criticism whatsoever. A lot of people simply do freeze when overwhelmed. I agree, it is sad to see. However, if you've never been around a firearm, heard one in the distance, or simply don't have it in you -- I can understand. You need to go back to your instincts. Unfortunately in a situation like this you need them the most. React, find cover, and create distance.

       We jyst went through active aggressor training at work. Run. Hide. Fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       They pointed out that our will be easy to freeze up but to counter that you should prepare by thinking about what you would do. Especially at workb where you are at most of the day. What is your escape route. Do you have anything on your desk you can throw. If you have to kick yourself in your office move furniture ahead of time (keep a book case by the door) so it's easier to block the door.
      </p>
      <p>
       They played the (heart breaking) audio recording of the school librarian who called 911 at Columbine. she directed the children to hide instead of run....and many of them died even though there was a window in the library. So learn that lesson- run if you can, hide if you can't run, fight as last resort, don't be a victim.

       Completely agree. Always have an exit, always be ready -- don't get caught with your pants down. Do anything you can to survive. Create distance, fight if needed, and don't be a victim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sad we live in a world like this, but people need to understand this.  99.9% of people aren't going to step in and help you. You can only help yourself, and others if possible.

       I know it's kind of weird but if you go to active aggressor training that is what they teach you. Don't cower in fear when you can run. And If you outnumber the shooter then do something about it. Don't let all of you be shot. If five people throw hat objects like a stapler for example all at once the attacker can be overwhelmed.

       Right... again... so run first. Buttttt if we outnumber the agitated active aggressors then find weapons to combat the assailant with whatever you can find. Awesome training sound superb.

       I agree on the "hide" part. Distance is your friend, like I originally said. However the training makes sense for the 90% of the population that won't react, or know what to do. We're all armchair quarterbacks at this point. Training makes you do things on instinct. Good or bad, but I'll take that 51% over 49% when your life is on the line. And your best shot is to get the hell out of the situation to begin with.

       In most of these active shooter situations, lets assume its a shooter and not "aggressor" like some people try to dumb it down...
      </p>
      <p>
       In a situation with a shooter, obviously shooting for mass casualty is what were using in our scenario... do you want to give him a full body target running away where you can't see him or predict his movements? What does honestly running away... usually down a hall or a building, running away gives the active shooter plenty of more opportunity to shoot MANY MORE people if people are moving.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, STOP, DROP AND ROLL as a best practice seems best to me. Stay down, usually active shooters shoot at 90 degree angle...
      </p>
      <p>
       if you roll around in a 3-4 circular ball crazily, your chances of an active shooter are only going to wound you drastically DROP if you do. (running away in masses creates a huge blob of a target that usually creates a disaster)
      </p>
      <p>
       IDENTIFY the assailant and start throwing everything and anything at him, not to piss them off but to throw off their programming. Most actors do not come in this situation saying hey, im gonna shoot a bunch of people and when they start throwing anythign at me i'm going to continue my gameplan, NO. They have to adapt to whatever it is coming at them, LITERALLY. It would not only break their concentration but cause a snap in usually their crazy psyched out brains....
      </p>
      <p>
       at least this is what makes sense to me, thinking about it for 15 minutes.

       Oh no trust me, I'm no good with a firearm, can't aim for shit and I even suck at computer games. I am all for people who want and know how to use them to be armed so its not only the bad guys with em. And I just don't agree with the run part... when you run, at least in there instructions is to run away, when you do that, what direction is your back to the active shooter? I'd rather not turn my back on that person.... wouldn't you agree?

       If it's life or death, 51% is better than 49%. Much less than half are capable, or equipped to react. Don't overestimate a crowd in a catastrophe. On a whole, fleeing works #'s wise. Again, morbid, but it saves more than otherwise. That's the most simple answer to your opinion.

       I didn't ask any opinions. I also doubt that in a mass shooting scenario more people running away from the shooter to allow him to continue to shoot would amount to less people being hit.

       ~~~~~~~~~~~~
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of September, General Electric signed a tentative agreement with SST, Inc., maker of the popular ShotSpotter gunshot detection system now in use in more than 90 cities worldwide.
ShotSpotter utilizes sophisticated acoustic triangulation technology to identify the location of gunfire from a wide range of firearms. According to the company, the system has the ability to pinpoint the location of shots fired to within 10 feet, notify police dispatchers in real time of a crime in progress, and help law enforcement agencies create databases to ascertain shooting trends.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Within 10 feet.... in 2015.... they have better technology we're sure... Las Vegas.... has this. Has to have this.

       sound echoes off of flat surfaces.  It looks like the arena was surrounded by several highrises.  A football field has a nearly 2 second echo.  So distinguishing the source of a shot amidst a flurry of echoes and reverberations would be very difficult in the chaos of a crowd.  Especially if you don't know how high up the gunman is positioned.

       Sometimes when I'm driving or just bored w nothing to occupy my mind, I envision myself in a crisis... Bank robbery, car crash, etc.. I think about what I would and should do. I feel like this has come in handy many times bc the times that I have found myself in emergency situations I feel like I react and act quickly. I don't always do exactly what i should have done, but at least I think on my feet, assess the situation and do something instead of just freeze like a dear.

       Many researchers in the field think that imagination evolved for exactly this purpose. The best way to handle a crisis is to train for it, if it's hard to train for, running the scenario in your head is the next best choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also why people are drawn to reading everything they can about situations like this, they are trying to keep the theoretical model in their head of how these things go down updated so they can run the simulation as accurately as possible.

       There's a YouTube channel called active self defense which gives some pretty great advice on what to do in an active shooter or armed robbery situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having been the victim of an armed robbery, I can tell you that it's hard to know what to do in the moment, especially if you're caught off guard and there are multiple gunmen like there were in my case.

       One of the keys points stressed is to not unholster
Immediately, you wait until the armed attacker is distracted, even momentarily and then unholster and do what needs to be done.

       I remember them talking about that. They show a few videos of guys trying to unholster too quick and shooter shoots them immediately. It's gotta take balls of steel to wait for the right time while a gun is in your face. Everyone's natural reaction is to go for their gun immediately

       That's what they teach you in the military, at least in Finland. Once the lead starts flying, first thing you do is drop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, in this scenario it wouldn't work if the shots were from and elevated position. But generally if you're being shot at, making your profile smaller is a good idea. Dropping to the ground might do the trick, usually.

       In a gunfight you should get the fuck down since both sides are exchanging fire, but in a terror situation like that laying on the floor it's going to be like shooting fish on the barrel for the shooter.

       Passivity training. You're supposed to wait in place for authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I'm at it, if you ever hear gunshots and panic, the first thing you need to do (other than ducking/getting small) is attempt to gauge the general direction of the mayhem. Once you know where it's coming from you can then intelligently move away from it or seek proper cover.

       Bullets flying through the air, the instinct is to get down out of the air. Mass confusion doesn't help, nor does not knowing where the shots are coming from. That said those "get down" spans absolutely added to the death toll exponentially, nobody had any cover at all.

       people didn't know where the shots were coming from. getting down if the gunman was ground level would've been a good idea since it sounded like it was coming from afar. obviously getting down when someone's raining shots on you from 30 stories up is a different story

       Run, Hide, Fight. When you have the chance always run, when running is not an option hide, when hiding is not a option grab whatever you can and prepare to fight. That is what we teach during active shooter training.

       If the shooter is in the same room with you, especially somewhere small like a club, I think it ought to be fight and encourage everyone else to fight. If you don't get his guns, the next guy will.

       If you've already lost the situation and you being a victim is inevitable, I agree. Fight for your life, all rules are completely off, do anything needed to survive. Great example: 9/11 Flight 93, "let's roll" passengers. However, they had no exit. If you don't have an equalizer, or another option (you 99% of the time do), flee. Let someone else take care of it with proper training/equipment.

       There is some science behind it, dont remember ever seeing numbers for where people got shot, but normally they dont last long and almost always a LEO arrives and thats when the shooter either takes his life or gets killed in a shootout. Thats the thing about it tho when it comes to adding the human variable its impossible to determine whats gonna happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: also youd be very surprised at the numbers of how fast we respond to the scene and end the chaos, now vegas is different as you see in the videos people had no idea where the shooter was.

       Right, which means they have not properly prepared for such event. This is the mistake, either not being prepared or a preparations being outdated/ or just broken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Understandably no one wants to prepare for 50 dead and 500 injured for a concert, but it happened, now what?

       We life vests on boats, what do we have for concert goers? Life needs to change, some way.

       Come on you honestly think a bunch of drunk concert goers returning fire at a hotel would've solved this??
Then we don't have one suspect we'd have HUNDREDS, all shooting at each other all not even knowing who the real shooter is. Terrorists would know this and take full advantage, you'd eventually not even have to shoot anyone anymore just throw fire works into crowds and sit back and watch them shoot each other in the chaos.

       Right, because all concert goers are either drunken idiots or just incapable of making logical decisions (like shooting into a hotel filled with innocent people in the distance with a handgun, or shooting everyone around them chaotically in a free for all manner) ... are you kidding me? Another classic generalization to say that good people shouldn't have the option of self defense.

       This was shockingly also part of the new hire on boarding process at a hospital I worked at in northern ca. Basically they said if there is an active shooter situation, barricade yourself in a room and block the door.  If someone has the intention they are coming in, arm yourself with anything that'd available and prepare to make your last stand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual advice from the hospital. Mind blown.

       This is true, but on the other hand many didn't know where the shots were coming from. In fact, I heard some on tape saying "it's just fireworks!" It can be paralyzing to need to run but not know whether you're running into or away from the threat.

       People just don't do that in vegas for some reason, it's crazy. When I moved there in 2006, there was a fire on the top floor of the Monte Carlo. I was playing poker there. The TVs are literally showing this fire spreading in the hotel I'm in, so I get up to leave. Everyone else looked at me like I was crazy for wanting to leave a building that was ON FIRE. Weird place, man.

       The most important thing is to not freeze up and go into shock. Keep your head down, run when the shooting stops while they are reloading. If possible, try and count how long it takes the perp to reload. When shooting picks up again, drop down to the ground, preferably behind cover. Rinse and repeat until you are out of the danger zone.

       I think they're rolling out the crisis actors on CBS. I said to my GF a half hour ago that it was weird that this hadn't started already. The first people they showed were two younger women where the one was literally telling the other what to say. Real or not, these goofballs ALWAYS pop up.

       No, that's not what was happening. One was helping the other recount the event. It would've been extremely chaotic during the whole scene, then having cameras, lights and microphones shoved in your face don't help lessen the stress.

       Guessing you've never been in an incredibly stressful situation. Then again, you clearly

       I absolutely 100% believe the event happened, someone in the small town I live in in Pennsylvania was attending it with his wife and he was killed. I watched some awful footage of bodies on the ground with blood everywhere and now the link has been take down. I was more observing that I think they mix these types of actors in sometimes to confuse people, that's all. And I could be wrong on that as well. I don't "want" there to be crisis actors because I believe the event happened it was just an observation I made.

       Before the scanner went offline, there were reports of active shooters at multiple casinos, but LVPD were aware that it might be a distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds to me like maybe it was just one with one or two accomplices. Maybe a preliminary thing to gauge their response?
      </p>
      <p>
       The crazy thing was that I heard on the radio the call to breach the room on the 32nd floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Officer gave the call "Breach, breach, breach"
       <em>
        BOOM
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wonder if some reports of additional gunfire wasn't the breach charge...
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortly after that, the scanner app, streaming broadcastify, went offline. They probably should've gone offline a lot sooner.

       Id imagine there were several people pulling out their ownguns trying to be a hero. If thats the case, it would be easy for others to mistake them for the shooters due to all of the confusion.

       Those weapons heard in the video are automatics and basically illegal, I say basically because the hoops are lengthy and very costly (20k costly). If it was a concerned citizen with an illegal weapon then they're just as fucked as the people/person that did it. If it was a legal gun then the person carrying it is a special kind of retard to walk around with a 20 thousand dollar gun on their shoulder

       Yeah it could be, but there are far cheaper models that are also much newer and better qualitiy since an automatic newer than 1986 is flat out illegal.

       On the 32nd floor firing off as many rounds as he did, any ricochets and echos are going to make locating the source that much harder, probably leading to a lot of different stories going around (like a really fucking tragic game of telephone). With everyone running and screaming, there's going to be a lot of confusion and bad info.

       Yes, just about every shooting that takes place in an urban area there is reports of multiple shooters.  This because of the repeat heard from echoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a shooter a few blocks away to your left and a few building in just right place to your right your will hear the shoots coming from your left followed by the repeat on your right.

       Assuming you know there are no explosives.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not use explosives if you do not there are explosives, right??? You can't be serious...
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there wasn't anyone in the room, but you'd want to breach and cleaer??

       Usually you take a hostage negotiator, rarely do police ever breach and clear...

       Same, but I think they just wanted to startle the attacker. The officer was in the stairway down the hall on the 32nd floor whispering that he had eyes on the room. A SWAT element was moving up the opposite end of the hall from the sound of it.

       I'm unsure why nobody is just chalking it up to people calling 911 because they THINK the shooter is in their hotel.  After all, all of these resorts are literally side by side and sound echos.  Just because this is a conspiracy sub doesn't mean we need to skip over a probable reasoning for this occurrence and chalk it up to intended distractions.

       I wont say ive fired heaps of weapons but enough automatics to know that when you pull the trigger the rounds go. It doesnt speed up then slow down.

       Firstly. Good find. However the shots are very standard for a long time at one speed then change then back. This guy the rythym was all over the place because its a short handle (if that makes any sense).

       Not unplausable but I still dont think that answers it.

       Which only comes from someone that is very well trained (sf) or knows they are coming. Ive seen that in multiple tour sf guys but only because they knew where the shots were coming from.

       Largest and easy to find are Magpul D-60, holding 60 rounds. There are a bunch of others you can find with a larger capacity, but they are uncommon. Given it is Nevada, you can find larger mags easier than a lot of states due to the full auto market being pretty big there.

       Ah so Nevada has 'loose' laws? Perhaps thats exactly the narrative then. "Hey, you can keep your rifles but you gotta give up the gucci extras" kinda thing. Thats what my money is on then.

       Ive been listening to a lot of the videos and that is one of the most peculiar things to me. The rate of fire itself. In each separate video i have seen the rate of fire is the same and goes on for an extended period of time or until the clip is empty. This would take large drum style clips to accomplish, and reloading these clips would take a long time.  A professional shooter with an automatic weapon would shoot in small bursts to maximize the effectiveness of their ammo and be able to aim easier. I would love to see actual security camera footage. I mean these are casinos. You would be hard pressed to find another building with more security cameras than these places.

       I used to own an ak-47 with 75 round drums. of course it was not fully auto but I could unload a lot of rounds just pulling the trigger fast. im sure there could be bigger capacity magazines than that.

       I'm not saying this was some covert sponsored attack, just that we are being conditioned, intentionally or not, to fear everyone and everything.

       Those timestamps aren't reliable, especially for random blogs. There's no way to know when a page was actually created, so google looks through the HTML and tries to find something formatted like a date that looks like it could be the "published on" date.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is, sometimes the article writer copies an old template and forget to update the date, or they put other dates in there for some reason, or countless other things that confuse googles parser, and it ends up with the wrong date.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can do a search for "google new timestamps" and see it's a pretty common problem.

       If you go to google and try to do a news article search for any shooter, any event, any famous person in the news, it will give you hits from decades ago because there are links to the current event on the page. Try it for any shooter now and see what comes up.

       I would keep in mind about multiple shooter theories that Las Vegas "news" tries to keep the lid on as much as possible violent/depressing or bad news that occurs because it scares off tourists &amp; their money.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a hooker kills a john in a hotel or vice versa you can bet it WILL NOT SHOWUP in the newspaper or local news television. That material does not get broadcast otherwise the hotel/casinos don't want to send that advertising money when you are scaring off their customers.

       I remember in '08 when the tourist murders started to pile up; media wouldn't cover it and cops were told by top brass and local government officials to just close the case on as many as thirty dead tourists that were mutilated that year.

       This is true. My personal experience is that I took a self defense 1 credit class as a freshman at university of Pittsburgh. It was taught by a police chief in that area and he stressed over and over how unsafe we actually were there as students and they had to quietly cover up many stories of murder, rape, robbery, etc to keep the image that it was not an unsafe school so parents felt ok sending kids there.

       Why are you police/ambulance radio frequencies accessible with a scanner ??  isnt that a quite serious security risk ??

       here in the UK they are digital and scrambled so you cant listen to them

       Here in the US, some are encrypted, and some are not. Even within departments they may have some channels that are secure, and some that are open. I'm not sure why, but I can make a guess. It is a pain in the ass to keep all radios on the same "fill" when it comes to encryption (we used freq hopping in the military) and it can make comms very difficult. So part of the reason could be just plain resources, and the other may be they don't want to have to worry about potential comm issues when the shit hits the fan.

       Remember when TV signals went digital a few years ago? Many of those frequencies that had been used for analog broadcasting were given over to emergency services for use with encryption technology. I'm not sure why some bands aren't encrypted, but either way that was part of the deal when they switched up broadcasting methods.

       The police and government are in service to the people. (I literally couldn't type that without rolling my eyes) Anyhow, it's a public service and since they are public servants, they must use open frequencies unless doing so will jeopardize public safety or the element of surprise. For example, when they go to execute a warrant and raid on a house, they used encryption for that.

       A near near me just upgraded their PD radios to digital encrypted. It cost millions of dollars and now ambulances and fire can't directly communicate with PD without special radios as we're on the old system. Most of the reason why places don't upgrade is just cost

       Not really. In the event of an MCI, alternative methods of communications are available once a command is established. Definitely would be a shitshow in the moment though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fact of the matter is that most of our radio traffic in police/fire/ems is so mundane its not worth encrypting.

       And why the fuck would they do that? Why not just actually kill people? The "crisis actor" narrative makes literally no logical sense, and is so laughable when you think of how riskier it is versus handing a crazy a gun and setting him loose if you honestly think literally every bad thing to happen in America ever is some government conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Organizing hundreds, even thousands of people? Including journalists, many of which are honest people who are looking to expose government corruption (mostly on the local level - not talking about national CNN/MSNBC pundits and the like)?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me this whole thing came about because people started talking out their asses during Sandy Hook, found some "convincing" evidence that turned out to be fabricated, and are just running with this narrative whenever something bad happens.

       Logic? I rarely see skeptics use logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       You ask them why at Sandy hook everyone there wore actor badges and skeptics flock to give explanations which are clearly illogical to the context of the evidence presented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or why Sandy hook victims and standard bystanders all just walked around in circles in and out of the school and around it..a skeptic will always have some stupid explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's good to be skeptical. Just..as you ask questions..try to allow yourself to follow the evidence

       You misunderstand much about this issue. The answer is obvious because they want it to be obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason tof have actors and other plants..is to cause comment fusion..many times real people are killed other times no one is killed. Truth is fake fake is truth..even when they make it hideously obvious to be fake such as botson..they laugh in your face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many shills are here..in this very thread..I applaud you all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many are truly concerned skeptics..I question..of what are you skeptical? That the government is incapable of creating such false scenarios? Please understand..they are not as dumb as they like to be portrayed. They are wolves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also consider shills show up to make many sound theories appear illogical.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for this shooting..it's always good to take in evidence before making claims. There already exists immediate concerns of how this is happening.

       No, it's an add for actors that OP has told you is for crisis actors, and you took the bait.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://crowdsondemand.com/">
        Crowds on Demand
       </a>
       is a company that provides actors for astroturfing campaigns and asinine "I want to pretend to be a celebrity so I'll hire 20 people to follow me around and take pictures of me." Which is sadly a thing in today's society. I'm not sure who is stupider, the person paying strangers to care about them, or the people getting paid to pretend to care about someone.

       No, there are people that do.  It's not a large number but the amount of people who consider it ridiculous means it gets more attention than you'd think.  The people who actually do think it's flat are welcome here just like anyone else interested in conspiracies, though they are likely to get ridiculed even by the people who complain about how conspiracy theorists are unfairly ridiculed.

       I'm not saying that real flat earthers don't exist, because there are always idiots, but it's a plausible theory that the reason flat earthers are so prominent right now is because it discredits actual theories due to people associating the stupid theory of a flat earth with real theories that could actually be true.

       You seem to be great at being there at the right time to down play any narrative that doesn't work towards your beliefs. 
All he did was post an ad he found and as it might not be for this particular event its out there that they do have people hiring for protest to push their agenda. If that doesn't bother you, I suggest you open your mind to possibilities.

       That's exactly what people said after the Gulf of Tonkin incident. Millions of people died in the war that started after that. Maybe if less were like you and happy to lap up the government sponsored narrative the Vietnam war might not have happened.

       Yeah, frankly, I see the connections they are making, but I can't imagine that scenario ever actually playing out. The person "they" are supposedly looking for would have to be easily manipulated; the odds that they find that person without giving too much information to someone smart enough to blow the whistle has to be astronomical.

       Oh yeah. The super-secret cabal that is organising the deaths of 50+ people is totally going to rely on some $20/hr wannabe actors that they hired on Craigslist to not spill the beans that they're being paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously? If you signed up for a $20/hr gig, and they told you that they were going to kill everybody and then you have to lie to a camera, you wouldn't think about maybe going to the police? ALL of the random actors they hired can be trusted?

       How in the world would this NDA be enforced other than by a suspicious string of deaths of the survivors who spoke out? It's not like the US government can take them to court and sue them for this, exposing the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also - what narrative needs to be pushed? If this was "faked" there's only one vantage point from where the gunman was, and a bunch of big buildings echoing the shots - no one could immediately pinpoint what was happening anyway - what could a non-actor possibly say that would be off-narrative?
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole thing is very cut and dry. Also - why is it so hard to believe that someone would/could do this without the government having to order it?

       Fuck off. You wouldn't believe proof anyway. Keep believing your stupid fucking narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story is fairly simple. There's no need to fake anything. If the government wanted to do this (they probably didn't BTW), all they had to do was hire a gunman and promise to protect him and set up a fall guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why wouldn't the government have any reservations about killing people if they were gonna stage this? Why would any of this need to be faked in that sense?

       And what would proof even look like to you? A home movie (you'd claim it was edited)? Pictures (same)? What would it take to convince you that 1.) People actually died at Sandy Hook. 2.) One of those people were acquaintances with

       Devils advocate - they need someone who isn't going to go home to their family at the end of the day. If you're sitting around a table planning out a supposed false flag mass shooting, do you think they are going to draw straws as to who shoots at people and kills themself in the room when it's over? No. You would hire someone stupid and/or gullible, tell them they are part of some kind of training with a fake gun, have them shoot people, then you kill them so they can't tell their story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not suggesting that's what is happening, just playing devils advocate as to the logic behind it.

       It's not a crisis actor ad, regardless of how often people keep posting them.  It looks to be hiring people for flash mobs, paid protestors, and people for rallies like when certain snowflakes need their ego stroked by big supportive crowds.

       Because it's not an ad for crisis actors, just regular actors and OP assumes that in a city where movies get filmed, only 5 hours from LA, that all actors are only for this purpose.

       Lots of people hire companies like this to gather signatures for petitions, bulk up press conference/rally turn-out, etc. I actually run a small signature gathering company, and I'm

       What's interesting about the footage for this is it looks real.  It looks like what you would expect something like this to look like.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare it with something like the Orlando shootings - where there is very little footage, and what footage does exist doesn't look like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't looked into the Orlando shootings very much, but I rememeber at the time seeing the footage and asking myself "is this really what it looks during/right after a mass shooting?"

       Calling it now. This guy is a crazy dude on the left who was radicalized by russian agents. He attacked a quintessentially right wing group. This is an attempt by russia to turn political turmoil into violent civil war. Don't fall for it. Everyone calling for violence against "the other side" is either fake or very stupid.

       I don't think there's been a single shred of evidence to support this "all high profile mass shootings ever are false flags!" narrative. You'd think if private companies are hiring hundreds of people to participate in these, including jouranlists, some one would have spilled the beans by now.

       Mockingbird is alive and well. It just goes by a different name these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its also not the area of responsibilty of a single alphabet soup angency,either. Pretty much every goverment agency, including the armed forces,have their own versions of it these days. Hell, the US Army runs tv commercials for recruiting people to join the team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then theres the private corporations and their own,in-house versions of perception management.... Industries like big agriculture(monsanto,etc...) and the pharmaceutical industry are also engaged in the practice.

       Front page of CNN.com: "Deadliest mass shooting in US history!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Hmmmm, the previous "deadliest shooting" was the Pulse nightclub hoax, during which no one actually died. None of the victims at least.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "NSFL" image is more staged nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing to do is let the shills and idiots run around in a panic and have their little fun pretending this was a real event and wait like literally 12 hours for all the seams to start coming apart and all the exposure of the scam to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of like the Charlottesville event. People were kvetching about NAZIS for several days until it was completely exposed as a staged hoax. Hear about any NAZIs doing anything since then? Nah. But you would have thought they were a clear and present danger...

       Nope, pretty sure 49 people died in that shooting. Do you just automatically assume literally

       Neither. It's a tragedy caused by a mentally ill man, who for whatever reason decided to kill tons of innocent people.

       OP clearly had an agenda and bias coming into the post. If you notice the
       <em>
        very first thing
       </em>
       he hunted down was the Crowds on Demand post, suspiciously so I might add. There's just as much evidence that the post might be authentic versus it might have been created by theorists to point to when a tragedy happens, since they're in literally every major American city.

       Apparently they found him dead in the room. A local TV reporter reported that, according to her local LE source, the shooter was in a suite and had 'more guns than any person should need, had thousands of rounds in many magazines, had two shooting platforms set up in the suite to utilize different angles, and had a camera system so they could see anyone approaching their room'. Press release says they found the shooter dead while earlier reports made it sound like he was killed by LVPD.

       Definitely some advanced planning involved, it would not surprise me if the dead suspect is innocent and was planted there to be the escape goat. It sounds like there is no real motive.

       This has been exactly my thought. Guy is known to frequent Vegas and country music festivals specifically, family can't think of any reason he might do it: state that he didn't own any guns when he moved, has never been known to be into guns or have any violent tendencies. My thinking moves towards a serial-killer-type person who is casting the blame on the suspect.

       The logistics of the plan just seem strange. Carrying hundreds of pounds of equipment by a 65 year old man up 32 stories without anyone noticing anything strange is odd. Long rifles has a specific shape, seems difficult to sneak in 10 without someone seeing

       Easily done over a few hours, no one would notice you bringing in duffle bags, even gun cases are not out of the ordinary, nevada is a gun friendly state, but likely these weapons were concealed in large bags or broken down to fit in normal suitcases.

       This is part of what screams some kind of conspiracy to me. Guy, 64 years old with nothing more on his record than traffic violations, checks into Mandalay Bay with 10+ guns and ammo. Four days later he shoots 400+ people from his hotel room window and SWAT finds him dead when they breach the room, claiming he took his own life. Something about this just doesn't sound right.

       Here's what I am having a hard time with. He was obviously in a perfect room to do this. Did he request this room? Or at least request this side of the hotel? And he'd also need to request a high floor. Are hotels in Vegas that accommodating to requests? Are concerts/events like this in this specific location common? If no, that makes this even more puzzling. So he would have had to reserve a room in a specific hotel for a specific date on a high floor facing a specific direction. Seems like this would be challenging to accomplish.

       We're all ready getting the calls to take people's guns. I posted this on a similar thread.
      </p>
      <hr/>

       Actually, you don't have a clue why your talking about. The US government does like a every 5 year review of what would happen if there was an organize insurrection/ civil war. And it doesn't go good for the US military.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply because there is about 1 gun for every American, the government have 300k soldiers. U.S. have 330 million people. So, imagine just 5% of the U.S. population armed like the hotel shooter. That's 15 MILLION people with 5 loaded shotguns and extra ammo.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's supplies at every local store to make bombs. Not to mention what people can do during war time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's not getting into details.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the fact is that the US is wall to wall all over the whole country, dispersed better than our military, heavily armed citizens. Everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people decided to take down the government, it would probably only take like 2.5 percent and a bit of organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to understand, the US government relies on at people to run shit. Imagine what happens if ALL electric grid goes down. And all the bridges get taken out.
      </p>
      <p>
       This "take away your guns shit" is the US government trying to lull you into become truly defenseless. For ever 1 mass shooter, there hundreds of thousand of responsible gun owners. The government wants them gone so there can't be an insurrection in case they want to do something bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if the government decides to outlaw and kill any antifa member as they are a domestic terrorist Group. Summary execution. The government has all your internet data, all your calls, all your texts, where you live, what time your home, where you work, who you associate with, and your location for the past 60 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust me, those dumb fuck knee jerk liberals will want the guns then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone's like, our sweet government would never do that. Except that's why government does. Protects its people from domestic terrorists. It just why group they want to exterminate first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit I'm listening to some person talk about black lives matter as a terrorist group. You all don't know what your talking about.

       This is how I can believe that there is no real terrorism in this country. Because realistically the first thing they would attack are gas stations. They're literally just sitting there waiting to burn and explode. Very visible and easily gets your point across

       Yes, it would be trivially easy to request a room near the top. Once you've done that, it's a 50/50 chance that you're facing the concert. If you're not facing the concert, you complain and they put you where you want to be. Worst case scenario, you come back and try again the next day.

       He was in the hotel for three days, so it seems like he prepared for the eventuality that he got the wrong room.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, even when hotels "sell out" they frequently have rooms reserved for VIPs. IE, if you're a big gambler and you show up at the Mandalay Bay and the hotel is "sold out", they'll figure out how to put you up in a room. And ironically, those "reserved" rooms are often the suites with a great view and lots of room (because you're a VIP.)

       Vegas hotel rules are a lot different than your typical business hotel.

       I think 32 floors is about 400ft. 10 to 12 feet per floor. 1050 ft is 32 feet per floor. It like you multiplied the number of floors by the number of floors for height. When to find height you would do height of floor by number of floors. Here 12 foot floors times 32 floors = 384.

       No, not all bullets are made to pierce one person and go into another. Some explode in the body. Some are blunt like rubber bullets. We don't know, but it is suspected the guy had basically military grade ammo.

       Things don't add up, that's for sure. A lot of people think it was either bumpfire, an FA mod or a crank mod due to the fact that the speed of the bullets fired didn't seem consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The false reports of multiple shooters could be due to echoing of gunfire, leading people to believe there was more than one shooter. The scanner audio does suggest there were multiple shooters though, so I am conflicted about that. It could very well be a confusion tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the biggest thing that throws me off is indeed the supposedly massive amount of guns and ammo found as well as the rest of the setup in the hotel suite.
      </p>
      <p>
       The floor shown in the picture is more likely to be around floors 16-18, the hotel has 43 floors total. Then again I've also read that the layout of the hotel is odd and that it skips numbers (?). The flashing in the picture was also present in later live footage on FOX I believe, so perhaps it is not muzzle flashing. Ofcourse I could be wrong about any of these things, just adding my two cents.

       I think the simple explanation is people in other areas heard the gun shots, saw people running, and called to report gun fire.. It's not some grand conspiracy. Just some panicked people.. Are the police just going to ignore a call they received saying someone is under fire? Obviously not. People just panicked.

       To address the machine gun part, and only that part, it's most likely he was using a "gat crank" or bumpfire modification to simulate full auto. The rate of fire varies widly within individual bursts which is a pretty clear indicator. All that means is he had possibly easy to acquire firearms that were simply modified.

       So OP, how does that crisis actor thing work? You recruit normal unemployed or underemployed folks to work for you for $20 per hour and just desperately hope that nobody ever spills the beans? Seems pretty likely that one of them would balk at your proposal and go run and tell.

       Not even that, they need to involve the media too. Say what you will about MSM cable news reporters, but I find it very hard to believe out of the hundreds of journalists that would need to be complicit in this, there's not one that would spill the beans of the biggest government conspiracy in US history. That's a career-defining revelation.

       See its wrong to think everyone in the MSM is complicit with any "conspiracy" or theory, they're just told what to report. For all they know, they're reporting the "truth". Not saying this shooting was a conspiracy or anything, but to think that X amount of people are involved and keeping quiet seems illogical, is just a false premise. You have people feeding the MSM what to report on and what to say. Again, all these people know is that they're reporting the "truth", but the "truth" is whatever they're told to report. Say, "I don't believe that happened, therefore, I'm not gonna report on it", won't get you very far in MSM. The experienced MSM reporters still have a job because they don't question what they're reporting, and they do their job and report.

       They're told by whom to report it? The implication made in these posts seems to say individual journalists are being recruited by teh government to orchestrate this event. And I'm saying that's wrong because no journalist worth his or her salt would be complicit in something like that without breaking the word about hte biggest government conspiracy in history.

       I agree, which is why you have to assume that they're just doing their jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Told to report by whom? Their editor, the news bureau they're paying for their information? I'm not 100% sure the hierarchy of news outlets (and google doesn't seem to be any help with this), but I'm pretty sure for big news stories, they're given information about the situation and then report it how they see fit (adding biases, etc). If they're not getting their information from someone/somewhere, where are they getting their information from? There has to be some source for where they get the information to report.

      <p>
       I'm sorry, what does "not 100% sure the hierarchy of news outlets" mean?  Do you know how news organizations work or not?  Do you have journalism experience?  Have you worked at a major newspaper or on a TV news crew?  What experience and knowledge do you really have of how news organizations work?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's ok to admit you don't know things.  What's bad, is making things up, like "I'm pretty sure for big news stories, they're given information about the situation and then report it how they see fit (adding biases, etc). If they're not getting their information from someone/somewhere, where are they getting their information from?"
      </p>
      <p>
       News reporters engage in a process of discovery when a major story is breaking.  The first thing they do is they start calling people.  Police, hospitals, the venue, all good places to start.  They check social media, check police scanners, essentially, they dig for information from any source they can find.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were listening to the BBC last night for instance, you would have run across them doing this live, calling a hospital in the middle of the crisis to inquire about casualty counts from the desk nurse, on air.  They are not "given" information, they look for it.  Once they have a piece of information they try to confirm it.  If they can confirm it, usually with a second source, they report it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not possible to control what information they get since the government can't control who they call, who they talk to and what information they gather.  They can't possibly anticipate who each individual journalist would call or contact.

       How did they know about the shooting in Las Vegas? How did they find out? They just cold call city hospitals to make sure there weren't any major incidents? How do they initially know that something has happened? If it's all independent research how are they so quick to report something? And not just "something" but a story that seems to be consistent with every other story that is being reported on the same thing. You'd think independent research would yield varying results. I guess they use the same sources, I guess they're all getting their information from SOMEONE OR SOMEWHERE.

       I think the problem your having is believing all journalists to be independent and credible.  Not all journalists are going to be out interviewing witnesses, fact checking stories and then publishing articles. For broadcast 24/7 News your going to have the anchor, segment producer, executive producer and station owner at least slightly involved in any story. What the anchor is reporting may have filtered through a number of people before they read what’s in front of them.

       Nope.  You use it to fill out crowds with payrolled employees who act according to the terms you set when you paid them.  Eg. No phones, no entering "controlled areas," no interaction with the "wounded/killed," etc.  Specialists handle the more visible roles.

       Seriously, I really don't understand why an inconclusive Craigslist ad from a month ago was included in this post. There is almost no way that word of something like this wouldn't get out if it was planned and staged a month in advance, especially if they're only getting like $20/hr

       Well, there are things like non disclosure agreements. Not to mention people would likely think you were lying if you said told the truth. Not saying that is what happened here but just saying that there are ways of making people keep quiet about something

       I may have found something interesting. If you go to the NV Clark County.gov site you can actually look up voter history-
       <a href="http://www.clarkcountynv.gov/election/Pages/ElectionHistory.aspx">
        http://www.clarkcountynv.gov/election/Pages/ElectionHistory.aspx
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically you choose the year, and the election and then by selecting "Generate Voter History File" you get a big long text doc showing you a list of every voter who participated in that election. Obviously it doesn't list who people voted for, but it does list party affiliation, district number, voting method etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've gone all the way back to the 2000 General Election and I see no record of a Stephen Paddock or any similar name. I also don't see any "Paddocks" that were registered in Mesquite NV.
      </p>
      <p>
       The obvious conclusion being that this person was not an active voter. (at least not in Clark County, NV)

       His name does appear in property record databases, however, with a deed dated 2015. It looks like he moved to his current residence on that date. Maybe he was registered to vote at an old address? Or just didn't bother registering given how much of a shitshow the most recent election was.

In a week, if more 'up close and personal' videos don't surface, I'll consider your frustration. But my gawd, this just occurred.

       You're being totally unreasonable. Give it time!!! 
Maybe the 50 dead people have something on their phones for your entertainment but until then.....just chill out. Not sure why you  are demanding instant footage!  For all you (we) know maybe there's something posted on Facebook that hasn't made it over to Reddit yet.
Uploading vids are not priority at the moment.

       Get ready for more instances like this to keep happening. Make no mistake, they will keep happening until we all surrender and say "Okay, we will give up our guns if the government will keep us safe." More shootings will take place in the near future until, as a country, we are forced to give up our defenses. Mainly the southern region, but many other Americans carry weapons as well. It's happening guys. Anyone else wonder if these things are orchestrated? I'm sure we all have those thoughts. If only we could get definitive proof and evidence. Most of the evidence is just not enough, but we know what is really going on.

       Serious question, and not looking to argue, just looking for other perspectives: if we keep putting more guns in people's hands, will mass shootings not just continue?
      </p>
      <p>
       When this totally normal, $400k house owning, ex-pilot with no criminal record goes berserk, what is the solution? Just let shootings happen and call it an anomaly?
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, not trying to attack, just looking for other views.

       That's a very valid point and I absolutely see where you are coming from. The truth is, this is a complex issue and there will never be a great solution to it. Where I live (Missouri) MANY people in the town (population of about 15,000 people) own weapons, more than one. We have never had a school shooting or anything even close to it. Most people are hunters, gun enthusiasts, or own one for protection. It's easy for me to say "keep the guns," because I live in a small town and haven't had much experience living other places except for a year in St. Louis, MO, and half a year in China. I definitely feel a lot safer here than I did in St. Louis and I was like 1 of the 6 or 7 white dudes living in my densely populated neighborhood. So, I am biased because I have grown up conservative. Maybe it's the bigger cities that don't need guns, but had someone with a handgun been next to the shooter without him seeing, he
       <em>
        could have - not would have
       </em>
       ended the shooting at 4 dead and 25 wounded instead of what it is now. Granted, that's an optimistic outlook. With this guy going berserk, I don't think it's a matter of
       <em>
        who it is going berserk
       </em>
       but rather
       <em>
        who can be there to stop that person
       </em>
       instead of waiting for authorities when it may be too late. Thanks for asking sincerely, I love when I can converse with people without harsh underlying comments and what not. This was my genuine answer. :)

       Do you believe the account that this was just one person that was normal and snapped?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone I know that owns guns is a reasonable person that isn’t going to snap and shoot up ordinary people, especially with fully automatic assault rifles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know what to believe but I always ask questions whenever MSM delivers a “fact”.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally believe that citizens owning guns keeps the government in check.

       Why do we not see the following in any of the news reports, or photos or footage from cameras that everyone has in their pockets?
      </p>
      <p>
       1) blood
      </p>
      <p>
       2) dead bodies, or bloody lumps covered in sheets or tarps, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) bloody victims being attended to by EMT or being loaded into ambulances, or being unloaded from ambulances at the hospital, or being carried into a hospital ER
      </p>
      <p>
       4) bullet holes or marks in the ground, or cars, or in anything
      </p>
      <p>
       5) actually panic. we se people running with drinks in their hands, but no real panic

       I think there are a few photos of dead bodies. One is in the OP, but there's a couple more. There's also a video that shows supposed victims being treated and the person filming (they're in a car) is asked to take them to a hospital.

       I am so glad I grew up in an era (1970's) where the news wasn't as fake and people weren't as cynically stupid as they are now.

       Because from now on....every single solitary shocking event that happens will be shared by MSM then ripped apart by forums.

       Apparently they are saying multiple shooters with fully auto weapons. Could be bump fire but unlikely you'd hit anything after people started to scramble.

       This is why we have to be careful what we communicate in times of sa cial media. "Confirmed shooting at Tropicana" - false alarm. "Shooting in NY" - false alarm. Same thing happened here in Munich during the shooting last year. Hundreds of experts confirming shootings on various places, at the end all false information.

       I don't think that phenomenon is related to social media that much. It's been happening far longer than we've been online.
      </p>
      <p>
       More likely, the buildings on the strip made the gunfire echo and this caused various locations to think someone was firing there and call 911.
      </p>
      <p>
       People running from the crowd and in shock piling into the lobby of a hotel across the street all saying someones shooting... People there gonna call 911.
      </p>

       It happens. Police are trained to expect it and quickly code 4 it.

       Sorry if I‘m mistaking and I don’t want to be disrespectful regarding that matter. But is this the Tropicana? If yes, doesn’t this video underline my statement? I mean it shows two dudes „identifying“ some person at a window as the shooter. They see a person looking out of a window and claim it is the / a shooter. Or which building is this? It clearly isn’t the 32 floor so it can’t be Paddock at Mandala Bay, right?

       killing politicians makes people happy, rather than spreading terror
      </p>
      <p>
       killing politicians also only leads to similar politicians being elected, but killing innocent people teaches other people to change something, to change gun laws maybe or move away from the U.S.

       Do you think most politicians are savvy enough to realize these events are caused by them and not independent from them?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would think most politicians blame "the extreme" other side and move on.

       I wonder what impact this will have on international tourism in the area. Las Vegas just had record pot sales and then a horrible event sure to make international headlines makes way. This will have an impact on conservative family members in other countries who will influence younger kids not to tour Las Vegas for pot.

       Too late to turn back now... there are so many guns everywhere that you will never be able to get em back now.... the only solution is to make
       <em>
        more

       guns or invent some sort of magical gun magnet to haul them all up into space or something.

       as a european, how many more of these shootings must you have until you guys realize that automatic rifles in the hand of civilians are not a good thing. please learn from the rest of the world. I understand deeply your 2nd amendment, and your right to defend it. But it comes with a cost. And youve seen that cost time and time again, from columbine to aurora to this. Isnt it time you guys really looked deeply into your 2nd amendment? Is it worth it? I get it, at one point the government might turn against you and attack you, and you would want to defend yourself. But honestly, thats such an entirely big stretch that its extremely unlikely it will ever happen. Besides, if it does happen - are you prepared to just open fire against multiple police? IF that should happen? Are you even capable of that? And again, at what cost? Is it really worth it?

       They paid a vast amount of money for the ones that are still legal due to the grandfather clause. As others have tried to inform you, some weapons are still legal as assault rifles, those cost a lot of money. Typically people that have them have had them before 1986 or they were given to them by a family member or friend.

       You guys ate already contracting each other. Or we are talking semantics here. Question - is an AR15 or any other assault rifle, or let's say a fully automatic shotgun like the AA12 - banned in the US? Then how come famous youtubers in the thousands have exhibitions of various smg's, ar's and handguns like the glock 17?

       I am answering your question, you just dont like the answer. A) it is illegal to buy a fully automatic weapon. B) you can modify weapons to make them go fully automatic. C) i dont know how "rednecks" all over you tube have fully auto. See B. and D) look at some of the post on this sub. Seems like he could have been using a trigger crank on a semi automatic weapon.

       and you are dodging my question again! How come thousands of people are openly displaying fully automatic weapons, if they are banned and illegal? Are they all breaking the law? Openly on youtube? One such popular youtube channel is "FPS RUSSIA", by an american who portrays a russian that likes guns. Here is a video of him shooting the fully automatic AA-12 shotgun. (

       Of course I can. I could provide thousands of them. But it's much easier for me, if you Just go to YouTube, and search for any gun you find interesting and you will see hundreds of results of people showcasing them in their literal backyard. Where do they all get the guns from? Try for example aa-12, mp5, glock 18, mp7, ak47, akm, scar, or basically any fully automatic weapon you would like to see.

       It's just a very loaded question, and a misleading one. You put me in a position where I have to assume moral responsibilty for the crimes of a depraved psychopath, and weigh that against my right to defend myself from others like him.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why you're getting downvoted. Not because we Americans are "butthurt", but because you're using a tragedy as an unfair appeal to emotion. It's not even a question of the 2nd Amendment in this case, but I will try and answer it anyway.

       If a concealed carry or rightfully born arms can save one innocent life, if it can put one of these psycopaths down before they have a chance to hurt anyone else, then hell yes. It is definitely "worth it".

       Tell me how many school shootings or mass shootings occur in for example the UK, compared to the USA. One country has extremely strict gun laws one sells them in every town in the country. But to answer your ridiculous claim : a) guns do not mean self defense. There are about a million ways to defend yourself that doesn't include guns. B) illusion of safety? What illusion is that? It's quite hard to perform a mass shooting or school shooting if all you have available are for example knives.

       Or had untreated mental illnesses, as is the case with many people that snap and start shooting up crowds or random gatherings. If he lost all his money, the reasonable thing to do would be to sell some of his arsenal to stay out of debt.

       Depends how much money he lost. He could have lost everything, if he went to casinos a lot it is likely his favourite casino would have him on the high rolling tables. I doubt it was 100% this motiviation more likely a mix. Lost money, fragile psych, not hard to see how he thought suicide by cop + taking anger out on people enjoying vegas might be a thing.

       Seems like if it were a grievance with a casino, he would've shot up a casino floor instead of a concert. Plus suicide by cop is much easier to accomplish on the ground rather than a high vantage point. This dude was straight nuts and that's probably all there is to this story.

       Fair enough. Just thought his gambelling connections might be linked to his story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is 62 common for breaks in mental psych (presuming he was a productive and healthy citizen before this)? I know early 20s/late teens is a sensitive age. Not that it matters, just makes me feel as bad for him as the victims. Hard to think something like an illness would make you do a thing like that.

       If he wanted to go that way then he wouldn't have "taken his own life" before SWAT got there. And you'd think he would've put himself closer to the police so that could happen, not 32 floors up where he could remain somewhat hidden for a while.

       Has anybody seen on the Today show Matt L. Says the leading Pulse shooting ER correspondent, Miguel(something), on how to deal with large numbers of gunshot victims  at once in the ER, spoke in detail about this in Vegas within the month at local hospitals....I'm trying to get a recording.

       <strong>
        some people

       would say - shit man, maybe we shouldn't make it so easy/better track these guns.

       Its more sad that literally the day after the shooting... Not even 24 full hours later, its being used for politics. Maybe wait a little before using innocent lives to push politics. Or is it "Never waste a good crisis" and fuck the lives lost?

       Well, good news, they won't do anything

       If they couldn't be motivated to change legislation based on kindergartners getting shot - they won't change a law for country music fans.
      </p>
      <p>
       People getting shot is ABSOLUTELY about politics because it is legislation that allows anyone to purchase weapons of all kinds and ammo with little or no tracking.

       There are speeding laws.. So by your logic You dont speed..? Heroin is illegal, your telling me people dont OD on it daily? Your logic is flawed. If people want to do something, they will. If they want a fully automatic gun and dont have the appropriate license (which is extremely illegal) so they can shoot out a window of the mandalay bay they will get that gun and shoot out the window of the mandalay bay onto a crowd of innocent civillians. Tell me more how this is a political issue?

       I just want to say that there's a guy name Dan Bilzerian who was backstage at the Aldean concert before the shooting started. He ran away when the shooting started, got his AR and went back to help people. I'm assuming with the gun. Not going to say 100% that this is why we're hearing a guy in fatigues was running around down there with an AR but it could be. You can find pictures of him down there with police (none with his gun though).

       That's such a stupid fucking thing to do. You want to help people against a sniper? Get them down, hidden, or running away. Getting a rifle yourself is only going to make you a target for the police.

       There was no way of knowing if it was a sniper or not. If it would have been a Paris style attack where the attackers were on site if Dan engaged the attackers he could have saved lives. So I think getting your gun out and try finding the attackers is something that may be called for and heroic given the risk of getting shot by the attackers themselves, by the police or by another good samaritan.

       Why a fucking idiot. That’s a good way to get mistaken for a 2nd shooter by everybody.

      <p>
       People trying to play hero only create confusion for the police and anybody running around with a gun who’s not in a cop uniform is going to scare all the panic bystanders around them.

       Sometimes heroes are necessary and it would have been worth the risk to get mistaken if it meant you could engage the shooters and end the threat. In Paris for example Dan would have been really useful because the terrorists just shot people in site with no one confronting them. Although in Vegas he couldn't have done much because the threat was concealed in a vantage point very far away, at the moment he had no way of knowing if he would be able to engage the threat. So I think if he came out with a gun he did the right thing. But the problem is what if there is another good samaritan with a gun and there are still shots ringing out, they both can mistake each other, specially in such an anxious state of mind. But I guess that's an acceptable risk which happens many times in actual combat in war zones.

       Give me a a break. No military. No "10 rifles", and he was a 62 year old schooled retiree with a wife and kids. This is not a gunman. And who the fuck brings 10 rifles. Two max and a bunch of drum magazines would have the same effect. "An orgt of evidence" is what I see here. And for what?

       Regardless there should be tons of footage of him walking into the hotel, are we to believe that they don't have tons of security cameras. So the footage should be easy to get and pretty black and white. If we don't see it we have to assume it's a scam. It should go without saying

       You have a good point there should be footage of him walking in with luggage where those things can fit. I wonder if there are cameras of the hallways also, that would be more useful. But if it was a false flag and the hotel is in it they could easily fake a footage.

       Yeah, it really isn't that difficult to learn how to take a rifle apart. They have those carts in hotels that can hold a lot of luggage. Probably wouldn't even need that many trips.

       It's all a plot to get guns taken from The People. He was obviously given those weapons by someone. And with no military background, how did he manage to get those weapons into the hotel?

       Look, Sandy Hook happened and people died. But it wasn't Adam Lanza. Otherwise the security photo of him entering the school would exist. But it doesn't. Despite brand new security cameras being installed and one specifically to view people entering the front door.

       That event is ripe for conspiracies. I personally think that one scenario is that he was killed and framed, and the real shooters are at large. But police probably won't even think about that possibility.

       No, I was asking how he did it since Vegas hotel windows cannot be opened. He had to have busted it out, meaning he would have drawn attention to the window prior to the shooting.

       From a stationary position that 1 person is hold up in? Yes, without a doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
       With practice and full mags, it would only take seconds for a reload..even less time if the shooter was just picking up already locked n loaded rifles and switching them out when they ran out of ammo (allegedly 10 different guns)
      </p>

       This is all long gun. Rifles. Not sure on make or caliber. Probably something popular like AK format or AR format.

       . I can reload belt fed rounds in under 5 seconds, mag fed rounds in under 10. The shooter would need to change barrels after about 150-200 rounds at the rate he was firing.

       whut????  I have had in the past several boxes of green tip 556 that I bought at walmart.  1000 rounds for $400 dollars.  You could easily carry 3000 rounds in a suitcase.

       the tricky part is getting enough pmags.

       but change barrels at 150 rounds???  what kind of shit 556 are you buying?  my Colt put down 300 with no issue.  It wasn't quite sustained fire like this, but between myself and a few friends we put 10 - 30 round clips through it in about 15 minutes.  shit was just fine.

       If you watch the videos of the incident you can hear one distinct weapon firing on fully automatic. Sounded like a small caliber too which is perfect for the situation.

       I don't think there were multiple shooters involved this time folks.

       The claims of multiple shooters include multiple locations; the videos from the concert aren't going to cover the interior of multiple Casinos/Hotels.

       Of course they're not but there were no victims inside of any casino/hotel. So it's safe to assume that the shooter or shooters would be aiming outside at the concert. The people in a Vegas hotel room partying it up, or sleeping only to be woke by gunshots echoing through a large building, are less credible than the video evidence I've been looking at so far. It's not impossible that there were multiple shooters it's just highly unlikely.

       Supposedly the shooter is a big gambler. If ge had a bunch of gambling debts he could of just snapped or maybe someone promised to pay it all off if he went on a killing spree.

       Not to say this is great timing,  but this feels like a great time to wag the dog with this situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every week needs something new. Hurricane, NFL, Puerto Rico, Mass shooting now, it feels like these situations are never ending and could be a perfect way for Trump to try and claim hes "Presidential" I think however we can all agree its too much of a coincidence that each week has a new topic, while the important ones like his impeachment fall to the side.
      </p>

       I am not saying thats what this is and I am devistated by the loss of lives here.  I am just saying it seems convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
       With everything thats happened and how Trump knows how to strategically divert the medias attention, it wouldn't be the most unheard of thing.

       im in favor of gun control, ESPECIALLY for the mentally ill but it doesnt keep guns out of places they dont belong. this will be like 9/11 for vegas. everything will be about security now, though it ultimately wont mean much.

       any huge outdoor public gathering is susceptible to this, especially if guns that can be made full auto with high capacity mags are available

       Following this logic the USA should also ban all people who live in inner cities, or "ghettos" since they statistically commit more crimes than any other demographic. Teenaged drivers should also be banned because they cause the most accidents. All men should also be banned since they are the majority of domestic abusers. Women should be banned because they are the percentage majority of convicts charged and imprisoned with theft, larceny, and fraud. Also anybody who has ever committed a crime should be banned, since they are more likely to commit another crime than people who haven't. Juveniles should be banned as well, since they are the most likely to commit vandalism and underage drinking. Just because the majority of mass shooters are white males, does not mean that the majority of white males are mass shooters. Using that kind of logic is how the holocaust happened.

       Comments in this thread questioning the Crisis Actor angle have substantially more upvotes than other topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kinda odd given most r/con folks wouldn't trip on Crises Actor on way or another.  Certainly on the table during these events, but not central to any theory.

       I've noticed something siliar too. Seems like that it's more prevelant then previous threads. Almost every reply to a post mentioning Crisis actors is stating how absurd that notion is. They are pretty similar in sentence syntax and wording.

       Crisis actors end up being a small part of false flags. They are never the deciding factor for me. They are merely supporting evidence after the fact. Normally, many other huge flags go up signaling inconsistencies. Just depends on the specifics. We had a ton of injured crisis actors in the Boston Bombing vs just the parents in say Sandy Hook who weren't injured at all. They are present at all of these events but each have differing roles of importance to television and image so to speak.

       This is my first time ever believeing a conspiracy theory, but... does anyone else find it suspicious that this is the best response Trump had to a disaster, and it happened right when people were starting to freak out over his lack of a response to Puerto Rico. Like maybe it was set up as a diversion and a tactic to show America's might? I hate to say that I'm starting to believe this, but I can't help it given the circumstances.

       I watched this all unfold live with /pol/ here's a recap of the events:
      </p>
      <p>
       Times are PST - this is without speculation as to questionable/falsified claims on behalf of the news and police
      </p>
      <p>
       ~10:00pm - shots begin to break out over the Route 91 Harvest Concert
      </p>
      <p>
       ~10:30pm - videos captured and uploaded start to spread online, media begins reporting active shooter, /pol/ identifies Marilou Danley as a suspect who previously went up on stage and said/warned/declared to the crowd "you're all going to die soon" and begins connecting her online profiles, her husband Geary Danley is also found and identifies as a hardleft democrat.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~11:00pm - Police shut down parts of Vegas strip /pol/ and T_D continue to view various streams on the ground include multiple periscope feeds from civilians.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~11:30pm - people begin getting evaced to medical facilities, I-15 is closed, death reports start coming in.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~12:00am - police breach suspects room and declare suspect is "down" (reports vary between this time and later on when it's declared the gunman shot himself.)
      </p>
      <p>
       ~1:00am - admist evacuation planning and orders police declare they are still on the hunt for Marilou Danley in connection to the shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~1:30am - death/injury toll is upgraded to 20+/100+
      </p>
      <p>
       ~2:00am - police scanners go quiet, sheriff starts getting ready for a press conf. (seen by local periscope feeds)
      </p>
      <p>
       ~2:30-2:45am - sheriff announces suspect ID as "Stephen Paddock, age 64" and that the suspect was found dead on the scene (piror to announcing this, the sheriff seen on a local periscope being handed the script which he reads from by a female reporter who quickly scurries away before they go live on tv)
      </p>
      <p>
       ~3:30am - at some point the local authorities declared Marilou Danley is no longer a person of interest in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~4:00am - periscope removes all videos from the area
      </p>
      <p>
       ~4:30am - death count 50+ injured count 400+
      </p>

       So this a throwaway. But I have plenty friends and family in Vegas and they knew people in attendance at the festival. Thankfully nobody they know we're injured or killed, just very shaken up. There was definitely more than one shooter. My cousin was listening to police scanners live and they were calling in false shooting reports at multiple hotels. One person couldn't have possibly executed such a calculated and organized massacre by themselves. This needs to be exposed. A lone wolf attack is one thing but an organized strike with diversion calls being made is another thing. Fuck the media, this needs to be known.

       I disagree with this statement. It would be very simple for one person to pull this off. In fact its probably the least chance to get caught. I have two big pieces of luggage (cause I self park and carry my own bags in) ...at best there is footage of the shooter dragging bags like everyone else. Fitting say 1000 .556 (AR ammo) into a bag is nothing...it does not take up that much space..the other bag is my weapons broken down...an AR taken apart could fit in a small bag...but ok so say I have three long guns and 7 handguns...all that very easily fits in one of my wifes bags she takes on vacation....
      </p>
      <p>
       this is actually not a complicated attack..IMO you don't even have to be a great shooter..where he was compared to the crowd you just spray and pray ...

       I worked in a police communications centre for a little bit. There was one high profile shooting while I was there and they were looking for the guy all night. The next morning we had so many people calling in for anything that looked suspicious. People panic and read into things.

       Can we all agree that despite every little nuance and difference of opinion, what happened today as reported over the scanners
       <strong>
        DOES NOT
       </strong>
       match with what we're being told has happened by the media.

       Multiple shooters. Shooters being reported by officers on the ground at a certain gate. Officers reporting the shots coming from middle of Mandalay Bay. Not just the north side. Mandalay Bay security reporting shots on two floors; the 29th and 32nd. I listened to parts of it earlier. These are just a few that stuck out and that I can recall.

       Do remember that during the heat of situations like that, situational info is always changing. Many have pointed out that there are a lot of big buildings for sounds to echo off of, giving the idea of multiple angles. People will also being calling the police from the ground giving inaccurate location information. Not to say this is guaranteed to be one shooter, or multiples, but during heated situations like this, the information that is factual will be wildly different from the information authorities have during the event itself. They're just trying to cover all possible angles of the situation to get it resolved.

       There are always inconsistencies. Bad information and rumors run rampant in crisis situations and police aren't immune to that. There were no windows out on the 29th, most likely a error from the hotel sensors.

       It's almost like listening scanner chatter is merely that, and the result of many people untrained people frantically calling 9-11 trying to piece together and report an extremely confusing and traumatic event happening in real time.

       I live in Vegas and something just isn't sitting well with me about all this. The windows at those hotels don't open, specifically mandalay bay I've been in tons of times and their windows don't open. If he shot the window out, it should've sent off alarms, Vegas hotels are really vigilant about not being the hotel someone used to jump out of a window, or a fire. The cops blew open the door supposedly but those locks are all electronic, the front desk can buzz them open. I have friends on my social media that reported shootings elsewhere on the trip on their facebook, this isn't a 'distraction' cause they posted as they heard them telling people to be careful of the area... there's no way this shooter acted alone, and Vegas is infamous for covering up bad news, or making it seem less 'bad' -- a 1 off crazy retired guy is an easier pill to swallow than 5 shooters and we only found one.

       It would've been a lot quicker response than that. As soon as the first bullet broke the window (assuming he needed to fire a few shots), everyone is alerted and external cameras would focus in on the window (I know a lot of hotels have external camera for monitoring rooms, not sure if Mandalay for sure does). They should've made contact with the room a lot quicker. And unlocked the door.

       The second that first shot went off, the hotel knew exactly where. But for some reason on the scanner they actually said that Mandalay security reported shooters on the 29th and 32nd floor. And the official story is telling us just the 32nd and one guy. And why the hell is there two windows shot out?

       What is stopping the "men at large" from continuing their spree then. If they didnt get caught is there a reason for then to stop? Reports in situations like this get jumbled. There is always a lot of false reports because in the chaos people will report anything.

       I'd like to see you take a hammer to those windows and see what kind of luck you have. And it's not A Facebook anecdote, it's many. My timeline all night was "I'm at so and so and heard gunshots coming from (not Mandalay Bay)" I don't hold firm that they heard it for sure, could've been a lot of echoing around a bunch of tall buildings, idk. All I'm saying is a lot of things aren't adding up for me.

FRESNO, Calif. — Acoustic sensors mounted on lampposts and telephone poles picked up the crack of gunfire and rapidly enabled police to zero in on where it was coming from. Within minutes, the alleged gunman in the deadly rampage was under arrest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer credited the technology Wednesday with the swift capture of Kori Ali Muhammad, a 39-year-old black man who authorities say killed three people Tuesday in a bid to wipe out as many whites as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       "He was in custody within 4 minutes and 13 seconds," Dyer said Wednesday at a news conference where he played audio clips of the ShotSpotter technology. "Kori Muhammad would be outstanding today if it wasn't for shots-fired detection."
      </p>
      <p>
       SpotShotter is widely used in U.S. cities. The Fresno rampage is one of the more serious crimes in which it played a vital role.

       Are you fucking kidding me with this crisis actor bullshit? You seriously think they're going to post an ad on Craigslist for $20/he and stage the worst mass shooting in US history with a bunch of randos off the street? I can't think of a better way to blow their cover.

       This is the problem with conspiracy junkies. You find puzzle pieces and decide that they fit together without doing anything of the work to demonstrate that they do.

       Ya, you'd think shit like that would be on the down low and only people with no fucking conscience would be part of it...

      <p>
       But people do insane stuff for money...
      </p>
      <p>
       Just not sure how something like hiring crisis actors off Craig's list could keep that kind of secret..
Dozens of people murdered and they think they need to shut their mouths for a few hundred bucks?
(Assuming it's only $25/hour like the ad said)
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole crisis actor theory is kinda far fetched I think. There's no way the average Joe, who is hired to be part of a mass murder could keep their mouths shut about it...

       I hope this does not create a shit show but, I have to ask this, what is connecting that post from CL with the actual events. Yes it is strange that it was posted 15 days before hand but I'm not seeing the connection. Is there any proof that people were supplied for this? And to be honest I have yet to see any actual proof that these type of situations have been staged. Not one.

       Is anyone else out there wondering if Stephen Paddock was even involved in the shooting at all? Now, I know he may have been responsible.  But I can't help wondering if perhaps there's more to this story than just that.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        LVPD Scanners: Multiple shooters/aggressors
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       • (Edit 4 - MSNBC and LVPD (on the scanner) confirming at least 2 shooters.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        MSM: Single shooter narrative
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       • Edit 24 - MSNBC now saying on air “no more shooters involved.” However eyewitness accounts claim multiple. Let the fuckery begin.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Edit 27 - “Can you please tell media to back off, we don’t have all suspects accounted for.”
      </p>
      <p>
       • Edit 28 - MSM continues to push the “no more shooters” narrative. Meanwhile, LVPD keep saying they have not apprehended all suspects.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        LVPD: Meanwhile, Stephen Paddock already dead (yet the chaos continues)

       • Edit 7 - Suspect down, floor 32 Mandalay Bay, room 135.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       • Edit 15 - Male walking into The Bellagio with a rifle.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Edit 19 - Shot fired at Bellagio. Automatic fire could be heard on the scanner.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Edit 20 - Audi with car bomb was left by 4 males.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know we don't have much information yet, but I tend to take whatever the media says and turn about 85-90% of it says and usually believe the polar opposite. What are you guys thinking on this? Was Stephen Paddock the sole shooter, part of a team of shooters, or even setup to take the fall?

       Exactly. These are seriously my thoughts. The media wants to talk about his gambling but the man was in vegas, of course it's probable that he's gambling. The man the media is pointing out now could be a bystander like anyone else, wrong place wrong time. They found weapons that are very hard to get your hands on even in the black market.

       This. Or the CIA steps in and shuts out the police completely. We will never know, but this story has so many loose ends- not because it's so fresh and still being researched, but because of what happened in the hotel room that isn't being released. Bouncing around from "he was shot by LVPD" to "he shot himself." Neither of those could be the reason or the answer.

       The MSM story is a total wash. They take advantage of the ensuing chaos and confusion to give themselves 'plausible deniability' regarding the information eyewitnesses come forward with, or what they themselves later recant. This is probably gonna end up like Sandy Hook and Orlando, relegated to the fringe internet theories of a few tin foil hat crazies.

       Without a doubt this smells of a false flag. The deceased supposed perpetrator does not seem to fit the usual paradigm. There has been an obvious movement to create divisiveness in the USA and a domestic crackdown is to be expected.

       Well, call me crazy, but I'm not even convinced this guy actually did it.  It sounds more like a gun deal gone bad to me and one of the parties went nuts (or maybe I've just seen too many movies). I mean, I think Paddock may have had limited involvement in putting the deal together (or something) and renting the rooms (perhaps), but I don't think he's the one that actually did the shooting. Of course, I could be wrong, and we may never know what really happened, but video of activity in the hallways and parking garage before and during the event would prove me right or wrong.  I hope we get to see it.

       The thing is, I don't think that many people care about Puerto Rico or even know where to locate it on a map.  I think you give people too much credit for being informed. Just like people will go along with whatever draconian legislation is passed after this shooting because 'it's in their best interest' or because 'terrorism'. You don't need to carry out a complex act of terrorism like this to distract people, just show them football and some athletes kneeling.

       I think you meant "Edit 29". What he meant was is how convenient the shooter is now dead, and we'll never know his true motive. Now the MSM can make up any motive or scenario at their leisure. Even if the shooter was alive, we'd never know if he was duped, or brainwashed, or must made a patsy to stand there holding some guns, all the while the real shooter or shooters made off already.

       False flag. Had to be multiple shooters. We're supposed to believe that some untrained lone wolf, killed 50+ people, and wounded 400+ people, (using what they are probably gonna say is an AR-15 with a standard barrel length of 16in and firing 5.56x45mm) while high angle shooting from the 32nd floor (at least 320ft up), and more than 400 yards away, (and oh by the way 400 yards is close to the max effective range of that weapon) on full automatic, for less than 2min total shooting time. And oh by the way it sounds like multiple weapons of different caliber's. Yeah i'm no tier 1 special operator, but i don't fucking believe that.

       I can't understand why there were so many weapons in the room for just 1 shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it's just TV shows, but when they find a suspect with an "arsenal" they instantly begin to think big picture, like there being accomplice. There's logic in that thinking regardless of it being acting.

       Based on this thread I have managed to determine it is a 'false flag' with this information:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        People who run top-secret false flag attacks recruit via Craigslist.
       </li>
       <li>
        The people running the false flag operation chose a person that would not normally shoot. This, of course, arouses suspicion.
       </li>
       <li>
        This was a drug deal gone bad. The gun fire was probably accidental.

       You were probably hearing the initial thud of the gun in the distance and then the supersonic cracks of the bullets. Either that or gunfire echoing off buildings. Watch the shootout scene in Heat for an example of it - when filming that scene they used the original audio because they thought it was more terrifying.

       I think it's clear that the incident happened. What's not clear is the motive. That is the frightening part. False Flag operations usually create situations where some new law is enacted, and thus more civil liberties are taken away. Scary times.

       Maybe someone from the Deep State saw how "People Power" was pushing back at the police/military forces in Spain during the Catalan Referendum, and they got scared, so they created another false flag to create fear &amp; panic. I know they want to take our guns away. I know they want us to become docile sheep. The question is how are they going to pull it off? The good news more people are aware about false flag operations thanks to the Internet. If the Internet ever got regulated then we're all screwed.

       That's a good point too... I just don't know. I'm just sad &amp; scared for the future for every decent loving person's sake. We're all being duped, but by whom or by how I just don't know. The Government takes more of our civil liberties away, and at what cost?? Banning Muslims sure as Hell didn't work this time. If they ban handguns or MR15's, then what if someone uses a home made bomb? Ban kitchen pots? I'm upset at the loss of life, and if this guy named Steve is guilty then may he burn in Hell forever! But what if he was a patsy, and set-up to hold those guns in those rooms? I am just at a loss for words, and I'm emotionally drained. It's as if fear has griped the entire nation, and anything we do or say takes us one step closer to a Totalitarian State.

       I just can't believe that 500 people were injured in 9 minutes.... by one guy. And he's way off into the distance yet he's picking people off left and right. Hardly any logic behind these claims, yet everyone is gobbling up the (likely) fabricated story like a Thanksgiving dinner. There's more to it than that. What exactly? I'm not sure.

       And there was a couple users that helped but, legit just eventually gave up

       There was nothing I could do to prove anything. They could provide me with obviously fake news and I'd give real news and I was still wrong.

       Its crazy they have a way to falsely sway so many minds. It's really messed up to even think a large group of people undertake such a task

       Idk im Canadian, maybe I never really fathomed something like this takes place.

       You I always see this as traitorist, act of treason, the effort they make to deliberately damage and corrupt the American people and the way it operates.

       I've been listening to radio/news on all major shootings recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the gunman is black/middle eastern the narrative goes as follows: "This is a tragedy." The nationality/race of the gunman is kept to a minimum, and the word terrorism is carefully tip-toed around.
      </p>

       Im sorry does anyone else see some people acting like nothing is going on or holding their fucking beers in hand while sitting on the ground like its a drill. Also the reaction from the crowd when the gun shots start...just seem off. I expected a lot more panic and a lot more running. Why would you sit there, still instead of running away. Can someone make sense of this....im very confused.

       If i'm on the streets and I hear shots, I first wonder what noise is that and when I realize they are shots then I would either remain in place and duck, lay on the ground or run to a location that I think will provide me cover.

       You are easier to hit if you remain in place. I would instantly run and worry about the source at a much later time. What is logic behind remaining in place and ducking. Bullets don't care if you are crouched. I wonder how many lives were spent because people we told to remain in place. I understand the potential for a stampeding innocent but that would cause a few injuries or maybe deaths than sitting still so the shooter can get a clear shot. Also why are you holding a beer during an active shooter event? At that point when people are on the ground or running away it should be clear that its time to ditch the beer and gtfo.

       I have been in a couple of situations where i heard what appeared to be gunshots, so I'm speaking from experience of what I did. Regarding the beer, i guess that person didn't go into panic mode just yet, and he/she was still in the stage wondering what to do.

       Yeah i guess i wouldn't know what i would do either as I've never been in such a situation before just saying i expected a much different response. We must be very desensitized at this point to hear gun shots and not think to run but to remain still and continue to drink beer.

       It's not desensitized it is just that when you hear gunshots you at first don't even realize they are gun shots, although with automatic fire you probably realize more quickly they are gun shots but my guess is that most people would be more in a state of disbelief and wonder than in a state of panic. Maybe gang members in Chicago would panic more easily if they hear gun shots but people who are not used to gun fights don't really have a warning system in their mind that makes them go in panic mode for gun shots.

       These Vegas fat-cats - Sheldon Adelson and the like - ARE Deep State.  No way they would crimp their cash cow with this.  It's more likely retaliation AGAINST the Deep State probably by a state actor or perhaps Chinese/Asian gangs who compete with Adelson and his ilk.

       Yes. As well as the REPEATED calls of a man walking into The Bellagio with a long gun. What happened to that guy? Or the 4 people who left the car behind? This whole fucking thing is fishy.

       Well, that I understand. It sounded like there were two teams in that hallway. I don't know if you remember this but the guy who set the breach off was on the radio telling dispatch that they wanted the other team to know they were coming down the hall about 5 minutes before they breached the door.

       It did sound like something right out of a movie, for sure.

       Not much context to go on here. Was this a bad practice, then? It sounds very careless, but I don't know what specific language they used, since this is the first I've heard of it. Aren't they supposed to have codes for this kinda stuff? Also, it's my understanding that police use secure communication channels, but still use open airwaves for low security clearance stuff. I'm not disputing you here, but I'm super curious to know more about what happened. No worries if you don't respond, because I'll probably do my own research later after I look through the thread a bit.

       Thanks for keeping a vigilant eye, even on quality posters and regulars, regardless of how valuable they might be to the community. I very recently observed a moderation situation on r/portland, who – despite their rules – protected the pretty low insults and attacks of a generally civil and very regular user who has had a few rare outbursts.  It's often difficult to differentiate many otherwise quality subs from cliques and popularity contests. My participate there has dropped immensely there, despite my being a lifelong resident of 39 years.

       Regarding multiple 'Shooters' there were swat teams and off duty police officers going around the scene and hotels. I heard an eye witness account of swat storming into their suite and everyone inside thought it was more shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also even local people had weapons and were trying to help. Hell Dan Blizerian has on his instagram story a video of him running to get his weapon and then reentering the scene with his weapon.

       Realize that this is a chaotic situation and yes people may have seen other people with guns, but it doesn't mean its some conspiracy.

       I'm definitely leaning towards the possibility that Paddock was killed by one of the real shooters. The injured security guard who was up there...by himself???...yeah right. More like shooter with a self inflicted wound easily getting out with police assistance at that under the guise that Paddock shot him.

       Not to mention, the MSM forms a verdict before the authorities even have a clue what's going on. Yet, society is so brainwashed by the media, most don't even bat an eye at the fact that the media is always dreaming up a narrative (without facts) like a fiction writer. But alas, the media is truth, right?

       Those back robbers, if I'm thinking of the same instance as you, had the advantage of having significantly superior firepower and body armor for the times. The cops didn't have a chance until they got some better equipment from, IIRC, nearby gun stores and SWAT. Then they cleaned house.

       I'd suspect some kind of break-in is also going on with this event too, given there are way too many juicy targets in that regard. Multiple teams in this instance. Two or three are causing chaos to keep the police busy, and some other team is blowing into vaults. Might not even be stealing bulk cash, but transaction records and various ledgers which are likely just as important for big casinos these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       However if that guess is right, I'm not sure if the unseen group is going to make the news like the ones doing all the random shooting.

       Exactly. To me, the “multiple shooters to one shooter” angle is a red flag. Listening to the scanner and they have not once said there was only one suspect.

        As a side note, if there was a entity (that I'm assuming is of a profile that would require some semblance of secrecy and would prefer for this to not be questioned, so basically not natural terrorists) performed these shootings simultaneously in multiple places, and the game plan was to just say "one did it lol" as their game plan, that would a comically bad plan. Further I don't really get why they'd pull it down intentionally, it seems counterproductive to what I imagine someone would like to portray imo.

       Isn't that how you execute an operation and blame it on a cut-out/fall guy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Draw your cutout into a group, come up with a plan and then convince the cutout he's the guy they're invested in performing the operation.  Only the operators know the guy really can't be counted on, so there are backup/secondary operatives who guarantee the mission goes down.  The whole thing is planned so that the cutout is nearly guaranteed to get killed, thus making the "lone gunman" narrative impossible to question and the conspiracy's evidence dying with the cutout.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying this actually happened, but since this modus operandi can be applied after the fact to nearly every lone gunman shooting, it becomes kind of standard conspiracy theory logic.

       Because he made up the girl getting shot story for attention. See how we're all talking about him now? He's a socialite, being at the scene of a terrorist attack is great for his image and will probably end up being quite profitable for him.

       Why would CIA operatives know much about guns? They sell them, sure, and they have others use them, but for the most part, the CIA would rather use any tool other than a gun.

       Things don't add up, that's for sure. A lot of people think it was either bumpfire, an FA mod or a crank mod due to the fact that the speed of the bullets fired didn't seem consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The false reports of multiple shooters could be due to echoing of gunfire, leading people to believe there was more than one shooter. The scanner audio does suggest there were multiple shooters though, so I am conflicted about that. It could very well be a confusion tactic.
      </p>

       I think the biggest thing that throws me off is indeed the supposedly massive amount of guns and ammo found as well as the rest of the setup in the hotel suite.
      </p>
      <p>
       The floor shown in the picture is more likely to be around floors 16-18, the hotel has 43 floors total. Then again I've also read that the layout of the hotel is odd and that it skips numbers (?). The flashing in the picture was also present in later live footage on FOX I believe, so perhaps it is not muzzle flashing. Ofcourse I could be wrong about any of these things, just adding my two cents.

But in this thread right now are people who will tell you that this is obvious evidence of a false flag operation and all of the victims are paid actors. Once the seed of possibility is planted you'll see grieving family members being called liars and two hour YouTube "documentaries" that people smugly post links to in comment sections telling users here to wake up and see the influence of Hillary Clinton and the Illuminati.

       Easily done over a few hours, no one would notice you bringing in duffle bags, even gun cases are not out of the ordinary, nevada is a gun friendly state, but likely these weapons were concealed in large bags or broken down to fit in normal suitcases.

       whut????  I have had in the past several boxes of green tip 556 that I bought at walmart.  1000 rounds for $400 dollars.  You could easily carry 3000 rounds in a suitcase.
      </p>
      <p>
       the tricky part is getting enough pmags.
      </p>
      <p>
       but change barrels at 150 rounds???  what kind of shit 556 are you buying?  my Colt put down 300 with no issue.  It wasn't quite sustained fire like this, but between myself and a few friends we put 10 - 30 round clips through it in about 15 minutes.  shit was just fine.

       To address the machine gun part, and only that part, it's most likely he was using a "gat crank" or bumpfire modification to simulate full auto. The rate of fire varies widly within individual bursts which is a pretty clear indicator. All that means is he had possibly easy to acquire firearms that were simply modified.

       I'm unsure why nobody is just chalking it up to people calling 911 because they THINK the shooter is in their hotel.  After all, all of these resorts are literally side by side and sound echos.  Just because this is a conspiracy sub doesn't mean we need to skip over a probable reasoning for this occurrence and chalk it up to intended distractions.

       I saw a Craigslist ad taken down for a moped recently. I bet that's how the crisis actors got around. Also there was a long line at Starbucks. I bet that's how they got free coffee.

       In this video? I didn't hear him say anything like that. He was early on the scene so maybe he had a chance to be a first responder, but when he got back to his room he realized that SWAT was already handling it.

       Sometimes heroes are necessary and it would have been worth the risk to get mistaken if it meant you could engage the shooters and end the threat. In Paris for example Dan would have been really useful because the terrorists just shot people in site with no one confronting them. Although in Vegas he couldn't have done much because the threat was concealed in a vantage point very far away, at the moment he had no way of knowing if he would be able to engage the threat. So I think if he came out with a gun he did the right thing. But the problem is what if there is another good samaritan with a gun and there are still shots ringing out, they both can mistake each other, specially in such an anxious state of mind. But I guess that's an acceptable risk which happens many times in actual combat in war zones.

       If the CIA wanted this, don't you think they could strong-arm some key Republicans into supporting gun control laws? They're capable of orchestrating all these attacks but can't get Joe Bob (R) from Texas to vote for the "Obama takin ur guns" law? This is fucking stupid.

       how is all of this more believable to you then just some dude snapping and killing loads of people? im honestly surprised these mass shootings dont take place more often. and i definitely don't believe theyre all just made up. humans are fucked up and do fucked up things. especially when guns are involved, its very easy for delusional people to just point a pull a trigger.

       Not much context to go on here. Was this a bad practice, then? It sounds very careless, but I don't know what specific language they used, since this is the first I've heard of it. Aren't they supposed to have codes for this kinda stuff? Also, it's my understanding that police use secure communication channels, but still use open airwaves for low security clearance stuff. I'm not disputing you here, but I'm super curious to know more about what happened. No worries if you don't respond, because I'll probably do my own research later after I look through the thread a bit.
