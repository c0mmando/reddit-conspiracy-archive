    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s alot of claim, political, race and trans hating, and planned out by the higher ups. Do you have any source? To any claim that has been verified?</p>

<p>And really, false flags need at least a sound arugement or even a small amount of evidence. Have any.</p>

<p>Because it sounds like you have your mind made up, with nothing to back it up but are soo confident its true you are pushing it.</p>

<p>Are you bias? Kinda sounds like your bias pushing a false agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great. Ive been going like crazy on here. Just in the anti disinformation mode. I respond to all doubt the same.</p>

<p>Yea that would make sense. But then the shooter would have to be going on the assumption there is absolutely not 1 leftist there. If like you said, he didn&#39;t wanna hit lefts.</p>

<p>Or, hear me out, he could of not cared about left or right, and just mowed down everyone.</p>

<p>You think he was able to determine no lefts? Or from the distance he was able to identify the lefts and not fire at them?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am a skeptic. The reason I came over to conspiracy was there is more up to date info over here right now. I woke up at 1am Mountain time (since I passed out drunk watching football early yesterday afternoon) and I saw that it was still an active shooter situation at the time. I was browsing the news subs by new and there were dozens and dozens of articles popping up with little conversations and tidbits from people. Then all these got deleted. I don&#39;t think it is a conspiracy, just the mods being responsible because if it is a coordinated attack it would be foolish not to have a logistics team monitoring social media. All this chit chat and links to live videos are not helping the police, it is just helping the terrorists so I can agree with it but consequently if you don&#39;t see something as soon as it is posted it might disappear on you. So I came over to conspiracy because I was hoping for some fresh links</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I originally also thought it was Muslims, and squads of them at multiple locations, it didn&#39;t take make to change my mind once the full situation came to light and confirmed facts, statements and testimony.</p>

<p>But while I thought it was gangs of Muslims, cause it was the only possible way with all the different reports, I was open until I got confirmed facts and statements, and testimony. Then like any normal fella once it was laid out and the situation was less chaotic it&#39;s simple to put things together. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I have seen it was a guy blasting away from the 32nd floor of the mandalay bay into the crowd below. People who seem to know what they are talking about seem to think it sounded like a semi auto AR of some kind with a bump-fire trigger mod to make it seem like a full auto and from the videos I watched I agree. The cops had a live stream after it was all over and said his name was stephen paddock. Isis is also claiming responsibility but they claim responsibility for everything and there is certainly a chance that some 60 year old white guy from Nevada adopted the ideology (however slim that may be)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats about what I think I haven&#39;t been able to look in to anything new lol been pulling my hair out on here.</p>

<p>But yea that doesn&#39;t sound right at all. That he was radical Muslim with Asian non Muslim wife?</p>

<p>Yea that doesn&#39;t sound right at all but groups like that have a track record for claiming responsibility. And if he was a lonewolf there is no real way to refute the claim </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose if you are crazy enough to do something like that you are crazy enough to secretly convert to islam but it seems a bit dubious. And I just saw that the stuff about the facebook account was not his. Apparently he did not have a facebook account. Being from northern arizona I can tell you that Mesquite, Nevada is a fucked up town. Lots of those little towns in rural Nevada and Arizona are full of crazies.</p>
