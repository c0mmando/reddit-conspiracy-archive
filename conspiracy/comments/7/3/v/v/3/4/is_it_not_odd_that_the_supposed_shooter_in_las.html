       How do we know someone didn't kidnap this guy, take him and his guns to the hotel, and then just leave him dead to be the patsy? If you went through all this trouble to pull off a mass murder, wouldn't you want everyone to know why? Something is fishy. Either this guy was set up, or the investigators are hiding his motives.

       Stop saying "civilians" to distinguish police from regular people. Police are civilians, as well. That being said, yeah, I kind of think this dude was most likely a patsy, due to the early reports of multiple shooters.

       The point is that the police in America have become militarized to the point that they no longer consider themselves to be civilians and in fact consider themselves above civilians, rather than civil servants. Unbelievably strange that you disagree with this to be honest.

       So, one could say by saying cops are not civilians gives consent and credence to them fraudulently claiming to be separate and of higher status (ie.

        you are the problem by doing so

       I'll just chalk this up to more post-suspension weirdness from you, very strange that you think the police need "civilian consent" for their militarization ... so oddly off-base lately.

       I've never encouraged any one to do that what-so-ever. You can keep falsely accusing me of that, but it has not basis in fact/reality. In fact, that post you are referencing is in my post here, as we speak and anyone is free to view it, to come to their own conclusions about it.

       Trying telling a police officer he is a civilian. He will show you a cache of body armor and guns in his trunk and a government ID that allows him to blow your fucking face off if he feels threatened. I'm not going to argue which definition is right. They don't get treated or act like civilians.

       And that there lies the problem. They are civilians, unless they are a faction of the US military and if they are now considered that, we have a full blown militarized police state, and that should make all question how and when the hell that happened.

       It happened over the last 10 years when we started giving them tanks and military equipment. I agree it's a problem. Doesn't change the fact they are in a different class of society then the rest of us. When was the last time you felt suddenly safer when seeing a cop? For me it's never, and I'm a white dude from middle America. They are government thugs. They will only get more funding, arms, and privileges that trample our freedoms the more shit like this happens.

       Perpetuating that they are a status above the rest of us, only gives consent and credence to their fraudulent system.
       <em>
        Stop saying they are

       And that there lies the problem. They are civilians, unless they are a faction of the US military and if they are now considered that, we have a full blown militarized police state, and that should make all question how and when the hell that happened.

       That appears to be "government support". Very odd how you do not know what's in the US constitution. Are you from the US?

       Not the one. You've deleted the others after I caught and called you out. Very suspicious how you just pick a random comment of yours and show it as proof or something. Suspicious as hell. But makes sense, because you have a shady account.

       Did happen, you deleted them, and you know that. Why are you lying, if you have nothing to hide? Weird...

       Anyways, I've learned that discussing with you is pointless after a while, you use the same tactic over and over. So, with that, I shall
