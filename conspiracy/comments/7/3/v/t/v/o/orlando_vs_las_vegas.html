    <div class="md"><p>Certainly doesn&#39;t seem to be stopping people from doing it though. Yes, I&#39;ve been to concerts, clubs, bars, and pretty much everywhere. No matter where I go and what I see, I look around and a half dozen people are taking selfies and shooting videos. EVERYWHERE I GO. Everyone seems to believe they are a celebrity or a &quot;lifestyle blogger&quot; (a popular job title for know nothing-do nothings). Just as Reddit peeps want that sweet Karma, everyone else wants to capture the video that will give them their 15 minutes. A year ago is no different, so where is the video? Where are the pictures? Gay people love taking pictures more than the rest of us. They want to capture their fabulousness. I&#39;m not hating but you know it&#39;s true so where is the video? Where are the pictures?</p>
