       I live in Vegas, it's a very small city, everyone knows everyone. What happened was real, I know multiple people that were killed and my girlfriends cousin was shot through the chest but fortunately she is stable. It happened. People were killed. Now what is weird is that on the scanners they were saying 3 shooters down and 1 in custody and now they're saying it's only 1 shooter. Some fishy shit is happening but please don't call it a hoax, lots of people I know have been effected by this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I am not saying it were are being told the truth about what happened, in fact I don't believe the news or police, what I am saying is that people were actually killed and lots of people on here don't believe that

       People were killed. That isn't up for debate. The event happened. You have to be completely nuts to think the entire thing was a fantasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy here is who perpetrated it -- not whether it happened. For fucks sake man, your bullshit detector is set on 1000. You're screening out actual things that happen. Turn that shit down.

       At least 50 people are dead - fact. At least 200 or more people wounded - fact. At least one shooter - fact. Everything else is not yet fact. What is yet to be determined is the number of shooters, if more than one then who were the others, why this even happened, who benefits, is the media telling the truth (probably not). Time will unroll most of this and the rest will be exposed sometime in the future.

       You need to remember that most of the public (and people here on reddit) view the media and government as their
       <em>
        parent
       </em>
       . To contradict them is to insult them. Hence the down votes. You are attacking their
       <em>
        security
       </em>
       . The fact that you are correct is secondary.

       hoax |hōks|
noun
a humorous or malicious deception: they recognized the plan as a hoax | [as modifier] : he was accused of making hoax calls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably down voted because a hoax is a deception, not a fabrication. Calling this event a hoax does not mean that there wasn't shooting and people weren't killed. Calling it a hoax means that some aspect has been lied about.

       Thanks. The sheer magnitude of this suggests more than one shooter. We are talking 55+ dead, and 400? wounded. That's 455+ people to shoot. No mention of a machine gun. Given that, there had to be at least 2 shooters. Likely 3.

       No its not. Plenty of bullets could have ricocheted to more people, and some were most definitively injured in the chaos, trampled and whatnot. I find it hard to believe this guy did it, or that it wasnt more shooters. Just saying, its possible

      <p>
       Anything is possible. It's not very likely. There had to have been more than one shooter. Lets say, for discussion purposes, that for every person shot that a second person got shot by a ricochet. That's still at least 125 people for the shooter to have shot. That's a lot of people to shoot. A lot of military fire fights (involving many shooters) don't kill that many people.

       No, I wouldn't care to pick one or two, because my point is that, unfortunately, mass shootings happen at a pretty steady rate in the US and have for decades. If you're going to say "This one was a hoax" then you're going to need to prove it.

       It's quite odd how you insist on me giving uneducated analysis on topics I have not researched. Which just goes to show how

       He said False Flag, that does not mean fake or hoax. You should really learn the difference before acting all condescending when giving an outrageous requirement that he wanted you to narrow down so he could give you an answer yet you refused to do so.

       Yes 58 died and no footage and at least 100 more shot I just haven't seen it. My friend who woud never buy into conspiracies mentioned to me he didn't see anyone get hit and hes a weirdo who watches "watch people die" and then I realize I was seeing the same thing I'm just saying

       No they weren't LOL wat a joke people just keep adding crap.. We got video of ER rooms and it shows a few people going in none with any blood or visible signs of anything.. And if it were not a hoax why would google censor 'vegas shooting hoax' as you can't even find people investing this angle until page 11!

       Perhaps if it were a common hang out place or the person is in promotion. A random sample of people who went to a concert (surely some were not from Vegas), where the odds of them being struck personally were only  0.004% individually, and over-all combined risk of (50/20,000) 0.1% - it's actually quite impressive odds being broken.

       I'm just saying I saw a lot of pictures and videos and for the number of casualties I saw very little "action". Now I have to think people died just like Sandy hook I cant fathom how they would hoax it all it just stood out to me from the moment I woke up and watched videos

       We need to be clear about the important difference between a "false-flag" and a "hoax". Some events are hoaxes. Obviously, this one was not.

       Just because people might be using the word hoax, and fake, doesn't mean they think it didn't happen: it means they think it was mostly likely orchestrated as a false flag.

       Yeah it's just not and you don't know. It's around the 30th largest city in the country. You're just talking out your ass dude - fucking Charleston would be a small city and LV is 5-6 times more populous.

       Metro LV is almost two million people, and NV is the most transient state in the country, not to mention the average 100,000 visitors in town at any given time.  You don't know even 20% of them.

       I thought this was the real deal this morning, but I've been looking at this all day, and so far. I haven't seen anything indicating a single person was actually shot. Before you post one of the the same 4 pictures being circulated - save it.  I've seen them already and they aren't convincing. This thing is starting to sink real bad already

       Yeah so crazy in the middle of the night during a transition m traumatic event a mobile phone wasn't able to get good video.  I'm really shocked.  I'm also shocked that these people that were shot at cared more about running for their lives than documenting the event so you could pick it apart anyway.

       Yeah it's just not and you don't know. It's around the 30th largest city in the country. You're just talking out your ass dude - fucking Charleston would be a small city and LV is 5-6 times more populous.

       The point of the post is that it did happen. Many conspiracy theorists like to spread the “event never happened” bullshit. Just like they said Sandy Hook didn’t happen, etc.

       Metro LV is almost two million people, and NV is the most transient state in the country, not to mention the average 100,000 visitors in town at any given time.  You don't know even 20% of them.
