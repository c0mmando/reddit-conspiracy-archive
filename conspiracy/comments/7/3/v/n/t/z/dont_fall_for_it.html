    <div class="md"><p>Just a sad reality of access to guns. For some I know, hunting is the main source of protein. Odd to think how guns, in these instances, actually perpetuate human life. Obviously life would be grand if no one killed anyone/thing, but I don&#39;t think taking guns away will do anything to solve the larger issue; some people are more prone to violence than others. We can only control our own actions, and some lack the capability to do even that </p>

<p>The only way to enforce an effective legislation is to violate your rights as a citizen and force raid tactics on you. Gotta make sure we get all the illegal contraband! Don&#39;t worry, if you cooperate, SWAT will make sure there&#39;s not a mass shooting in your living room!</p>

<p>Basically no rules or no one listening to the rules. I personally don&#39;t see any middle ground. You either have rules and laws or you don&#39;t right? Even setting where your lines are and what rules to have is creating rules. No civilization has ever existed that wasn&#39;t built on one set of rules or another. Those rules can have grey areas but if the option is rules or no rules there isn&#39;t a grey area I can see but I&#39;m willing to let you explain what you mean. </p>

<p>Disorder is not &quot;basically no rules&quot;. More binary thinking. This seems to be a reoccuring trend. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still scratching my head at why you are so adamant about recontextualizing the conversation to be about &quot;no rules&quot;. I have not and will not advocate for &quot;no rules&quot;. You made that stance and now you want to argue against it. Very strange. </p>

<p>This is the definition of anarchy.</p>

<p>Disorder is not &quot;basically no rules&quot;. More binary thinking</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re right disorder is not following rules. it seems like you cut up my sentence though I said No rules or not following the rules. Not following rules is disorder. If not will you please define disorder? </p>

<p>I&#39;m still scratching my head at why you are so adamant about recontextualizing the conversation to be about &quot;no rules&quot;</p>

<p>The statement you made saying &quot;The only way to enforce an effective legislation is to violate your rights as a citizen and force raid tactics on you.&quot; This statement sounds like you are saying the only way to enforce laws is to violate your rights. I took from that that you believe that law enforcement is a violation of your rights. So I asked for clarity of what you believe. I said</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So are you calling for no laws? Im not sure I follow and I just want to make sure we&#39;re on the same page. To enforce property and safety rights we have to have a police force. Any group over 10 people starts to need rules to maintian order and function which calls for some form of enforcement.</p>

<p>So we can clear all this up. Do you think we need laws and if you think we as a society do need laws lets talk about what kind of Gun laws we should have and why. </p>

<p>NO. Disorder is literally a lack of order. Iraq was in DISORDER after the American bombing, but there were still rules. See the difference??</p>

<p>Well, since we were taking about GUN legislation, I assumed that was a given in the discussion. Apologies for going as far as assuming the audience was following the conversation. But I was talking about gun legislation specifically because Americans have an attachment to their guns. You can make legislation all day long, but not everyone is going to volunteer to give up their contraband. So if you want your LEGISLATION to be EFFECTIVE, you must ENFORCE the legislation. Which is going to necessitate boots on the ground (not like our government is adverse in the least to doing so) and the boots we&#39;ll get on the ground are going to treat citizens like dirt or worse, kill people for not complying. </p>

<p>Laws are important to a functioning society, we&#39;ve never disagreed on that. But GUN law is emotional for a lot of America, and will lead to a conflict that will make a mass shooting look like a playground dispute. </p>

When people follow rules you have order
When people don&#39;t follow rules you have disorder. 
You can&#39;t have people following rules and have disorder even if you mean &quot;CONFUSION&quot; when saying disorder because the confusion would be not knowing the rules to follow. </p>

<p>Iraq was in disorder after the american bombings because of the break down of rules. Otherwise they would of been following the rules and they would of had order. The could of been confused about what the rules mean and that would be  the &quot;disorder&quot; you are referring to. </p>

<p>dis·or·der
ˌdisˈôrdər/Submit
noun
1.
a state of confusion.
&quot;tiresome days of mess and disorder&quot;
synonyms:   untidiness, disorderliness, mess, disarray, chaos, confusion
verb
1.
disrupt the systematic functioning or neat arrangement of.
&quot;she went to comb her disordered hair&quot;
synonyms:   untidy, unkempt, messy, in a mess, mussed (up), mussy; </p>

<p>I agree to have effective gun legislation we must enforce our laws. If people don&#39;t want to give up there contraband then they are breaking the law and are responsible for the consequences. I have no empathy for law breakers. If they don&#39;t like the law then they are free to vote just like everyone else. If they want to resort to violence then they are breaking more laws then contraband laws. If they want to resort to violence then it just reinforces they shouldn&#39;t have guns. If a person is allowed to say I don&#39;t agree with Gun laws what stops them from saying they dont have to listen to drunk driving laws? I don&#39;t care if they are emotionally attached to their guns. Crack heads are emotionally attached to there crack doesn&#39;t change a thing. If they are a public safety concern then they should be regulated like everything else found to e a public safety issue. </p>

<p>Saying something shouldn&#39;t be illegal because then we would have to enforce the law doesn&#39;t make any sense. If people will violently resist then they will be meet with force just like if they violently resisted having their drugs taken from them. As soon as the resort to violence they give up empathy. We have laws for non-violent change and it&#39;s up to their personal responsibility to follow those channels no matter how difficult they may be. I don&#39;t like Betsy Devos but I&#39;m not going to use violence to change her. </p>

<p>How does bombing Iraq not fit this definition?</p>

<p>And neither does law enforcement. Demonstrably. Allowing them to continue to have carte blanche in how law is enforced has and will lead to the breakdown of society. Something you and I agree is bad. No one voted to have LEO&#39;s above the law, but that is the reality. Expecting otherwise from them is foolish. </p>

<p>I used the same argument in another thread regarding the shooting, but in relation to mental health...<strong>which is almost always the reason why these people commit mass murders</strong>.

    <div class="md"><p>Thats not true. You did a pretty good job of discribing the issues. Types of guns, mags, ammo, owners and background checks. Each point you just listed can be added to legiastion. Ban all made at home AR15&#39;s? We could make a law for that so we don&#39;t have untracebale guns on the street. Increase background checks and stop unregistered person to person sales we could make a law for that. So the words &quot;Gun Control&quot; is just the short version of talking about each one of those issues. If I say I want more gun control it could be anyone of those issues. If I say I want less gun control it could eqaully be anyone of those issue. Guns won&#39;t always be legal in the US ask a felon. They can very well take guns away from everyone.

Honestly seemed like this thread was placed in a queue for a couple hours and then all the voted came or it got a LOT of love in Australia. Ultimately I think it was a little of both, part of the mechanics of the site work and that some people where trying to suppress LV shooting discussions at least temporarily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree, I figured it was some mechanic or something like that but I will back up OP in saying it was rapidly downvoted after it started to gain a little bit of traction. Using what we all three are saying this could explain what I saw and would just be another example of what we all have seen over the past couple years. I think we can also all agree that over the last couple days we have had some guests to this sub that have had some alternative motives and I would not put it past them to use some of their dirtiest tricks to use an event like this.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I thought there was a thread a while back that went into some detail on how this site has been designed on the back end so that they can more or less restrict certain users content so that, at first, it is only visible to a small group of like minded people before the content gets reviewed and approved\ removed before it has a chance to reach the larger pockets of users. I will try aand find the sauce. But to me that&#39;s what it appeared to be. It was like I was in the lucky echo chamber, and we all liked it, then it got artfically squashed. </p>

<p>Anyways glad to see that it is not at 0 anymore, just saying I would not at all be surprised if the Parasites would go to such lenghts to try and supress independent journalism or civil discussion on an event this size, at least that is, until we have been told the official mantra and how you should feel.</p>

<p>Love you all, let&#39;s not jump to conclusions and let&#39;s let the evidence present itself.</p>

<p>It only takes one to make a mass shooting happen, and legislation doesn&#39;t close black markets. Most shooters don&#39;t have their guys registered, and don&#39;t purchase them legally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Side note there is an argument that people will do drugs and reasonable access should be made to the drugs to help deter crime. Say you have an opiate addiction and doctor cuts you off from a prescription where do you turn? To other means and in the current state most of those option are illegal by action of possession/etc.  I&#39;m not saying we should make heroine or meth so legal that kids can just get it but maybe we should give addicts access instead of jail as a social measure. </p>

<p>The problem is to rope it back in to guns is there is a broad problem that no bandaid will fix and in the same sentence no all encompassing law will fix either.</p>

<p>&quot;The streets&quot; are flooded with cheap, knockoff semiautomatic handguns. Rifles of any kind are rarely used in crime, automatic rifles even less so. </p>

<p>It&#39;s more like, if the ladder broke when you were on it, you might be in favor of some stricter ladder safety regulations.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the main point: there&#39;s a functional difference between an automatic rifle and one that has been modified to shoot at a rate similar to automatic rifles. But there&#39;s a huge difference in the legality of those two weapons, in that automatic weapons are generally not legal to own (or at least very hard to obtain) and trigger cranks and bump stocks are easy and legal modifications. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/03/gunman-had-a-bump-stock-device-that-could-speed-fire.html">They already found two of those in the hotel room</a>. Let&#39;s also not write off fully automatic but legal weapons as a possibility in this case before we know what his arsenal consisted of.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that all of the weapons he had were legal to own. That&#39;s a major problem, even if illegal automatic weapons on the street aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a source on the 600 but that&#39;s roughly how many were injured by either being shot or fleeing. They&#39;re all still related to the incident.</p>

<p>First off, it&#39;s a loose analogy. I think you already know that though and are just grasping for anything to argue. </p>

<p>Second, no it&#39;s not more like that. The user is the common denominator here. Say you add &quot;restrictions&quot; (more on that in a moment), what does that do to prevent him from ignoring the restrictions entirely? What if those restrictions don&#39;t apply to him? The user hasn&#39;t changed, no matter how well the ladder is built he can still fall off easily. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That may be a point you&#39;re going for, but it&#39;s not the point of this discussion which started with the claim that automatic weapons are a problem in crime. They aren&#39;t, it&#39;s that simple. </p>

<p>I imagine you would have been quick to point out examples of they existed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s possible that all of the weapons he had were legal to own. That&#39;s a major problem, even if illegal automatic weapons on the street aren&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So back to the &quot;restrictions&quot; you mention above: How exactly do they prevent a 64 yo middle-upper class man with no prior mental health or legal history from obtaining them? </p>

<p>If he can&#39;t obtain them no one can. So what you&#39;re talking about is a violation of the 2A, might as well just come out and say it. </p>

<p>In doing so you should consider if America really needs to give up the right to not only this but also due process and protection against search and seizure, because that&#39;s what you&#39;re talking about when you decide this is the best course of action.</p>

<p>I for one would prefer to keep the few rights I still have.</p>

<p>And the numbers don&#39;t support your claim of &quot;a huge problem&quot; with legal gun ownership. The ratio of illegal shootings to gun ownership doesn&#39;t support this, you&#39;re talking about a few thousand to hundreds of millions. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ah but that&#39;s not what you said above, is it? You said that 600+ people were shot by one man. </p>

<p>Pretty significant difference in context of the discussion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no looser than yours. Restrict dangerous alternatives in favor of safer ones as a preventative measure. Does it work in 100% of cases? Of course not. No law does. But by your logic, why should we have preventative laws against anything if &quot;users&quot; are just going to act how they wish? I presume there are at least some of these laws you would agree with. Some restrictions actually work pretty well with adequate enforcement, as I&#39;m sure you know.</p>

<p>I frankly don&#39;t care what you call it. 200+ year old documents often need facelifts. The founders weren&#39;t perfect, and that&#39;s why they left a repeal mechanism in place. Replace it with something that addresses our current needs, and eliminate the vagueness about &quot;militias&quot; and &quot;arms&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in favor of legal, responsible gun ownership. I&#39;m not in favor of incredibly liberal gun laws that allow potentially dangerous people to amass arsenals and having the capacity to kill 59 people in a very short amount of time. I&#39;d love to see you keep a straight face while telling me this crime could have been committed at the same scale using only handguns.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t disagree with one part of the Constitution? If I think 2A is outdated and in need of revision, I must necessarily think the rest is garbage, too? Would you say this of people who were in favor of repealing the prohibition amendment? This is total nonsense.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always amusing when your type pretends there aren&#39;t already measures in place. You demand the &quot;100%&quot; prevention and refuse to recognize that these incidents are extreme outliers in relation to the number of guns in circulation. </p>

<p>You&#39;re talking about 13,000 or so gun homicides each year out of hundreds of <em>millions</em> of people and guns, and only a small percentage of those are random, non-gang related shooters. You have 99%+ not being used for illegal violence and it&#39;s not good enough. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I frankly don&#39;t care what you call it. 200+ year old documents often need facelifts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wondered if you&#39;d ever get around to some honesty. It&#39;s always the same with you folks: &quot;No one is trying to take your guns, we just don&#39;t want anyone to have guns&quot;. Blah, blah, blah. </p>

<p>Well here&#39;s a news flash for you: even if you were able to pull off a repeal you would succeed only in making a black market for illegal buyers. You would stop absolutely nothing except the hundred thousand or so people who use them to protect themselves every year. You would serve the country up on a platter to every criminal, gang and malicious government agency, then cry about some other non-issue that you&#39;ll definitely fix this time.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another news flash: the country doesn&#39;t want a repeal. It&#39;s that simple. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d love to see you keep a straight face while telling me this crime could have been committed at the same scale using only handguns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d like to see you tell me with a straight face that rifles are suddenly a problem considering their use in violent crime is so rare. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t disagree with one part of the Constitution? If I think 2A is outdated and in need of revision, I must necessarily think the rest is garbage, too? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why I don&#39;t like people like you. You can&#39;t think. You latch onto this one idea and get tunnel vision. </p>

<p>Use your head. Say you get rid of the 2A. Now you have some 2-300,000,000 guns in the country that are illegal, and in many areas every household has at least one.</p>

<p>Are you going to offer to buy them back at fair market value? No, it would cost far too much. So you would rely on some few voluntarily turning in their guns, then go after those who did not. </p>

<p>So besides the fact that you as the government just robbed people who committed no crime of their money and possessions, you also have another problem: people aren&#39;t honest, especially when it comes to protecting what&#39;s theirs. </p>

<p>You have no way to know if that person who turned in one gun has ten more buried somewhere or hidden in their basement. You have no idea who all is in possession of these guns because there is no federal registry and even if there were there&#39;s no way to track private sales and gifts. And even if there were, there&#39;s no reason to believe most people would comply with it because they saw this coming a mile away. </p>

<p>So what are your options? </p>

<p>You would have to go door to door searching every home, every nook and cranny, every property. You would have to open deposit boxes in banks and use metal detectors in yards. </p>

<p>And you would have to do all this without any due process or legitimate warrants. In short, you would turn America into a complete and total police state, and very likely trigger a civil war in the process.</p>

<p>You would take good, law abiding people who believe that the government grants privileges, not rights and turn them into criminals. </p>

<p>All for what? A promise of safety that can&#39;t be kept? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I said 600. Call it 500. Call it 400. Call it 300. How many is enough for you to realize that legal ownership of these types of guns is problematic? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A hell of a lot more than 13,000 or so when hundreds of millions of guns are owned. </p>

<p>If your claim holds any water then gun violence should be going up as ownership goes up. But it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>If your claim holds any water then there should be hundreds of thousands or more dead by gun violence every year. But there&#39;s not.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy pretty easy to see if you don&#39;t have a season pass to ride the emotional rollercoaster every time it takes off.</p>

<p>Negative. First off, repealing 2A wouldn&#39;t magically make all guns illegal, that theoretically would be an additional act of Congress. But we wouldn&#39;t even get there because, secondly, if it was replaced with something more specific <em>like I proposed</em>, it would leave the large majority of gun owners alone.

<p>I guess you want more gun violence? I don&#39;t know, personally, I&#39;d like to see less.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>gun violence should be going up as ownership goes up</p>

<p>Oh right, because when two variables are correlated, that naturally implies causation, right? There are no other factors at play like poverty, population density, and access to law enforcement?</p>

<p>Swing and a big miss, you&#39;re now 0 for 4. I&#39;m benching you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your a fucking shill, if not your missing some chromosomes or just never learned to have a logical critical analytical mind.</p>

<p>These mass shootings take place in gun free zones.</p>

<p>If everyone had a side arm, it would have been much more difficult for paddock to pull it off by himself (official narrative)</p>

<p>As it is the logistics of this shooting are just not possible with an aged average man.</p>

<p>If he was with ISIS then why didn&#39;t the Nevada Fusion Centers red flag this guy. </p>

<p>This is without a doubt a CIA/MOSSAD operation.</p>

<p>You keep saying muh freedoms like gun control is the only thing keeping you free in this country. You know your freedoms are restricted and controlled every single day, right? Speed limits on roads restrict your driving for safety, not shouting fire in a theater restricts your freedom of speech for safety, see the pattern yet? Background checks, gun show/private sale requirements, records of sale, waitlists. None of this is going to keep you from stocking up on guns and continuing to use them absolutely nowhere practical except on the range while you pretend to stop shooters and terrorists.

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve obviously given up on freedom and have completely submitted to authority. I bet it makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. </p>

<p>Shouldn&#39;t we try every other possible solution before surrendering our freedoms. Useful idiots like you just rush straight to the polling booth to vote your agency away, sad. </p>

<p>Europe&#39;s murder rate and bodily harm rate is rising every year and it wont be long before it matches the United States&#39;s. But the government will never let them protect themselves and the government can be as tyrannical as they want without worry. It&#39;s already fucking terrible there. Look whats happening in Catalonia. </p>

<p>The founding fathers have already thought this problem through and come to the conclusion that individual rights Trump the consequences of liberty. Andrew Jackson had been shot several times in his life in duels which were commonplace back then. Gun crime was just as much a problem in the 18th century if not more and people actually would commonly carry multiple flintlock pistols so they had the same capacity as revolvers which is considered the minimum for adequate personal defense. The following is a picture of how they carried their weapons:
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/DgSP8">http://imgur.com/a/DgSP8</a></p>

<p>And anyway. Why not let separate communities have differing levels of gun control? And the current methods of gun control are completely ineffective. If a city wants to ban guns I agree they should be able to but I wouldnt wanna live there unless they somehow guaranteed that no one had guns. </p>

<p>And good fucking luck taking people&#39;s fucking guns in America. Criminals will ALWAYS have access to guns. Even in Europe there are guns for sale on the black market. You have no idea what you are talking about. </p>

<p>This is a fucking 3D printed gun:</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/FTZEn">http://imgur.com/a/FTZEn</a>&#39;</p>

<p>This is a fucking DIY 3d printer made of a glue gun and legos and perfectly capable of producing plastic guns.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/a3bFK">http://imgur.com/a/a3bFK</a></p>

<p>Guns are actually very simply objects and a metal tube with a small hole in one side with the end blocked off produces a musket. Now though sophisticated plastic guns are 3D printable which could even be semi automatic and concealable. Furthermore metal 3D printers will one day be cheap enough and if society does not learn how to cooperate and create a distributed means of trusting one another, and tolerate eccentric lifestyles and free speech and what not we are going to only give up power to a totalitarian police state because the metal 3D printers will allow criminals or your average psycho the means to create things much more destructive than pistols.</p>

<p>How do you suppose we should ban those 3D printed plastic guns? Ban &quot;glue guns?&quot; You realize that&#39;s basically what a cheap 3D printer is? No matter what you do the opposition will learn to get around it, whether that is cyber snooping or literally banning 3D printers. People will learn how to make their own 3D printers and the instructions for how to do so will be posted online.</p>

<p>Allowing it on the clear net means there is a chance that they can be tracked, at least, but criminals already know how to use tor and your average psycho on the internet certainly knows how to use tor. And if tor gets taken down it&#39;s only a matter of time before someone makes an alternative because there are reasons to want to protect your privacy other than violent crime, but when society goes after people for &quot;crimes&quot; that are simply individual choice and ethical then it forces good citizens to need the same things criminals need to protect their identity.</p>

<p>A more open, tolerant, and understanding society would mean that people feel less threatened sharing their information and would mean that only people who actually want to do something bad have anything to hide. Unfortunately that would take a major change in culture and society which is actually less probable than a totalitarian police state but we should at least try. Before it&#39;s too late.</p>

<p>It&#39;s only a matter of fucking time before your average pyscho, terrorist or criminal smartens up a bit then this is going to blow up in our fucking faces literally and the only deterrent will be either a totalitarian police state or armed citizens. Alternatively we could come up with a decentralized means of trusting one another, maybe using some kind of circle of trust on social media, like if 5 people sign off on trusting someone then they are cleared from checking their house for forbidden legos and glue guns? Anyway it&#39;s in our best interest to start cooperating online right now before the state steps in and starts &quot;protecting&quot; us through totalitarian police state policies.</p>

<p>Also gun control advocates fail to take into consideration an individual&#39;s right to protect themselves. Just because YOU feel safe relying on a corrupt system for your protection does not mean everyone else does and that also means that people living in rural areas will have zero defense against criminals. There really are no-go zones for police in Europe but that also exists in America. There really are neighborhoods in places like Compton that are entirely gang controlled and cops wont go there without a swat team and you may have to wait half and hour for police to arrive when you call them. </p>

<p>Not to mention by the time the police are called it is too late and there is already a victim. But gun control advocates don&#39;t even consider people like truckers who travel across the nation and may have to sleep at sketchy truck stops for example. An individual should be allowed adequate protection anywhere in the United States, not just rich gated neighborhoods.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not fair to punish legal gun owners for the acts of criminals. Many of the guns used in crimes are stolen but it&#39;s simply unethical to punish individuals that are law abiding for criminals behavior. This might not mean much to you but for those of use that regard liberty as essential for life and not an arbitrary abstract concept, it has validity.</p>

<p>We should be trying every fucking possible solution <em>before</em> surrendering our freedoms to the federal government. I do not understand why people like you want so badly to not be free. You&#39;re obviously brainwashed and cucked. There ARE other options, yet youre the one unwilling to try them. Just straight to giving more power to centralized authority, sick!</p>

<p>Have you realized why violent psychos pick movie theaters and schools as targets? Because theyre specifically <em>gun free zones!</em> Criminals can always get weapons! Especially in America! You want to surrender your freedoms even when it will barely fucking work and then there will be no going back and the government cant be stopped by then. We will never get our freedoms back so the only option is to never fucking surrender them in the first place. If a single city or community wants to ban guns i guess they should be let to do that but its a nightmare either way. <strong>We need more robust methods of trusting eachother.</strong> One idea might be using a form of cryptographic tokens to determine who is trustworthy by a type of &quot;circle of trust system.&quot; Why wouldnt you even want to try something like that instead of being so fucking enthusiastic about cucking yourself??? </p>

<p>I had a quick google and came up with a website called Armslist that had many assault rifles for sale in Nevada. The one that the shooter was mainly using was illegal, I get that. But it seems a hell of a lot easier to buy an arsenal in Nevada than Sydney.</p>

<p>Easy is a relative term, but from the looks of it any Nevada resident could simply buy whatever gun they want as long as someone is willing to sell. No background check, no need to register. The only hurdle is the seller needs to determine if you &quot;look suspicious&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that is enough and I don&#39;t think tightening those laws constitute taking away someone&#39;s right to bare arms.</p>

<p>so have plenty of non-tyrannical governments. Having an AR10 or AR15 isn&#39;t going to &quot;stop tyranny&quot;. Its a bullshit argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t think it would be better than nothing? </p>

<p>&quot;And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?… The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin’s thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If…if…We didn’t love freedom enough. And even more – we had no awareness of the real situation.&quot;</p>

But when an armored vehicle is sitting outside of your house, you&#39;ve been flash banged, and its the dead of night, your gun isn&#39;t going to do anything against the 20 trained, armed, soldiers.

<p>Luckily your reasoning is faulty. The US military is never going to have 20 trained, armed soldiers for every gun owner. The ratio is actually more than 20 armed citizens per soldier. Disarmament is never going to happen without a fight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have the facts, but you haven&#39;t made the connection between the presence of a federal government consisting of a few hundred wealthy people taking thousands of dollars per citizen to fund a $700 billion per year military, and a citizen&#39;s desire to exercise one the founding principles of the country? The connection between a government willing to imprison more people than any other country, and even now willing to openly assassinate its own citizens without trial at the president&#39;s command, and a citizen&#39;s desire to defend himself from that government? </p>

<p>Are you under the mistaken impression that Americans actually have the political power outside the force of arms to change any the things you&#39;re complaining about?

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it is.</p>

<p>I own tons of firearms. I can carry concealed as I please and have licenses as well as clearances with the US government.</p>

<p>If the gun goes across state lines, it is a federal fuck you in the ass crime to ship it direct. If it&#39;s within the State, State laws apply.</p>

<p>Person to person sales are legal.</p>

<p>Anyone who is a dealer, also known as an FFL, who sells new guns absolutely does all that stuff. Paperwork, background, calling the Federal government on the phone right there and then.</p>

<p>Armslist is basically a place for dealers to sell cheap guns. It&#39;s like cars.com</p>

<p>Used guns, within the State, in person, is the only place the Federal check doesn&#39;t always hold. And only in certain states. And even then you can be held liable for failure to due diligence selling a weapon... Most private sellers want your god damn info, and many won&#39;t sell at all unless you have the licenses I have issued by the State after federal review.</p>

(Although fixing the media might help there somewhat) but many would never have thought of shooting up the place if there were enough safety nets to keep them from feeling like their life is over.</p>

<p>But again, we&#39;re talking about the USA, land of &quot;fuck you, I&#39;ve got mine... and if I don&#39;t got mine I&#39;ll kill you all and go out in a blaze of glory.&quot;</p>

<p>Suspect was fully accurate? Uh, as a former machine gunner in the Marine Corps, it does NOT take much accuracy when firing into a large target area at that distance. It was a large concert, with a lot of people in attendance over a large area. The guy wasn’t using a bolt action rifle to pick people off one by one.</p>

<p>What this guy supposedly did is what us machine gunners would call enfilade fire, which is when the cone of fire (where the rounds are impacting), coincide or nearly coincides with the long axis of the target. Basically meaning you’re entire “impact area” is completely encompassed with your target. It’s a machine gunner’s wet dream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you a former machine gunner? Obviously not because you do not know what covering fire is? Okay even assuming that rapid fire is beneficial <strong>youre acting like a person cant squeeze the trigger fast.</strong> That is obviously false. And semis can be <em>easily</em> modified to shoot fully automatic. Do you know that you can bump fire without an official &quot;bump fire&quot; stock?</p>

<p>Again. People are perfectly capable of squeezing a trigger fast. Again. Hitting people in the arms and legs is not beneficial. He also was too high up and chose probably too small of a caliber. A 338 lapua from a lower story window I think would have been much deadlier. And faster does not always equal more deadly! </p>

<p>Its no coincidence that there were so many injuries but relatively few deaths. He apparently hit like 300-400 people yet &quot;only&quot; killed 60. Think if he had been aiming for their chests. Actually much scarier. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calm down champ, I&#39;m not blaming your guns. I&#39;m saying that any Joe fuckwad shouldn&#39;t be able to buy a device that gives them automatic weapon capabilities. Tell me you at least agree with that?</p>

<p>Also if Trucks had no other primary purpose for most people besides potential murder tools, I&#39;d say we should at least implement some smart rules regarding them. Trucks get a pass because they&#39;re basically a necessity for society as we know it to function-- the risk of its use as a murder tool is a calculated acceptance we all agree to live with.</p>

<p>You seem to have this mindset that guns are just as needed in life as trucks somehow? Sorry, your shooting range permit is not as important in society than a CDL. You don&#39;t need 40 rifles the same way you need an automobile to get to work in the morning.</p>

<p>Do you need the current status quo so badly regarding guns that you feel the occasional mass murder is acceptable? That we should continue this transaction of allowing things like automatic weapon mods and bump stocks, paid with the cost of human lives every so often?</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for target shooting, plinking, hunting, competition, and home defense. I just think we can manage to enjoy all those while still being reasonable about how we exchange weapons. I truly don&#39;t understand how people like you think it&#39;d be impossible to maintain those hobbies after any sort of gun legislation takes affect. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he used a automatic weapon he didn&#39;t get it legally. So how is a law banning automatic weapons gonna stop people who don&#39;t follow gun laws to begin with? Second amendment is not for hobbies or hunting. If you read it carefully it actually to allow the people stop the government from be coming a tyranny. They will probably take away bump stocks because he probably used a AR with a bumpstock. If you think taking away guns makes you more safe that&#39;s simply not true. Statistics show that places where gun control is the toughest like Chicago and NYC this is where most crime and the least safe. So if you think that some how the government is going make everything alright and make you safe again, fine. I just caution you to think twice. Once you get the point to where they are taking away rights that YOU care about you will have very few tools protect yourself and your family  at that point. If you believe Bumpstocks shouldn&#39;t be sold I can kind of compromise with you there. However, if you think that&#39;s the last gun law the powers that be will want to make you are truly foolish. If the US or any other country could take all the guns away from there people they would do so in a heart beat.</p>

I agree that no one should own 10+ rifles and thousands of rounds of ammo. Handguns with 30 round clips and crazy shit like that.I see your points where guns could be from another more primitive time. But by saying a person can&#39;t have gun on there own property like a shotgun is good for home defense. You are kinda saying to them if you get attacked robbed they don&#39;t have the right to defend yourself. Cops are great but they can&#39;t be everywhere at once. You would be depending on them to get to you in time which is not always possible. Like in PR and Texas there has been looting but the news don&#39;t want to mention it. Hows a cop gonna help you when he can&#39;t even get to you. When the electricity is off and the stores aren&#39;t open people can get uncivilized real fast.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, first of all - thanks for engaging in discussion. We actually agree on some points.</p>

<p>Where would you draw the line between weapons that actually have a use in self defence and weapons that haven&#39;t? I think handguns and pistols should be exempt because they have a use as self defense weapons, hunting rifles and shotguns because they have a use in hunting. Considering the conditions and reality in the US, you should be able to keep those at home. Everything else, selective fire rifles, extended mags, etc should be kept at the gun range.</p>

<p>For the (imo quite outlandish) scenario that shit hits the fan in a way that government collapses to a point where it can&#39;t enforce this (basic) gun control anymore, that should be more than enough to clear any zombies in your path to the gun range where you can retrieve your heavier weapons.</p>

<p>My idea was more about social control/responsibility being facilitated by laws. If you were required to interact with other people because they have a responsibility for keeping you and your heavier guns safe at the gun range, they might be able to spot when someone becomes dangerous to others or themselves. More failsafes, basically. Still not perfect protection, but I think it might be a good balance between individual rights and trying to get spree killings under control. There would still be gun violence, but at least you&#39;d have an upper limit on the number of people someone kills in a spree, so to speak.</p>

<p>Again, my perspective is different, considering I&#39;m in a country where you just don&#39;t assume that someone you run into on the street could pull a gun on you. Government is stable enough and has enough fail safes that I don&#39;t expect a collapse. No regular natural disasters (except for occasional flooding) that disrupt infrastructure for more than a few days.</p>

<p>You are implying that 58 people dead today is somehow a drop in the bucket of how many are killed by other means.</p>

<p>If you say no to any of those, it is you who isn&#39;t rational.</p>

<p>Guns are one of the best deterrents of suffering in the world. They equalize the strength difference between men and women, give the common man power over his government, and teach people the value and responsibility of power.</p>

<p>How you think it is rational to ban them, when they don&#39;t even account for 1% of all deaths, on the grounds that they can cause death, when I know you don&#39;t support banning those things which cause even more deaths, is simply delusional.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mass shooting? Mass killing is more important. The tool used is irrelevant which is my point. The Nice truck attack killed more people and no gun was used.</p>

<p>If you want to use that line of reasoning for the 2nd amendment, you also need to apply it to the 1st amendment. Is text speech? What about thought? &quot;the right to bear arms&quot; does not limit the type of arms at all. It does not specify which means it does not limit. If you limit that, what makes you think the 1st amendment can&#39;t also be so limited? Be careful what precedent you set.</p>

<p>You talk about stopping mass shootings as if that will actually have an impact at all on the number of people killed violently. It won&#39;t. We have proof of this. The only solution to preventing Mass killings by any means is to strengthen the bonds of the community, not rob people of their rights when they themselves are not a threat to society.</p>

<p>&quot;Also, can you list me what you consider the most important things needed in order to carry out a mass shooting? Just curious.&quot;</p>

<p>All you need to kill dozens of people is the will to do it and the person with the will to do it. The tool is irrelevant. The problem is that we have people who are willing to take the lives of their fellow Americans by any means necessary. </p>

<p>I know what you want me to say. &quot;You need a gun&quot;. Duh, you can&#39;t &quot;shoot&quot; without a gun, but since when is a gun needed to kill people? Since when is my right to bear a gun of any type responsible for someone else&#39; decision to maliciously kill dozens of innocent people?</p>

<p>Whether you like my post or agree with it. I care about all of you. I want your life and your children&#39;s lives to be free and happy and devoid of violence. To do that, they will have to defend their happiness from evil. They need guns to do it. It&#39;s the only tool we have to make &quot;all men equal&quot; a reality. </p>

<p>I only ask that people look at the real root of this problem- a heavily radicalized and divided population. The rhetoric thrown around politically now a days, the animosity each side has for one another is what causes these mass killings. That is where we should focus our efforts. People are what kill people with violence. They have always, for our entire history, found a way to kill eachother. Guns being invented changed nothing other than giving the weak a means to compete with the strong. That should be something everyone can agree upon. Before guns we were ruled by thuggery not thought.</p>

<p>If you want to use that line of reasoning for the 2nd amendment, you also need to apply it to the 1st amendment. Is text speech? What about thought? &quot;the right to bear arms&quot; does not limit the type of arms at all. It does not specify which means it does not limit. If you limit that, what makes you think the 1st amendment can&#39;t also be so limited? Be careful what precedent you set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you know what a slippery slope fallacy is? I wasn&#39;t going to mention it in regards to the 2nd amendment, but are you actually trying to say that by implementing any sort of gun laws we&#39;re threatening the first amendment as we know it? Please think about how much of a stretch that is. Even if it was true this was somehow the intent, which we don&#39;t know-- this is just a speculative hunch on your part, there&#39;s nothing stopping republicans from preventing it from going that far. Why is any sort of reasoning regarding guns off the table due to this threat when your political party is literally in full control of its extent?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You talk about stopping mass shootings as if that will actually have an impact at all on the number of people killed violently. It won&#39;t. We have proof of this. The only solution to preventing Mass killings by any means is to strengthen the bonds of the community, not rob people of their rights when they themselves are not a threat to society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What proof? I keep hearing that there&#39;s proof that guns have no coorelation to the amount of violence caused by a perpetrator, but I&#39;ve never been shown it. How credible is this proof? Is this a study, or what?</p>

<p>Ask any military officer about the effectiveness of a pistol compared to an automatic machine gun, emplaced in a mounted position while defending an embassy. None of them are going to say that the effectiveness, the potential body count in this analogy, is going to be equal let alone similar. Where did you get this idea that guns don&#39;t affect the potential number of people killed when it&#39;s extremely obvious that just a more effective gun will do that exact same thing?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All you need to kill dozens of people is the will to do it and the person with the will to do it. The tool is irrelevant. The problem is that we have people who are willing to take the lives of their fellow Americans by any means necessary.</p>

<p>I know what you want me to say. &quot;You need a gun&quot;. Duh, you can&#39;t &quot;shoot&quot; without a gun, but since when is a gun needed to kill people? Since when is my right to bear a gun of any type responsible for someone else&#39; decision to maliciously kill dozens of innocent people?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is the tool irrelevant? In order for someone to commit such a mass murder, they have to go through certain steps. They have to build up the &#39;courage&#39; to do it, they have to plan how they&#39;re going to do it, and they have to acquire the tools to execute that plan. Affecting those first to is non-trivial. I get the concept of trying to &quot;strengthen the bonds of the community&quot; and make people less likely to act out like this, but functionally how the hell do you expect to accomplish that? That is such a huge unknown territory of social change that I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to purposefully influence in the first place. </p>

<p>So what does that leave us with? Affecting the tools available to the perpetrators. Do you remember the scene in Pulp Fiction where Bruce Willis is in the pawn shop looking for a weapon? Every potential weapon has a different amount of effectiveness, and therefore each has a different upper limit of how much damage can be done in a certain amount of time. Yes, knives can cause mass murders, but while an assailant might be able to kill 5 people in a minute using a knife, that same assailant could probably murder 100 with an automatic machine gun.</p>

<p>So that brings us back to my main point: what purpose do civilians have for amassing such a large arsenal of guns and ammo? and then considering that purpose, is that &#39;right&#39; really so important to us that we shouldn&#39;t screen them or require a license or whatever we decide is best, for them to do so? I don&#39;t know the solution so don&#39;t take that last thing I said to heart, I&#39;m just trying to say that <em>something</em> needs to be done.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether you like my post or agree with it. I care about all of you. I want your life and your children&#39;s lives to be free and happy and devoid of violence.

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s completely fine. Anybody can accomplish this with a few weapons and a few boxes of ammo. Again, a person only has two arms. My whole thing in this is that I don&#39;t understand how a civilian could have a legitimate need to stock up and acquire such a huge amount of potential destruction. And that begs the question as to why we aren&#39;t at least pondering why they need it and whether or not they can be trusted with it in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I completely understand the ideology at play here. Truly. I have a similar issue with politicians trying to change the internet as we know it with the whole net neutrality thing going on. The main thing I disagree on however is that guns are not a catalyst for violence. Hell, our country is arguably the way it is today in part because we americans invented a more effective weapon with the rifled barrel than the British had at the time.</p>

<p>You&#39;re absolutely right that violence has never changed at its core. But I insist that things are much different due to their modern level of effectiveness. The Boston Massacre only involved 5 deaths, likely because flintlocks limited how effective they could be. Today, if the exact same situation was acted out with modern guns, that number would be in the hundreds. Like I&#39;ve said, other countries don&#39;t have quite the same critical issue we have, even though they do have the occasional unfortunate tragedy. A European is perfectly capable of committing plenty of violence if planned out and executed properly. In America however, that plan is already 90% completed already: just buy a gun and point it at people. It&#39;s too easy. We make it far too easy-- you can literally, on a whim, go buy a gun just to immediately shoot up a mall with it. No questions asked. Hell, you could probably then return it to the gun shop like nothing happened. I&#39;m not saying we should restrict someone&#39;s ability to buy a gun in that way, but at the very least we have no reason why we can&#39;t limit things that allow massacres to happen. There&#39;s no reason why we can&#39;t limit someone&#39;s ability to effectively wage a Rambo-style military assault against a crowd of people. </p>

<p>In our history, average citizens have never been able to hold as much destructive power as a modern citizen today in the USA can. The 2nd amendment was not written with fully-automatic, silenced, belt-fed guns carried by people with 2,000 rounds of ammunition in mind. That would be about the equivalent of an entire division of their troops back then. The constitution is great but it was purposefully written to be adapted to the times, unquestionably relying on it in this way to direct our actions on modern issues like this is not very smart. That said, I&#39;m not saying we should exclude certain things from civilians, just that they have so much killing potential that we need some sort of rational process to at least make them harder to fall into the wrong hands.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave you with this: <em>something</em> needs to change. I don&#39;t know what it is, but it needs to be done and it needs to be actually effective. Leaving out the &#39;gun&#39; part of that equation is not productive if we&#39;re trying to implement reasonable laws that will prevent massacres such as this. Something can be worked out that will make everyone happy, but the first thing we need to do is to be able to discuss it in the open without such vitrole and expectations of ulterior motives.</p>

<p>Either way, thanks for the good conversation. It&#39;s nice to have an actual discussion for once instead of being called an antifa liberal cuck over and over or whatever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too appreciate the discussion.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not for everyone having access to all types of weapons. A pocket nuke in everyone&#39;s hands would be bad for everyone. I agree. I&#39;m not trying to argue that.</p>

<p>My point is that we have to be very careful about where we draw the lines. &quot;More gun control&quot; is not a smart position, and I&#39;m not suggesting that is your position. My main post was simply a general case for why the core argument of gun control does not address the fundamental issue with these types of attacks.</p>

<p>We won&#39;t see fewer deaths or less violence with more gun control. I linked to many such studies and I&#39;ve not yet seen a compelling case where gun control made anybody safer. I&#39;ve not seen it, and I can&#39;t find it. If it were true and common knowledge then I&#39;d have the exact opposite position.</p>

<p>I disagree that a pistol is adequate. As you said, the base power of weapons has been elevated. The entire point to an armed citizenry is that they can compete with any authority hovering over them. If their power becomes too far removed, it is the same as having no power at all. If the person breaking into your house has tools and capabilities you cannot legally compete against, then you are helpless.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t claim to know where that line is drawn, but I know that I&#39;d rather have the people around me armed than not. I would hope the virtues of an armed population are obvious. </p>

<p>You ask for proof. I linked to you many such studies. Furthermore, guns and crime are correlated - inversely. Meaning more guns in the hands of law abiding citizens means less crime. So there is a correlation, but it is the exact opposite of what gun control activists scream constantly.</p>

<p>Only the border states, with high gun ownership, defy that trend and the reasons for that are perfectly clear if you look at the data. They have to deal with a statistically significant amount of crime unrelated to the factors involved in such studies. If you account for that, and you look at the rates of crime before and after gun control legislation, the results clearly and concisely indicate more guns== less crime.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a libtard for sure. I&#39;m genuinely interested in the facts, but the facts don&#39;t tell me more gun control matters. Every sensible piece of information I can find, modern or historical, suggests that guns are essential to maintain democracy, reduce suffering, and keep freedoms in tact. </p>

<p>I only ask that, if you are sensible about it, you acknowledge my right to bear arms the way I recognize your right to speak freely about taking such rights away. It is a two way road. </p>

<p>It is indeed a slippery slope. If you think the 1st amendment isn&#39;t being categorized the way the 2nd amendment has been for decades I advise you to just look at what is going on. The censorship, the labels, the many speech laws going into effect in 1st world democracies around the world. It is shocking, and guns, I think, are more relevant and needed in the populace&#39;s hands today than ever before.</p>

<p>Thank you for the discussion. Be safe and live well!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I must have missed the studies you linked; I&#39;m having a few of these conversations simultaneously and might not have got around to reading them. I&#39;ll just assume though they&#39;re true in the way you interpret them for the sake of a clear argument.</p>

<p>I think the main issue at the core of our differences is two trains of thought: I&#39;m looking at it historically, in the sense of how other countries compare to ours and how they try to prevent these things from happening. I also understand that far end of a solution is basically your 2nd amendment nightmare, but I see no reason why there can&#39;t be a perfectly fine, effective, compromise.</p>

<p>From what I gather of your opinion, you look at it mostly from our own insular experience with guns and crime. Which I appreciate, it&#39;s perfectly reasonable as long as the studies are sound and interpreted properly. The thing that scares people like me though is that this is new ground. The idea that more guns would solve this is almost experimental in a way. I don&#39;t want to turn this more political than it needs to be, but it reminds me of policies like &quot;trickle down&quot; econ that are, in the kindest way I can say it, still a point of contention and unclear effectiveness decades after being put into place. Maybe it still will work at advertised at some point, but nobody can honestly know whether it will or not-- just like I can&#39;t say making all guns illegal won&#39;t solve gun crime and like you can&#39;t say giving everyone guns would do the same. </p>

<p>So effectively, we have to try something to know whether it works or not. My argument would be that other countries like Canada, from what I understand of the majority of their law(besides Quebec, that place is nuts), allow you to buy and own guns very reasonably. They also have no problem with civilian militia either, I believe. A lot of people find comfort in knowing that it works great for others so it must work for us, which is a whole debate in itself that I immediately concede as probably wrong for such a crazy place as the USA</p>

<p>I also understand that you have to give efforts like you suggested 100% effort for them to truly work. A half-measure isn&#39;t going to work, and unfortunately for us both those seem to be Washington&#39;s specialty.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like how so many people are so sure that <em>their</em> idea about this is the only possible good solution, and refuse to even discuss other possibilities. At the very least this conversation we&#39;re having is the first step. Now we just need to get everyone else in on it too...</p>

<p>No worries. They are there though. I even linked a pro gun control study that has pretty fair data as a counter argument. I then elaborated on why it&#39;s not entirely reliable (not necessarily to the fault of the authors).</p>

<p>&quot;I think the main issue at the core of our differences is two trains of thought: I&#39;m looking at it historically, in the sense of how other countries compare to ours and how they try to prevent these things from happening. I also understand that far end of a solution is basically your 2nd amendment nightmare, but I see no reason why there can&#39;t be a perfectly fine, effective, compromise.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing, other countries do not prevent these things. Europe has the record even after sunday for mass murder with a gun and guns are almost universally banned over there. In the absence of guns, people find other ways, such as acid, trucks, bombs (made from household items you can get at a grocery store) etc. Many of these alternative methods have higher kill counts than any mass murder with guns. So, guns clearly don&#39;t cause more crime.</p>

<p>Secondly, overall violent crime in Europe is rising rapidly while in the USA it has been steadily falling for decades except for a bump in recent years. This is despite gun sales for the past few decades continuously setting records. I can&#39;t link you sources atm due to work, but just look them up. I will link them to you later if I get the chance.</p>

<p>The point being that the grass is NOT greener in other countries, not at all. Sweden, for example, currently has the highest rates of rape of any 1st world nation atm. That is not indicative of a healthy society. 
<a href="https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/5195/sweden-rape">https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/5195/sweden-rape</a></p>

<p>This is Mr Sander&#39;s supposed paradise model. </p>

<p>Now the US doesn&#39;t have a great record on that study either, the variability amongst countries should tell you that guns aren&#39;t playing a role in that particular case. </p>

<p>France, with stricter gun laws than california currently has the record for highest kill count by gun of a 1st world country. Here is their law overview: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_France">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_France</a></p>

<p>We are a safe nation. Just because we have the most &quot;gun related violence&quot; doesn&#39;t mean we are the most violent. We aren&#39;t. We are very very safe relative to other nations. It&#39;s just that when violence happens, guns are more likely involved. That makes perfect sense, but does not indicate a gun problem. It&#39;s a crime problem.</p>

<p>&quot;From what I gather of your opinion, you look at it mostly from our own insular experience with guns and crime. Which I appreciate, it&#39;s perfectly reasonable as long as the studies are sound and interpreted properly. The thing that scares people like me though is that this is new ground. The idea that more guns would solve this is almost experimental in a way. I don&#39;t want to turn this more political than it needs to be, but it reminds me of policies like &quot;trickle down&quot; econ that are, in the kindest way I can say it, still a point of contention and unclear effectiveness decades after being put into place.

<p>I disagree that this is a new problem. The only problem I see is that people are less responsible for their own safety than ever before. History will show you that a gun was man&#39;s best friend besides a horse for most of our history. It is recent that we have outsourced our protection to police, and the results are not inspiring.</p>

<p>Violence has always been there, and always will. The issue as I see it is that whenever these types of attacks happen, we say society is guilty instead of the individual. I disagree with that. Right now there are more guns than people in this country, and yet these events are quite rare. Furthermore, not to be cold, but you can&#39;t even tell year by year when a mass shooting took place because it&#39;s effect on total death rates is almost negligible. More guns simply has zero correlation with more deaths or violence. The only death by firearm statistic that is shown to possibly have a correlation with access to firearms is suicide, but that&#39;s a separate issue.</p>

<p>&quot;So effectively, we have to try something to know whether it works or not. My argument would be that other countries like Canada, from what I understand of the majority of their law(besides Quebec, that place is nuts), allow you to buy and own guns very reasonably. They also have no problem with civilian militia either, I believe. A lot of people find comfort in knowing that it works great for others so it must work for us, which is a whole debate in itself that I immediately concede as probably wrong for such a crazy place as the USA&quot;</p>

<p>Canada has some benefits we don&#39;t. USA has one of the most violent places on earth as it&#39;s southern neighbor, Mexico. I know Mexico has become a political issue so I&#39;m not trying to stir the pot, but let&#39;s just say it causes significant damage to both our economy and our society through border violence. I didn&#39;t realize how bad it was until I researched it last year. MUCH of our violence comes from border related spill over. The drug war is fought as much on USA soil as Mexican soil and that is reflected in our statistics.</p>

<p>That being said, you are right that Canada is not nearly as firearm adverse as other nations, yet their crime isn&#39;t a big deal. So hopefully you can agree with me that the presence of guns is a fuzzy contributor at best.</p>

<p>As a side note. The point to a militia is that it is not tethered to the authority governing it. That was the intention behind the articles of confederation and the bill of rights. Our militia is to be the people, and they are to be independent from the military. Our government plays no role in the militia. By definition they cannot. The militia is not an army, it is a protection against the army.</p>

<p>When the constitution was written, they were under legal authority of the British. Their army was the British army. It was the non loyal militia that overthrew them and established the USA which is why they put so much weight into the militia being a counter balance. (taking deep breath).</p>

<p>&quot;Another thought I just had: an idea like yours has no failsafe. If it doesn&#39;t work like expected or maybe works fine in one regard but causes other major issues for police or something, there&#39;s no going back to even our current pathetic state of affairs. It&#39;s an all-in move and the safety of the country is on the line. Even when a scientist does a dangerous chemical reaction he knows will work fine from personal experience, he still is terrified of the potential danger if something goes wrong. And we don&#39;t even have that experience to reassure us. The stake is too great for me to feel good about such an idea. Can you see why this terrifies me?&quot;</p>

<p>Yes I do understand your fear. Thing is, I believe in our people. I really do. If you want some comfort you should read the constitution and articles of confederation (I&#39;m not suggesting you are uneducated in them, only that the details often overlooked give you insight into the great wisdom of the 2nd amendment). They were the most brilliant people who knew precisely what they were doing. The strength and greatness of our country isn&#39;t a coincidence. We are the failsafe against tyranny, against evil. The founding fathers built a country on  that principle, and I now know why. (I wasn&#39;t so thankful for the 2nd amendment as I am now until about 2 years ago).</p>

<p>The failsafe, my friend, is you and me. Together, as a society, as a democracy, we control this country. We always hope that civility will keep it together, but the guns were given to us intentionally incase we had to fight for our rights.</p>

<p>Remember, if someone wanted to harm you or your family, the only person who can stop them is you, and your success rests on how equivalent, or excessive, your capability is to theirs. The police will never prevent harm from you or your family. They will be too late, they will do to little. This is a sad reality, but it is reality. </p>

<p>&quot;I also understand that you have to give efforts like we suggested 100% effort for them to truly work. A half-measure isn&#39;t going to work, and unfortunately for us both those seem to be Washington&#39;s specialty.
I don&#39;t like how so many people are so sure that their idea about this is the only possible good solution, and refuse to even discuss other possibilities. At the very least this conversation we&#39;re having is the first step. Now we just need to get everyone else in on it too..&quot;</p>

<p>Hey, kudos to you. I fully agree. I am for whatever is done based on the real facts and with 100% good will and constitutional spirit in mind. I&#39;d not claim to have all the answers. I can only tell you that I see great wisdom in the constitution, and I believe in it, our people, and you to together find the right answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what, I think we&#39;ve actually come to a good common ground here. Everything you&#39;ve said comes across as completely reasonable. We might disagree in some areas but I feel we absolutely understand each other, and that&#39;s truly what matters most in these situations. It&#39;s a great (yet rare) thing to see online. I think you&#39;d agree that at the bottom of this is the idea that we&#39;re two faces of the same coin. The metaphor of &#39;left-wing&#39; and &#39;right-wing&#39; politics both being equally needed to keep the plane flying level comes to mind (i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s where the &#39;wing&#39; labels came from but i like my interpretation of it regardless.) </p>

<p>A lot of people behind us, on both sides, are so incredibly judgemental and bigoted (in it&#39;s literal definition) towards people who show even a slight hint of being on the &#39;other side&#39;. I&#39;m guilty of it too, like how I just automatically assume anyone wearing a MAGA hat is probably not worth talking to, or how I feel literal disgust when I hear Trump about to talk-- even before he says anything. I remember many people, even my own family, doing the exact same thing with Obama and I just couldn&#39;t understand them at the time. Now that I&#39;m doing it, I have plenty of rationalizations for why it&#39;s not quite the same thing even though it absolutely is. The end result is the same, and it&#39;s absolutely not productive in the slightest-- yet I see people doing the same thing constantly, mostly in much worse manifestations.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like politics has become (or maybe it&#39;s always been this way?) a national reality drama TV show, but with fans as rabid as the NFL. It plays out like a Disney high school drama, and each American has their own interpretation of who are the villains and the heroes. I could go to TVTropes and write out a long list of ridiculous tropes that American politicians, the corporations who rely on them, and the media act out on a daily basis. And we, as the american citizen, just eat that shit up, accepting it almost mindlessly. The one thing it does not seem to be about is actual policy. Nobody wants to actually talk about how specifically to get things done, it&#39;s like they just want to root for symbols of political success for their &#39;side&#39; regardless of its actual contents (the recent ACA repeal bill comes to mind). Even the people who insist their political actions are based on their love for the country and its traditions come off as disingenuous when they disregard traditions that don&#39;t fall in line with their modern political views. </p>

<p>The thing that seems to always come first is which &#39;team&#39; you&#39;re on. Where you live, the political affiliations of your friends and family, etc-- basically the environment you live in. All that comes before anything that could actually be constructive.</p>

<p>I consider myself a left-leaning moderate, in the sense that I refuse to play into all the political gamesmanship that goes on and just support what I think is most reasonable for everyone as a whole. I don&#39;t consider that too crazy, yet I&#39;ve been called both a liberal cuck and a neo-nazi. If I&#39;m talking to a liberal and I say anything that could be labeled as sympathetic to right-wing ideas, I&#39;m immediately looked down upon. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s actually reasonable or not, all that matters is that that I&#39;m &quot;punching left&quot;. As for how that plays out when talking to the &#39;alt-right&#39;, just look at the ridiculous things people have said to me in this thread alone. It usually either ends immediately with a &quot;libcuck&quot; or results in a ridiculous psuedo-debate where the person refuses to concede that even a single thing I say might be reasonable-- either way, almost always absolutely counter-productive. Those experiences leave me feeling like I have no &#39;true&#39; affiliation. I don&#39;t have a subreddit to go to where I&#39;ll find a bunch of people I know will always agree with what I say and only feed me things I want to hear-- and you know what, maybe that&#39;s a fucking good thing.</p>

<p>That all said, I take solace in the fact that I found a little island here where all of that didn&#39;t seem to exist for a moment. It gives me hope that maybe things aren&#39;t so bad. So thanks for the great little debate here. Frankly <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was the last place I expected to find such a decently intelligent conversation. </p>

<p>Hell if you ever want to shoot the shit sometime about anything, I&#39;d be happy to kill more time on another similarly productive argument.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;You know what, I think we&#39;ve actually come to a good common ground here. Everything you&#39;ve said comes across as completely reasonable. We might disagree in some areas but I feel we absolutely understand each other, and that&#39;s truly what matters most in these situations. It&#39;s a great (yet rare) thing to see online. I think you&#39;d agree that at the bottom of this is the idea that we&#39;re two faces of the same coin. The metaphor of &#39;left-wing&#39; and &#39;right-wing&#39; politics both being equally needed to keep the plane flying level comes to mind (i don&#39;t know if that&#39;s where the &#39;wing&#39; labels came from but i like my interpretation of it regardless.)&quot;</p>

<p>Thank you for the kind words. You are right about the balance. That&#39;s what makes democracies ( and representative republics) so successful, they give everyone a voice and let the average of all those voices become the one voice of change. Atleast in theory. </p>

<p>I am glad that you were able to see through my admittedly combative first post to realize there are hidden truths and virtues about yours and my own right to bear arms. </p>

<p>&quot;A lot of people behind us, on both sides, are so incredibly judgemental and bigoted (in it&#39;s literal definition) towards people who show even a slight hint of being on the &#39;other side&#39;. I&#39;m guilty of it too, like how I just automatically assume anyone wearing a MAGA hat is probably not worth talking to, or how I feel literal disgust when I hear Trump about to talk-- even before he says anything. I remember many people, even my own family, doing the exact same thing with Obama and I just couldn&#39;t understand them at the time. Now that I&#39;m doing it, I have plenty of rationalizations for why it&#39;s not quite the same thing even though it absolutely is. The end result is the same, and it&#39;s absolutely not productive in the slightest-- yet I see people doing the same thing constantly, mostly in much worse manifestations.&quot; </p>

<p>So true. I too get caught up in it. I try to be respectful, but sometimes I do get frustrated with what gets thrown around. We probably would frustrate eachother for certain positions, but hey, we are each our own person shaped by our own experiences.</p>

<p>It comes as no surprise I&#39;m sure to you, but I do lean pro Trump, but I also disagree with him on many issues. His stance on medicine is one example. Thing is, I understand the people who are suffering and why they like him. I thought he was going to be an air headed kardashian type until I realized he was resonating with real people and real problems. That&#39;s why he won. Like him or not, he is democracy at work. The people who elected him have been screaming for a while, but nobody heard them. You and I may have our opinions on that, but they finally had enough.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s like politics has become (or maybe it&#39;s always been this way?) a national reality drama TV show, but with fans as rabid as the NFL. It plays out like a Disney high school drama, and each American has their own interpretation of who are the villains and the heroes. I could go to TVTropes and write out a long list of ridiculous tropes that American politicians, the corporations who rely on them, and the media act out on a daily basis. And we, as the american citizen, just eat that shit up, accepting it almost mindlessly. The one thing it does not seem to be about is actual policy. Nobody wants to actually talk about how specifically to get things done, it&#39;s like they just want to root for symbols of political success for their &#39;side&#39; regardless of its actual contents (the recent ACA repeal bill comes to mind). Even the people who insist their political actions are based on their love for the country and its traditions come off as disingenuous when they disregard traditions that don&#39;t fall in line with their modern political views.&quot;</p>

<p>I think our world has become smaller due to the internet and other tech. Politics may or may not have changed much, but the nature of how information spreads and how it impacts people has changed indeed. You are right that policy has been on the back burner, but to be fair, Trump, despite his sometimes terrible way with words, really honed in on the policy aspect. He spoke the hard truths that none of his opponents wanted to hear, but his voters dropped to their knees with tears of joy when they finally did. I remember I got on board the &quot;trump train&quot; about august. His rallies man. They were incredible. Nothing like what the media portrayed. He was really resonating with people. Never seen anything like that. Lines miles long in bitter mid-western winter temperatures. You gotta at least nod to that as being something.</p>

<p>Even so as you say, our government, and politicians almost care nothing about policy. The proposed ACA replacements were terrible. See, I don&#39;t care what direction healthcare goes so long as it does what it needs to do - make healthcare affordable, sustainable, and the highest quality it can be. What is that? It&#39;s really hard to say considering both sides seem to be completely compromised by insurance/ big pharma lobbyists.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a numbers guy, and they tell me neither the ACA nor the replacements would work. I don&#39;t see why we can&#39;t try a true free market system for a while. Literally every other industry is more free market and less dysfunctional. Slap some restrictions like no bias against pre-existing conditions, cross state insurance and I think we&#39;re at a good start. Hell, we can do this scientifically and test modular components to see what works. </p>

<p>I am not loyal to a party. I can&#39;t say I lean either way. Perhaps I&#39;m more conservative now a days, but the republicans(moderates anyways) are as terrible than the far left. </p>

<p>&quot;I consider myself a left-leaning moderate, in the sense that I refuse to play into all the political gamesmanship that goes on and just support what I think is most reasonable for everyone as a whole. I don&#39;t consider that too crazy, yet I&#39;ve been called both a liberal cuck and a neo-nazi. If I&#39;m talking to a liberal and I say anything that could be labeled as sympathetic to right-wing ideas, I&#39;m immediately looked down upon. It doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s actually reasonable or not, all that matters is that that I&#39;m &quot;punching left&quot;. As for how that plays out when talking to the &#39;alt-right&#39;, just look at the ridiculous things people have said to me in this thread alone. It usually either ends immediately with a &quot;libcuck&quot; or results in a ridiculous psuedo-debate where the person refuses to concede that even a single thing I say might be reasonable-- either way, almost always absolutely counter-productive. Those experiences leave me feeling like I have no &#39;true&#39; affiliation. I don&#39;t have a subreddit to go to where I&#39;ll find a bunch of people I know will always agree with what I say and only feed me things I want to hear-- and you know what, maybe that&#39;s a fucking good thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Sure I get that too. Damn, I&#39;m not trying to compete, but you should atleast pretend to be a Trump supporter for a day and see what that&#39;s like. lol. Still, I don&#39;t want to fight fire with fire. I want to put that fire out. I&#39;d like to see us as a society rise above the meaningless bickering and start focusing on bigger issues. There is so much we could achieve and do if we stopped trying to govern each other&#39;s lives and squander our great resources and wealth on empty Trojan horses.</p>

<p>&quot;That all said, I take solace in the fact that I found a little island here where all of that didn&#39;t seem to exist for a moment. It gives me hope that maybe things aren&#39;t so bad. So thanks for the great little debate here. Frankly <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> was the last place I expected to find such a decently intelligent conversation.&quot;</p>

<p>Haha well, I&#39;d hope that r/conspiracy would be one of the better places to find open minds. It&#39;s their slogan after all. I&#39;m surprised it has maintained itself with all the negative push back, but this is one of my favorite reddit pages besides &quot;The_Donald&quot; ( take a deep breath!)</p>

<p>&quot;Hell if you ever want to shoot the shit sometime about anything, I&#39;d be happy to kill more time on another similarly productive argument.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah man sure. I had a great convo with you. Agree or disagree, discussion is good. That is what&#39;s so great about our freedom to speak freely. When thought flows freely, the truth will always be set free. People now a days are so reclusive they forget that it&#39;s ok to disagree and not hate other people or atleast think less of them because they live a different way.</p>

<p>Peace to you my friend! Have a good night!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So my mother was watching The View this morning, and it caught my interest because the entire show was a long interview with John McCain. Made me think about this convo we had and I wanted to see what you thought. I&#39;m not sure what you think of him as a politician, but if you get a chance to watch it somehow I&#39;d highly recommend it since he touched on quite of bit of things we both talked about here weeks ago. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not online quite yet but if I find a link to it i&#39;ll be sure to post it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t seen it so I can&#39;t comment on it personally. What I can say is that I find  McCain a detestable traitor to his party and country at this point. Atleast the Democrats are unified in their ideology. McCain just pretends to be conservative despite being nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not implying that he can&#39;t say something that is true. I&#39;m sure there are things I&#39;d agree with him on, though few and far between. His hatred of Trump is obvious and that taints his objectivity. It also looks like he may have his hand in illegally promoting knowingly false information to the FBI to slander/incarcerate Trump over the fictitious Russia collusion.</p>

<p>He&#39;s likely behind the Dossier that&#39;s recently (finally) being covered by the MSM. He did atleast act as the one to give it to the FBI.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No that&#39;s not the only defense. That&#39;s just the relevant part in response to the post I was replying to. The most important reason is that I don&#39;t trust our government and I don&#39;t think we ever should. They should always fear a well armed populace. I&#39;m even fine with fully automatic weapons being sold. You want something regulated, do thorough mandatory background checks and mental health screening. But most importantly regulate the media and how they are allowed to report on shooters. They basically glorify shooters by plastering their face 24/7 and fear mongering for weeks all just for profit, ensuring future copycats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>During the 1990s, Australia was confronting a problem similar to the one that regularly confronts Americans: shooting incidents over the previous decade had left more than a hundred people dead, including the infamous Port Arthur massacre in April 1996 that saw one gunman wielding a semi-automatic rifle kill 35 people over the course of a single day (including 20 people with 29 bullets in about 90 seconds):</p>

<p>In 1996, Martin Bryant entered a café at the site of a historic penal colony at Port Arthur, Tasmania.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old ate lunch before pulling a semi-automatic rifle from his bag and embarking on a killing spree. By the time he was apprehended the next morning, 35 people were dead and 23 had been wounded. Bryant had become the worst mass-murderer in Australia’s history.</p>

<p>Australia had experienced mass shootings before, but the Port Arthur massacre shook the nation to its core. Bryant was later assessed to have the IQ of an 11-year-old. He told investigators that he’d paid cash for firearms at a local gun dealer.
Shortly afterwards, John Howard, the new Australian prime minister, moved to enact nationwide gun law reform (a process complicated by the fact that the Australian national government had no control over gun ownership or use, so gun reform legislation had to be passed individually by all states and territories). Those reform efforts, known as the 1996 National Firearms Agreement (NFA), included two nationwide gun buybacks, voluntary surrenders, state gun amnesties, a ban on the importation of new automatic and semiautomatic weapons, the tightening of gun owner licensing, and the creation of uniform national standards for gun registration. Australia collected and destroyed an estimated 650,000 firearms (a reduction equivalent to the removal of about forty million guns from the United States), which reduced Australia’s firearms stock by around one-fifth.</p>

<p>In a peer-reviewed paper published by American Law and Economics Review 2012, researchers Andrew Leigh of Australian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University found that in the decade following the NFA, firearm homicides (both suicides and intentional killings) in Australia had dropped significantly:</p>

<p>In 1997, Australia implemented a gun buyback program that reduced the stock of firearms by around one-fifth (and nearly halved the number of gun-owning households). Using differences across states, we test[ed] whether the reduction in firearms availability affected homicide and suicide rates. We find that the buyback led to a drop in the firearm suicide rates of almost 80%, with no significant effect on non-firearm death rates. The effect on firearm homicides is of similar magnitude but is less precise [somewhere between 35% and 50%].
Similarly, Dr. David Hemenway and Mary Vriniotis of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center found in 2011 that the NFA had been “incredibly successful in terms of lives saved”:</p>

<p>For Australia, the NFA seems to have been incredibly successful in terms of lives saved. While 13 gun massacres (the killing of 4 or more people at one time) occurred in Australia in the 18 years before the NFA, resulting in more than one hundred deaths, in the 14 following years (and up to the present), there were no gun massacres.</p>

<p>The NFA also seems to have reduced firearm homicide outside of mass shootings, as well as firearm suicide. In the seven years before the NFA (1989-1995), the average annual firearm suicide death rate per 100,000 was 2.6 (with a yearly range of 2.2 to 2.9); in the seven years after the buyback was fully implemented (1998-2004), the average annual firearm suicide rate was 1.1 (yearly range 0.8 to 1.4). In the seven years before the NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate per 100,000 was .43 (range .27 to .60) while for the seven years post NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate was .25 (range .16 to .33)</p>

<p>Additional evidence strongly suggests that the buyback causally reduced firearm deaths. First, the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback. Second, firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates.
While there is no doubt that firearms deaths in Australia have decreased substantially in the years since the implementation of the NFA, how much of that decrease is directly attributable to the NFA is still subject to debate. Much of that debate focuses on the fact that the gun death rate in Australia was already decreasing prior to the time the NFA was introduced:</p>

<p>For Australia, a difficulty with determining the effect of the law was that gun deaths were falling in the early 1990s. No study has explained why gun deaths were falling, or why they might be expected to continue to fall. Yet most studies generally assumed that they would have continued to drop without the NFA. Many studies still found strong evidence for a beneficial effect of the law.
It’s also true that in both cases, the authors of studies cautioned that NFA-like plans wouldn’t necessarily achieve (and have not achieved) the same results in the United States, in large part because Australia’s geography makes it much easier to control the flow of arms into the country:</p>

<p>Several factors are important in assessing the extent to which the results from the Australian buyback can be extrapolated to other countries. Australian borders are more easily controlled than in countries that have land borders. In addition, Australia’s government in general and its policing and customs services in particular are highly organized and effective. The NFA also had an extremely high degree of political support and was quite competently executed. And the buyback was accompanied by a uniform national system for licensing and registration of firearms. These factors should be borne in mind in considering the extent to which the results from the Australian NFA might generalize to other countries.
It does not appear that the Australian experience with gun buybacks is fully replicable in the United States. Levitt provides three reasons why gun buybacks in the United States have apparently been ineffective: (a) the buybacks are relatively small in scale (b) guns are surrendered voluntarily, and so are not like the ones used in crime; and (c) replacement guns are easy to obtain. These factors did not apply to the Australian buyback, which was large, compulsory, and the guns on this island nation could not easily be replaced. For example, compared to the buyback of 650,000 firearms, annual imports after the law averaged only 30,000 per year, with many of these bought by law enforcement agencies.
Regardless of how much of a cause-and-effect relationship there might be between the NFA and gun deaths in Australia, it’s undeniable that the firearms homicide rate in that country has decreased substantially since the implementation of the NFA. It’s not the case, however, as suggested by the misleading and long out-of-date online piece quoted in the Example block above (which was written way back in 2001) that the overall crime rate in Australia has shot up since the NFA was introduced. The rates of various types of violent crimes (sexual assault, kidnapping, homicides of all types) have scarcely changed at all, and while the robbery rate rose substantially in the 1998-2001 timeframe, it dropped below its pre-NFA level by 2004 and has continually declined since then:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure. The rates spiked in the 90&#39;s and have just came back down to &quot;Normal&quot;. Even at half is that acceptable? Those rates also leveled out in the early 2000 before gun owner shipped spiked. So maybe more people with more guns causes less homicides. I think we need more data points to come to a conclusion about that. I&quot;m 100% for armed civilians protecting themselves. I do we could do a much better job regulating the guns we have. Make sure all the owners of guns and each gun is tracked. Make any untraceable gun illegal. </p>

After the truck attacks in Europe there was discussion on how to prevent future attacks of that nature, such as placing more bollards around pedestrian areas.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the vast majority of Americans can be safe with their guns.  That still isn&#39;t an excuse for not having discussions on how to reduce risk.  Clearly the solution, like I said, isn&#39;t the full extreme either way.  Taking everyone&#39;s guns away isn&#39;t a solution, nor is letting everyone have all the guns one.</p>

<p>But there should be a discussion if we can learn anything, if we can study the events, if we can understand what causes these events, and then put measures in place that reduce the likelihood in a reasonable manner.  That answer may be nothing and that would be okay.</p>

<p>I would find it likely that there will be enhanced security checks at these hotels from now on.  Perhaps just the standard search/xray bags and luggage.  That isn&#39;t a wrong thing to do.  Will it help in future events?  Literally impossible to know, but it will mitigate the risk of a known style of attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, nice to see a rationale thought in here. </p>

<p>I live in Canada. While it is far from perfect, I think we have a good balance here when it comes to firearms. </p>

<p>I will state upfront that I don&#39;t own a gun so perhaps I have a bias, however at no point in my life did I wish I had a gun.  I don&#39;t feel &#39;deprived&#39; or that my life is in any added level of danger. In fact my death is likely to come by way of an incident that would not be preventable by a gun. I&#39;m more worried about being hit by a car than an incident that would be preventable had I had a firearm.  </p>

<p>Anyway... if I wanted a firearm I understand the process to be fairly simple but enough to deter a crime of passion due to the fact that I can&#39;t just go out and bring a firearm home today. There is a course and some other stuff that needs to be undertaken. </p>

<p>As a bowhunter, I sometimes wish I had a side piece, but I do have other means to protect myself in a close encounter with an animal. I carry bear spray and a fixed blade.   The only thing that worries me would be an by a wild cat (cougar), however not only are these rare, it is my understanding a gun won&#39;t help me much against an animal that quietly stalks and attacks it&#39;s prey. I&#39;ve thought about a hunting rifle, but I don&#39;t rely on hunting nearly enough for a primary source of food. </p>

<p>Anyway, I think the US could potentially benefit from tighter gun legislation.  There doesn&#39;t need to be an outright ban, but removing the ability to own certain guns and tighter control over procurement might help.  </p>

<p>Did I read correctly today that the Vegas shooter bought thousands of rounds not long before the shooting? Why are Americans allowed to buy so many bullets over such a short time frame. I recognize you can accumulate ammo over time regardless, but what need is there for  a that much ammo.  Idon&#39;t buy ammo here in Canada, but I understand that I would not be able to buy that much ammo over a short period of time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m progun. I however am on the fence of gun laws. The original intention of the law was so the citizans could protect themselves from tyranny but now chemical and nucular weapons are a thing is this even possible anymore. The founding fathers couldn&#39;t of know the destructive power weapons would achieve. To fight our government at this point would take access to very destructive weaponry by civilians. What would of happened if this guy had a daisy cutter? How can I be for civilians with enough destructive power take down our government when I can&#39;t trust civilians to be responsible with that power? We keep explosives from civilains to keep bombs from happening as often as they would with out regulation. Where should we draw the lines with rifles? Again I&#39;m progun so please debate with out personal attacks. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it wasn&#39;t significant, but only 3 deaths when 2 bombs go off in a large crowd sounds like it could have been a lot worse.</p>

<p>No, but it does make it a lot worse. He couldn&#39;t of caused the damage he did with out a gun or other weapon. </p>

<p>No, it&#39;s easier to do with a weapon. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what your point was suppose to be. If it was anything could be a weapon so why pick on guns. I think this is a false equivalent. The reason would be to prevent higher degrees of damage. Regulate high powered rifles and clips so when they are used for evil they do less damage to the public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you are &quot;progun&quot; but are arguing the other side, I&#39;ll go the other way.  I am vehemently against guns and gun ownership in general.  BUT, you are way wrong on the &quot;tyranny&quot; thing.  A tyrant can just be a robber.  Your home is your sacred space, law wise.  If someone or even the government has ill intent you can protect yourself.  And say you have a lot of land, a pistol may not suffice.  I don&#39;t think Randy Weaver was planning to &quot;take down&quot; the government at Ruby Ridge, but many feel that his course of action wasn&#39;t unjustified.  If you have federal agents taking out people with high-powered rifles, then it would be nice to have some countermeasure, as a citizen.  </p>

<p>I would just have far more draconian gun laws for misuse.  I also think that if YOU think that the U.S. government is unassailable because they would use chemical or nuclear weapons against their own people, then they ARE tyrants that we should want to be able to protect ourselves against.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since lone wolfs are increasing in frequency it is a long term problem and should be addressed. The bump stock that was recently used is a perfect example. When a person use something in a very destructive way normally we then make a rule/law regulating that thing. It&#39;s sad 1 person fucks it up for everyone but thats the way it goes. I won&#39;t argue our government isn&#39;t perfect but it&#39;s ours. It&#39;s like a car that we only get 1 of our whole lives. We can either work to make it better or kick a bunch of dents in it and break all the windows. If we work together on uniting the country then we don&#39;t have to worry about it becoming unstable. I&#39;m for ending the drug war. Sounds good. </p>

The people who did&#39;t would then be branded as criminals and law enforcement would do the rest. Military wouldn&#39;t need to be called. Wouldn&#39;t even come to war. You would just slowly arrest and prosecute people you found in violation of the law.

Cause that&#39;s exactly what you would be known as a cop killer. It would be ATF or FBI knocking on your door. I would turn in my guns.

    <div class="md"><p>Every southern state would enforce it. A individual might resist but the country as a whole is law abiding. People don&#39;t want to loss their homes, freedom, cushy government jobs to protect their guns. It&#39;s just not worth it to 90% of people to break the law. Look at whats happened so far. Inch by inch it&#39;s happening. No war and just like I said the people not complying are arrested. If they use violence they are arrest or killed. I aslo think you are wrong that the vast majority of the military wouldn&#39;t side with the government. Te government pays them. They give them their place to sleep. Their pride is in they&#39;re service to the country. You would be hard pressed to tell me the military would want to rebel over fire arms. Killing innocent people maybe but we would be talking about criminals. People who attacked police officers. No one is going to have any respect for them. They will all think you where given a peaceful choice and you choose to not follow the law. So I think they side with the people that pay them to follow the law. </p>

I know lots of them who are against marijuana laws but they are still enforcing them because they don&#39;t want to loose their jobs which would cause them to lose their homes and healthcare. Your saying all these people would choose to become criminals. I just don&#39;t see that I don&#39;t see half our country as lawless lowlifes. Maybe in rural areas you wouldn&#39;t see enforcement at first but you would in major cities. Then as soon as DOJ see&#39;s all the money the bring in arresting people it&#39;s on. If you make guns illegal ATF isn&#39;t going to care what part of the country you live in. They will come pick you up. A lot of people can say they wouldnt ever give up there guns because it&#39;s not happening but when actaully confronted with the very real pain of having to fight for them most aren&#39;t going to cross that line. For most of them the only reason to have a gun is to protect there lives not many of them are going to want to go to war with the police and give up their live for a object they could just as easily do with out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The scenario it&#39;s self would be the justification for a increase in gun control. The inability to use a gun in that scenario show&#39;s that guns don&#39;t protect people from that scenario which is the only argument you can make for having them there. Protection. In the scenario we are talking about guns in civilian hands become not a protection but a danger to police and civilians. </p>

<p>Lets take 2 examples. 
Guns legal.
Police arrive on scene and start to see several armed people some might be suspect some might be civilian. Each one has to be dealt with before they can move on. They have to call for the weapon to be dropped and secured in each event. People with there Adrenalin up can have trouble following even simple directions. </p>

<p>Example 2 
Guns controlled. 
Police arrive. The only people who have guns are the people who brought them or civilians that have managed to take them from the enemy. The police can move faster from less false positives and they also don&#39;t have to worry about untrained civilian cross fire. </p>

<p>If guns aren&#39;t able to be used for protection in this environment and they could be a danger why would we want them in this environment? I will full agree and acknowledge that not all events are the same and there will be exceptions to this rule. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The venue had alcohol. Concealed carry is not allowed where alcohol is sold (bars, taverns, etc.)  Ergo, no one was carrying and thus no CCW was available to help.</p>

<p>You are saying that this points to not allowing CCW, because it couldn&#39;t help in this situation.  This is a false equivalency.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s do another false equivalency so that you can see what I mean.</p>

<p>Kitchens have grease. Grease catches on fire. You need a specific tool - a Type B fire extinguisher - to fight it.  If you fight it with a Type A or Type C fire extinguisher, the fire won&#39;t go out, and it might even get worse.  The tool is just used to help out until the professional firefighters can get there.  It can be, but not always is, useful.</p>

<p>You are saying because someone fought a grease fire with a Type A fire extinguisher, or maybe they couldn&#39;t fight it at all because they couldn&#39;t get to their fire extinguisher, you should ban all fire extinguishers and just leave firefighting to professional firefighters.</p>

<p>The best thing to do is train and equip as many people as possible to properly use a fire extinguisher, and have them on hand for when they are needed.  To say otherwise is to twist logic to meet the demands of a certain narrative.</p>

<p>Can I point out that he was around the maximum range of his rifle with a elevated position. Even if someone would of had a CC the possibility of returning fire was 0%.  If people tried retruning fire in this situation it would of been more dangerous then helpful. They could of hit people in rooms around his if their bullets even made it to him they could of dropped short and hit pedestrians. </p>

<p>To support what I said Caleb Keeter, Jason Aldeans guitarist had this to say &quot;“I’ve been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life. Until the events of last night. I cannot express how wrong I was. We actually have members of our crew with [Concealed Handgun Licenses], and legal firearms on the bus,” Keeter wrote. “They were useless.” He continued:</p>

<p>We couldn’t touch them for fear police might think we were part of the massacre and shoot us. A small group (or one man) laid waste to a city with dedicated, fearless police officers desperately trying to help, because of access to an insane amount of fire power.</p>

<p>Enough is enough.</p>

<p>Writing my parents and the love of my life a goodbye last night and a living will because I felt like I wasn’t going to live through the night was enough for me to realize that this is completely and totally out of hand. These rounds were just powerful enough that my crew guys just standing in close proximity of a victim shot by this f—ing coward received shrapnel wounds.</p>

<p>We need gun control RIGHT. NOW. My biggest regret is that I stubbornly didn’t realize it until my brothers on the road and myself were threatened by it. We are unbelievably fortunate to not be among the number of victims killed or seriously wounded by this maniac.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are saying because someone fought a grease fire with a Type A fire extinguisher, or maybe they couldn&#39;t fight it at all because they couldn&#39;t get to their fire extinguisher, you should ban all fire extinguishers and just leave firefighting to professional firefighters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No thats not what I&#39;m saying. What I&#39;m saying is having 500 people with guns in a crowd of 20000 with a active shooter doesn&#39;t help and makes the situation more dangerous. In small scale events yes guns help. But in large scale events they hurt. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best thing to do is train and equip as many people as possible to properly use a fire extinguisher, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fire extinguishers are not guns you wont accidental put out the wrong fire. You won&#39;t slow a fire fighters response to a fire by holding a fire extinguisher. You might shoot the wrong person in a crowded place, you might get shoot by a police officer who didn&#39;t know you weren&#39;t a target. I understand and agree that CC&#39;s are great for preventing small scale crimes but I think they are dangerous for just about anything Swat is going to show up to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You make it illegal so you can use the power of the law to reduce it. Won&#39;t catch it all but you can make it unprofitable. The only thing I have against a person owning more then 10 guns is it gives them the ability to cause great public harm while not offering anymore protection from &quot;criminals&quot;. While I wish we lived in a better place where people where personally responsible and we didn&#39;t need these kinds of restrictions people keep fucking it up for everyone else. 80% of people are doing nothing wrong but the people who are fucking it up are fucking it bad. Thats the only thing I don&#39;t like about people having multiple guns. I&#39;m not die hard all about it. It just a opinion I&#39;m not saying anyone else has to think that way. The argument &quot;But it wont stpo them&quot; is made a lot. While I agree a crazy man is going to do what a crazy man will do. I do think we can make it harder on them. Tim Mcveigh needed help from 3 people to build his bomb. That made it harder on him because then he had to recruit. It took longer and increased the chances of him getting caught. Not being able to get everything in one place increase the area he had to travel for supplies and increased the cost of his device. If we removed the regulations we had in place even then he could of built his bomb faster and larger. This shows that regulation does play a part in threat reduction. </p>

If you consider yourself a law abiding responsible citizen I wouldn’t expect you to have ‘killing someone with a gun’ as being on the forefront of your mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Banning guns would mean law abiding citizens would turn their guns in, people that live and operate outside the law wouldn&#39;t so those guns would remain. Someone that is looking to do something like this will find a way, regardless of the gun law. Had this shooter needed to go through illegal channels to get the guns he would have because of he was willing to open fire on a crowd of 22k people, getting a gun illegally wasn&#39;t something he would have cared about. He also committed a felony with a 10 year minimum sentence by converting the weapon he had to full automatic so he obviously didn&#39;t care about the existing gun law anyway. Banning guns would not have stopped this and would just leave the person in your felon breaks in scenario with no defense to their home and family. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that if guns have to be obtained illegally then their numbers would drop. There would be less than 5000+ children shot every year from guns lying around their houses. There would be less than 1 mass shooting every single day. Of course it won’t stop everything, but it will definitely reduce the chances of these things happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Past prosperity is no guarantee of future stability.  Hopefully it stays that way, history indicates otherwise.</p>

<p>Sure, a purely civilian armed uprising won&#39;t stand a chance against most modern militaries in <em>symmetrical</em> warfare.  It wouldn&#39;t be, as such things happen in a vacuum.</p>

<p>See the insurgencies in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, and even the American Revolution itself.  Veterans, defectors, and foreign influence are all force multipliers for the lowly partisan.</p>

<p>None of the above guarantee success, but all the heavy ordnance in the world can only help a regime enforce dictums.  Enforcement itself will eventually come down to boots on the ground; some goon, somewhere, will have to kick down a door.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I understand your point. My view is that if there were no guns, there would be no mass murders. To compensate for your loss here I would promote increasing your home security, or utilising household objects to fend off intruders. Of course sometimes a large intruder would injure/kill a homeowner, that can’t be completely eradicated, but with no guns the lives saved would massively outweigh people in the situation you’ve mentioned. At least that’s my guess. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t quite agree with your statement. There is gun violence in Australia, there was a jewellery heist with sawn off shotguns next to the bakery I worked at for example. The police set up a sting to catch them thankfully. Pretty amazing sight seeing swat members run out from nowhere on what seemed like a regular day.</p>

<p>I agree we&#39;re safer from massacres or gun related violence because we have no arms now. </p>

<p>However for the first time in my life I can see the argument for pro-gun laws. If, conspiratorially speaking, we did have martial law imposed against our will or we were invaded by a nation; we could basically do nothing about it as Joe or Jane citizen unless you were one of the few with illegal arms or a hunters licence.</p>

<p>There is something to be said for protecting humans against themselves though. A psychotic without a gun is better than a psychotic with a gun. But even with our laws a psychotic <em>could</em> find a gun (and have) if they wanted to badly enough so is the answer stripping people completely from guns? Maybe it would be better to have employed more thorough gun laws with tight screening and regulations around home security for arms. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting debate to consider and I think often the solution doesn&#39;t lie distinctly in left or right opinion but somewhere in between.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant gun crimes. And I&#39;m from Ireland, where the op was talking about for example and no, we don&#39;t have random terrorist strikes but regardless, gun ownership has nothing to do with that. There&#39;s more gun crime in Mexico because it&#39;s a hotbed of crime so it&#39;ll happen regardless of whether or not citizens are armed. Sure, you&#39;d feel safer but there&#39;ll just be more homicides.</p>

<p>Gun homicides per 100,000
U.S.A: 10.5
Mexico: 7.6
Ireland: 0.8
U.K: 0.2
Italy: 1.3</p>

<li><p>What am I lying about? You said America doesn&#39;t care about, or depend on, the countries I&#39;ve mentioned. That&#39;s not something I&#39;ve ever inferred? Again, I&#39;m pointing out that countries that have no guns have no gun violence. Laws change sometimes, particularly outdated ones. A law about guns from 1791 might be past its sell by date. </p></li>
<li><p>I have not forgotten about the Bataclan, no. Do you think if everyone in that concert had a gun the amount of deaths overall would have decreased? I do not. I&#39;m aware that guns will always exist. Again, my point is that if there are fewer guns, there will be fewer gun related deaths. You can throw anything at me, these will remain facts. </p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t feel embarrassed, I wouldn&#39;t use personal attacks to maintain my argument either. Yes, the Bataclan happened, unfortunately. But in France there are fewer guns than in America, so we speak about the Bataclan, but that&#39;s it. Not the 364 other mass shootings that would probably happen like in America where guns are more prevalent. Again, my point is these things are less likely to happen where there are no guns. Are you going to mention the shooting in Munich in July 2016 next? Yes, that happened. But it happens less frequently around the world in comparison to the disgusting statistics your country hold countless records of, due to the fact that anybody can buy a gun.</p></li>
<li><p>I said &#39;I&#39;d presume&#39; as it&#39;s an impossible statistic to know, but all you have to do is look up toddler deaths in America to find any source. Here&#39;s just one -  <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/19/health/child-gun-violence-study/index.html">http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/19/health/child-gun-violence-study/index.html</a>
Guns make suicide easier, yes. If you look at facts, which I&#39;m continuously sending your way, you&#39;ll see that about 1300 children die from gunshot wounds a year in America. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>You don&#39;t represent yourself, or your argument very well when you say things like &#39;you got obliterated, cry harder&#39;. Unless you&#39;re a teenager, I&#39;d suggest keep personal insults aside to get your point across. The only thing I cry about is the innocent people that die needlessly in America for these reasons. I&#39;m very happy to listen to your argument, and happy to learn more about the situation as we speak. I&#39;ve also learned about the benefits of listening to your opposition, which is why I&#39;m trying to respond logically and politely to everybody on this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Defence against government tyranny? How did that go for you? Home defence, lock your doors and windows, get an alarm. My point is, again, if you have a shit attack it’s very easy for you to end your own life or kill multiple people very quickly with your weapons. Before you use hammers and trucks as your example, you can’t kill 60 people from a window with a hammer, and it’s easier to dodge a truck than to dodge a bullet. And again, hammers and trucks have practical, necessary uses. Read the word ‘necessary’ again. </p>

That would at least stop every trigger happy, easily influenced, uneducated violence enthusiast from being able to pick up a handgun with their next grocery run. Have to start somewhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey I definitely agree with you; if there were no guns then gun violence wouldn&#39;t exist. But we live in a real world, where real world problems still exist. If you could snap your fingers and cause all guns from the world to disappear that would be great, and would probably lead to a significant drop in human on human mortality rates.  But the reality of the situation is outlawing guns in the US wouldn&#39;t actually get you the desired result. We have 2 boarders that are way too easy to traffic illegal goods through, I mean just think about the massive opiate problem the U.S. is having. Not to mention that firearms are now able to manufactured through 3d printers, outlawing guns just isn&#39;t a viable solution to solve the issue. The reality is that it&#39;s a complex issue that will require no small amount of nuance and public discourse to solve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I agree, it’s impossible to eradicate from society completely, absolutely. But if you get your guns from the black market you’ll be less likely to own as many as if they are legal. You’ll be less likely to purchase at all, I’d presume. Murder is illegal, people still get murdered, yes. If murder was legal, more people would get murdered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, unfortunately the problem is getting escalated rather than lessened. I believe we should have guns, though I will never own one. I think having it so folks who are crazy or mentally unstable shouldn&#39;t own any. The gun violence stems from much deeper problems than just access to them. Standard medical care for everyone, including mental health care. Addressing the income inequality gap, and improving the general quality of life. These are issues to the problem. We seem to be fixated on only the gun part of that discussion though. Turns into just more divisive politics rather than any kind of real solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I do, absolutely. I’d never consider owning a gun. For one, it makes suicide far too easy an option. Among the 1,300 children who die each year from firearm-related injuries in America 53% are homicides, 38% are suicides and 6% are unintentional. Another 5,790 survive gunshot wounds.

    <div class="md"><p>Sandy Hook was a staged event carried out by child murdering pedophilia cults that have infiltrated aspects of the government and media and were backed up by the human trafficking Italian Mafia and paramilitary death squads. Sandy Hook was used as type of litmus test to sort out those that reject the official story and speak out. Those who spoke out against Sandy Hook&#39;s official story have been put on a list for persecution and execution. The fake story was the bait and the internet is the hook used for catching those that speak out. Anyone that looks into Sandy Hook can see the inconsistencies, flaws, and suspicious details. Realizing that members of the government and media were involved in carrying out a staged mass shooting of 20 children is shocking. Many immediately turn to cognitive dissonance to deal with this realization. Those initiated in secret societies were in on it and there are millions in the United States that are initiated into secret societies.</p>

<p>The fact is that the US government has legalized information programs through the NDAA with the intent for international use through their Voice of America (VOA) broadcasting network makes the media legalized liars that cannot be trusted. The VOA reported on Sandy Hook. The media&#39;s immediate response to Sandy Hook was disarmament of citizens. It is logical that a tyrannical government would seek to disarm citizens and go as far as staging mass shootings to do obtain their objective. Since it was the death of 20 children this makes it a sensitive subject. The reality is that the US government has murdered millions of children through trade sanctions, war, and hellfire missiles and they do not even deny this. Those involved with the Sandy Hook story signed national security contracts, were paid mostly through charitable organizations, and are members of secret societies involved in pedophilia and human sacrifice.</p>

<p>Some inconsistencies include Robbie Parker smiling on video less than 24 hours after his daughter was brutally murdered as the media reported, the death certificate released through the Freedom of Information Act that states Adam Lanza died the day before Sandy Hook occurred and in New Hampshire, the strange behavior from the coroner, green screen used by CNN during an interview with one of the victims parents, doctored photos of Adam Lanza, and many other details. The inconsistencies were intentional and the bait. Motives involving Sandy Hook include disarmament for enslavement, pay offs or greed, murdering those that speak out, and most of all for enabling human trafficking and pedophilia. Many came out strongly in defense of the story as if they were there and many of them are paid or more than likely pedophiles part of this larger agenda.</p>

<p>The Lanza family are a Sicilian nobility and hold many titles through out Sicily to this day. Today Prince Pietro Lanza di Scalea is the head of the Sicilian Lanza family. The Sicilian Mafia are involved in human trafficking. The Hollywood movies that glorify gangsters as if they have some moral code is propaganda. The mafia are the most ruthless and despicable group on the planet. Ryan Lanza moved to New Jersey where the Italian Mafia have major influences over. It appears that Ryan Lanza helped to create the fake identity of Adam Lanza while residing in the town of Sandy Hook. Jeff Lanza is a retired FBI agent from Connecticut and this suggests the Lanza family have infiltrated the FBI. The private investigator Wolfgang Halbig while speaking with a woman on video mention the Italian Mafia threatening them. I have been threatened many times for speaking out against Sandy Hook myself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a stupid argument; The &quot;the government wants to take your guns away.&quot;  The government doesn&#39;t want to take guns away.  It&#39;s a good debate to have about &quot;gun control.&quot;  We&#39;ll be having the gun control debate, talk every now and then when a big shooting happens.  Unfortunately these big mass shootings will continue to happen.  </p>

<p>Secondly, the debate for government removing ALL guns from Americans would be to prevent these mass shootings from ever happening again.  Take all the guns away and you&#39;d probably still have these mass shootings. It&#39;s just a debate like all the other intellectual debates.  &quot;To Gun Control&quot; or &quot;Not Gun Control.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, I&#39;ve heard full auto fire on tv or in the news or some video clips.  And I&#39;ve definitely heard a lot of semi-auto or regular rifle fire.  You&#39;d think it would sound something similar to that.  That gunfire definitely didn&#39;t sound real, even if it was far away.  Still you&#39;d think you&#39;d see or hear some ricochet or hear bullets hitting something.  Also, how does someone get a hold of 10 automatic weapons like that?

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, if we outlawed cars, it&#39;d be harder to use them as weapons. I&#39;m a little confused by your questions. Are you saying that because people can do illegal things with any objects, limiting access to one object over another is not a solution?</p>

<p>If so, that is a pretty naive argument. Vehicle ownership is arguably more regulated than gun ownership and cars weren&#39;t created with the purpose of killing things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This screams false flag. Didn&#39;t make any sense to me since i heard about it this morning. Only explanation  that makes sense at the moment to me is gun control. </p>

<p>Think about it, the other mass shootings as of recent didn&#39;t trigger gun owners enough so they said hey, what better place to change peoples view on gun control than a fucking country music festival. 
 A large majority of people who like country love guns, hunting, and murica. At least I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s the logic behind whoever pressed the agenda. So they decided to hit it, and the aftermath of it, in their hopes, is to change the minds of concert goers and their family, extended families, and friends. </p>

<p>This is a tragedy, and it&#39;s terrible. And I&#39;m not a republican or democrat, don&#39;t believe we need more gun control, or anything...I just use common sense. And there&#39;s no way I&#39;m buying that this was a lone wolf who randomly snapped. Too many red flags with this one.</p>

<p>(this post has NOTHING to do with any presidential matters)</p>

<p>Gun sales ALWAYS increase when the topic of gun control comes up. Remember the fervor around the violent crime control and enforcement act? (included assault weapons ban, &#39;94). There was a record amount of guns and large capacity magazines being purchased, since they we would be grandfathered in after the act was in place (which... really didn&#39;t do anything to hinder, if not actually accelerated the amount of those items deemed as&quot;assault weapons&quot; being present in the public, even in the years following while the &quot;ban&quot; was still in effect; although only being in effect for 10 years before being repealed. (Not discussing effectiveness of that ban in this post)).</p>

<p>When the ban was repealed in 2004, restrictions were lifted, gun control talk went down, as did sales. New president, promise to not restrict guns, sales have dipped again after the last democratic president. The biggest bumps in sales have been surrounding periods of gun control talk/restrictions/shootings.</p>

<p>Food for thought. Friendly trend-ly reminder.</p>

<p>tl;dr</p>

<p>Gun sales are down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the act of &quot;lone gunman&quot; in general can effect legislation it just breeds more distrust. If the endgame is to remove guns eventually these situations are all too valuable for the movement.  Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the country and yet has the highest gun violence.  Most crimes are ones of opportunity and when a criminal knows there is a high chance you are unarmed it only adds to the opportunity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No offense but people who blame this on guns are simply nuts. Here&#39;s why.</p>

<p>If you want to ban guns because people die to them, do you also support banning Cars, Ladders, Medicine,Cigarettes, alcohol, house hold cleaning products etc.?</p>

<p>If you answer no, then you are a hypocrite because each of those things EXCEED the number of deaths caused each year by guns. If your goal is to keep people from dying, guns are literally one of the last things you should think about banning.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate</a></p>

<p>More than double the number of people killed last night have died in car accidents since the shooting took place. Where&#39;s the car ban virtue signalling?</p>

<p>Also not that gun deaths are just a subset of violence which means they account for even less of the violence specified in that link.</p>

<p>2)</p>

<p>&quot;But gun control means less gun violence!&quot;</p>

<p>Yep, and no humans means no violence at all. What&#39;s the point?</p>

<p>Do you care more about whether a woman is raped by a man with a gun or that she is raped at all? If you say the former, you are also a hypocrite.</p>

<p>Gun control has been proven to increase the total amount of violent crime, not with guns, but overall. A perfect example is Australia where violent crime skyrocketed after the gun ban. More women were raped after the gun ban than before, but I suppose for those who care more about raped by &quot;man with gun&quot; than &quot;raped at all&quot; that is an acceptable trade off.</p>

<p>Here: <a href="http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=17847">http://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=17847</a></p>

<p>Less gun crime != less crime. It always equals more crime.</p>

<p><a href="https://crimeresearch.org/2013/12/murder-and-homicide-rates-before-and-after-gun-bans/">https://crimeresearch.org/2013/12/murder-and-homicide-rates-before-and-after-gun-bans/</a></p>

<p>It is a fact that more crime occurs where criminals know their victims are not likely to have weapons to defend themselves with. As you have seen just last night, the police do not ever deter crime, they can only clean up the mess left behind and promise justice. </p>

<p>Only armed citizens can prevent a crime from happening by stopping it when it happens rather than the police cleaning up after.</p>

<p>There is just one credible study I could find that supports the notion that gun control reduces crime and that is this.</p>

<p>source: <a href="http://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Firearm-Ownership-and-Violent-Crime.pdf">http://crimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Firearm-Ownership-and-Violent-Crime.pdf</a></p>

<p>Problem though. Notice the states which led to the weighted bias against gun ownership are also southern border states. A border rife with violent cartel drug related crimes and a disproportionate number of crimes related to undocumented citizens. Borders are always more violent because that is where goods (money) change hands.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t present this to be mean, only to help people question their position. It is insanity to suggest that banning guns is at all about saving lives. It objectively, by every metric we have observed, led to more suffering without guns than with guns. Guns are undoubtedly a protection against suffering.</p>

<p>Why are more guns and lax gun laws a good thing?</p>

<p>1) It statistically deters crime in all specific cases, and does so well at it that it almost negates border crime rate biases in the few credible studies in support of gun control (which conveniently do not account for the very tangible negative of being a border state or bordered with a border state to a third world country with a drug war rivaling that of the middle east.</p>

<p>2) It is a freaking right just like freedom of speech. It is not for hunting, it is for protection against authority. It is laid out very clear why it exists, and I would hope the revelations of our government&#39;s activities over the past 30 years would help people remember just how evil authoritarians can be. </p>

<p>3) Guns teach people respect of power and authority.</p>

<p>4) Guns equalize the natural physical advantage men have over women. This gives them yet another tool with which to protect themselves should laws fail them. </p>

<p>If you really care about saving lives, and think banning things saves lives, go look at the first linked list. Start at number 1 and work your way down. Only then will arguments about banning guns be taken seriously. Anything short of that is just posturing and dangerous posturing at that. A statement made without merit that threatens the only amendment we have that protects all of our other amendments. </p>

<p>Make no mistake. Without the 2nd amendment, We&#39;d not be having this discussion right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the thing about the second amendment was it was written in a time when the average gun fired at a rate of 3-4 rounds/min. The &quot;right to bear arms&quot; seems perfectly reasonable when there were only a few selections of guns and rifles. Nowadays, we have guns that can fire 1000s of rounds/min...imagine the damage that can be caused by 1 person alone. So it becomes obvious that civilians shouldn&#39;t own these fully automatic weapons, but then why does the government get to?   </p>

<p>The purpose of the bill of rights was to empower the people and give them the right to overthrow a government; if necessary. If they restrict our rights with gun control laws, they should abide by the same rules(of course, that&#39;s when &quot;national security&quot; becomes an issue). It doesn&#39;t matter how many guns US citizens can own if the government&#39;s militia has the best of the best. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats you have a point about a lot of crime being stopped by civilians with guns. I think we would have to talk about specific GC laws. I think small scale crime is prevented by armed civilians. Home invasions/assaults/robberies. I think large scale crime like mass shootings aren&#39;t helped though. The singer said they had access to lots of legal guns in there tour bus but none of them helped because they couldn&#39;t even pick them up for fear of being thought by the police as a suspect. That struck me. They couldn&#39;t even pick up a gun. What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, nice to see a rationale thought in here. </p>

<p>I live in Canada. While it is far from perfect, I think we have a good balance here when it comes to firearms. </p>

<p>I will state upfront that I don&#39;t own a gun so perhaps I have a bias, however at no point in my life did I wish I had a gun.  I don&#39;t feel &#39;deprived&#39; or that my life is in any added level of danger. In fact my death is likely to come by way of an incident that would not be preventable by a gun. I&#39;m more worried about being hit by a car than an incident that would be preventable had I had a firearm.  </p>

<p>Anyway... if I wanted a firearm I understand the process to be fairly simple but enough to deter a crime of passion due to the fact that I can&#39;t just go out and bring a firearm home today. There is a course and some other stuff that needs to be undertaken. </p>

<p>As a bowhunter, I sometimes wish I had a side piece, but I do have other means to protect myself in a close encounter with an animal. I carry bear spray and a fixed blade.   The only thing that worries me would be an by a wild cat (cougar), however not only are these rare, it is my understanding a gun won&#39;t help me much against an animal that quietly stalks and attacks it&#39;s prey. I&#39;ve thought about a hunting rifle, but I don&#39;t rely on hunting nearly enough for a primary source of food. </p>

<p>Anyway, I think the US could potentially benefit from tighter gun legislation.  There doesn&#39;t need to be an outright ban, but removing the ability to own certain guns and tighter control over procurement might help.  </p>

<p>Did I read correctly today that the Vegas shooter bought thousands of rounds not long before the shooting? Why are Americans allowed to buy so many bullets over such a short time frame. I recognize you can accumulate ammo over time regardless, but what need is there for  a that much ammo.  Idon&#39;t buy ammo here in Canada, but I understand that I would not be able to buy that much ammo over a short period of time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every southern state would enforce it. A individual might resist but the country as a whole is law abiding. People don&#39;t want to loss their homes, freedom, cushy government jobs to protect their guns. It&#39;s just not worth it to 90% of people to break the law. Look at whats happened so far. Inch by inch it&#39;s happening. No war and just like I said the people not complying are arrested. If they use violence they are arrest or killed. I aslo think you are wrong that the vast majority of the military wouldn&#39;t side with the government. Te government pays them. They give them their place to sleep. Their pride is in they&#39;re service to the country. You would be hard pressed to tell me the military would want to rebel over fire arms. Killing innocent people maybe but we would be talking about criminals. People who attacked police officers. No one is going to have any respect for them. They will all think you where given a peaceful choice and you choose to not follow the law. So I think they side with the people that pay them to follow the law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calm down champ, I&#39;m not blaming your guns. I&#39;m saying that any Joe fuckwad shouldn&#39;t be able to buy a device that gives them automatic weapon capabilities. Tell me you at least agree with that?</p>

<p>Also if Trucks had no other primary purpose for most people besides potential murder tools, I&#39;d say we should at least implement some smart rules regarding them. Trucks get a pass because they&#39;re basically a necessity for society as we know it to function-- the risk of its use as a murder tool is a calculated acceptance we all agree to live with.</p>

<p>You seem to have this mindset that guns are just as needed in life as trucks somehow? Sorry, your shooting range permit is not as important in society than a CDL. You don&#39;t need 40 rifles the same way you need an automobile to get to work in the morning.</p>

<p>Do you need the current status quo so badly regarding guns that you feel the occasional mass murder is acceptable? That we should continue this transaction of allowing things like automatic weapon mods and bump stocks, paid with the cost of human lives every so often?</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for target shooting, plinking, hunting, competition, and home defense. I just think we can manage to enjoy all those while still being reasonable about how we exchange weapons. I truly don&#39;t understand how people like you think it&#39;d be impossible to maintain those hobbies after any sort of gun legislation takes affect. </p>

<p>Is an auto weapon mod ban really going to ruin the hobby you love?</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t see the point of being allowed to own AK-47s and the such. Why not ban anything other than guns and hunting rifles and let the government buy back everything else? Or just mandate that everything apart from guns/hunting rifles has to be stored securely at gun ranges with 2+ keys needed to retrieve and required to stay on that property.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, first of all - thanks for engaging in discussion. We actually agree on some points.</p>

<p>Where would you draw the line between weapons that actually have a use in self defence and weapons that haven&#39;t? I think handguns and pistols should be exempt because they have a use as self defense weapons, hunting rifles and shotguns because they have a use in hunting. Considering the conditions and reality in the US, you should be able to keep those at home. Everything else, selective fire rifles, extended mags, etc should be kept at the gun range.</p>

<p>For the (imo quite outlandish) scenario that shit hits the fan in a way that government collapses to a point where it can&#39;t enforce this (basic) gun control anymore, that should be more than enough to clear any zombies in your path to the gun range where you can retrieve your heavier weapons.</p>

<p>My idea was more about social control/responsibility being facilitated by laws. If you were required to interact with other people because they have a responsibility for keeping you and your heavier guns safe at the gun range, they might be able to spot when someone becomes dangerous to others or themselves. More failsafes, basically. Still not perfect protection, but I think it might be a good balance between individual rights and trying to get spree killings under control. There would still be gun violence, but at least you&#39;d have an upper limit on the number of people someone kills in a spree, so to speak.</p>

<p>Again, my perspective is different, considering I&#39;m in a country where you just don&#39;t assume that someone you run into on the street could pull a gun on you. Government is stable enough and has enough fail safes that I don&#39;t expect a collapse. No regular natural disasters (except for occasional flooding) that disrupt infrastructure for more than a few days.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no looser than yours. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, since I&#39;m clearly referring to mine I&#39;d say that makes sense. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Restrict dangerous alternatives in favor of safer ones as a preventative measure. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh huh. Sounds great, until you stop to think about the fact that we&#39;re discussing firearms and the only danger lies in the user. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>By your logic why should we have preventative laws against anything if &quot;users&quot; are just going to act how they wish? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;ve determined this as my logic. I&#39;m fine with background checks and keeping felons from buying guns. I would love for private sellers to have access to background checks. </p>

<p>What I&#39;m not fine with is vague &quot;prevention&quot; that doesn&#39;t do anything further to stop these incidents. I&#39;m not fine with people like you being willing to decide that I should give up my rights based on the actions of the very few. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, it&#39;s not meant to be a cure-all. But let&#39;s at least try to make it harder to kill at such a massive scale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s always amusing when your type pretends there aren&#39;t already measures in place. You demand the &quot;100%&quot; prevention and refuse to recognize that these incidents are extreme outliers in relation to the number of guns in circulation. </p>

<p>You&#39;re talking about 13,000 or so gun homicides each year out of hundreds of <em>millions</em> of people and guns, and only a small percentage of those are random, non-gang related shooters. You have 99%+ not being used for illegal violence and it&#39;s not good enough. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I frankly don&#39;t care what you call it. 200+ year old documents often need facelifts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wondered if you&#39;d ever get around to some honesty. It&#39;s always the same with you folks: &quot;No one is trying to take your guns, we just don&#39;t want anyone to have guns&quot;. Blah, blah, blah. </p>

<p>Well here&#39;s a news flash for you: even if you were able to pull off a repeal you would succeed only in making a black market for illegal buyers. You would stop absolutely nothing except the hundred thousand or so people who use them to protect themselves every year. You would serve the country up on a platter to every criminal, gang and malicious government agency, then cry about some other non-issue that you&#39;ll definitely fix this time.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another news flash: the country doesn&#39;t want a repeal. It&#39;s that simple. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d love to see you keep a straight face while telling me this crime could have been committed at the same scale using only handguns.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;d like to see you tell me with a straight face that rifles are suddenly a problem considering their use in violent crime is so rare. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can&#39;t disagree with one part of the Constitution? If I think 2A is outdated and in need of revision, I must necessarily think the rest is garbage, too? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why I don&#39;t like people like you. You can&#39;t think. You latch onto this one idea and get tunnel vision. </p>

<p>Use your head. Say you get rid of the 2A. Now you have some 2-300,000,000 guns in the country that are illegal, and in many areas every household has at least one.</p>

<p>Are you going to offer to buy them back at fair market value? No, it would cost far too much. So you would rely on some few voluntarily turning in their guns, then go after those who did not. </p>

<p>So besides the fact that you as the government just robbed people who committed no crime of their money and possessions, you also have another problem: people aren&#39;t honest, especially when it comes to protecting what&#39;s theirs. </p>

<p>You have no way to know if that person who turned in one gun has ten more buried somewhere or hidden in their basement. You have no idea who all is in possession of these guns because there is no federal registry and even if there were there&#39;s no way to track private sales and gifts. And even if there were, there&#39;s no reason to believe most people would comply with it because they saw this coming a mile away. </p>

<p>So what are your options? </p>

<p>You would have to go door to door searching every home, every nook and cranny, every property. You would have to open deposit boxes in banks and use metal detectors in yards. </p>

<p>And you would have to do all this without any due process or legitimate warrants. In short, you would turn America into a complete and total police state, and very likely trigger a civil war in the process.</p>

<p>You would take good, law abiding people who believe that the government grants privileges, not rights and turn them into criminals. </p>

<p>All for what? A promise of safety that can&#39;t be kept? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I said 600. Call it 500. Call it 400. Call it 300. How many is enough for you to realize that legal ownership of these types of guns is problematic? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A hell of a lot more than 13,000 or so when hundreds of millions of guns are owned. </p>

<p>If your claim holds any water then gun violence should be going up as ownership goes up. But it&#39;s not.</p>

<p>If your claim holds any water then there should be hundreds of thousands or more dead by gun violence every year. But there&#39;s not.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy pretty easy to see if you don&#39;t have a season pass to ride the emotional rollercoaster every time it takes off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No use other than killing people. Damn, I guess I&#39;ve been using my guns wrong all these years. Thousands of bullets shot and not a single person killed, how is this possible!? Home defense, hunting, target shooting, defense against government tyranny. Hammers are only useful for hitting in nails and murder, so we should ban them.</p>
