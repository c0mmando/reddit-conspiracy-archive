       Hello,
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, Im from north India and I live there currently. And from last 20 years or so. We have an occasional terrorist attack. Maybe once in two years.
      </p>
      <p>
       And apart from those we also have random shootouts and lone wolf attacks. But even in my country where we don't have as much superior cameras or phones but still get videos and bloody pictures of almost all attacks. Sometimes even live tv feeds.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why is it so that in American shootings, I rarely see dead bodies or bloody victims? Especially in LV where there must be million people with cameras. I only see firecracker sounds. And no blood no gore no victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2008 Mumbai attacks we got live tv feed of a terrorist shooting and escaping via car, then apprehended by police. Live. Bloody pictures and victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       In America it's always hush hush. No whatapp videos, nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       American shooting do not make any sense to me. Where are the victims? What's are the videos of people dropping dead? All I see is people running and falling over each other like in a stampede

       There is video that the news channels keep showing of people fleeing, amidst gunshots, and many of those individuals are shot dead. Did you expect videographers to stick around and risk being killed? Or to go back in afterward, and instead of aiding victims, stand around filming them? I'm not sure of the logic here around any expected alternative. Do you want police body cams to instantly broadcast extreme gore? Does that sound realistic or appropriate? Video and photo evidence is great, and it should be gathered and accessible, but probably not for our instant entertainment.

       People filming from hotel windows? Like there was live hostage situation in Bangladesh Dhaka. People got to see even terrorists holding the guns. And many people filmed them calm from their hotel rooms.

       The terror attack in Tehran recently was similar. The terrorists released video. There was CCTV. Footage from passers-by, from the foyer, from down the street, from windows. And lots of grisly evidence.

       It's all good. I've struggled with the idea of crisis actors for a while. Paid protesters seem like a no-brainer. You just have to go to any campus and find people who are riled up enough to take 20 bucks and stand in a crowd for a while. But crisis actors are something else. They need to have an inkling of the fact that they are part of a grand deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       One explanation is obviously blackmailing. How hard would it be for the shadow government (NSA, CIA, et al) to find 200, 300 people, wannabe actors maybe, who have done unspeakable things in private, but next their webcams? You send them an email with a file attached that shows them jerking off to kiddie stuff or some such vile action and tell them to be at that location around that time saying exactly those 5 talking points, or else....
      </p>
      <p>
       That's one option. The other is scopolamine. A drug that makes you infinitely suggestible while being perfectly lucid. It's a literal mind-control drug, and I have no doubt the CIA knows it very, very well. People are said to have "voluntarily" cleared out their apartments overnight in Colombia while telling the concierge guy that everything was perfectly fine, remembering none of it in the morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this scenario? I think it's really too early to judge, but the lack of "realness" in the footage we've seen so far makes it conceivable that the gunshots were practical sound effects (remember how the first salve didn't lead to any sort of panic, despite the highest probability of fatal injuries in that time due to "density of heads in the crowd" (damn, felt grotesque writing that)). The music stopped, people got confused, second salve, victims (or "victims") start to drop, people start to scatter, and that's about all I know. Supposedly they killed "the guy".
      </p>
      <p>
       The most perplexing question about all of this is the question why they would care to use actors and blanks? Karma?!

       I agree with all you have to say. Im just confused as to why there isn't more evidence of the death toll and injury count. With around what, 500 injured youd think there would be physical evidence somewhere ya know.

       I don't find it hard to believe that a lot of people got injured and are filling up the hospitals. I'd be interested to know how many of them are from gunshot wounds though. That would clear a lot of things up.

       what if they're able to shutdown cell sites or even triangulate or target an area by some means that prevents people from uploading videos? I don't know. maybe the victims and attacked are faked and staged to an extent. 
We all saw chases and I think the OJ chase in the bronco? These terrorist acts however... not allowed to see what happened on spoon fed details.

       Wow.  Until I read this
      </p>
      <p>
       Ive always just thought 'that's how it's always done.'  Now it seems obvious to me that the reason for not showing these things is so that the government can come up with an official explanation and the vast majority of people will just have to accept it as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's only recently that I've been seeing a lot of the 911 footage for instance and how long did it take to release the film of the JFK assassination?
      </p>
      <p>
       I always thought the reason these thing weren't shown is out of decency and respect for the dead and their families.  Now I'm pretty sure it's exactly to create a cultural norm of not showing this type of footage to keep people from questioning the narrative.
      </p>

       Thanks much OP!

       A post on subreddit isn't serious. His friend getting shot in the chest is. You seriously think the first thing he should do is go on reddit to prove to a couple dozen people he was shot? Calm down Johnny Quest.

       I think you are right. Then people need to stop making shit up. Just don't comment if you have no proof.

      <p>
       There were some fine kids on YouTube claiming their friend was there. And I was like okay sure kid. But then later in the video they were driving around the strip in the YouTube video recording trying to figure out what was going on acting like kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did they prove to me their friend was there, no. But I mean shit. They were there after the incident, driving around doing stupid shit acting like kids. So you know, chances they have a friend there.

      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying it didn't happen or whatever, I'm just saying with 20k people there, out of which many were live streaming to Instagram or Facebook, taking pics and videos clips, you'd think there would be so many different angles, people running but holding the shaking phone in their hands.. I would, you would.. most people would.. yet we have the same few clips and pics being reposted everywhere.. if 20k people were there I'd expect 5k videos from cellphones, people in hotel rooms looking out recording, etc.

       So no, this pic is not sufficient.

       I can see your point, and thoroughly understand it. I would say in today’s age of technology, it is very common for people to pull out their phones and start recording when something goes down nowadays, but I would like to argue that it’s probably not as common as one would think, especially in this kind of situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It initially seemed like there was a large sense of confusion with the first volley, hell, Jason played through the entire first volley? Once it came known that something wasn’t right, and the crowd became aware that a person(s) was raining fire down upon them, adrenaline starts flowing and people kick into the “fight or flight” mode. I would like to think, that even in this day in age, most people wouldn’t immediately pull out their phones and start recording once they assess that they are in a life or death situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there a handful that do though? Of course. Hence why we’ve seen a handful of videos and pictures from the events. Are there more videos and photos out there that haven’t made their rounds on social media yet? I’d be willing to bet that there is indeed many more videos and photos, some of which are probably pretty graphic.
      </p>
      <p>
       It hasn’t even been 24 hours since the first round went sailing through the air in Vegas yet. I’m sure a lot of the people that were in attendance are still recuperating and coming to terms with what actually happened. It would be a pretty traumatic event for mass majority. Over the next couple days, when the dust settles, those people will start looking at the videos and photos on their phone. I would be willing to wager that most will see those images, and for one reason or another (disgust, respect, whatever), they won’t share those images on social media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people have a sense of common decency, and if they had graphic photos of mutilated and dead bodies of innocent victims, their first response isn’t going to be to post it on Facebook for all their friends and family to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my 6 cents.

       I take everything I see or hear with a grain of salt, from either side. I try to take a step back and try to see why something might be the way that it is though.

      <p>
       They don’t release all of the video: Are they hiding something they don’t want us to know? Maybe it’s a conspiracy. Maybe it’s a false flag? Or maybe it’s legit, but the video depicts a weak point in security the perpetrator took advantage of and the authorities don’t want to make that weak point public? Maybe they haven’t thought of a way to prevent the same thing from happening again and don’t want to give other like-minded individuals good ideas? It might have shown a lapse of security or judgement on the authorities fault and they don’t want to show their hand?
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t just think of the possibilities you want to believe, think of all of the possibilities that are out there, then try to poke holes through each and every single one of them, whether it’s the one you want to believe or not.

       Guy was a 64 year old multimillionaire according to the media. He had no problems accessing the tools to carry out the job. I’m very curious about the motive as well. Usually situations like this you always hear about a “manifesto,” but I have not heard that word yet for this event.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was pre-meditated and well planned. The guy had to have left a manifesto, a note, a letter. Something. If he did, I’m sure it’s already in the possession of the authorities. It’s only a matter of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Sheriff was spreading a lot of news very quickly though. We got a lot of information in a relatively short amount of time. Still nothing on motive though...

       A lot of people nowadays use Snapchat (so annoying checking stories in the morning and you have that one friend that was at a concert the night before and it’s a million damn snaps of the whole concert), requiring you to hold your thumb down on the ole recording button at the bottom (or the volume button, but how many people actually use that?)... something startling like a rain a bullets falling down on a crowd would cause a reaction in most people to remove their thumb from the bottom part of the screen from their cell phone, thus ending the recording, and follow on events would likely prevent them from “sending” what was recorded.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s my take though. Obviously some people were legitimately recording the traditional way, and we’ve seen some of those videos. And like I said, there is likely more out there, but the people with the video are probably still recovering, and most likely won’t share what they recorded.

       shooter was not on the 32nd floor. There so many things contradicting themselves right now and its getting ridiculous. Why do people in such high places of power plan and do these types of things?  It reeks deepstate. Wish this deep state crap would just die and everyone live in peace jeez.

       Every time there is some kind of mass shooting event I look for these videos, mainly because I'm very skeptical of the media and it's narratives, but they never exist. Nothing ever adds up. Thanks for making this point. There's always 1 or 2 photos that look completely staged and nothing else... in a time where every person has a video camera in their pocket, there should be tons of this information.
