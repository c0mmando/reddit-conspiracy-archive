<p>4 out of the last 5 mass US shootings have  had the highest death toll.</p>

<p>Aurora 15, Sandy Hook 27, Orlando nightclub 50, and now this Vegas shooter with estimated 60+ deaths and 122 injuries. They get bloodier and bloodier and I NEVER remember this many shootings until recently during the refreshed gun control debate pushed by the media since 2012. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been getting worse and worse, and a lot of these shootings seem to have elements of being provocateured or staged events based on evidence of crisis actors, multiple shooters as opposed to the lone shooter theories, eyewitnesses and victim accounts that conflict, and a slew of other fishy loose ends. </p>

<p>Get ready for the calls for gun control. Don&#39;t buy it. Expose this to as many people as you can because time is running out and these people mean fucking business. They are refusing to back off. </p>

<li><p>There are 80 million gun owners in this country. A majority of the military I speak with have taken an oath to the constitution and to fighting enemies foreign or <strong>domestic</strong>. That includes a corrupt government. Imagine even 40 million gun owners, unified under a common goal to defeat the corrupt elite. They are terrified of this. Tyrannical Governments throughout history have disarmed their populations. Mao, Stalin, Hitler. What makes you think this one is any different? Same elites bankers and tycoons running the show anyway. </p></li>
<li><p>Doesn&#39;t matter. They just need to get a majority of the population to endorse this idea. Anyone who doesn&#39;t is part of the &quot;others&quot;. Hell, they just need registrations on these guns, so they know which houses have them and what guns they own, and which houses they have to go barging in during confiscation and kill everyone inside. </p></li>

Please dont pretend like we dont live in a fascist state where corporations rule over our govt and play these placeholders like puppets.

2. Over 100,000 speeding tickets alone are issued every day. Being ticketed is not life-threatening.---<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2016/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2016/</a>    Quick google search of how many civilians died at the hands of police in 2019 shows just under 1000 people. Some estimates are much higher then this, oh by the way we have to guess what this number is because the fbi or anyone else for that matter tracks this...
3. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3uuiig/us_government_still_silent_on_american_journalist/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3uuiig/us_government_still_silent_on_american_journalist/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link</a>
4. you dont think speaking your mind is a loss of freedom? maybe you likle being told what to do but i dont.  Of course 9/11 was just an example of when they really pushed ahead under the national security b.s.
5. Definition of fascism
1 often capitalized :a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition</p>

<p>You dont think worshipping a flag (as weve seen is a big deal lately) and all this money exchanging hands between large corporations and politicians through fake offshore business accounts and  charities that do nothing what they claim and selling drugs and firearms to foreign countries fascist?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understand the power of data collection.</p>

<p>The government is quietly collecting our data.</p>

<p>The owners have extreme disdain for certain segments of the population, but they can&#39;t currently do anything about it.</p>

<p>So they collect data. So the owners know who they like, and who they don&#39;t like. Where they live. Where they work. Where they travel to. What they drive. When they wake up. When they go to bed. How much money they have. Assets.</p>

<p>And they collect the information they don&#39;t like as well.</p>

<p>Patiently waiting till the US becomes docile enough. No guns, extremely susceptible to propaganda. Most people are shut ins. Extremely unhealthy lifestyles. Then they make their move.</p>

<p>All those people they don&#39;t like suddenly disappear. And your dumb ass is like, &quot;what do I have to hide?&quot;</p>

<p>Trust me dip shit, you have a lot to hide. Let&#39;s say they decided to break up society by IQ. All people with IQ under 110 get summarily executed. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say they decide black lives matter, or antifa, or white pride is now a terrorist grip and thy all get summarily executed.</p>

<p>They already know who and where those people are. </p>

<p>We need to stop letting the government collect our data. </p>

<p>That is because <em>I deliberately wrote them in that order.</em> And also, if you look at the dates you&#39;ll see that the ones I listed are <em>not</em> in chronological order, so the totals don&#39;t rise over time. In chronological order my list would have been 13, 18, 13, 21, 14, 23, 32, and it&#39;s <em>not a complete list.</em> It&#39;s just a list of some particularly notable mass shootings. Many, many others have occurred that resulted in fewer than 10 deaths, including this very year.</p>

Whenever an unprecedentedly large thing happens, be it a crime like this or a weather event or whatever, it&#39;s a natural reaction to say &quot;Things are getting worse!&quot; Even when they&#39;re not actually getting worse in any meaningful way.</p>

There&#39;s simply no justification for &quot;Der terk ur gurns&quot; hysteria. If mass shootings were going to lead to repealing the 2nd, it would&#39;ve happened 50 years ago.</p>
