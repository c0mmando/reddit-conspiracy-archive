       I hope you are all perceptive enough to see that this is the agenda...
      </p>
      <p>
       4 out of the last 5 mass US shootings have  had the highest death toll.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aurora 15, Sandy Hook 27, Orlando nightclub 50, and now this Vegas shooter with estimated 60+ deaths and 122 injuries. They get bloodier and bloodier and I NEVER remember this many shootings until recently during the refreshed gun control debate pushed by the media since 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's been getting worse and worse, and a lot of these shootings seem to have elements of being provocateured or staged events based on evidence of crisis actors, multiple shooters as opposed to the lone shooter theories, eyewitnesses and victim accounts that conflict, and a slew of other fishy loose ends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get ready for the calls for gun control. Don't buy it. Expose this to as many people as you can because time is running out and these people mean fucking business. They are refusing to back off.

        The government would just blow insurrection up with unmanned planes and the powers are aware of this, why do they need guns gone. 2. Everyone knows people who identify as conservative politically won't give their guns up.
       </li>

       It's actually quite ironic that people find it hard to believe that mass shootings may take place in the land of easy guns.

         There are 80 million gun owners in this country. A majority of the military I speak with have taken an oath to the constitution and to fighting enemies foreign or
         <strong>
          domestic
         </strong>
         . That includes a corrupt government. Imagine even 40 million gun owners, unified under a common goal to defeat the corrupt elite. They are terrified of this. Tyrannical Governments throughout history have disarmed their populations. Mao, Stalin, Hitler. What makes you think this one is any different? Same elites bankers and tycoons running the show anyway.

        <p>
         Doesn't matter. They just need to get a majority of the population to endorse this idea. Anyone who doesn't is part of the "others". Hell, they just need registrations on these guns, so they know which houses have them and what guns they own, and which houses they have to go barging in during confiscation and kill everyone inside.

       damage to infrustructure is waaaay more upfront than how they operate.  I dont know how old you are but in the time that I have been alive I have felt the squeeze of freedoms being taken especially after 9/11.  If your smart you take away or trick the public into giving away freedom little by little until one day, poof your fucked and living in Nazi America.

       How about the fact the govt is now allowed to just spy on us? how about our militarized police state where getting a traffic ticket could cost you your life. How about losses of freedom of speech, journalists who dont play the game get killed, Political correctness in itself is a social block so people stop saying what they think because it may make some single mother in ohio butthurt.  Please dont pretend like we dont live in a fascist state where corporations rule over our govt and play these placeholders like puppets.  Your govt does so much shit under the pretense of national security that not even the president or congress knows about it.  open your damn eyes.  Just because you have a decent job and a house you can afford filled with garbage from wal mart doesnt make america great because lots of people like you lost everythiing they had at the hands f greedy b who deecided to crash a market for profit.

       Quick google search of how many civilians died at the hands of police in 2019 shows just under 1000 people. Some estimates are much higher then this, oh by the way we have to guess what this number is because the fbi or anyone else for that matter tracks this...

       4. you dont think speaking your mind is a loss of freedom? maybe you likle being told what to do but i dont.  Of course 9/11 was just an example of when they really pushed ahead under the national security b.s.
5. Definition of fascism
1 often capitalized :a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition
      </p>
      <p>
       You dont think worshipping a flag (as weve seen is a big deal lately) and all this money exchanging hands between large corporations and politicians through fake offshore business accounts and  charities that do nothing what they claim and selling drugs and firearms to foreign countries fascist?

       You don't understand the power of data collection.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government is quietly collecting our data.
      </p>
      <p>
       The owners have extreme disdain for certain segments of the population, but they can't currently do anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they collect data. So the owners know who they like, and who they don't like. Where they live. Where they work. Where they travel to. What they drive. When they wake up. When they go to bed. How much money they have. Assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they collect the information they don't like as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Patiently waiting till the US becomes docile enough. No guns, extremely susceptible to propaganda. Most people are shut ins. Extremely unhealthy lifestyles. Then they make their move.
      </p>
      <p>
       All those people they don't like suddenly disappear. And your dumb ass is like, "what do I have to hide?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust me dip shit, you have a lot to hide. Let's say they decided to break up society by IQ. All people with IQ under 110 get summarily executed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say they decide black lives matter, or antifa, or white pride is now a terrorist grip and thy all get summarily executed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They already know who and where those people are.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to stop letting the government collect our data.

       They have to be able to locate the people to bomb them. There's a reason they are doing it legally and not forcefully. Also, they don't have 40 million bombs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the US is all about democracy and justice.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there were a war within the country, there would be extreme pressure from the outside world for the US government to end it, immediately. Throw down weapons and let the US vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's how it works. Not to mention drones are not going to cut it. As soon as they start droning citizens on US soil, shit will hit the fan.

       For better or worse, mass shootings are not a new phenomenon in the US. The Aurora, CO, theater shooting in 2012 "only" resulted in 12 deaths, meaning it doesn't even break into the top ten deadliest mass shootings in US history.

       not if your taking into account the shooter and how planned they were.  I think it is strange the numbers arent varied and simply rise.  Im not making any conclusions, just observations.  I think there are many factors to this if you really want to break it down.

       That is because
       <em>
        I deliberately wrote them in that order.

       And also, if you look at the dates you'll see that the ones I listed are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       in chronological order, so the totals don't rise over time. In chronological order my list would have been 13, 18, 13, 21, 14, 23, 32, and it's
       <em>
        not a complete list.
       </em>
       It's just a list of some particularly notable mass shootings. Many, many others have occurred that resulted in fewer than 10 deaths, including this very year.

       It doesn't. It only looks like that because I put them in descending order; they're not in chronological order. This year alone, we've seen other mass shootings with death tolls ranging from zero (there were injuries but everybody survived) to eight or so. This one event that happened last night is an outlier (obviously), and it isn't indicative of any kind of meaningful trend.

       Sure. It's a peculiar sort of phenomenon. Whenever an unprecedentedly large thing happens, be it a crime like this or a weather event or whatever, it's a natural reaction to say "Things are getting worse!" Even when they're not actually getting worse in any meaningful way.

       Sure.  But in the end it does seem pretty obvious that gun control is always going to be the main focus of these things until it isnt a thing anymore.  It is inevitable that they will take away guns through legislation

       As I said, mass shootings are not a new phenomenon. They've been happening since 1949,
       <em>
        roughly
       </em>
       once every hundred or so days on average. There's simply no justification for "Der terk ur gurns" hysteria. If mass shootings were going to lead to repealing the 2nd, it would've happened 50 years ago.

       Also - if you want to assume these things take months even years to plan  by unseen government forces with an agenda this "october surpise" would have been Hillary's event and possibly the catalyst for her to implement gun control.    the fact that it happened at a country music festival (ie. a community supportive of guns) makes things interesting.

       And except for the guy in Aurora whose brain they obviously over-cooked, all shooters end up dead - ,most often by their own hand. This is the way the programming is intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there is no way the shooter can ever tell anyone about any programming.

       Its not all about gun control actually, its gonna be more about internet lock down.  Watch.  Theyve grabbed his computers and hard drives to quote check for online influences, and questions of the guns that he had were automatic, and did he at home modify them, and did the internet show him how to convert those guns to fully auto?  Bs machine is in full swing.
