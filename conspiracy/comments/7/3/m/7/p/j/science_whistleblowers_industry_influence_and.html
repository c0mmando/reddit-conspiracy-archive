         Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines.
         <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/">
          All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic.

         A vaginal mesh implant made by Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) was launched without a clinical trial, and then marketed for five years after the company learned that it had a higher failure rate than their two earlier devices. Internal company emails disclosed in a US court case, in which a 51-year-old woman was awarded a record $57m in damages this month, also show that senior executives even briefly considered suppressing unfavourable data that “could compromise the future” of the device. But documents submitted to the court show J&amp;J staff had raised concerns about the “spinning of data” in emails and male executives are seen bantering about a suggestion that sex with an earlier patient with mesh complications must be “like screwing a wire brush”. In other emails, J&amp;J staff complain of colleagues “constantly spinning data” and of a dangerous blurring of the “lines between commercial and research” divisions. “I am continually amazed and surprised at our need to push back,” wrote Judi Gauld, Ethicon’s former clinical director in Scotland.

       I think you're getting the wrong message from these kinds of posts. It's not that we can't know truth - it's that we should never blindly trust institutions. Experts and academic institutions are great resources of information and knowledge, but always read their reports and methodologies directly and evaluate for yourself.

       I've worked in some research chemistry for commercial applications. There is a lot of pressure to find what they want to find. This wasn't in medicine, just saying it is definitely a thing. Oh, and one time I made a mistake that gave us erroneous data that was beneficial to the project and holy hell, the whole rest of the directions of the project were scrapped instantly. They had me working day and night investigating this new property.
      </p>
      <p>
       I eventually realized my error, and it was extremely hard to come clean about it in the face of their enthusiasm. And then I never could convince them it was really a mistake, they came back to it repeatedly wanting me to make it real for them.

      </p>
      <p>
       “As the single largest purchaser of childhood vaccines (accounting for more than 50 percent of all vaccine purchasers), the United States is by far the largest financial victim of Merck’s fraud. But the ultimate victims here are the millions of children who every year are being injected with a mumps vaccine that is not providing them with an adequate level of protection against mumps. And while this is a disease the CDC targeted ts the single largest purchaser of childhood vaccines (accounting for more than 50 percent of all vaccine purchasers), the United States is byo eradicate by now, the failure in Merck’s vaccine has allowed this disease to linger with significant outbreaks continuing to occur,” the suit alleges.
