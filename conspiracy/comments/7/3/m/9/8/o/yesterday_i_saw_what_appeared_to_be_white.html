<p>The question that came to my head was &quot;Why would an openly gay man endorse practices of &quot;Islam&quot;? and why is this non muslim male wearing a hijab?</p>

<p>Imagine how much this sick psychotic SJW culture has fucked people that gay men are wearing hijabs?  As if they need to make some solidarity with a religion that seeks to put them to death for being homosexual? </p>

<p>You walk around and see that much of the people in the streets have been turned into aimless, misguided and self defeating morons by a mainstream sadist cultural conditioning reinforced through all media and communications. The feminists are attacking other women, the gay men are wearing hijabs, the black social justice movements are bigot and racists who want to segregated black people from everyone else.</p>

<p>All I see is an aimless, degenerate and de-evolving society that seeks to devour itself. Just a sea of  programmable tattooed zombies that would cut off their own limbs if told do so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My first post and Ive always loved this sub but why is op getting downvoted so harshly? Did I miss something? If I did, please clear it up for me. I live in a large metro city in Canada as well and see things similar to this all the time. Is it not bizarre that a homosexual would endorse a ideology that, at best, would be unaccepting of his lifestyle and at worst, kill him for such a lifestyle? Maybe reads too much like a t_d post for people? I don&#39;t get the problem... like I said maybe I&#39;m missing something. Can someone explain? Btw always loved this sub. I can understand how people see that its changed over the years but great thought provoking ideas from here!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It honestly reads like bait from the more reactionary subreddits - it&#39;s not in good faith discussing a gay dude endorsing islam (why would a gay dude wear a hajib, being gay wouldn&#39;t make someone act like some islamic women do).</p>

<p>It&#39;s immediately made about spooky SJWs- again, meaning the thread wasn&#39;t made in good faith, it was baiting stupid partisan conflict.</p>

<p>So while I don&#39;t think it has to be a t_d pasta, it does reads like one, or more likely someone trying to act like like a t_d poster and start a stupid thread on r/conspiracy - people do the same just spam posting trump tweets with no conspiracy angle at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The anti-Trump protest outside of one of his rallies that I attended last year (in a large metropolitan area. DC no less) was almost entirely women and children with a few BLM folks and hairy guy Bern bots sprinkled in. Then the Women&#39;s March was largely made up of...women. With some men sprinkled in. I don&#39;t know why but I never get to see the freaks. So disappointing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, pretty much everyone I saw at the Women&#39;s March was either a nice older lady or a standard Seattle bluehair type. Nothing too out of the norm, everyone was friendly.</p>

<p>The smaller protests only draw the die-hards, which is where you can find more concentrated weirdness. Even then, lefties aren&#39;t as exciting as the right likes to imagine us. I hung out with so many nice old ladies at the Women&#39;s March. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>exactly, we thought society would evolve to something better. That no matter what, we protect individual rights and freedoms. Now, it seems they  want to sacrifice individual rights for ideology and &quot;systems&quot; and &quot;entities&quot; that have no interest in protecting the well being of the individual they are using for a means to an end. </p>

<p>and that&#39;s what I was thinking &quot;Would the system he is foolishly celebrating in solidarity, Ever protect him as an individual?&quot; the sad answer is &quot;no&quot; . Would the muslims in my city band together to celebrate his expression as a gay man wearing a hijab? No.</p>

<p>I wrote this post to ponder the future of individual rights in the Western world amidst  clashing, opposing ideologies being meshed together now for political means.</p>

<p>Do the math!</p>

<p>Gay hating=bad, Brown=Good, Islamic=Good +1</p>

<p>+1 is higher than -1 so the gay white male must be sacrificed. </p>

Fucking running to the internet to bemoan the decline of western civilization is some bitch shit.</p>

<p>And if this isn&#39;t true and you&#39;re just making it up...your parents failed. Point blank. </p>
