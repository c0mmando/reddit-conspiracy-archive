        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The original article: <a href="https://lawnewz.com/crazy/doj-seeking-info-on-6000-people-who-liked-anti-trump-facebook-page/">https://lawnewz.com/crazy/doj-seeking-info-on-6000-people-who-liked-anti-trump-facebook-page/</a></p>

<p>The CNN article that used slightly less click bait like title &quot;DOJ demands Facebook information from &#39;anti-administration activists&#39;&quot; <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/09/28/politics/facebook-anti-administration-activists/index.html">https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/09/28/politics/facebook-anti-administration-activists/index.html</a></p>

<p>The real problem/question is what they&#39;ll do with the information once they have it. The biggest question I have is what warranted the warrants?? If there&#39;s no evidence of a crime, why are they trying to investigate private citizens who opposed Trump, before he was even elected?</p>

<p>Note, the warrants were issued in February(one of his first actions as president is to use the government to identify his opposition!?), and Facebook has fought for time up till now to make sure the 3 users in question were notified of this.</p>

<p>What&#39;s of import is it isn&#39;t just the info of 3 people in question, it&#39;s the info of anyone who followed them, liked them, responded to any events they created.. or basically interacted with them in any way.</p>

<p>There must be more to this, getting a warrant usually involves evidence of a crime.. but that isn&#39;t mentioned at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so is this like when the FBI opened an investigation into all the people who post on the Donald?</p>

<p>Id be more scared of a corrupt femocrat controlled fbi Investigating  people who voted against Democrats then  this</p>

<p>And before you go about complaining about Trump. The only reason he can do this is because of the precedent set by the  Democrats</p>

<p>Conservatives have been warning about Democrat government  overreach setting a  trend</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what&#39;s the probable cause they are citing?</p>

<p>I did vote for Obama, but I&#39;m not going to defend his actions.. I don&#39;t vote, period. There was no good choice.</p>

<p>But I need evidence this started before Trump won office.</p>

<p>Because what you cited relies purely on probable cause, which isn&#39;t cited.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t actually care who started/allowed this process, I&#39;m more concerned about why it&#39;s allowed to continue.</p>

<p>There&#39;s only so much we can blame on Obama..</p>

<p>At some point, our current president is enabling this hunt, for those who opposed him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I agree with you, that&#39;s spying on everyone. They&#39;re a totally different agenda because they don&#39;t discriminate: we&#39;re all enemies.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s different than trying to gather information specifically about the opposition. Legally trying to gather information about the people who stand against you..</p>

<p>Trust me, I&#39;m not for anyone gathering information on everyone.. but when the &quot;enemy&quot; is trying to literally gather information specific to those who opposed them..  honestly, it&#39;s the step that&#39;s required before the police state of Nazi Germany.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>These are things that both parties have done for decades. I am not trying to take away from the importance of this, but it is not new and fb is not the first company to share information with the government. Back in the day people had to physically snitch on you for being a suspected commie, nowadays we snitch on ourselves while we pretend to be hidden.  we are not hidden an everything we do is monitored somehow. It has already started, but I hope this wakes more people up because I think we are running out of options for the American people to see the government is the enemy an not each other. Hence why they want to go after people who are anti trump. </p>
