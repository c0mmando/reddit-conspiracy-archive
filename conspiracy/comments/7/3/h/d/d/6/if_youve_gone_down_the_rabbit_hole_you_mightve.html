    <div class="md"><p>i agree that Satanism is the root of the conspiracy.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think Jesus is the answer though.  I think the bible  is a compilation of a lot of ancient religions based off of Sun worship and astrology.  Jesus never existed and is just a metaphor for the sun.  This is why he is called Gods Sun, the light of the world, the savior of darkness, etc...
The bible is now a tool used to divide and conquer the masses and keep people ignorant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Genesis in the beginning it was just God and the Word was with God and they were one in the same and Jesus was the word made flesh. God leads us through the Holy Spirit.

    <div class="md"><p>True. We are all made in the image of God. From what I understand though we have a &quot;Spark of Divinity&quot; that can allow us to reach God. But Jesus is the essence of God made flesh. He came to show us the way to reach our potential. The ancients always wanted a physical god to worship (Like the Golden Calf) so God sent Jesus as the physical representation of him. The Old Testament God points to &quot;The Way&quot; but Jesus is &quot;The Way&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, as far as I can tell everyone has that spark and it&#39;s the actual key, the &#39;pearl of measureless value cast before swine&#39; iirc. My problem with people worshiping physical things, or non-physical things, even jesus(heresy, I know) is that worshiping &#39;people/others/things&#39; seems like it can be an awfully good way to lose track of your own personal connection to that &#39;spark&#39; which will always have a higher fidelity connection to &#39;god&#39; than anything else ever will provide you with. </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s just me, I had a really intense conversion experience and it had nothing to do with jesus whatsoever.(Well, maybe not nothing, but the catalyst drew inspiration from many sources including some esoteric teachings of jesus of dubious reliability...) My &#39;spark&#39; woke up and turned my world upside down, honestly it still is doing that, but it&#39;s weird because I&#39;ll sometimes watch Christians describe these absolutely insane sounding conversion experiences they had and I&#39;ll be like &#39;yep, that sure is someone who went through what I went through, but from a christian perspective.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the english language was created as a decoder language by monks and religious leaders after the bible was written.<br/>
 A long time ago the ancient people knew that no one could own the Sun. They also knew that without the Sun life on earth would not be possible. </p>

<p>Since no one can own the Sun, they said it was Gods Sun. They knew Gods Sun made life possible for Earth. Before christianity the ancient people still owned land. However no one owned the sun. You can&#39;t possible own the Sun. </p>

<p>This is why Christians say Gods only Sun gives his life for us. Everyday he rises to save humanity from the darkness as the risen savior, the Light of the world,  Gods one and only sun. The sun turns water into wine, the sun feeds the masses with two fish (because the sun rises beneath the constellation pisces), the sun heals the sick, the sun makes the blind see (when its dark your blind). The sun stops moving on the winter solstice on december 21st, 3 days later it starts it accession back summer solstice. </p>

<p>When you look at the setting sun over the ocean, each moves one degree north or south depending on the season.  This is why they say Gods Sun walks on water.  </p>

<p>Further more the word for Sun in latin is Jes, pronounced yes. This is where the Jesus comes from. </p>

<p>Christians either are completely ignorant to this symbolism or they are in denial because they don&#39;t want to admit they have been conned.   </p>

<p>I believe Jesus is a metaphor for the sun, the 12 disciples are metaphors for the 12 constellations, Mary Margdelen is the moon, Peter is Jupiter (peter the jew), and a the whole story is actually an ancient science told symbolically about the stars, the planets, the sun, the moon, etc. , and the seasonal influence it has on our consciousness over time. </p>

<p>I believe there is a creator grand architect who designed the geometric laws of the universe and that consciousness creates physical reality and not the other way around. </p>

<p>I believe we are all part of that creator and you can tap into that consciousness through mediation. </p>

<p>Not believing in Jesus has actually freed my mind from the mental slavery of Catholic religion i was raised in. </p>

<p>I believe all religions are a means of controlling peoples minds who don&#39;t have the courage and curiosity to look for answers themselves. &quot;Jesus&quot; said it himself, don&#39;t cast pearls to swine... </p>

<p>Why does the vatican have a giant statue of a pinecone in the middle of the yard. (they know the power of the pineal gland and they are hiding it from you) </p>

<p>I believe that most major religions are Saturn worshipping pedophile rings at the very top, who are controlling the publics mind through mass media and social manipulation, sending people to wars for their private gains and keeping people as spiritually ignorant as possible so they can run away with the power and money. </p>

<p>I believe religion and Jesus are used as a tool to get you to stop questioning anything more than what they tell you to think. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll go a little further to say that 
Jes = sun in latin
Mary = mare = sea in latin, why we say we are sailing the virgin sea. The Virgin Mary = the virgin mare (when the sun rises it looks like it is being born from the sea...) </p>

<p>Jupiter= Peter, peter is known as &quot;the rock&quot; Jupiter the biggest planet in our solar system = The Rock </p>

<p>Mary Magdelen = the Moon 
The moon is full 13 times out of the year 
2 of the 13 full moons happen in one of the months 
the months are made after constellations 
The disciples are made after constellations 
1 desciple gets mary (the full moon) twice. hence the reason she is considered a whore. </p>

<p>The bible says Jesus fed the the masses with 2 fish and bread. 2 fish are the constellation pieces. For the last 2,000 years of Jesus&#39; supposed existence he&#39;s been feeding the masses in the age of pieces. </p>

<p>We are now entering the age of Aquarius the water bearer. LUKE 22:10 Jesus words. He replied, &quot;As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters,&quot; what could that be? </p>

<p>Did you know the zodiacal signs are called houses? </p>

<p>Genesis 32:30 &quot;So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.” 
The pineal gland is known as the seat of the soul. Funny how Jacob named the place pineal because he saw God... </p>

<p>Why do people worship Jesus on Sunday? SUN day? </p>

<p>John 14:2 “In my Father&#39;s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.” </p>

<p>Here Jesus is talking about the house of the zodiac and the mansions being each constellation the sun passes through during the precesion of the equinoxes.</p>

<p>Judas betrayed Jesus with the kiss of death. Scorpions are known to give the kiss of death. Judas is symbolic for the Scorpio constellation. </p>

<p>Mathew Mark Luke and John, symbolic for our four season. Summer winter spring and fall. </p>

<p>I can go on and on. I think i&#39;ve made my point. Its all symbolism. The planets and constellations effects on the seasons of human consciousness. Exactly why the elite are conditioning us to accept a new spiritual path. The water bearer (Aquarius) is supposedly going to expose the lies were were told in the age of Pisces. </p>

<p>Jesus is also symbolic for the truth.  There is a story in the bible where they are condemning Jesus and a murderer named Barabas.  In this story the leaders condemning Jesus and Barabas say, according to your laws we can let one of these prisoners go of your choice.  Who should we let go?  All the people say Barabas.  This is symbolic for the masses of people hiding from the truth and wanting the lies and bullshit to stay in their comfort bubble.  </p>

<p>All that being said...  Jesus is also a symbol for the christ consciousness attainable to each and every human through meditation and the understanding of true knowledge and wisdom.  It is the complete dissolution of fear through understanding the nature of ones own consciousness and how we individually relate to the universe.  </p>

<p>He is called God&#39;s son because God gave him the power to see the other reality that nobody else can/could see. He was the first spirit, he was there when God created everything. Yahawah taught him everything and then after the world had killed all his prophets (John being the last one), he sent his first spirit and the world even killed him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus can be compared to the sun, but I don&#39;t believe that He can be reduced to the star. Light can represent knowing or seeing and the darkness, ignorance or blindness. Physical life depends on the sun as spiritual life depends on virtue.</p>

<p>From my understanding, the words meaning &quot;sun&quot; and &quot;son&quot; would not have sounded the same in Greek. They are only homophones in English, which didn&#39;t come around for over a thousand years after the New Testament was written.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible has some truth in it, but it was compiled and edited by human beings, human beings who knew they were compiling something with which they could control people. Why people insist on believing the Bible is the literal word of God is beyond me, when they know full well it was created by human beings, and when they know plenty of stuff was deliberately left out. There are lots of gospels around that just didn&#39;t get put into the Bible, yet they contain things that are different from the others, it&#39;s not like they were left out just because they were repetitive.</p>

<p>And we know from the prolific and widespread Catholic Church child sex abuse that these so-called religious men are not exactly to be trusted, so why do you trust the religious men who compiled the Bible? Why do you think they were not manipulating things to deceive you?</p>

<p>The most telling thing is this &#39;Jesus is the only way&#39; stuff, which is completely contradictory to the idea of a benevolent God, and serves instead to create hatred and division between people, with those who believe that the  Bible is truth and Jesus is the oly way to God going out and trying to convert everybody, while being often disrespectful towards others&#39; beliefs, which just divides people. A loving God would bring people together and an all powerful God wouldn&#39;t make it so there was only &#39;one way,&#39; and a very odd nonsensical way at that, in which to have a relationship with him.</p>

If &quot;he&quot; didn&#39;t rebel against the hive there would only be humans on 3 planets and none of them would be named earth. We we&#39;re given independence.. Im not so sure that was a good thing. Now anyways. But never the less we have it, and about 3% of the population know this; and the rest do whatever. </p>

<p>When the last of the tall whites died, it was because of our meddling. They were your satans benefactors, our inherited protectors. After he lost to &quot;God&quot;. They brokered peace on our behalf. Now we think we can hang with the grown ups. Lol kids. We were warned when the nazis started messing with moving &quot;spacetime&quot;. Children often do not do as they&#39;re told. Now we&#39;ve progressed to a point where we have to atone for our transgressions. !which by the way are totally acceptable, we grew up as a species thats all! However we see fit. Because we were given the freedom to choose. </p>

<p>Nothing will save you but yourself. If you want to join the eternal consious do so. If you want to serve your lord do so. If you want to come here and impose on others to conform to your ideology do so</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hello fellow traveler! The knowledge you seek is within you. Do you feel a purpose of grandeur you can&#39;t explain? Frequent Dejavu, especially when you were young? Sometimes you feel things as or before they happen as though it&#39;s falling into sync? Do those who are close to you come to you because you&#39;re &quot;understanding&quot;, but really you can just feel and guide their emotions through a positive energy? Are you against all odds always the Paragon?</p>

<p>The &quot;universe&quot; eternal energy &quot;conscious&quot; has imbued us with energy. I believe this is because the Native Americans began their Ghost Dance to ask for help from the universe. We have been arriving on earth for generations now.. I think each of us fulfills a specific purpose. Again this is what I&#39;ve been able to peace together. Like a inter dimensional butterfly effect we are supposed to correct some imbalance caused by negative forces.</p>

<p>open your third eye and look beyond yourself, your surroundings and what you learn; to see not just truth, but all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So read the other books too lol. I Like the book of Enoch. And while yes, man does wretched things in the name of God, Jesus taught quite the opposite kind of behavior. There&#39;s really only a few rules and yet it&#39;s a hard thing to do in this day and age. </p>

<p>Jesus taught to have a personal relationship with God, basically an inner dialogue with him. Any so called Christian religion that teaches there&#39;s some kind of middle man or heaps a bunch of requirements along with the few basics is taking advantage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, as far as I can tell everyone has that spark and it&#39;s the actual key, the &#39;pearl of measureless value cast before swine&#39; iirc. My problem with people worshiping physical things, or non-physical things, even jesus(heresy, I know) is that worshiping &#39;people/others/things&#39; seems like it can be an awfully good way to lose track of your own personal connection to that &#39;spark&#39; which will always have a higher fidelity connection to &#39;god&#39; than anything else ever will provide you with. </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s just me, I had a really intense conversion experience and it had nothing to do with jesus whatsoever.(Well, maybe not nothing, but the catalyst drew inspiration from many sources including some esoteric teachings of jesus of dubious reliability...) My &#39;spark&#39; woke up and turned my world upside down, honestly it still is doing that, but it&#39;s weird because I&#39;ll sometimes watch Christians describe these absolutely insane sounding conversion experiences they had and I&#39;ll be like &#39;yep, that sure is someone who went through what I went through, but from a christian perspective.&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the english language was created as a decoder language by monks and religious leaders after the bible was written.<br/>
 A long time ago the ancient people knew that no one could own the Sun. They also knew that without the Sun life on earth would not be possible. </p>

<p>Since no one can own the Sun, they said it was Gods Sun. They knew Gods Sun made life possible for Earth. Before christianity the ancient people still owned land. However no one owned the sun. You can&#39;t possible own the Sun. </p>

<p>This is why Christians say Gods only Sun gives his life for us. Everyday he rises to save humanity from the darkness as the risen savior, the Light of the world,  Gods one and only sun. The sun turns water into wine, the sun feeds the masses with two fish (because the sun rises beneath the constellation pisces), the sun heals the sick, the sun makes the blind see (when its dark your blind). The sun stops moving on the winter solstice on december 21st, 3 days later it starts it accession back summer solstice. </p>

<p>When you look at the setting sun over the ocean, each moves one degree north or south depending on the season.  This is why they say Gods Sun walks on water.  </p>

<p>Further more the word for Sun in latin is Jes, pronounced yes. This is where the Jesus comes from. </p>

<p>Christians either are completely ignorant to this symbolism or they are in denial because they don&#39;t want to admit they have been conned.   </p>

<p>I believe Jesus is a metaphor for the sun, the 12 disciples are metaphors for the 12 constellations, Mary Margdelen is the moon, Peter is Jupiter (peter the jew), and a the whole story is actually an ancient science told symbolically about the stars, the planets, the sun, the moon, etc. , and the seasonal influence it has on our consciousness over time. </p>

<p>I believe there is a creator grand architect who designed the geometric laws of the universe and that consciousness creates physical reality and not the other way around. </p>

<p>I believe we are all part of that creator and you can tap into that consciousness through mediation. </p>

<p>Not believing in Jesus has actually freed my mind from the mental slavery of Catholic religion i was raised in. </p>

<p>I believe all religions are a means of controlling peoples minds who don&#39;t have the courage and curiosity to look for answers themselves. &quot;Jesus&quot; said it himself, don&#39;t cast pearls to swine... </p>

<p>Why does the vatican have a giant statue of a pinecone in the middle of the yard. (they know the power of the pineal gland and they are hiding it from you) </p>

<p>I believe that most major religions are Saturn worshipping pedophile rings at the very top, who are controlling the publics mind through mass media and social manipulation, sending people to wars for their private gains and keeping people as spiritually ignorant as possible so they can run away with the power and money. </p>

<p>I believe religion and Jesus are used as a tool to get you to stop questioning anything more than what they tell you to think. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll go a little further to say that 
Jes = sun in latin
Mary = mare = sea in latin, why we say we are sailing the virgin sea. The Virgin Mary = the virgin mare (when the sun rises it looks like it is being born from the sea...) </p>

<p>Jupiter= Peter, peter is known as &quot;the rock&quot; Jupiter the biggest planet in our solar system = The Rock </p>

<p>Mary Magdelen = the Moon 
The moon is full 13 times out of the year 
2 of the 13 full moons happen in one of the months 
the months are made after constellations 
The disciples are made after constellations 
1 desciple gets mary (the full moon) twice. hence the reason she is considered a whore. </p>

<p>The bible says Jesus fed the the masses with 2 fish and bread. 2 fish are the constellation pieces. For the last 2,000 years of Jesus&#39; supposed existence he&#39;s been feeding the masses in the age of pieces. </p>

<p>We are now entering the age of Aquarius the water bearer. LUKE 22:10 Jesus words. He replied, &quot;As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house that he enters,&quot; what could that be? </p>

<p>Did you know the zodiacal signs are called houses? </p>

<p>Genesis 32:30 &quot;So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.” 
The pineal gland is known as the seat of the soul. Funny how Jacob named the place pineal because he saw God... </p>

<p>Why do people worship Jesus on Sunday? SUN day? </p>

<p>John 14:2 “In my Father&#39;s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.” </p>

<p>Here Jesus is talking about the house of the zodiac and the mansions being each constellation the sun passes through during the precesion of the equinoxes.</p>

<p>Judas betrayed Jesus with the kiss of death. Scorpions are known to give the kiss of death. Judas is symbolic for the Scorpio constellation. </p>

<p>Mathew Mark Luke and John, symbolic for our four season. Summer winter spring and fall. </p>

<p>I can go on and on. I think i&#39;ve made my point. Its all symbolism. The planets and constellations effects on the seasons of human consciousness. Exactly why the elite are conditioning us to accept a new spiritual path. The water bearer (Aquarius) is supposedly going to expose the lies were were told in the age of Pisces. </p>

<p>Jesus is also symbolic for the truth.  There is a story in the bible where they are condemning Jesus and a murderer named Barabas.  In this story the leaders condemning Jesus and Barabas say, according to your laws we can let one of these prisoners go of your choice.  Who should we let go?  All the people say Barabas.  This is symbolic for the masses of people hiding from the truth and wanting the lies and bullshit to stay in their comfort bubble.  </p>

<p>All that being said...  Jesus is also a symbol for the christ consciousness attainable to each and every human through meditation and the understanding of true knowledge and wisdom.  It is the complete dissolution of fear through understanding the nature of ones own consciousness and how we individually relate to the universe.  </p>
