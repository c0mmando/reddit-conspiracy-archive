       You reached unprecedented levels of retarded with that post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said HRC blames Russia for losing and asked a serious question about clarifying your opinion further. You then respond that I'm extrapolating while also admitting she blames Russia as well....
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said she blames solely Russia but you for some reason are using "conservative media" as my opinion. Media you didn't even provide a link for. Solid logic.

       You: Jesussssss Christ she does not blame Russia 100% she only blames them 50%! Stop extrapolating!

       Would NBC saying she blames Russia for losing be acceptable to you? Are they too conservative for ya?

       I called your reply stupid because it was. Keep deflecting though. Don't bother to reply unless you'll actually answer how my statement was wrong. I've posted a MSM article that is the opposite of conservstive but you can keep saying that I'm reciting conservative talking points since that's all you have.

       The primary difference is Israel is a client state and while it changed a few years ago there were important U.S. fortunes dependent upon Saudi Oil. There are still important U.S. fortunes tied to U.S. oil but different ones than before  about 2014 or so.

        In the twelve weeks since the party conventions concluded in late July, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has received significantly more broadcast network news coverage than his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, but nearly all of that coverage (91%) has been hostile, according to a new study by the Media Research Center (MRC).
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, the networks spent far more airtime focusing on the personal controversies involving Trump (440 minutes) than about similar controversies involving Clinton (185 minutes). Donald Trump’s treatment of women was given 102 minutes of evening news airtime, more than that allocated to discussing Clinton’s e-mail scandal (53 minutes) and the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play scandals (40 minutes) combined.

       OP doesn't understand how bots are used to amplify the message. The lies spread by these 200 accounts are made "trending" by the bots. As a result they are read thousands of times by real people who sadly don't realize it's Russian propaganda.

       If you're on the fence, exposure to an echo chamber can "change your mind" by solidifying you into the dominant view of that particular echo chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're opposed to an argument, but willing to listen on principle, constant expose to an echo chamber can make you less likely to be vocal about your opposition. This compounds the above effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't "changing your mind," in the definition you're getting at, certainly, but that sort of worldview shift happens rarely. Changing someone's mind doesn't have to be making them vote for someone different--it's just as effective to make someone feel disinclined to vote at all.

       Buying a product and forming a world-view are two different things. The latter can definitely not be done by twitter. The argument is that twitter
       <em>
        swayed
       </em>
       or
       <em>
        changed minds
       </em>
       . I'm saying nothing on twitter has ever changed a mind on anything. Hence, echo chamber.

       LOL love that slippery slope there but I never said anyone was of lesser intellect, you did. I dont not believe anyone with a different opinion than mine is inherintly stupid. People can be intelligent and make stupid decisions. Your decisions are reinforced by your current knowledge. Some peoples heads are filled with lies but are sharp as a tack.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, twitter and other social networks just spread the ideas and add little to the actual debate. They muddy the truth to the point that the most intelligent person questions it. This is the intention of the entire operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversations such as this typically aren't the genesis of a viewpoint. We arguing our already concrete view points here in this useless back and forth.
      </p>
      <p>
       However on twitter and other social networks, they are spreading the genesis of ideas(and lies), not arguing the validity of existing ones. For instance, they spread fake anti-fa tweets from an account actually in russia that says incendiary stuff. Then they use their bots to trend that topic. This leads many to give credibility to a post that has been trending. False or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       This tweet does nothing for detractors or proponents of anti-fa. What it does is enforce the opinion of those on the edge of what anti-fa is(or what they want you to think).
      </p>
      <p>
       So you see, it has little to do in the actual debate and more to do with the disinformation affecting the debates. This means it has little bearing on ones intelligence or susceptibility to debate. It has everything to do with muddying that debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, the ones who debate online, like you and I, typically are pretty hardset in our beliefs. Its those on the sidelines, watching our conversation, that they intend to influence.

       There wouldn't be billions of dollars spent in advertising research to figure out the exact type of music that makes people more likely to open their wallet if humans weren't able to be influenced. You sound like the exact kind of person that proudly proclaims you're immune to advertisement and propaganda because you're too smart for it. We are all susceptible to it and we literally have areas of America that teach children that a rubber cylinder you slide over your dick upsets an all powerful all knowing being that created everything in the known universe.

       First of all, back in 2016, Obama couldn't warn people without appearing partisan. But the government did, the head of all 17 agencies concluded that Russia interfered with the election. As Comey put it during his congressional testimony, there is “no fuzz … whatsoever”. Yet, the message has not gotten out. So what makes you think 2018 will be any difference if we don't take stronger action?

       If you can control the us with 200 twitter accounts, that matters a lot.

       I mean MSM and spy agencies control the narrative. That several hundred thousand real people. And the majority of people can't be manipulated using that.

       But they did to not see Trumps apparently. I've never seen a more brazen corruption scheme in this country. And his followers can't even see it. Whatever caused that kind of willful ignorance is pretty damn effective.

       Thank you for expressing the very foundation of your problem. You've
       <em>
        never

       Did you live through 9/11? Did you understand what all of us felt on a day like that?

       I'm probably older than you with more real life experience, have a family, a career, a kid, a house, a mortgage. Been grown up a while. I'm sure only people that supported the orange muppet felt bad on 9-11 though, good point.

       $100,000 dollars worth of memes didn't influence the electionm IMO. Trump campaign alone spent $90 million.

       Be honest, do you truly believe any Facebook or twitter message had an effect on the election? Zuckerberg himself said 99% of the political content was organic (yeah sure) but said it came from both sides, you can read

       Remember not too long ago, when the Russians were  accused of hacking voting machines and turned out

       Give it a month and this story will have a similar tone.

       The list of excuses for losing this election are endless, why is there no personal responsibility?

       The effectiveness of Russian influence is a moot point and impossible to quantify.  The issue is their continued efforts and if any Americans are working with them.

       Trump won because he ran a far better campaign than Hillary (which isn't saying much). You could blame a million things for Hillary's loss, and she has, but you could never prove that any of them actually caused her to lose. I don't know anyone who is remotely concerned about Russia in real life.

       No, Trump won primarily because he could "shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and not lose voters". His followers were more concerned with liberal tears than actually electing someone who wanted to run the country wisely.

       It's heavier cuts at the top with much smaller at the bottom. Where is all this lost tax money going to be made up? A sales tax increase don't mean dick for a rich person. Cuts across the board is going to hurt the lower and middle classes.

       The tax plan that was recently released. If I make above $200K this year I will save a lot more, assuming the plan is actually passed. With the Establishment blocking as much as they can, I sort of doubt it will be.

       Trump lead a laughably bad campaign rife with corruption and sexual assault allegations. In the middle of his campaign his campaign MANAGER resigned in disgrace due to charges of foreign corruption to the tune of 8 figures. He himself was accused of sexual assault by double digit women along with an audio recording of him admitting to doing it at least once. The fact that he one speaks to the uneducated nature of the population more than it does to his ability to campaign.

       It's an especially pathetic spin on the 'russia' narrative. The biggest funding of shills and bots happens within the USA. I dunno I feel like some high up people calling the shot have really lost their grasp on reality. Do they not realize young people are not watching corporate TV? You can't damper wikileaks by shouting 'Russia' for the next decade.

       No, because Russia is evil-incarnate in the world and they want nothing more than to destroy our freedoms. And of course the only way to combat this kind of evil is to limit our freedoms ourselves so they can't accomplish their goal. Checkmate, comrades!

       The "war on terror" I think has lost its appeal, so they needed a new boogey man as an excuse to curtail the internet. I don't think they could get away with some cave-dwelling Arabs "hacking" is into danger, but another government doing it, that could be a big enough threat for people to have a TSA-like hate for the internet.

       Yup... it's called the Scorched-Earth Policy, invented no-less by the devious and devilish Russians themselves who burned-up anything of use to Napoleon's invading army as they retreated deeper into their own territory leaving nothing and no one behind. A victory of ashes for Nappy who lost most of his army to starvation, disease, and a Russian winter he couldn't find any shelter from.

       Similar tactics may have been used prior to that but the name "Scorched Earth" being applied to it originated and entered our vocabulary with Napoleon's defeat in Russia and the wholesale burning of the country, including the Russians own capital city of Moscow.

       This is one of my favorite pieces of military history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russian cavalry's (mostly Cossacks) rear-guard actions of the Napoleon Invasion provided the bulk of the resistance, and they did employ a scorched earth policy, they did not invent that tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with scorched earth, it was the superior horsemanship of the Cossacks, plus great Russian tactics (ride out to meet Napoleon, draw him deep into Russian winter), and the Russian winter than won the day.

         Shit, actually Russia was spreading all sorts of fake news on Facebook.

         They have a couple hundred Twitter accounts and bot followers though!!!

       Like holy shit it's just so ridiculous how the same level of hysteria has remained even as the story break down.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        B-b-b-but Mueller!!!!!
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Clapper lied. Either Comey lied under oath or Schiff lied. Leaks to the media about the investigation have been constantly wrong. I'm ready to hear what Mueller finds with an open mind, but the presence of the investigation itself is not enough for me to dismiss all the other nonsense that's gone on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the result of the investigation could change my mind on all this, I'm not pre-emptively dismissing the results. But I'm waiting for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just so crazy to me how the exact same tactics the military-alphabet industrial complex use every time are still effective here. It's so easy to whip people into a frenzy.

       If you liken the 200 accounts to what it takes to make a Reddit post take off, then yes, I can understand how only 200 Twitter accounts could be used to propagate and disseminate information. But why do you assume that the full might of Russian influence is limited to these 200 Twitter accounts? Like could you imagine that if Russia was truly serious about influencing populations around the world they would use every means at their disposal.

       There are so many other influences on the election, like the MSM which was in bed with Hillary, that its crazy to believe the evil Russians had any effect. I can pretty much guarantee that the MSM had a bigger influence, and their collusion should be investigated and they should be punished.

       This study was shit. That argument popped up shortly after the elections. I remember reading a link posted by some user. It was a typical statistics play, afair the news taken from all candidates was taken in different timeframes. Everyone with a clear mind saw what the media reported WORLDWIDE in the last few months. It was heavily anti-trump. Just to be clear, I hate this guy, but that was clearly against trump. In my opinion that was also a reason he got voted.

       At first it was Russia didn't do it. Then it was wheres the evidence. Then it was we've done it in other countries too so who are we to judge. Now it's yeah they did it but did you actually think they swayed the election.On top of numerous people within the campaign and administration lying,including Trumps own son, about meetings with Russians. Trump lying about financial dealings within Russia. People on both sides of the aisle saying yes Russia did this

       soooo..., if I was a 2nd or 3rd world nation looking at this, it sort of looks like the US has grown weak and Russia is clearly ascending.  If Russia can finesse US elections so well, maybe that's the trade partnership I, as a 2nd or 3rd world nation, would like to cultivate.
      </p>
      <p>
       the Russiagaters are being phenomenally short-sighted.  to anyone without an ideological dog in the fight, Russia is starting to look like the stronger choice to ally with.  and that's even if the US wasn't letting internal political messes slop into foreign policy.  the US is looking less and less like a stable country.

       This is what would happen if any nation believe the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was listening to a CSPAN segment congressional committee hearing on foreign affairs. The head of the US UN person was testifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       She was talking about how other nations perceive the US extremely differently than US citizens. They don't care about any of the trump drama. In fact with trump as president, it made them more confident in his predictability. Obama you didn't know if he was going to roll over and play dead or drone attack. Where as trump they were reassured that he would just drone attack every time. LMFAO.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt other nations are going to cross the US, currently. There will always be black markets though. But my guess is that the US has a pretty strong grip on the black markets too. When's the last time a leader of a major criminal operation was arrested? Never. Not in my life time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other nations do not believe the IS propaganda narrative. The governments do not plan based on media and public government statements. I mean, unless it's official. Like a deceleration of war. Or something serious.

       I find it comical to think that even the most robust propaganda network could elect Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, what elected Trump was Clinton alienating the Bernie supporters. When "BernieBros" were being called alt right misogynists by their own party, did the democrats really expect them not to jump ship? The Clinton emails were just icing on the cake at that point.

       This is basically what I think. I don't think Russia did a fucking thing. And I think it's laughable they did. Hillarie's corruption and tactics made the US literally hate her. Everyone would have rather had anyone other than Hillary. I think the deep state elected Trump knowingly.

       So why did Twitter crib from Facebook's search of a few bots they linked to Russian instead of actually looking?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because 9~15% of twitter is bots. Not all Russian bots, but bots for any country or company.  If they remove the Russian ones, they then admit they've been able to tell

       It's very obvious to anyone that has been paying attention that the people responsible for the "clear signs of bot activity" were the same shills that come here day in and day out to parrot MSM talking points and bash Trump/anyone who isn't vehemently against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way that post was shilled was the #1 tell. The fact that people like YOU are still trying to use that as an example is the second biggest tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you do anything else in life besides sit on reddit and blame everything on Trump and Russia? Literally like 90% of your posts have one of those two words in them.

       The fact you base how you are going to comment to someone and vote on their comment based on the tag you set for them some time ago is fucking sad. I bet you go around and downvote anyone with a "red RES" tag without context of what they are saying. I'm sure you got a color that mean auto-upvote for users too. You're playing psychological tricks on yourself and not even realizing it. Then you keep on buying into it each time you see the tag you set and not what they have to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you're going to claim that's not true, then wtf are the reasons for your tags on people? Especially since you color code them for some reason. It's fucking sad.

       I didn't say Russia hacked the election. I think people were fed up with the way establishment politics work. Doesn't mean they don't try to interfere with other people's politics. I mean, the US does everywhere else.

       Where did I say they did? All they needed to do was convince people to either not vote because Clinton would be such a poor choice (not that I disagree, except given this specific alternative), or that Trump would be better than her. What part of that is a world view? It's a specific choice with 3 options.

       I'm kind of surprised you aren't getting attacked more, anything Russia related usually draws tons of negativity.. makes me think the info is just too solid to really argue.

       Half the reason I posted a quote of your reply was because I half expect it to be removed by mods.. but I'm still generally new here, and not sure what direct action they're willing to take.

       Quite comical. It's been pretty hilarious to see the "hacking" downgraded to "sabotage" downgraded to "infiltration" downgraded to "influence". But all my friends who read the Washington Post fail to see the humor.

       Yes, only 200 forget to turn off geo-tagging. Never mind that if those 200 are retweeted by millions of bots, then the message will be seen by tens of thousands of real Americans.

       I'll tell exactly what is happening:
      </p>
      <p>
       The democrat elite have been dealt a shocking blow by Trump winning the election and are doubling down on privacy and free speech via these scare tactics and Russiaphobia in a power grab and for relevancy. The Republican elite don't care about this because they want the same outcome, which is further restrictions on social media and free speech. The Republican elite only cares enough when it comes to Trump-Russia and even then they have Mike Pence as a backup and Pence is the one they actually want in the Presidency. So both the democrat and republican elite play the citizenry like a fiddle and divide us via wedge issues all while they get a better grasp on social media and encryption services in the guise of "Russia! Russia! Russia!"

       It's "comical" if someone suggest an actual state with resources, bodies and infrastructure, not to mention a vested interest did it to sway an election, but if I said they were Soros Elite Zion bots you'd up-vote it in a heartbeat. Man, I'm so done with this sub.

       The people who believe either the 'Soros did it' or the 'Putin did it' narratives are both hopelessly lost. I feel for them, that level of cognitive dissonance would take its toll on the psyche.

       Not even half as comical as this post... I love that we pretend a single thing like 200 twitter accounts swayed things when we have hard evidence that someone manipulated voter registration data in at least 3 states during the last election.

What began as an effort to promote soft messages about the United States among the Arabic blogosphere soon morphed into a much more tightly focused outfit dedicated to countering the rhetoric spewed by extremists online.

       It's hilarious how obvious the shilling is based on the top comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       People think that the Russians put more propaganda into the country than our own Govt? Goolag is censoring progressive websites and YouTube demonetizing people who spread the truth about what is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're absolutely right OP. You are 100% correct. Look at how conspiracy has been taken over and this post you have and all comments are DOWNVOTED into oblivion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Russians have America by the nuts and if they have masterminded cracking reddit and flipping votes and hacking dnc and manipulating Twitter and Goolag and the news -- then why is ALL we ever hear about is how bad Russia is?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is reddit filled with anti trump subreddits and comments if the Russians are so good at what they do?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's because it's the EXACT OPPOSITE. America has control of the propaganda in our own country. Just as China does. American govt wants to keep the citizens off base by blaming another county and keeping people from being able to discuss openly the propaganda being used on its own citizenry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as China says "no tienamen square never happened" they control their own internal propaganda. I've been to China and westerns are told not to mention this to the Chinese. And definitely not ever talk about it on tienamen square. The Chinese are told it's a lie. Just like North Koreans paint us Americans as the enemy when really it's their own brutal regime that keeps their own citizens oppressed.

       The Russian oligarchs used our own system to influence the election a little bit. Maybe enough to tip it. With just 600 fake social media users. That's impressive.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's downright terrifying to acknowledge that the influence Russia exerted was child's play compared to the control our own oligarchs have over the system. With our campaign finance rules and a heavily consolidated mainstream media that controls the national agenda, I would not be surprised one bit if near total control of our elections rests with well under 100 people.

       When the Russians set fire to Moscow, their own capital city, even Napoleon was shocked and stunned. If there was some other instance of that in military history prior to that neither Napoleon or anyone else knew of it. So where and when did something else similar to that before it take place if you're so sure it did?

       Let's try!!
We need a counter attack campaign to fight back against Reddit, MSM, Hollywood, and World Governments.
We are The People! They FEAR Us! We have the power!
If we could only all get on the same page, we would literally be unstoppable.
That's they reason they are going hard on the "Divide and conquer" tactics in the MSM. Creating race driven crisis to keep people from organizing together and rallying around a common idea.

       Yup... it's called the Scorched-Earth Policy, invented no-less by the devious and devilish Russians themselves who burned-up anything of use to Napoleon's invading army as they retreated deeper into their own territory leaving nothing and no one behind. A victory of ashes for Nappy who lost most of his army to starvation, disease, and a Russian winter he couldn't find any shelter from.
