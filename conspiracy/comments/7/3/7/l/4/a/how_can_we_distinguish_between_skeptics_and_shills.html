    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with you here. Anger is destructive, and anything one can accomplish with anger can be accomplished with love. Anger eats away at body and mind - stress hormones are released, tissues inflame, the heart races. Love catalyzes peace and clarity of mind.

Admins are not willing to stop it, although they surely know when it&#39;s happening. A &#39;noob&#39; posts something that gets 1200% more upvotes then any other comment in a short time span. It&#39;s the new business model.

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously there&#39;s no sure-fire way to distinguish them, however a general rule of thumb I have is:</p>

<p>Skeptics will say something is unlikely, or that &quot;they can&#39;t see it&quot;. From their posts, U can tell they&#39;ve examined the theory (and evidence), but feel like there&#39;s not enough there to raise further awareness.</p>

<p>Shills will have a more extreme stance, they&#39;ll say the theory is impossible (or ridiculous), without offering too much rebuttal to the conspiracy claims. On a variety of big conspiracies, they&#39;ll resort to &quot;text-book&quot; arguements, and you&#39;ll oftentimes find yourself wondering  if it&#39;s even a real person typing, as opposed to an advanced bot. (They exist)</p>

<p>Obviously there&#39;s exceptions, but from where I currently stand, it&#39;s pretty easy for me to seperate the wheat from chaff. </p>

<p>A true conspiracy theorist will rarely say: &quot;that&#39;s impossible!&quot;. A shill will go through hoops to ridicule the topic to steer people away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We should all use critical thinking when engaging with other users. I&#39;m sick of seeing commenters getting called out because of their account age. There are many reasons for having a new account but a lot of users take that alone as the reason for calling someone a shill. If account age is such a concern perhaps we can lobby the mods for a new rule that does not allow participation from accounts less than &#39;X&#39; old. But, tbh, that would be a silly rule. Conspiracies live and die on arguing perspectives. So I would suggest we do just that. Argue, or to be nicer, converse with other users and lay out your perspective. Be willing to defend. Be willing to listen. </p>

<p>Keep in mind: They&#39;re doing their <em>best impression</em> of an intelligent person. Which says a WHOLE LOT about them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no way to bring this whole sub together unless you make it a one topic echochamber.Most of the time shilling is a non issue and only brought up when pressed for proof.</p>

<p>Look,I get it.We all want to discuss and share our info.But 90% of posts are unsourced or Blogs linking to Blogs that link to blogs that say they did that.You can&#39;t expect to have a discussion like that.This is the internet,you can find a Blog or website that claims human feces are sentinent beings.That doesn&#39;t make it so.</p>

<p>I am deeply skeptical.I enjoy JFK stuff,Area 51 and the like.So I stumble across a post that claims this,that and those guys working in that government  run a child slave ring.So naturally I want proof or at least some evidence.The typical responses are:&quot;I researched it so do the Same.&quot; or &quot;Just open your eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>So someome already did the Research? Great,link me mofo.No?I wouldn&#39;t believe you any way?Why did you post than?</p>

<p>And this is the point when you get called shill because you want proof.There is no common ground with people like that.</p>

<p>Even if you get into a discussion there is no common ground.</p>

<p>A claims x.I post multiple sources that proof A wrong.A proceeds to call me shill and a sheep.</p>
