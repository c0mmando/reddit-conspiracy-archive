       Increasingly I feel that this is the most important question to ask ourselves on this sub. With disinformation and provocateering coming from every side, it's becoming all too easy to fall into the trap of paranoia and isolation. I truly believe that nearly everyone here has their heart in the right place. How can we heal the divisions between us?

       I'm not sure that's enough, though. I think that the way we engage with each other should come from a place of love. I see a lot of bickering in the more controversial threads, and often people reply to anger with more anger. This sows more conflict, more division, and makes it increasingly unlikely that any of us will be able to see the world clearly.

       I disagree with you here. Anger is destructive, and anything one can accomplish with anger can be accomplished with love. Anger eats away at body and mind - stress hormones are released, tissues inflame, the heart races. Love catalyzes peace and clarity of mind. I think that positive change is more likely to result from love than from anger.

       Shills are paid. They have no heart and want only to divide. There can be no unity as long as they continue to operate.
       <br/>
       Admins are not willing to stop it, although they surely know when it's happening. A 'noob' posts something that gets 1200% more upvotes then any other comment in a short time span. It's the new business model. I would not be surprised if individuals on the reddit corporate board are also selling votes to the moneyed public, and have designed bots that follow certain scripts.

       I think that even people paid to sow division and chaos have hearts and are deserving of love. I ask myself, 'Why do they do this?' I try to understand the circumstances of their lives. I see them as fellow humans and then I am able to engage with them and everyone around me from a place of love.

       My trick is to gage their interest. Analyze speech patterns (err writing I guess) and you'll see when someone is interested vs asking for a source only to just send you down into endless uninterested fights
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone with interest will try to put more words into their thoughts, will ask questions etc or say what they know already. The other just goes "Ya have a source for that?" most of the time lol

       If you haven't provided sources for your arguments then intellectually they aren't worth a lot. So the only real question to ask is sources (that ideally aren't just some youtube video rather than anything more substantial)

       It's just like using the word 'faggot' as a derogatory insult.  You're equating a fetish a person is into to something shameful.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're free to use it, but I think it is the mark of someone who can't think for themselves and follows the latest 'edgy' internet trend.

       Being gay is not a fetish... And a lot of people that use the term "fag" aren't using it as an insult to gays. Sure, plenty do. Can't help that. But think about battle-rap or hip hop. A lot of those folks don't mean it as "hah you like dick". They view it more as "hah you don't get ladies". Or, even shorter, "asshole". I could see that considering how hyper-masculine the scene is and has been.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who can pitch and catch? And bases said decision on an individual instead of a gender? I don't give a fuck about "slurs". I'll do my thing and you can complain about it. Words are just that. Words.

       I was referring to cuckolding as the fetish, do try to keep up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listening to a decent amount of rap in my life, I don't recall the term faggot being used often.  It may have been, but unless you can point to a decent example, this seems like reaching.

       "Cuck" became a Buzzword because those on the alt-right felt that the left was being too lenient towards minorities and rationalized that white people are so apologetic and gave African Americans so many goodies that they might as well let them fuck their wife too.

       Maybe learn what words mean and where you are leaning before you open your mouth next time. Or, preferably, before you subscribe to a viewpoint you don't even understand. The "try to keep up" is even more hilarious in context.

       You certainly do post in TD, and when you don't you're posting pro-Trump propaganda and basically anything anti-left. Found it funny scrolling through your post history because I noticed that I'd downvoted perhaps 40% of it organically. Shill =\= person who has different opinion FYI.

       They only get the shitty ones. Anybody can "troll". True skill is when you actually get under their skin, which easily manipulated people are worse at.

       HRC campaign attacked a fucking meme in the middle of a presidential race, a flag of surrender to people who could see it, and blood in the water to the rest. She fed the trolls. Never feed the trolls. The fact that nobody stopped them from doing it shows their incompotence.

       Obviously there's no sure-fire way to distinguish them, however a general rule of thumb I have is:
      </p>
      <p>
       Skeptics will say something is unlikely, or that "they can't see it". From their posts, U can tell they've examined the theory (and evidence), but feel like there's not enough there to raise further awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shills will have a more extreme stance, they'll say the theory is impossible (or ridiculous), without offering too much rebuttal to the conspiracy claims. On a variety of big conspiracies, they'll resort to "text-book" arguements, and you'll oftentimes find yourself wondering  if it's even a real person typing, as opposed to an advanced bot. (They exist)
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously there's exceptions, but from where I currently stand, it's pretty easy for me to seperate the wheat from chaff.
      </p>
      <p>
       A true conspiracy theorist will rarely say: "that's impossible!". A shill will go through hoops to ridicule the topic to steer people away.

       don't waste your time.  the only thing that matters is building sustainable balanced transparent systems that don't require the use of coercion to run.  focus on building those things.  discuss those ideas.  figure out how to do that one thing.  when the choice is obvious to most that there's a better way people will coalesce around making it happen.  and then the whole hierarchical system that's been put in place to ensure this won't happen will shudder under its own brittleness as every small outlying force will contribute to tearing the thing down.

       We should all use critical thinking when engaging with other users. I'm sick of seeing commenters getting called out because of their account age. There are many reasons for having a new account but a lot of users take that alone as the reason for calling someone a shill. If account age is such a concern perhaps we can lobby the mods for a new rule that does not allow participation from accounts less than 'X' old. But, tbh, that would be a silly rule. Conspiracies live and die on arguing perspectives. So I would suggest we do just that. Argue, or to be nicer, converse with other users and lay out your perspective. Be willing to defend. Be willing to listen.

       I've noticed that shills will argue and deflect because that is their purpose, and a skeptic will generally ask questions to learn why someone thinks a certain way and will reasonably disagree. Shills are far more likely to mock the beliefs of others or just try to be annoying, really. Of course you cant usually
       <em>
        prove

       someone is a shill because we are all anonymous here, but I am confident that I can tell, and I've noticed that many others have identified the same shilling patterns.

       Skeptics have good questions but state that they are open to different or new ideas, often saying that they are interested in the topic but would like to know more about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shills show up with snarky comments that shit on the theory in question and then if you check their comment history you realize that they don't actually believe in any conspiracy theories, they just inexplicably hang out in a conspiracy forum to obfuscate and distract. Oh, and they use bizarre non sequitur personal attacks.

       Yeah good point. With those scenarios it's like, why the hell did you even ask then? I think those things might be to sort of gauge how we feel about topics for some kind of macro research or something. Like to get the lay of the land to see how people really think about a conspiracy. I think there's a term for that kind of post but can't remember it. Data mining maybe?

       I mean, I mostly respond with unconstructive snark towards conspiracies that are utterly idiotic. There's so much pseudoscience floating around here that it's often impossible to be constructively critical. I'd love to be paid though. Grad school has it's expenses.

       I ask people who I think could be shills why their favorite conspiracy theory is and why. I have no reason to think that about you but is that a question you can answer? I'm kind of asking rhetorically but feel free to really answer if you want to.

       For sure, and I understand the basic premise of your question. If they can't answer that, then it's a good sign that they're just in the thread to troll, create drama, or otherwise disrupt. I think mine are a bit vanilla to be honest. I'm interested in the corruption in agriculture (meat, dairy, plant), as well as in the energy industry (Shell, Exxon, BP, etc) but in general in corporate lobbying. As far as theories go, it isn't really complicated - just see what companies are donating to who. What companies donate and to who are rally interesting though. For instance, Sanders received a remarkable amount of donations from defense contactors.

       A skeptic is you, the reader. A smart person who is just questioning the official narrative.

       A shill is someone who disagrees with you.

       You can't. The only way you can prove it is hard facts. And online it's not like you can jump through a computer to where someone is typing from.

       I strongly believe high risk users we will be segregated from each other and just be talking to AI all day. Or at least an attempt segregate and placate with AI.

       There is no way to bring this whole sub together unless you make it a one topic echochamber.Most of the time shilling is a non issue and only brought up when pressed for proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look,I get it.We all want to discuss and share our info.But 90% of posts are unsourced or Blogs linking to Blogs that link to blogs that say they did that.You can't expect to have a discussion like that.This is the internet,you can find a Blog or website that claims human feces are sentinent beings.That doesn't make it so.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am deeply skeptical.I enjoy JFK stuff,Area 51 and the like.So I stumble across a post that claims this,that and those guys working in that government  run a child slave ring.So naturally I want proof or at least some evidence.The typical responses are:"I researched it so do the Same." or "Just open your eyes."
      </p>
      <p>
       So someome already did the Research? Great,link me mofo.No?I wouldn't believe you any way?Why did you post than?
      </p>
      <p>
       And this is the point when you get called shill because you want proof.There is no common ground with people like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you get into a discussion there is no common ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       A claims x.I post multiple sources that proof A wrong.A proceeds to call me shill and a sheep.

       A skeptic will ask questions, be curious, engage in sharing information. A shill will straw man, insult, mislead or use some other tactic to nuke the post.
