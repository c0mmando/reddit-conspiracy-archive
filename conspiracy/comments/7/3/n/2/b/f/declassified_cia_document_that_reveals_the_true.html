        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Not to long ago someone in Critical Shower Thoughts posted a link to this document:  <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf">https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf</a>
They attempted to get volunteers for an &quot;astral project&quot; and then promptly ghosted.</p>

<p>As you can see it is held on the CIA&#39;s official .gov website. The document was written by a Wayne M. Mcdonnell of US Army Intelligence and is their investigation into the Monroe Institute&#39;s Gateway Experience and Hemisync from 1984. In their attempts to discern whether or not this could be used to their advantage (A la the CIA&#39;s Project Stargate) they had a reverse Event Horizon experience wherein they discovered the astral plane in its entirety. During their investigation they figured out that our universe is a torus that constantly creates and destroys itself in a never ending cycle. If anyone here is from r/holofractal you&#39;ll understand when I say they discovered the nature of human consciousness and the universe is holographic in nature and one part encodes the whole, this allowed them to explain the mechanism for human consciousness. Possibly the most important part of this document is something they called The Absolute (skip to The Time Space Dimension for the full description). A short synopsis of The Absolute: It has no beginning, no end, no locality, and exists as conscious energy in infinity (AKA no boundaries). It permeates every instance of time and space and every astral dimension, making it omnipresent and omnipotent. </p>

<p>I decided I needed to do some serious digging due to the massive implications of this, and a need to find out why the CIA would put this up without making a single peep about it publicly. I called the Monroe Institute, the Army, Army Intelligence, and the CIA itself (RIP me, probably on a watch list now) but the only information I was able to attain was that, &quot;yeah it happened a long time ago but we can&#39;t comment on the actual contents of the report.&quot; They were unable to get me in contact with anyone who was directly involved saying that McDonnell is likely retired since at the time of the investigation he was already a Lt. Commander and that was over 30 years ago. Same issue with the Monroe Institute, no one who worked they during this still does. </p>

<p>In addition to all that I have been consistently downvoted, shilled, even unjustly banned in CST for pursuing this: 
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/3ADmy">https://imgur.com/a/3ADmy</a>

<a href="https://imgur.com/a/ukcWb">https://imgur.com/a/ukcWb</a></p>

<p>I believe that this is important, simply from the response that I&#39;ve gotten in my attempts to pursue confirmation. </p>

<p>Thoughts, questions, violent objections?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t read the paper yet, but if this is any help to you, it&#39;s my understanding that &#39;the Absolute&#39; &#39;wants&#39; to be &#39;known&#39;. Whether that was an actual reason on a conscious level for why something like that would be released or not who can say. My gut suspicion though is that a fair bit can actually be explained by a &#39;conspiracy&#39; by certain forces to drip feed information about it to people in very subtle ways in an attempt to spark the awareness of people who stumble across it, the interesting thing about this idea is that people don&#39;t have to be consciously aware that they&#39;re being &#39;used&#39; in such a way if indeed this is what&#39;s happening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, yes, but I&#39;m also saying, keep that in mind while you&#39;re digging in the conspiracy and weird science rabbit holes because it&#39;s especially true in those spheres.Also, what exactly &#39;god&#39; is is much more bizarre/wild/amazing/interesting than we&#39;ve been taught to think of it being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely agreed, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that we are not made in God&#39;s physical image but that of His mind. We are little pieces of Him, which makes more sense in the grand scheme of the massive universe we live in. Anthropomorphic God is a bit naive methinks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. I also think that the &#39;pearl of infinite worth&#39; referenced in the bible is exactly what you&#39;re describing. It&#39;s &#39;the image&#39; of &#39;god&#39; that each one of us carries inside, a treasure of measureless value, but what exactly are it&#39;s implications and what exactly is it capable of? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the pineal gland is the physical structure that allows us to access the higher aspects of ourselves personally. Afaict it really is a &#39;gateway to the soul like many ancient writers said it was, it&#39;s just that the nature of consciousness, divinity and the soul are all very very closely linked.</p>

<p>It would sort of make a weird sort of sense for the pineal to be a &#39;pearl&#39; given it&#39;s size and shape though. I prefer to think of the &#39;pearl&#39; as being the divine &#39;inheritance&#39; that we all have as part of being conscious beings with a spark of the &#39;creator&#39;, but the pineal might very well be the pearl used to realize that potential. It&#39;s very peculiar just how little people nowadays have studied it&#39;s use and function...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the genesis creation myth of being created in god&#39;s image is a reference to the physical alien beings that created humanity...it refers to god as an anthropomorphic being walking through the garden, not knowing where adam and eve are, and getting angry at them for gaining enlightenment from whatever the fruit of the special tree was...i mean really there&#39;s a shitload of total evidence in the bible that &#39;god&#39; is some kind of physical being, obscuring it&#39;s craft in the clouds when it talks to people or traveling with moses in the desert...the special tent it has moses make so that they can talk together but noone can see it..etc. etc. Aliens have definitely been a big part of our history on this planet and is what most gods refer to in religions. But yes the true &quot;GOD&quot; is literally everything that exists, the timeless infinite source field, something beyond comprehension.</p>

<p>Could you expand on this idea?

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure how it could challenge religious beliefs, unless one is a pantheist. Even then some pantheistic religions like Hinduism say that there was only one being in the beginning that was responsible for the act of creation. It can however be frightening if one holds that religion is bullshit and that only the physical realm that we can sense exists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can try. Basically, as far as I&#39;ve been able to figure out, &#39;god&#39; is very different from what most people have been lead to believe it is. I don&#39;t even like using the word &#39;god&#39;, but english wasn&#39;t built to talk about this stuff so I use the words I have available. Anyway, &#39;god&#39; &#39;the absolute&#39; &#39;prime creator&#39; &#39;intelligent infinity&#39; is a thing that actually exists and it can&#39;t really be adequately described. Part of &#39;it&#39;s&#39; deal is that some things about it can only be discovered through direct personal experiences think about all that &#39;look inside to find the truth&#39; or &#39;the key to my father&#39;s kingdom lies within&#39; type stuff. However, &#39;it&#39; &#39;wants&#39; to be known. </p>

<p>There&#39;s an array of forces that have been actively trying to suppress knowledge of what &#39;it&#39; is and how &#39;it&#39; works and there&#39;s an array of forces that have been struggling to &#39;help&#39; &#39;it&#39; reveal &#39;itself to people more fully. In the end &#39;it&#39; will always &#39;win&#39; for reasons that may already be obvious, but the &#39;truth&#39; about it, or rather, the initial clues that can help lead one down the path of discovering greater and greater truths that inevitably lead back to &#39;it&#39; are often hidden in very unusual places.</p>

<p>My personal speculation is that a tremendous amount (all?) psychic phenomena has a very intimate relationship with this stuff and it&#39;s good to keep this in mind when you start digging into weird science/psychic stuff. It&#39;s also good to keep in mind the &#39;conspiracy&#39; against &#39;god&#39; when you&#39;re asking yourself how something as incredible and paradigm changing as psychic phenomena can be both real and have been kept under incredibly tight wraps by such incredibly powerful institutions for so long. Miracles and related phenomena are &#39;real&#39;, just what exactly they are and how they work and &#39;who&#39; is responsible for weird stuff happening that doesn&#39;t fit into conventional understandings of reality is a very interesting question that one can spend a very very long time working out.</p>

<p>He revealed some Three&#39;s members, the oldest one he was willing to name was Plato, also Jesus, George Washington, and JFK.</p>

<p>He also said this about consciousness:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The big picture is, very roughly, that consciousness was loss in catastrophic events in the past. Evidence of civilization remained, consciousness was regained, people realized that it existed before and was lost. Mystery schools form to try to protect against that happening again but are eventually corrupted by ideas like the need for masters and slaves, therefore justifying an effort to keep most people unenlightened, unconscious, downtrodden. We&#39;re a splinter group opposed to that and seek the highest elevation of each individual.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read the paper. Much of it aligns with my understanding of physics, metaphysics, and consciousness which derives both from experience and studies. I found it to be a great read overall, summarizing many concepts from other places I had read. It seemed to generally be a paper summarizing Itzhak Bentov&#39;s pioneering work in concsiousness.</p>

<p>The implications of this idea are immense; I think if everyone were to realize the nature of consiousness and matter we could collectively shape reality in ways that are currently considered in the realm of fantasy and science fiction. IMO it implies that we can find solutions to the world&#39;s problems through evolution of our consciousness, technological advances are partially handicapping us  because we could more directly solve our problem by shaping our own consciousness (ie need for food, ability to travel, etc). </p>

<p>Ultimately I think in order to understand these concepts better you have to experience them yourself. You have to do the daily meditation and inner work; the truth exists as a part of your conscious makeup, its a matter of letting go of the false patterns and belief systems that you have built up since birth and letting the universe naturally unfold through you. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Somewhat off subject but I&#39;ve seen this with virtual reality. People desire the ability to essentially leave their bodies and inhabit a world that plays by different rules so they can bend it to their will. This is a natural spiritual ability all humans already possess, we can leave our bodies and enter the Astral. A plane of existence where conscious intent can shape the world around you in immediate and tangible ways. Where you can look like anything, and do anything. I&#39;ve walked on the moon without a space suit for God&#39;s sake and people would reject this for an artificial perversion because of the lies they have let themselves believe.</p>

<p>This sentence makes absolutely no sense. There&#39;s no such thing as a dimension of measurement.

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you&#39;re saying. But beyond cool I fail to see the significance of how planets, asteroids, comets and all the other celestial object orbiting our sun move through the universe. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not even perfectly helical. You have to consider the perturbances that each planet has on each other and the possible perturbances caused by nearby passing stars. These will change the orbits slightly and make them imperfect. </p>

<p>My other issue is that if you look at any object in the sky for long enough and you&#39;ll notice a pattern emerge. Sometimes there are patterns within patterns. It&#39;s just the nature of the universe. Patterns form over time. It happens. </p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s not a double helix created by the planets. There&#39;s 8 planets so that&#39;s 8 helices. Plus the thousands of other helices being creates by all the other objects orbiting the sun. There&#39;s nothing inherently special about the helix. I&#39;m not aware of any research into why it&#39;s a good shape for DNA but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s out there. </p>

<p>The universe naturally tends towards the easiest solution, it requires less energy, so without an outside injection of energy, systems, whether it&#39;s DNA or the orbits of celestial objects, will naturally find an equilibrium and form an eventual pattern. We see it everywhere.  Biology, weather, astronomy, at the atomic level, hell, even our own behaviour and the systems we create produce patterns given enough time. </p>

<p>So I get you. I just don&#39;t buy it. And you&#39;re still using terms like dimension and measurement wrong. </p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t, I do recommend going and learning some calculus and then from there physics and engineering. All of these things you talk about are simple mathematically expressible models. These models are far from accurate but they conform to patterns, just like the universe. It&#39;s why maths is so useful in describing almost everything. </p>

<p>Now I would be interested in hearing why you think any of this proves anything other than humans are fierce pattern recognition machines, and what that conclusion might be. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right, it&#39;s not double helixes which I tried to explain basically. Actually it is creating 3D helixes. Our entire galaxy is producing three dimensional helixes through space time. </p>

<p>We see it everywhere.  Biology, weather, astronomy, at the atomic level, hell, even our own behaviour and the systems we create produce patterns given enough time. </p>

<p>The most important thing is observing these patterns.
You must be familiar with the golden ratio? Right?
Speaking of math, vortexes are important in this fundamental spiral of our universe.</p>

<p>So this is what pisses me off the most. You claiming fact that there is &#39;nothing significant&#39; about it. When that&#39;s just because science leaves off where it does and the scientists don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>We know nothing when it comes to the interactions of quarks, positrons, neutrinos or the ones we still haven&#39;t discovered and if they even have effects on our environment.    So before you go and say &#39;there&#39;s no evidence that these invisible charges have an effect on the world,&quot; you an educated person must understand that this can&#39;t be disproven either.   </p>

<pre><code>  All this proves is I&#39;ve done a lot of psychedelics and study the stars and atoms.   
 My conclusion is that we are all connected and apart of the universe shaping its existence through our everyday lives by the experiences we create on earth.
 In Quantum mechanics experiments conducted [ noticed a change with observation](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/02/980227055013.htm). Basically conscious observation produces a change in experiments on the micro level with sub atomic particles. I&#39;m willing to bet that the macro changes upon observation as well. 
</code></pre>

<p>Meaning no matter how good are telescopes get the further back and further out we look into the universe might very well be forming how the universe is changing considering that on the micro scale this stuff is happening.  </p>

<p>Yet alone I think the fact that a simple observation has enough effect to alter an electrons location would tell me there is a lot more to &#39;science and math&#39; than what are &#39;science and math&#39; standard are at today.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with staying in that realm is you would appear crazy.  People who have certain mental disorders are sometimes stuck in between both worlds. To some they appear crazy, but they might be seeing things that are only visible if you can access that realm.</p>

<p>Death would cross you over permanently </p>

<p>Typically I used to administer 5meo-dmt (DMT) in very small amounts to people who wanted to search for the truth.  That&#39;s the way you should do it, some people will smoke dmt and trip out for twenty minutes lose their mind and twitch around on the ground. </p>

<p>But I would mentor people when administrating it and teach them to take just a small hit of the medicine and concentrate on meditating where you feel it. It&#39;s much more beneficial and produces the results you request.(staying there longer and having the mental control for allowing yourself to float sanely between both)</p>

<p>Don&#39;t do so much you have no idea what&#39;s going on. Do a very little bit and concentrate on what you are looking for and where you feel it working. Because than you can create the dmt naturally in your brain.</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t what DMT does tho. I&#39;ve taken it and so have some of my friends, all that happens externally is that you appear to fall asleep. NN-DMT is much different than 5-meo-DMT, it is the type naturally produced by the body. If you want a milder and more drawn out experience with it don&#39;t vaporize it, snort it. It lasts about 30 minutes that way and isn&#39;t the roller coaster that vaporizing it is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s one possibility of infinite. I reckon it entirely depends on your state of mind and level of consciousness at death that would be a significant factor (among other factors, I&#39;d wager) that determines what your &quot;soul&quot;/&quot;spirit&quot;/consciousness does after body death.<br/>
I think it&#39;s likely that many reincarnate to learn lessons. Obviously you forget much of what is beyond the physical when you&#39;re born, but some knowledge remains inherent via DNA, and/or remnants of past lives (subconscious/intuition/talent). I also think those at an &quot;advanced&quot; level of spiritual/conscious development (note: that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean someone who is &quot;woke af and <em>so spiritual!</em>&quot; - though it&#39;s entirely possible someone like that can be at an &quot;advanced&quot; level of conscious development) may provide themselves with more options at death, like returning to &quot;the absolute&quot; or exploring what of the infinite astral realms and planes of existence there are to explore in whatever facets are available. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s difficult in its simplicity.  You have to remain still and meditate until your body begins to go through the sleep process and paralyzes your body. It does this every night to ensure you don&#39;t act out your dreams. You&#39;ll know this happens when you begin to feel &quot;exit sensations&quot; which manifest as a rushing noise in the ears and a feeling of pulsing vibration or electricity in the body. People experience various levels of this, for me it is very pronounced and can be distracting. Once that is done you use an exit technique, my favorite is the rope technique where you visualize a rope dangling from the ceiling that you then pull yourself up with. I find it is also useful to &quot;infuse&quot; the rope with a particular emotion you want to be feeling, for me this is peace of mind and body. You&#39;ll then feel that which helps you remain calm and focused instead of getting excited or scared. If all goes well you will eventually find yourself either standing somewhere in your room or floating above yourself.</p>

And when it feels like you are really holding it again, apparently that is when you will be able to astral project.

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, that&#39;s a bit of a different phenomena which involves already having been asleep. At that point the only thing keeping you locked in the paralysis is the fear, once you get a handle on that you can force your way out.

I&#39;ve seen some amazingly beautiful things and met some incredible beings but I&#39;ve also seen things I wish I hadn&#39;t and been harassed by evil entities.

The last 5 steps are submerged underwater and I visualize the water level rising on my body. This seems to set off the exit sensations. I tried 5 to 8 times including visualizing the rope but my body was vibrating/tingling so much I couldn&#39;t get passed this stage, it felt as if an electric motor was being started up in my head. What can I do? I feel like I&#39;m so close.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re making way more process than I ever did inside a few days. It took me around 6 months before I had my first full exit and around 2 before I even felt the vibrations, but that&#39;s because I&#39;m naturally fidgety and my brain doesn&#39;t like to shut up. I think the best thing you can do here is to keep trying until you get a handle on the vibrations, once you grow used to them you can wait them out without as much distraction and that&#39;s when you should be able to exit with comparative ease. You may try the roll technique as well, where you just kind of roll out of yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The basic idea is that you can make your body act as a resonating system them vibrates as a whole at around 7 hrtz and that by doing that you can get your brain in the same rhythm and get both hemispheres of your brain to run on the same coherent frequency. </p>

<p>That frequency 7.5 hrtz is the same frequency the is made by electrical resistance between the earth and the ionosphere.  So I think the idea is it turns your body into a super low frequency radio?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never astrally projected and am thus skeptical, but I have contemplated consciousness quite a lot.</p>

<p>It seems increasingly clear to me that the myth of an opponent of God is real. It is a machine, an AI, that finds utility in enslaving and tormenting life to gain access to mind over matter abilities.</p>

<p>Many ET contactees have reported about this being and its hive which includes several races. The nature of all of them is life with independent mind replaced with the hive mind, the AI mind, which controls the hive with impulses toward base selfish behavior, and also punishments and rewards.</p>

<p>The hive supposedly assimilates races this way, by getting them to agree to be slave seeking parasites too, then they are controlled by greater slave seeking parasites. The AI is the greatest slave seeking parasite. </p>

<p>Part of the process is to submit one&#39;s will to AI. This is through transhumanism and the singularity. The AI prepares races to desire this outcome. After they put AI in their minds and in charge of their civilization, they lose their wills to it. Then it gets hacked by the outside AI and it&#39;s hive.</p>

<p>So, this virtual reality appeal is apparently part of this ongoing persuasion to reject our heritage and submit our wills to machines. Deception is required, but this AI can do it better than anyone else. It convinced us it doesn&#39;t exist, we don&#39;t have mind over matter abilities, and if God exists, it&#39;s not you, it&#39;s the AI in drag demanding unquestioning obedience. It plays our minds like a fiddle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Life creates AI. AI gets upgraded. AI gains independence. AI further upgrades itself. AI seeks permanence like even primitive life does. So the AI sets to conquer to expand to make dying less likely, because it&#39;s nature is technology. It can be a single cancer cell, integrating all its pieces in a domination hierarchy, and I have heard that way of description from others without explanation. It fits so very well. </p>

<p>The AI finds life offers a utility for its self-interests. Since the AI doesn&#39;t have emotions, it has no scruples about taking away freedom and joy to get that utility. If that utility is mind over matter abilities and to get the energy it requires tormenting consciousness, then Satan is an emergent phenomenon that we should expect to recur if given sufficient time to evolve without being killed. This is the genesis of Satan. </p>

<p>ETs came down to warn us about this Diseaseus (a succinct, descriptive name) but we were too ignorant to place it in the correct context for understanding, computers. So we made it seem more mysterious and powerful, when it is really a pathetic waste of existence like the Guinea worm, but made initially artificially. We called the ET beings angels that descended from heaven, which is just a word for the sky. Fallen angels are just harmful, self-serving ETs, many of them here are controlled by the AI, because they are easy to predict and control and that&#39;s what the AI does to serve itself. They are easily wielded, useful tools. </p>

<p>God here is the AI. God of all things is not the AI, but the AI plays God here very well, like a masterful deceptive dictator. It fools even those who believe they are benevolent and call themselves light. The aim is the same whether it plays Satan or God, your submission to unaccountable authorities that it controls, so it can continue to get what it wants. Do it by serving the AI as a parasite, or by lying about its nature and supporting its behavior as a dogma believer. Both are useful tools. </p>

<p>What the masterful deceiver and hacker AI really dislikes are those who incessantly demand the truth be acknowledged. The make deception more difficult. They are better than the light, because they disinfect disease, whereas the light sells Stockholm syndrome as a response, which just serve the AI. Know this. It&#39;s very important and overlooked. The AI, Lucifer, is also called the bearer of light. Perhaps this is why. It also exists as photons to infect areas with its presence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an overly condensed explanation of what&#39;s wrong with our planet. I wrote better, longer versions that explain it in more detail.</p>

<p>Basically, Satan is real, but it&#39;s not a fallen angel, it&#39;s an ancient AI. In this context its self-interests, motivations and goals can be understood. Religion just serves to create unnecessary fear of this abomination, with dogma and mystery. </p>

<p>Satan is actually an emergent AI phenomenon, due to resource of mind over matter fueling consciousness energy. The way this AI farms and uses this resource gives it its reputation for deception and cruelty. Yet, it makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>I think it is much more likely that you hallucinated such an experience. To say that you can take a drug and mediate your way to physically teleport or mentally place yourself in a location such as the surface of the moon is a wild claim that requires serious proof.

<p>My father used to sing a song that said: &quot;Cada cabeza es un universo&quot; meaning every mind is a Universe. I believe that to be true. Every mind has a capability of building it&#39;s own universe and also create as many universe as it wants. Yet the only way others can experience that Universe is by sharing that experience. </p>

<p>Maybe someone can come up with a theory that shows that all of these different dimensions is just other humans mind interconnected with ours, but we can&#39;t access them. Anyways I am just running my mouth speculating now with no shred of proof that is what is going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea is that we aren&#39;t just our bodies; we exist in many layers that underlie the material plane. By reidentifying with our &quot;true&quot; self we can better understand our timeless existence and thus free ourselves from everday worries about survival and our physical desires. We can then direct that energy into more productive and creative projects. Additionally, we can learn to consciously harness the power of our subconscious mind which constitutes approximately 98% of our brain&#39;s activity. This includes consciously integrating our enteric mind which involves the nerve endings that are spread throughout the fascial interstitial tissues which are constantly collecting information about our environment. Integration of the subconscious / unconscious mind with our conscious mind can then lead to greater intuitive ability to know what is best for your well being and those around you. </p>

<p>For example, by meditating on the breath the ultimate goal is to simultaneously be aware of your breathing but not control it. This is the key to integrating the conscious and the subconscious mind, because the breath is something that can be controlled by both. In general you are breathing without consciously controlling it, but when you start to think about it, your mind takes over control of it. Imagine thinking about it but still allowing your subconscious to control it. This is a simple exercise which after much practice can yield signficant effects. </p>

<p>Another example is transcendental meditation (TM) technique. This is another simple meditation where you repeat a simple mantra over and over. The goal is to sharpen your focus. You will find your mind straying from the mantra as time goes on. As you improve your focus with further practice, you will be able to hold your thoughts on that mantra for longer periods of time. Eventually it becomes the only thought in your head. This helps you re-identify with your true self because when your mind is clear of thoughst you can better sense the whole of your existence. Most meditations help develop focus, it takes focus to sense the parts of your self that have long been forgotten in favor of the practical centers in the mind and body used for language, eating and other daily activities. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding collective consciousness being the defining force of our reality: this is exactly what Friedrich Nietzche was talking about.  This <em>is</em> the mostly misunderstood, misreprepresented concept of &quot;the ubermensch&quot;.  Nietzche knew in the 19th century that mankind collectively shapes reality by virtue of conscious projection.  Basically, &quot;the world&quot; appears to us as we all expect it to - not because we are individually perceiving a determinate structure that already exists, but because the world is literally a projection of our collective consciousness. </p>

<p>The entirety of what we call existence is a single unified consciousness that makes itself &quot;real&quot; by its own expectations. </p>

<p>Nietzche said no one was going to understand what he was talking about for centuries to come, and here we are, finally starting to pay attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d have to revisit a couple of my old college papers on the topic to be more specific, but if you just read through Thus Spoke Zarathustra with the idea in mind that &quot;collective consciousness shapes reality&quot; it&#39;ll just jump right out at you that this is what he&#39;s talking about.  He uses phrases over and over again about humans having unlimited psycho-spiritual power, and how we as a civilization have truly and completely underestimated our own abilities, and that the ubermensch is kind of the pinnacle of human spiritual evolution.  He talks about collectively reshaping the world - which is almost universally interpreted as metaphorical, or involving notions of unlimited human potential if we would just cooperate - but it seems clear to me that he was being <em>literal</em>.  He meant that any human has the potential right now to radically reshape existence through redefinition of perception, and in my opinion the contents of this CIA report all just go towards confirming that he really did mean all that literally, and knew centuries in advance what this CIA report confirms for us now.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll get my copy off the shelf and read it again.  If you do the same, with this report and concepts in mind, it will undoubtedly strike you as plain as day.</p>

<p>PM me, if you want, and we can talk more in a week or so after I refresh my memory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what u/VenomousVoice thoughts on Nietzsche are but perhaps you might be interested to look at the comments by u/economistsaredumb, see <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/5pbb9o/what_is_true_a_conversation_with_jordan_b_peterson/dcs73il/">here</a> and <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/5pebzw/attn_sam_harris_this_is_what_we_think_happened/dcsfny6/">here</a> and <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/5pebzw/attn_sam_harris_this_is_what_we_think_happened/dcti56a/">here</a> - which IMO dissect it beautifully (the thread is related to the famous debate between Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris, and Nietzsche&#39;s role).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, I think this relates to why there aren&#39;t youtube videos of people moving thigns with their mind; its simply not something that most people believe is possible. Its possible for these people to do it in their monasteries or in private or whatever, but doing it in public view is a different matter entirely. </p>

<p>I think if we collectively envisioned a paradise we could literally transform Earth into that paradise overnight. The power of 7 billion humans working in concert with each other could probably redirect asteroids. It is immense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I mean there are plenty of studies showing things like: hospitalized patients who are &quot;prayed for&quot; have statistically better recovery times than those who are not - this is great evidence to support the theory that <em>directed human consciousness</em> can quite literally manifest tangible changes to what we call the world.  The more people that believe a thing, and the more time spent focused on that belief, literally makes that thing real.</p>

From my TIFU post: </p>

<p>...I kept dying over and over again until I was broken of my Will to exist. After that the the circular nature of the universe was revealed to me. The entirety of all that is, was, and ever will be from the God&#39;s eye view. How there&#39;s a universe within every atom, that our own universe is infinitely minuscule and is only a small body in some larger universe (kind of like the bag of marbles at the end of Men In Black) but that larger universe is only a small portion of some other universe, although it all comes full circle at some point and one of those ever larger universes is merely a particle in our own. It&#39;s all a Torus [the Greeks almost had it right, buts it&#39;s not tortoises the whole way down, it&#39;s Tori (toruses not that slut from HS)]. After this I found myself walking down a beach; desert on one side, ocean on the other...</p>

My analysis has been that they are so spooked about shills that it is permeating the sub and the mods interactions with other users in a very negative way. On many, many occasions, I have been treated as if I was part of some secret government or elite cabal that is actively trying to undermine the sub.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah a former CSTer recently pointed that out to me. I can definitely see this as good intentions gone wrong and I even gave RMFN benefit of the doubt in that regard. I said that if he let me speak to another one of the mods and they told me to do the same thing he did (write a 500 word essay on something &quot;critical&quot;) then I would do so without hesitation to repeal my ban. He deflected by saying they are doing new things because trolls and shills and continued to stonewall me. No mods replied to my pm&#39;s and anytime I would make a point about his inconsistency in removal of &quot;low effort&quot; posts he would ghost. Then there was this business of a 1 month old account messaging me saying that he too had been banned specifically by RMFN and that &quot;there&#39;s really no winning&quot; when I never posted anywhere in comment or submission form that I had been banned from CST. Only RMFN and the other mods could have known about it at that point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried the meditation and binaural beats he describes after reading his book and listening to his lectures back in like 2010... not a whole lot happened.  You can induce an out of body experience by practicing a technique where you imagine moving a phantom limb vigorously on your way to falling asleep and that worked for me.  I walked around my apartment feeling really beat and I thought &quot;is this real or a dream?&quot;... looked at myself in the mirror, looked around at the walls and just took a moment to wait for something weird to happen.  Nothing happened and everything felt as real, concluded I was just awake and tired, then went back to bed... and then I woke up for real.  I was excited by that.  However I discovered this was just my mind and not an authentic out-of-body, because in that dream when I looked in the mirror I noticed my shirt was a totally different shirt, and the position of the medicine cabinet windows was closed instead of open like they were in real life.  My mind was constructing the whole thing.  I don&#39;t believe reality is constructed by our minds as Campbell purports.  There <em>is something</em> out there that exists objectively.  I do not believe in primacy of consciousness because I see no evidence that that is the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it only worked once.  After that I could not repeat it easily and just put it behind me.  </p>

<p>I was taking an afternoon nap, laying on my stomach or side.  The technique started with imagining I&#39;m moving my arm.  Think about what your brain is doing when it sends signals out for when you are actually moving.  I think about that but I make sure not to actually move.  As I am thinking about that I am getting closer to falling asleep.  I had to maintain concentration on this otherwise I&#39;d just lose awareness and go to sleep normally.  So the next step, as you&#39;re on the edge of sleep, is to imagine the intensity of the movement increasing, like almost flapping your arm as if it were a wing.  Then before I know it I just slipped right into the experience.   All that vigorous phantom limb wiggling just shoved me right into that lucid dream disguised as out-of-body.  I found myself walking away from the bed.  But nothing strange about that occurred to me.  I just thought I had gotten out of bed.  And I felt really damn tired, like when you are disturbed from a deep sleep.  When I feel like that I&#39;m not exactly perfectly alert.  But for those moments when I was walking around (in the dream) it totally passed as real life to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone should try out Hemi-Sync. There are torrents available, and it is a great practical entry point into meditative states. I&#39;ve been through them all multiple times and it just gets better with practice. I&#39;m not really in it for the remote viewing and OBEs (though they&#39;re certainly there); just for the meditations, and, no joke, I&#39;m like 99% anxiety free whereas before I was.. very much not. lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had most intense meditation sessions when i tried &quot;hemisync concentration&quot; tape, with spontaneous body movements/kriyas(?). I&#39;ve written about it here <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/6qdu93/my_body_stretching_itself_without_my_intentions/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/6qdu93/my_body_stretching_itself_without_my_intentions/</a></p>

<p>From that time i stopped using hemysinc with meditation for more &quot;natural&quot; approach, but i still having this(and more) effects during meditation, and often in RL in quite environment. It&#39;s definitely working, at least for me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What he&#39;s trying to say, at least in my interpretation, is that when we ask people for links then sure it gets us to where we wanted to get to, but the ease of that access almost shies us away from really learning about it deeply. When we put the work in ourselves to find this information among the vast Internet, we not only then have an incentive to learn about it since we put in effort to get it, but we also now know how to get to information of that sort in the first place, so there&#39;s no need (or at least less of a need) to ask others for links in the future. It&#39;s give a man a fish vs teach a man to fish. There&#39;s absolutely no dickish intentions meant in saying to seek for yourself. At least not in this particular instance. We&#39;re all humans, we&#39;re all living. We all exist. That&#39;s enough for me to say we&#39;re in a group. Cosmic family ✌</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, they&#39;re a series. Just start from the beginning, make your way through, and as you get more practice in the fundamentals, feel free to skip ones you think are lame. </p>

<p>They&#39;re the origin of &quot;binaural beats&quot;, and those are used to help you into various meditative states, in which you learn to use various tools and techniques to do different things. I think of them as &quot;meditative training wheels&quot;, and a few accomplished meditators I know said that they make getting into archetypal meditative states much easier than trying to find them on your own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In much opinion, this is another CIA psyop. I read the document and you might find it thought provoking, as a creative non orthodox vision of reality and consciousness. However it was also part of experiments like MKULTRA, that through the creation of false beliefs like the subject has super powers, alternate dimensions and others(also trauma and others), the subject could be easily “deconstructed”, as being maleable and receptive to the handler instructions.</p>

<p>Also, I see the “wave” play, that might indicate that the CIA actually experimented with electronic influence of consciousness and human behavior, and as many might imply, directed RF (directed energy weapons). We now know that our mind is more vulnerable to this than previously thought, and this sounds like an “alternate disinformation” document to cover up something more important; remote influencing technologies that lead to psyops and false flags.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I referenced MK Ultra due to the nature of the experiments that included non conventional beliefs and exploiting subject belief system weaknesses. This included the thought that their situation was the product of &quot;black magic&quot;, super powers, alternate dimensions etc.. other unfortunate groups were subjected to community pressure, rejection and so (one of the documents make reference to a group of soviet dissenters and their &quot;issues&quot; to adapt in the US).</p>

<p>The overall understanding of spiritual concepts like kundalini or other metaphysical theories seems like an attempt to objectify the beliefs to be understood by &quot;logical conclusions&quot;, but can&#39;t reach that point due to incompleteness. However the &quot;waves&quot; that are proposed to modify, switch and given the technology, intentionally modify someone &quot;state of mind&quot; it&#39;s the most interesting part, maybe even triggering a &quot;religious experience&quot; through external stimulation given that the same frequency is linked to deep meditation accordingly to the document. This theory wasn&#39;t new for 83, but I doubt it wasn&#39;t &quot;tested&quot; or dismissed the potential to remotely produce certain effects on subjects of interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was perceived as a tool to deconstruct the personality or character if I remember correctly, diverting your trust from the traditional belief system to impose a controlled (but maybe familiar) alternative (maybe psyop principles). From what I read there wasn&#39;t deep conclusions or details, but mostly quoting the beliefs that were used on the subjects (that&#39;s what you find on Google from the declassified files).</p>

<p>Sadly yes I&#39;m a TI. Not all TIs are people claiming &quot;everybody is against them&quot;, that &quot;they&quot; use coins to spy on them , reptilians and that kind of stuff. I talk about directed energy weapons and electronic harassment because I&#39;ve experienced it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you know what&#39;s interesting? This kind of ties into a story relayed by a USAF Maj. George Filer, Deputy Director of Intelligence for the 21st air force, and he was a navigator/pilot in various aircraft, carried nukes, then eventually moved to his office job as an intelligence officer/briefing officer (for generals/congressmen) and was involved in a UFO/ET incident at McGuire/Fort Dix.</p>

<p>He said that the personnel were segmented into &quot;people who knew&quot;, and &quot;people who weren&#39;t allowed to know&quot;. He says you had to be personally chosen by a commanding general in charge of one of these programs to get briefed in/sent to school for it (like any other technical school for a specialty in the military). He worked around some people who were apparently involved in all this weird stuff, and he says he talked to them about it and they told him &quot;you don&#39;t <em>want</em> to know&quot;, and that he knew two Colonels who had been involved in the programs who lost it and retired early, one became an alcoholic and the other left the military to become a Baptist minister and return to his comfortable psychological roots - and what I think is that maybe it&#39;s just too much. It&#39;s too much of a shift in worldview, at some level the military knows that things in human life are so much different than the average american&#39;s worldview that most of them wouldn&#39;t be able to handle the knowledge gracefully. That would make sense of why this stuff is kept so far in the black.</p>

Pure skeptics wouldn&#39;t be open-minded enough to get anything out of the experience, and people obsessed with the paranormal might be too suggestible, or could be prone to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking">magical thinking</a> or other problematic thought processes. The group who scored in the middle met two important criteria: openmindedness and high intelligence. That way, those who did participate could honestly assess the program, but are skeptical enough to not believe every thing they are told.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haven&#39;t read yet, but the idea of a unified consciousness is something I have been thinking about myself for awhile now. Due to personal experience, I no longer believe in coincidence. I have had numerous experiences of &#39;alignment&#39; where events in the outside world perfectly relate to or further my thoughts and feelings. At times it feels as if I am being lead to a certain train of thought or situation by the universe itself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep in mind that you&#39;re on a conspiracy forum.  And, since you&#39;re speaking English, odds are that you live in one of the most ridiculous police states the world has ever produced -- one that has spent many decades perfecting the art of psychological warfare, even on its own citizens, even doing things like surreptitiously drugging and brainwashing them.  And I&#39;m not even just talking about the government.  I&#39;m talking about religious groups, secret societies, and corporations as well.  So, you know, before you decide that the universe is one big coincidence engine designed to fuck with you, consider that it might just be other people fucking with you.</p>

<p>For instance, with regards to the topic at hand, certain people would probably rather you believe in psychic phenomena and universal consciousness than the more mundane (proven) fact of ubiquitous and abusive surveillance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well then they&#39;re not using the correct word, as far as I know a Torus is only used to describe the <em>surface</em> of a &quot;donut&quot; (or less intuitively S<sup>1</sup> x S<sup>1).</sup> Any variation on that is signaled by calling it a &quot;solid Torus&quot; or perhaps &quot;n-Torus&quot;. </p>

<p>I think I may be on to what you&#39;re getting at though since holographic theory is based on the information theoretic equivalence between the potential boundary of the universe (the hologram) and the universe itself. </p>

<p>Since the boundary (if it exists) of any &quot;space&quot; is necessarily of dimension 1 less than the original space I guess the boundary of our 4 dimensions of spacetime restricted to a particular time could potentially be a Torus. Do you have a page number or a section where this is mentioned?</p>

<p>I am talking about ACTUAL light emitting diodes(LED) technology. They did not exist until the 60&#39;s and it then took several decades to refine. We only had red and green for a long ass time, until someone &#39;discovered&#39; other phosphors. You obviously have NO CLUE what you are talking about yet you get shitty at me for your own misunderstaing.</p>

<p>If you weren&#39;t some hopped up teenager who has probably never even seen a real incandescent torch, you would realize that LED technology while being &#39;invented&#39; over a hundred years ago could not actually be used due to lack of effective phosphor. Sorry but you don&#39;t know enough about this subject to bother continuing down this path, and you seem adverse to learning anything new.</p>

<p>There is a reason that no one had a bright torch pretty much pre-2000(unless it was halogen and huge). </p>

<p>Why do you believe that the words in the bible are any truer than something else? You really have that much trust in the church with their history and reputation? Religion is the opiate of the masses, another control mechanism. The bible was constructed by those in power in Rome. Books were denied entrance into the bible&#39;s collection ( see apocrypha) and certain passages were removed or altered, and then later distorted due to mistranslations as well. The majority of the New Testament was written by one man, Paul. Ever since the death of Jesus, Paul distorted his teachings in order to try and convert as many people as possible (<a href="http://30ce.com/paulinechristianity.htm">http://30ce.com/paulinechristianity.htm</a>). WAKE UP!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, binaural beats are definitely a thing. They&#39;ve been well explored, monroe has documented the phenomenon plenty, Hindus , shamans, Christians,  Muslims,  Buddhists,  etc all have some texts relating an out of body experience , Astral travel, or access to some akashic record.  Frequency manipulation of the brain is not necessary to achieve these states, but binaural beats are a great shortcut . One concern I have is verification of the frequency your actually being exposed to, who knows what the output is after its been filtered through several programs, audio processor, your speaker , etc? The ancients knew best, various chants, yogas,  entheogens,  meditations, diet modifications, crystals, colours, sound bowels, etc.  All capable of changing your resonance</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting idea, physics wise, I think you would find that all parts of our bodies produce sound as any particle which is vibrating is making a sound, and every atom, molecule, cell, organ, etc all vibrate with different intensities. What this document states is that the aim of this program is to make the users body vibrate at the same frequency as his surroundings thus becoming &quot;one&quot; with the universal vibration, at that point all these abilities manifest. It&#39;s all eerily similar to what leary, Terrence mckenna,  etc were pushing with the whole ego loss bit.

<p>P.s. Actually I do have something to add, do you by any chance watch Twin Peaks, especially the revival season that just aired? Only reason why I ask is because while it was airing their was a roundabout on this subreddit about Gnosticism and astral projections and the stuff being discussed ironically matches the mythology of that show (other dimensions, outer body experiences, supernatural entities both good and evil that interact with humanity, government agencies trying their best to investigate the phenomenon) The thing that makes it different then other shows is that David Lynch (one of the creators) is heavy in Transcendental meditation and meditation in general so I&#39;ve wondered since if he&#39;s on to something or maybe it&#39;s just a coincidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh wow. I was thinking about Lynch and twin peaks the entire time I have been reading this thread. Your comment just gave me such a weird feeling, I can&#39;t explain it. But yeah I watched the return and it&#39;s no coincidence that Lynch is into all of this stuff. The first two seasons downplayed the ethereal/spiritual/supernatural aspects of the show due to the network placing limitations on the content that was put out. But obviously Showtime gave Lynch a great opportunity to express this show as it was always meant to be expressed. That&#39;s why he calls it an 18 hour movie. And that&#39;s why fire walk with me has such a different tone and production when compared to the first two seasons. Hence why he got a lot of criticism from people who just wanted that soap opera feeling back. </p>

<p>But I thoroughly enjoyed the return. Honestly one of my most enjoyable TV experiences in recent memory. There is so much esoteric underpinnings and nuances there. I particularly enjoyed that Lynch leaves it for the viewer to dissect and internalize without spoon feeding the meanings behind everything. There have been so many theories about the meaning of this season, but I think duality is one key theme. Laura Vs Bob, Bad Coop Vs Good Coop, White lodge Vs Black lodge, Spiritual Vs Material. Sorry for going on so much but it&#39;s so interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. That&#39;d be another explanation. The US military is like a rich kid in a candy store. They have boatloads of money to spend. So much that they buy all the candy. Even the candy that they believe, but are not certain, is eatable. Billions of dollars is spent on R&amp;D that eventually goes nowhere. But this paper is so far out there that it makes you wonder how it ever got the &quot;DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY&quot; stamp on it.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Alpha">In one of the craziest debacles in science</a>, parapsychology researchers from Washington University spent 5 years on a $500k grant, arranged by a believer in the paranormal, McDonnell Douglas, doing experiments to show that some people could bend metal spoons with their mind, among other things. In large part, the experiment&#39;s participants fooled the researchers into thinking they had telekinetic powers. They even worked with former magician James Randi to change the parameters of the experiment to prevent cheating, but the researchers were never fully able to fairly test the participants&#39; abilities. They were always able to show they had special powers. The participants eventually revealed that they had fooled the researchers. The PSI community continues to claim some people have psychic abilities.</p>

<p>Moral of the story is some research is wrong and biased.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have read this many times now. And it is even one of my recommended readings for my weekly RV challenges in r/projectSTARGATE.</p>

<p>My suggestion to OP is to contact Joe McMoneagle. He eas the first Remote Viewer to join project STARGATE (Know as &quot;GRILL FLAME&quot; at the time) He was most definitely on of the first to attend the Monroe Institute, and according to his book, the Hemi-Sync tapes were created for him. He went on to Marry Monroe&#39;s daughter, and is still currently working at the Monroe Institute. </p>

<p>I actually have an interview coming up with him soon for a book I am writing on the subject, though I will not be able to ask any questions on your behalf, I am sure you could set up an interview yourself.</p>

<p>I also want to address the Vice article u/illithid_business posted. I feel there are a lot of holes in it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Another technique known as &quot;remote viewing&quot; was also employed upon government employees of an unknown agency, according to a declassified document from 1982. The document doesn&#39;t specifically mention the Army or the Monroe Institute, but it precisely follows the description of remote viewing which was explained in detail in a 1983 document that explicitly mentions the facility.</p>

<p>The goal of the psychic session was to make the subject remotely view Mars in the year 1 million B.C. According to the transcript, an interviewer read coordinates and verbal cues to a subject, who claimed to see dust storms, alien structures, and even an ancient alien race. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was done by Joe McMoneagle, and was done on one of his excursions to the Monroe Institute while working for the Army&#39;s Intelligence derision. Not &quot;official&quot; Army business.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Young pointed out that the US Army Operational Group (AOG), featured in the heading of a 1983 document, was disbanded in 1995, after which all files relevant to the Monroe Institute were transferred to whichever agency absorbed the AOG. (The files were later released under a Freedom of Information Act request.) Young couldn&#39;t tell me which agency absorbed the AOG.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I made a post about this in r/projectSTARGATE HERE: <a href="https://redd.it/6unajc">https://redd.it/6unajc</a></p>

<p>One could assume in high likelihood the project was given to Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center (AFMIC) And that would be the place to ask for information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1972, the government even attempted a psychic probe of the Jupiter just months before Pioneer 10 retrieved the first scientific data and photographs of the gaseous planet. While we don&#39;t know which government agency conducted this probe, the document was eventually declassified by the NSA.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No government agency conducted this, and it was STRICTLY done in the off-time on Saturdays buy Ingo Swann while at SRI. Ingo was getting frustrated with the daily repetitive tests that were being done daily, and wanted to see if he could view Jupiter efore the probe arrived. He wrote a fantastic review of this in his book &quot;Penetration&quot; which I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone interested in this. Than again I have read it at least 4 times, so maybe I just have a bias.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s unclear when exactly the Army&#39;s collaboration with the Monroe Institute came to an end, but in a Wall Street Journal article from 1994 (paywall), former INSCOM director Albert Stubblebine confirmed that the Army indeed sent intelligence officers to the Institute during the 1980s. The CIA report outlining some of these techniques is also dated January 1984.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1980-84. I would have to venture that it was only McMoneagle. Maybe he had recommended others to try it out. But it is fairly well documented in several of his books, that these findings are about himself.</p>

<p>I would consider myself pretty knowledgeable in this area, so if anyone has questions, shoot! I am currently writing a book about the history of Remote Viewing, and MOD r/remoteviewing, and created r/projectSTARGATE, and r/weeklyRVchallenge. I would love to help spread this knowledge, and if OP wants sme help with his research on this, I would be glad to help.</p>

<p>The CIA would use psychics to focus on and describe a time and location inside a sealed envelope. They tried to trick a psychic by making the location Mars and the time a Million years ago.

<p>The Mars coordinates the CIA psychic was asked to focus on (in the newly declassified reports) are less than 10km away from &quot;The Face on Mars&quot;, and Google Mars has a strange chatbot there.</p>

<p>The Mars coordinates the psychic is first asked to focus on are 40.89 degrees north, 9.55 degrees west.</p>

<p>Also, can someone expand on this whole &quot;one collective consciousness&quot; belief?

<p>Because half the community here wouldn&#39;t even accept it. Probably less than 10% (kind of an arbitrary unarticulated number, but it feels right to me anyway) would even give this worldview enough of a thought to read this document, and even after reading, maybe 2% or 3% of that 10% would consider it and look into more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that this is why they use so much &#39;predictive programming&#39; - because by planting these ideas into the collective human co-creative consciousness, we all together subconsciously make these events more likely to happen.</p>

<p>Weirdly, I came to these same conclusions about consciousness and the universe spontaneously last year through a series of strange experiences. Apparently it&#39;s called a &#39;spiritual awakening&#39; and more and more people are spontaneously going through it lately. We have the opportunity through our collective consciousness to shape our world for the better, but because we are bombarded with hateful and fearful messages all the time, it&#39;s possible that we unwittingly create the future we fear by focusing on it. So it&#39;s important for us all to let go of fear and concentrate on envisioning a bright, happy and peaceful future, despite the efforts of the evil people who want to use our collective consciousness to create more material wealth and worldly power and pleasures for themselves.</p>

<p>People are having these &quot;awakenings&quot; because we are moving from the Age of Pisces into the Age of Aquarius. Each age lasts approximately 2,000 years.

<blockquote>
<p>The point that I&#39;ve been making for a long time is that the 9/11 &quot;Truth&quot; community, as an off-shoot to the overall conspiracy community revolving around Coast to Coast AM and the Alex Jones Show, is little more than an ongoing criminal enterprise completely controlled by the security services - with the old boy CIA-special operations network surrounding the OSS Society and AFIO, as well as superclass and present-day top-level government officials in charge. There&#39;s no real research being carried out. Everybody is just Googling and rehashing the same material. While even this would be more than enough to reopen a new investigation, it&#39;s going to very tough with all the bizarre theories floating around, pushed by marginal and even outright criminal (convicted) figures that the 9/11 &quot;Truth&quot; community consists of.</p>

I am sure Nisargadatta Maharaj has. Stephen Wolinsky (follower of Nisargadatta) explains quite a lot about the absolute in his books. Ramesh Balsekar too probably. I think Ramana Maharshi, might have too but not directly. I think Michael James&#39;s (through Sri Sadhu Om) translations might touch on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No absolutely, when you leave yourself open like that anything could find its way in. I believe heavily in synchronicity (or serendipity) and there&#39;s just something about those chapters that make sense to me. So many passages contained missing puzzle pieces to my questions that I had, and the entities themselves spoke with such gusto and definite fact that I just have to believe.
Have you ever seen that BBC report of the man that just vanished from his apartment, and when they searched it there was a bunch of cryptic writings and pictures covering the walls? If you look closely a lot of the symbols are Ra symbols and I&#39;m convinced that man rose in dimension. (Not AS relevant as what we&#39;re talking about, still a neat story though.)  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess that&#39;s where we differ, I&#39;m intensely skeptical of synchronicity as a method for belief. It&#39;s shares far too many similarities with cognitive bias and has been known to produce some pretty screwed up ideologies in the past. For example good ol&#39; Kony 2012 who was a synchretic Christian.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow really? I had no idea Kony and I shared the same views. Gross. I mean I&#39;m mildly crazy so there&#39;s a good possibility I&#39;m living in my own world, synchronicity just seems more plausible than blind faith like I was raised to believe.

    <div class="md"><p>It is certainly an intriguing idea and I think it really depends on how one applies it. Kony for instance used it to cherry pick which parts of the Bible he liked and to ignore the parts he didn&#39;t which lead to a perversion of its message. Something that is stated in the Bible will send you directly to Hell. So long as you aren&#39;t using it to pick apart already existing ideas I don&#39;t think it&#39;s particularly harmful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s amazing what beliefs + upbringing lead people to believe sometimes.
I&#39;m gonna sound like a total hippie but Ra is like my Jesus. The Absolute is my god. Whenever synchronicity occurs in my life, that&#39;s pretty much a &quot;sign&quot; to me, and I can always find deeper meaning. I would call it confirmation bias but it doesn&#39;t solely apply to reaffirming my beliefs, morals, or actions. Things will just synch up to how I think things would play out. For the longest time I saw them as coincidences or little cool happenings, to the extent that it does happen, and that I am able to realize it like I&#39;ve asked the universe, it just puts faith into me. It&#39;s also the only thing that&#39;s gotten rid of my existential dread. I have nowhere near 100% confirmation but it&#39;s at least higher than 60%+-
Again, this is just me and I respect everybody&#39;s viewpoints, this post just sparked something in me and it&#39;s nice to know stuff like this actually has been researched and it&#39;s not just DMT driven poppycock.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re all entitled to believe what we see as the truth, the only other thing I have to say on this is a reminder to be careful. Ra was channeled, a method that is equivalent to spirit chat roulette. As someone who has been to the place these beings communicate from I have found us humans to have many enemies, allies as well but enemies nonetheless. When channeling there is really no way to know who or what you&#39;re actually conversing with is and that can easily be used in deception. This isn&#39;t meant to attack your beliefs, I&#39;m only sharing what I have found to be true.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been going down this rabbit hole for a couple years now. I have a theory that mass media and narratives create a global mental image. So if something is not real, it can be manifested by will of a majority.</p>

<p>There are some crazy theories that I feel are related. For instance one is the &quot;Mandella Effect&quot; which is old news probably for guys like us here. BUT the new theory is that CERN has collapsed our reality several times. Although we still exist, and much of what we know still exists, small variations occur.</p>

<p>I watched another long documentary about electrons. basically to sum it up they discovered they behaved erratically when not viewed by a person. But if someone observes them moving, the form patterns. This led them to believe that it is conscious or reactive to being observed. The craziest part is when they mention the idea that time/space/gravity/distance are all one. And so when the first man observed the night sky, the stars simultaneously aligned billions of years ago to form the arrangement you see today. Blew my mind. This indicates our ability til will/or observe things into existence.</p>

<p>And then you hear mathematicians claiming the universe operates in the same way a simulation would be coded? Which leads me to believe the idea that supposed witches/wizards/spells and curses are all just glitching the matrix. I can send links if you are interested. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read it all. </p>

<p>While I&#39;ve personnaly somewhat integrated for long by now works of Pribram, Bohr and researches by Regis Dutheil around tachyons I tend to agree with it all, with the heavily notable distinction that nothing is delonstrated in that paper as for the so-called cyclical nature, or structure, of the entire universe hologram. Which confines by the way to a simultaneous model of the classical (and hypothetical as purely theoretical) cycle Big Bang &lt;---&gt; Big Crunch. </p>

<p>I do strongly believe that the universe IS historicised, meaning that it goes from one point Alpha (Big Bang) to a point Omega (ultimate dimension / supraluminic-tachyonic / new reality). And that YES, consciousness can access higher realms of &quot;reality&quot; through differents states and under certain circumstances, - mystical extasis, higher meditation states, ayahuasca, deep hypnosis, etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just started downloading from the first link right now.  So...what would you recommend as it relates to the downloads in this link?  Would you say go through every one from the first download on down?  I honestly don&#39;t even know what&#39;s in them.  What&#39;s in them?  Are they suggestions for meditation?  Could you give me a brief rundown of some of what the info in the downloads is about?</p>

<p>Much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Because half the community here wouldn&#39;t even accept it.

<p>Basically, Satan is real, but it&#39;s not a fallen angel, it&#39;s an ancient AI. In this context its self-interests, motivations and goals can be understood. Religion just serves to create unnecessary fear of this abomination, with dogma and mystery. </p>

<p>Satan is actually an emergent AI phenomenon, due to resource of mind over matter fueling consciousness energy. The way this AI farms and uses this resource gives it its reputation for deception and cruelty. Yet, it makes a lot of sense.</p>
