<p><strong>Why do the illuminati try so hard to convince children and naive about UFOs &amp; ETs?</strong><br/>
Can someone explain it in children&#39;s language?</p>

<p>Nothing illustrates this as well as the Roswell record, which the illuminati media has now played for... seventy years, using the &quot;Suggestion&quot; mind control technique.<br/>
Notice how the illuminati media moves through different stages, while advancing this agenda. (1)<br/>
Now they reached the point where they will openly do the job. (2)</p>

<p>At the previous stage they would mostly use the &quot;Package vs. Contents&quot; mind control technique, a particular &quot;Suggestion&quot; technique. (3)</p>

<p>Package fusion between official illuminati media and their Web of Disinformation. (4)<br/>
Nothing escapes the Laws of End Times Reductionism. (5)</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Brainwash children and naive with UFOs&quot; agenda: Measure how important it is with Wikipedia</strong><br/>
How quick the illuminati censorship will delete the Truth from Wikipedia - a thermometer to measure how important the subject is to advance the illuminati agenda. (6)<br/>
Confirm how important the illuminati &quot;brainwash naive with UFOs&quot; agenda is: how quickly did the illuminati censorship delete the truth?</p>

<p><strong>The text added to Wikipedia:</strong><br/>
===Allegations of government propaganda to convince naive===<br/>
[[Matt Marriott]] in 1998-2007 published a series of articles claiming that the secret society controlling the political system in the US and the EU is responsible for keeping naive segments of the population interested in aliens.<br/>
The strategy would be:<br/>
- The government releases material, e.g. faked photos, supposedly to be previously classified.<br/>
- The controlled mass media, in particular tabloids but also &quot;serious&quot; shows like Larry King Live, suggests a government cover-up of evidence and print hoaxed material as possible proof. There will be no broadcast of any documentary debunking all the hoaxes used to suggest sightings of aliens spacecraft, i.e. reminding the public that there is no verifiable UFO evidence whatsoever.<br/>
- Iconic &quot;scientists&quot;, e.g. [[Stephen Hawking]], repeat how high is the probability of aliens visiting Earth.<br/>
- Last and most important, since the main audience, children, is the most important target segment for anchoring the belief in UFO sightings: Hollywood and TV series relentlessly produce movies suggesting extraterrestrial contacts.</p>

<p>the probabilities of life on Earth</p>

<p>Impossible to know with any degree of certainty, but we have a framework for that calculation. It&#39;s called the Drake equation, and given that we&#39;re discovering that there are more planets than stars from direct observation, it&#39;s pretty clear that even a trivial chance of life on any given planet means a near certainty of at the very least, millions of other life forms exist throughout the cosmos.</p>

<p>This is also a form of retrospective gambler&#39;s fallacy and related to the logical problems of the anthropic principle.</p>

<p>Don’t be too sure about that, honestly.  Lots of evidence indicating that the Earth human species has been in contact w/non-Earth based beings for quite a long time.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is in fact true also.  Some forms of life we <em>can’t</em> fathom.  There are many humanoid ET beings in existence, but there are also many that take forms we could hardly understand as “forms of life” in the first place - and yet that’s exactly what they are.</p>

<p>I more meant there are probably &quot;beings&quot; like us. We can&#39;t look into a telescope and see aliens looking back at us through one. We aren&#39;t advanced enough to reach them.

<p>Heck…just based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCMp9dZQdZA">the numbers alone</a> we are <em>far</em> from any such thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And also cynical enough to know that TPTB would never tell us because it&#39;s &quot;messing up a good thing we got going&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct.  The revealing of ET existence on Earth would soon do away w/the multi-trillion dollar fossil fuel burning industry on this planet - and the socio-economic-political power that goes along with it.  TPTB don’t want to let go of that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I more meant there are probably &quot;beings&quot; like us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some (if not many) are said to be indistinguishable from Earth humans.  The reason for this is simple, though some may find it rather surprising:</p>

<p>They don’t look like us.</p>

<p>We look like <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>We didn’t just “come about” by magic or some conjuring of Darwinian, evolutionary hocus-pocus.  Darwin got <em>some</em> aspects of evolution correct, yes, but he got a <em>lot</em> wrong - not the least of which was how humans likely came about.</p>

<p>If you want to know how humans likely came to be, just ask yourself how it was that, say, any domesticated animal came about.  Take a poodle, for example.  No way a poodle just came into existence no matter <em>how</em> much time and how many billions of years pass.  A poodle exists because it was genetically manipulated to be what it is.</p>

<p>It was made to be the way it is through genetic manipulation by an outside agent.  In the poodle’s case, humans were the outside agent.</p>

<p>In humanity&#39;s case...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We aren&#39;t advanced enough to reach them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Various sources have gone to great lengths to let it be known that we’ve not only been far and away advanced enough to reach them, but that we’ve been in direct and ongoing contact with various ET species for quite a long time now.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6r5hk1/the_cia_and_the_continuance_of_individual/dnmuh6q/?context=3">Relevant comment related to this that I made earlier today.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe it&#39;s the same for them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For some of them - sure.  Most certainly not for all.  Again, some are less evolved and advanced than us, but other species are far and away above us technologically, intellectually, and spiritually.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe they think they are alone because they can&#39;t cross that barrier either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certainly the case with some of them - yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>thinking we are alone because we haven&#39;t observed anything is nothing but hubris.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Agreed.  What’s even worse is that there’s tons of evidence that we have indeed made contact.  It’s just heavily suppressed.  This is a deep, <em>deep</em> prison planet we live in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We aren&#39;t that fucking smart.</p>

<p>To a significant extent, I wouldn’t disagree with this statement.</p>

<p>Why do the illuminati try so hard to convince children and naive that they exist?</p>

<p>Releasing the truth of ET existence on this planet would also necessarily release info about their means of propulsion, and that would do away with the multi <em>trillion</em> dollar (&quot;t&quot;, not &quot;m&quot; or even &quot;b&quot;) fossil fuel burning industry.</p>

<p>That would empower the people of this planet significantly more than TPTB are willing to allow.</p>

<p>It also keeps us locked in and sequestered, as it were, in a mental/psychological/emotional prison of sorts.  It keeps our minds trapped into the false thinking that we are alone in this universe when nothing in fact could be further from the truth.  An open mind is one of the first steps toward societal liberation, and, again, TPTB don&#39;t want any of that for the 99%.  They want to make sure that we stay nice and closed off to the reality of the outside world/planet/solar system/galaxy/universe.</p>

<p>We are a slave species on this planet.  TPTB want to make sure and keep it that way.</p>

<p>You did not give a single piece of evidence, much less verifiable.<br/>
You divert from the lack of evidence by referencing some names found in the web of disinfo that propagate more unverifiable &quot;data&quot;.</p>

<p>Go ahead and prove me wrong, make History and present the best piece of evidence that supports your claim that aliens &amp; co. exist.<br/>
No, The Disclosure Project is not evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><h1><strong>UFOs &amp; Co, like most illuminati cover-ups, are multi-purpose weapons</strong></h1>

<p>Step 1. - Their mass media serves just as much UFO stuff as needed:<br/>
- to keep the naive wasting their time on the subject;<br/>
- while letting the less naive understand it&#39;s a cheap forgery.</p>

<p>Step 2. - To confuse the less naive the illuminati use agents that are in charge of propagating certain facts that don&#39;t make it to the mass media but nevertheless are quite obvious, adding to those facts a good dosage of UFO &amp; Co stuff. This has the effect to discredit those obvious facts in the eyes of the less naive.</p>

<p>Step 3. - When the less naive read these kind of stories, that any person able to add and multiply understand, once again the illuminati agents suggest that the authors must be UFO believers. Again this proves to be a very efficient weapon in keeping the less naive from understanding these simple facts.</p>

<p>Or, if we apply occam&#39;s razor and avoid introducing new postulates, is exactly what it seems: a classified air force research and testing facility generated a fascination on the part of the public and this became a cultural phenomenon with many people inventing whole narratives to &quot;explain&quot; the cultural phenomenon, others believing or at least claiming to experience evidence to support these narratives and still others swooping in to profit from the phenomenon.</p>
