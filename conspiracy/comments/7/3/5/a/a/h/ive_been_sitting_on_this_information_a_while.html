       This happened in 2013, I haven't posted anything about it until now because it's personal to me and honestly I feel somewhat endangered by posting it (Is it safe to be posting stuff like this?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, here goes.

       Nick was actually a good friend of mine. To my knowledge, he was not a drug dealer (if he was, it would come as a huge shock to me). He didn't drink, do drugs, or smoke cigarettes. But he did love talking about conspiracies (He liked talking about the NWO in particular). He was the first person who turned me on to this world and got me thinking. Now he's dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       To this day, I don't know what the motive was for killing him. I don't understand what threat he posed, but I guess he must have known something.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't find any drugs on him because he didn't take drugs. As of now, there have been no firings or prison time for his murderers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of the reason I haven't posted this is because I don't want to insult his memory, but I think it's time and I think he would approve.

       You bring up a good point, why would they murder him? What could he have possibly known? I mean, I have been schlepping through crazy conspiracy stuff for decades, and at best I'm a comedic footnote on some knuckle dragger tptb middle manager's loser file.

       Only one thing I can think of, and that is DC's most favorite recreational activity. I don't want to disrespect your friend's memory either, but there are only a handful of things a kid could be involved in that could prove fatal.

       This seems more like a wrong place, wrong time, type thing, and they killed him because it was the simplest thing to do.

       Sounds more like a drug dealer got narced out by one of his buddies.  The Cops showed up and people started swallowing bags of Drugs(this is standard to Drug Dealers/Mules).  Maybe this kid didn't swallow anything but the Cops probably thought they did so they tried digging around in his mouth and probably intended on forcing him to vomit.  The injuries probably came from a finger, or a small flashlight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way Dealing Drugs is a good way to get they Cops to come and kick your door in, and once you get those dudes fired up they are going start busting ass for little to no reason.  You've seen the videos and heard other stories about excessive force and brutality right? So I'm not really surprised this happen or think it's out of the ordinary.

       Can you read?  I never say that in my comment.  My point is how Cops using excessive force and killing someone a Conspiracy or even out of the ordinary?  They aren't trying to silence people who know too much, Cops kill people for little to no reason all the time.

       How are you even quantifying the outrage between the white woman on a plane and a black man in a car? They both got covered in the news. They're both conducted themselves poorly, they both got manhandled by the police.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't move the goal posts from police behavior to perceived public outrage. Media coverage
       <del>

       public opinion.

      <p>
       On the whole, statistics show that African Americans are more than twice as likely to commit violent crimes, and it's because of their pervasive criminal culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Racist cops don't make them commit 52% of Homicides despite only accounting for 13% of the population.

       Really- it's racially skewed police reporting that has Black people (13% of the population) accounting for 54% of the violent crime in America? Numbers inflated to four times their population segment just flying under the radar, being reported for 6 years under Eric Holder's justice department...and Obama couldn't pass
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       legislation to stop it?

       You know why there haven't been any city-ruining riots about police brutality in the past 6 months? Because body cams started rolling out and facts started being part of the conversation.

       Well that wasn't a racist BLM riot obviously because the kid was shite. BLM is spreading racist propaganda. Black people are killed exactly proportionately to the amount of crime they commit. I like criminals to be culpable for their detriment to society no matter what race they are. You're willfully denying reality.

       because the laws they choose to enforce are unjust ones and have no semblance of proper morality and have backings mainly in big business.
      </p>
      <p>
       the laws they choose not to enforce are committed by big business.
      </p>
      <p>
       not only are these laws harder to prosecute because of the levels of corporate security (I know I know, not on the internet but access control to information is always a big thing physically for years), and the high level of power of these individuals make it difficult under our system.

       Standard police procedure it sounds like, in juvenile informant/sting ops which usually either target the completely innocent or the mentally disabled(not saying your friend was). This is the real conspiracy, that this shit can just happen with no recourse. The banality of evil is what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Years ago(in the 90s), I told my mom about a friend I had in 10th grade who sometimes sold weed on the bus, he was the guidance counselor's son! So, my mom being naive(like reallllly) told our neighbor lady about it in passing. Well, her husband was a deputy sherriff so the put a fucking sting on me. One afternoon I was taking a nap and a lady cop showed up at my door asking my mom if I could talk about it - long story short after several weeks and more escalation, with them demanding I give them a list of some sort of other drug dealers  - I couldn't produce one ofc, I was a new kid in town and regardless I wouldn't have, talk about trouble! - and threatening my mom as well, she broke down one day and started screaming over the phone to them to lay the fuck off...they did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I can fully imagine in this day and age it going a bit differently, like something that happened to your friend. And my parents wouldn't have been able to afford to do anything about it. They'll shoot you in the street like a fucking dog, or just cut your trachea out if they're unsuccessful in their initial barrage so you can't testify against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They entrap children now, they camp out in schools and make up shit to arrest people for(drug trafficking) when they're not camping out on skid row making up shit to arrest the mentally ill adults for(terrorism). It's extremely fucked up and no one will stand up to it because everyone's terrified of being locked up themselves.

       That happened to a guy with autism, some undercover cop pretended to be his friend and forced him to buy weed for him. He didn't know anyone who sold weed so he asked around. He had no friends so he wanted one so bad he went through lengths to get his new friend soon bud. So finally he got hold of a 0.4g bag. The cop busted him and the news over reacted by reporting a 'Huge Drug Empire Sting at High school' headline. Fuck the police and government

       you are wrong, but ok.  if you want to look at it that way then each precinct is a different gang with different leaders.  they have different cultures &amp; different policies.  there are many places in America with police forces which are both positive &amp; noncontroversially supported by the community.  assholes like yourself are contributing to the problem, not doing anything to help it

       Well, post what he knew or his death will be in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone is worried about knowing roo much, make a bunch of social media accounts, post what you know (try not to slander) and tell everyone you know in real life and on the internet to spread your message if killed.  If he was whacked, the information he knew must be very important and widely unknown. There are too many of us that know now to take action against random truthers
