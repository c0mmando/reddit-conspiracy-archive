       There are a few things that seem odd about msm's reporting of this. I am prob rehashing a lot of what has already been said, but shills on here seem to dilute it all. Here are a few points I hope will add to a larger discussion:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) No motivation for the shooter. Wealthy retired guy with no history of criminality or fringe religious/political beliefs goes bonkers, yet in all news coverage I have seen, not one mention of terrorism. Very odd for US media. All I hear is ISIS did not do this and calls for more gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) No security footage of him entering hotel room with 10+ rifles. This seems like an easy find. Msm can show us footage of chemical weapons used on children in Syria and US soldiers liberating Iraq with no delay but you cant get the hotel cams of him walking into the hotel lobby in Vegas?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Gf's ID found in room, but she is out of the country. Didn't she need her ID to leave the US? Nope, none of that, only that she is completely innocent. I am not saying she is guilty, but it seems like something someone should clarify.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole thing is suspect to me because usually crazy people show some indicators of being crazy. Furthermore, if he had hit hard times due to gambling debts the typical response is suicide not mass homicide. Why would a normal well-off guy with no history of warnng signs do this?

       1) Light travels faster than sound. BUT Cadence is spot on.

       2) Most casinos have some windows that open &amp; close.

       Some say that strobe light is still flashing today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever been in a building that had fire strobes? It was said that he set off the fire alarm. Perhaps those systems were linked. Either way, that light was seen flashing for some time after the event as well..

       This is social engineering. Country music is a stronghold of second amendment rights. This is a problem for TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fans of this band are perhaps now more likely to support more gun control as a result of this guy's new postion . These fans will also  transmit those ideas to their peers. The stronghold will be weakened a bit. Advantage globalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is funny to say maybe the shooter really just hated country music. I do too, lol. But, this statement from the artist says a lot I think.

       He's a dumb ass for thinking and saying what he said.  If everyone were armed, then what happened last night wouldn't have happened.  That shooter - whoever it might have been - would have been dead long before what happened happened.

       What bullshit. No one knew where the shooter was coming from, and you want to have people shooting at where they
       <em>

       the shooter is? Not to mention a pistol shooting a protected vantage point 32 stories up is not going to be effective and would just create a target.

       Would everyone in the crowd just start wildly firing at the hotel?

       I mean just what I said above.  If everyone were armed, a fraction of the reported attacks simply wouldn't take place.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attack that took place in Vegas very well may still have happened.  That one may have occurred anyway or slipped through the cracks, as it were.  However, I (again) absolutely, 100% guarantee that a vast majority of all the other attacks we read about simply wouldn't occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does all that have to do with this one?
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, you get any would be "crazy" assassin that had previous plans to "pick off innocent bystanders" and you suddenly put him/her in a country where 75%-95% of would be crazy assassins were stopped dead (and I mean dead) in the tracks of their potential attack because they got shot down by surrounding citizens where
       <em>
        NO ONE
       </em>
       was "easy pickings" and
       <em>
        NO ONE
       </em>
       was "an innocent bystander", and I guarantee you that almost every single one of those would be attackers would simply say "Uh...on second thought." and not to it.

       Yeah, yeah.  Of course there are the "suicide by cop" types that actually
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to get gunned down down in that very way, but the point is that absolutely MOST of those attackers
       <del>
        would think twice
       </del>
       simply wouldn't go through with it...and if they still did?  90% of them would get shot down in their tracks by surrounding citizens before they got too far at all and did more damage to surrounding citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       On one level, it can be said that what I just stated obviously wouldn't apply to the Las Vegas gun man.  One could say that this one would be one of the %5 that got through.  That's still a massive improvement on the body count of "crazed shooters" in this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand though, I also guarantee you that at least a
       <em>
        few
       </em>
       hotel goer neighbors heard the gun shots from the hotel room.  I also guarantee you that enough armed people would have likely gone in there and shot whoever was in there dead before they got too far in their body count stacking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, an armed citizenry = far less shootings and violent crimes in a country.

       Because you’re not thinking correctly.  That’s not the scenario’s fault or reality’s fault.  That’s yours.

       You’re for some reason (perhaps because it makes your non argument have a little bit more steam maybe) perpetrating a false equivalency fallacy by attempting to equate the shooting that took place in Las Vegas with the vast majority of shootings that otherwise take place in the country - i.e. a lone gunman in the street with one intended victim or no more than two or three.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is far different than what you’re attempting to paint up.

       Again, your sole refutation is referring to an incident that is about as far from the norm as can be.  This is the definition of cherry picking to suit your personal bias and non-argument.

       You’re…not too smart, are you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know why I’m going to attempt to reiterate this because you were obviously oblivious to it the first time and it apparently flew right over your head then, but I’ll try one last time:  The fact is that if every would-be perpetrator knew that every would-be victim were in fact armed and dangerous, there would be almost no would-be perpetrators.  Period.  Point blank.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don’t get that truth, that fact, that reality…then I simply can’t help you.  Conversation’s over.

       He was known to be anti-trump and attended anti-trump protests. Supposedly there was antifa literature found in his hotel room. Also ISIS has claimed responsibility, claiming he was a converted muslim. But i think they're just saying that. Also you dont need your license to leave the country

       My larger point was it seems odd for msm to glance over foreign influence in this scenario. I feel like in most of these stories the press latches onto "He spent time in XYZ country", and in this case they clear her name right away.

       Its been mentioned many times in other threads. Here's a video that supposedly shows him and his wife at a anti-trump protest from a few months ago.

       But Why bring your drivers license, its not valid anywhere but the us

       My point i was getting at is that MSM didnt glance over foreign influence. Like i said they're saying ISIS is claiming responsibility and that he was a recent convert to islam. You dont need to go to a different country to be exposed to radical islamic ideoligies

       I thought is was apparent in my post that I believe the msm is a lie. Another part of my post is that msm DOES NOT implicate isis. You suggested the msm does do this, and that they found antifa lit in his room.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was interesting to me and others and you were asked to provide sources of msm saying this. You failed.

       All you showed was
       <a href="http://www.americasfreedomfighters.com">

       and it sucked. So, I think you lost what the discussion is about.

       Yeah, that is the big mystery right now.

       I wouldn't expect them to release it while it is still under investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, someone hauling around pelican cases isn't suspicious at all in a hotel especially in a place like vegas where there are expos and all kinds of business things going on all the time there. He would need 4-5 cases like this -

       Or maybe he just threw them all into a giant duffel bag, I have a duffel bag that you could put a bunch of guns in no problem.

       Pelican cases wouldn't look suspicious to a maid either.

       I don't get that either. Why even mention that detail of the investigation regardless?

       What I am saying is that with most crimes, especially lately, there is a security cam vid of the perpetrator playing while the news anchor explains what happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of every Eyewitness News story. "Did this man yada yada yada.. ", while a black and white IP cam shows the creepy suspect on film.

       Michael Savage just interviewed the "shooters" neighbor who happens to be ex-military. Neighbor said he couldn't believe this guy was the shooter, knew him very well, was never one to talk politics or be extreme when they chatted weekly over beers.

       It's fishy, but nothing yet discredits the official story on its own. While the cam footage of him carrying all those weapons in the room wood be nice, it's absence doesn't necessarily prove anything, neither does the maids not seeing any weapons. His motive could be gaming losses. The lower flash appears to be unrelated. Fishy but not impossible

       This is what sticks out to me. It's an MGM players card. As an MGM employee we are not allowed to let anyone use a players card that does not match up with their ID. If she really was out of the country, there would be no need for this man to have her players card.

       Aren't those the ones that you just stick into the slot machine and it tracks your gambling? Not to say it isn't a violation of ToS but is there really anything preventing him from using the card while he is gambling?

       After a few decades of living in this world, you develop a sixth sense for sensing patterns, blatant bullshit and probability (especially if you happen to have a brain that was geared towards these to begin with).
       <br/>
       These frequent killings of groups of random innocent people simply aren't possible.
       <br/>
       People in the U.S. -- if they're actually going to arrive at a point where they're willing to kill a group of people -- are many thousand times more likely to kill a person a group of people who they feel engaged in injustice against them or people they know or care about.
       <br/>
       If these random mass killings were legitimate, there would simultaneously be many thousand times more killings &amp; bombings of politicians, CEO's, bosses in meetings, malpractice doctors, churches involved in molestation, police departments, etc.
       <br/>
       Killings of random people in at schools, movie theatres, restaurants would be essentially non-existent in comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if the CIA were staging events to scare people in to believing that they're not safe anywhere, and that police state expansion and support of the military invasions is needed to keep them safe, well, then what we're currently seeing is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what you'd expect to see.

       Dont jump to accusing commenterd as shills.  They're just not as worried about the consequences of them being wrong as we are.  I feel its worth digging into any lead just leave your left/right paradigms at the door and hope most of the time you're wrong.

       If you're correct its much more terrifying then any left/right/religious  motive.  Not enough right now to prove anything conclusively but the circumstances are starting to smell real bad...like fish..a fishy like smell.. I hope you're wrong.  Truely afraid you're not.

       He's not wrong.  TPTB are not here for the masses.  They're here to, among other things, terrorize us into abject servitude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be scared though.  The key is for all of us to come together as one united species - which is what we in fact all are - and stand up against them TOGETHER.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we remain apart, then it's easy for them to continue fucking with us and killing us as they've continued doing for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we come together, band together, and stand up as one against them, however - putting all the bullshit racism and indoctrinated hate completely aside as the manipulative psyop that it is - then we would be able to do away with their manipulation in a heart beat.  They can't stand up to all of us being together.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we remain apart, then you
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       be scared.  Be very scared because we are easy to continue being taken advantage of - as we have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we unite, however, there is absolutely no reason to be afraid because we are much,
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       stronger together than they could ever be.

       Recently from observation it appears we are more divided then ever so i guess thats what scares me.  People are too bought into societal norms, MSM narratives and a pre built agendas they can latch onto.

       I agree. It seems like everyone grabs their own partisan narrative about this and let's it fly away into blaming it on either the dems or the gop.

       The elite win when we are divided and unfortunately this polarization has us all opt for safety rather than addressing the real problem . I worry we are headed for dark times. I hope the people can stay woke.

       Yes.  It certainly appears so.  I wouldn’t disagree with this.  This fact doesn’t mean what I said above is any less true, however.

      <p>
       Yes.  You are correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what, however?  The very thing you’re rightfully afraid of is the EXACT reason why right now is actually one of the absolute best, most clear opportunities that we have had as a society in the past I don’t know how many generations (if
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       in recent history, as a matter of fact) to stop and actually be able to SEE how it is that our coming together as one people is in fact the best thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was any time in our history where it’s most obvious where coming together is the best option against the forces standing against us…it’s
       <em>
        right now
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       We are seeing before our very eyes just how ignorant and destructive is hate and racism and how easy these maladies keep us from being united and standing up against the manipulation around us.  There is no time more obvious to see just how moronic separation is than now actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d say that now in the midst of all this seeming chaos is the time that we are presented with the best opportunity and illustration for why we SHOULD absolutely come together.

       And an event like this one, as well as all the other bullshit events that have taken place in the recent past - regardless of whether they were false flags, orchestrated psyops, actual, organic terror events (unlikely), or whatever - provide us with great reasons as to why the left right paradigm is in fact nothing but complete bullshit and is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       working.  Neither one has gotten it right, and more and more of us need to be seeing just how wrong both sides are.

       But fuck it.  Bring it on.

       I’m either going to overcome it, or I’m going to die trying.  There isn’t any in between or quitting or giving up on spreading this feeling that I have - this truth that I feel - that we are all

       Realize that the vast majority of everything you've ever been told and taught by the establishment is a lie.  Certainly not easy to do.  Certainly not easy to come to that realization - and even more difficult still to stick with it and look at it straight in the eye if and when you actually
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       find yourself confronted with the fact that your (our) whole life for the most part has been a lie perpetuated on top of a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, if one just so happens to be strong enough to realize that we are in fact all one, and also happens to be strong enough to continue saying it and
       <em>
        being
       </em>
       it to one and all regardless of who might disagree, then there's a possibility that this truth might catch on - and if it catches on and refuses to die and go away, then TPTB will not be able to manipulate the masses as easily if at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not nearly as easily done as said.  This I know.  However, the truth is there all the same.  The power in unity is not a lie - not a fabrication.

       How can I ever unite with people who stand up for foreign muslims over their fellow Americans?  They stand up for illegal aliens.  They are anti 1st and 2nd Amendment.

       You must understand what I'm saying. You were transplanted here from Europe because your ancestors sought a better life. We have always afforded this same opportunity to the rest of the world because that is what makes America great.

       I don't disagree with that. But you do realize there are many Arab people living here in your country. Going to work, paying taxes, even serving in Congress. Justin Amash is one of the few pols I like. He is an Arab and a member of the liberty party.

       This is a terrific post. The thing that always gets me about these incidents is the seemingly randomness of the targets. Even someone with some mental illness would have some rationale for their selected targets. It's always regular people, doing regular things, enjoying themselves.

       Not saying I disagree with you, I just don't know the answer to this question. What would be the motivation to expand the police state? If a ruling class really is capable of pulling these kinds of events off, they've already got enough money and enough power to do what ever they want. Why would the government want to take away our pistols and rifles when they're pioneering weapons far deadlier and more precise than the nuclear weapons of WWII. Even for some crazy, evil ruling class what is the point of doing all this. Seems like they've already got everything they could want.

       It really lies in the small amount of information we know about this guy.  The profile does not fit the act commited...it just doesnt.  Guy has combined 42 guns between site and home.  Well off retiree with no military training or real obvious/strong political activisim and no strong religous involvement collects the weapons and meticulously planned this for what .. he hates the left...he's on some sort of jihad.

       In response: 
1.) Without political/religious motivation there is no "terrorism" by definition. As for ISIS, I think the whole mid 60s, white guy, from Nevada blew that theory out of the water.
2.) Weapons can be concealed. Also, the incident is under investigation and any security footage in possession of the police. We may get to see it AFTER an investigation (maybe).
3.) She is traveling abroad. Most likely with a passport. I would assume the ID they found was a Driver's license/ID card. Why the alleged shooter had it is anybodies guess.

       I don't have anything for point 1 but for the other two points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can't you disassemble and reassemble those weapons. If anything he could have easily hid them in his luggage, even if they weren't disassembled. As a hotel staff member, we don't check a guests luggage, and it isn't usual for a guest to have multiple bags of luggage, especially if they're staying multiple nights.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like this seems to be the case because housekeeping didn't report anything suspicious. Usually housekeeping will report immediately if there are fire arms in the rooms and even wont service them. (At my property, we actually store guests rifles) im unsure of what they do in Vegas.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video footage of him in the hotel may take a while before they release it because they're still investigating. He had been in the hotel for multiple nights, so it has to be hours of video footage they have to go through. It'd be easier if he had only been there like two or so nights, so they'd have only two days to go through, but i believe he was there for at least four nights. They may not release any video footage until they look thru it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GF must have used her passport to leave the country, and may have left her belongings with the shooter because she was coming back or maybe left in a hurry. Its all up in the air at this point. We are barely getting to the 24hr mark. The sad thing is people are already pushing their agendas instead of getting more help to the victims. Not surprising but very disappointing.

       We have security cameras here at my property (watching them rn) and only management is allowed to save recordings and whatnot. It may be that airports are public property, but hotels are private property, also there's the difference between audio &amp; video. I think it may be a privacy concern, and perhaps they need to censor the individuals in the video in order to avoid lawsuits.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may seem small in comparison to everything that's going on but I don't think too many people would be keen on being showed on national television. Of course, this is all speculation, so don't take it to heart. It is just some food for thought. We will probably get the security footage, but only after they're finished with what they need to get done.

       My conspiracy theory is way different. Who have we been fighting proxy wars with for decades? What country has been infiltrating America's election, social media, and cyber security? What country is run by a KGB oligarch that controls the media and kills his enemies? What country takes pride in their ability to cheat they system and get away with it? To commit horrific acts and get away with it? Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know. Russia is a nothing-burger. The piss dossier, the constant Fake News on Russia, the shills that are all over every social media platform, and the populist presidents followers that feel the constant need to defend Trump and call the Russian investigation crap. Now, a good portion of the country automatically hears "Russia" and thinks it's a joke and they don't take it seriously. But here is my thing:
      </p>
      <p>
       A conspiracy needs as few people as possible to be involved and the ones who are involved have to really be loyal. Putin will kill and jail people. The KGB had pulled off insane shit, like the switching of the urine to pass doping test. If they can pull off all the other crazy shit they have, why couldn't they make a patsy? I don't trust the government, but ours is so large that while they may be able to divide and conquer by running on the same platforms forever, there are too many of them to be able to keep up with it all. Do I think the 1% are up to no good and would love to beef up security and have the citizens have less access to weapons for when the shit finally hits the fan and they want a fighting chance? Of course. But who would love even more to have less Americans own guns? Probably a country that wants to destabilize us and other countries, have us start a World War, and then know they had a chance to Red Dawn us on our own soil while US troops are busy fighting somewhere else. Unfortunately, Americans believe that no one would ever be able to attack us at home and most of them don't know or have forgotten that we have been fighting Russia forever in various ways. I have other ideas, but I totally think they have a better chance of setting this whole thing up than the FBI does.

       The KGB is the original deep state. Lee Harvey Oswald was in Russia for a few years before the shooting and married a Russian woman. Russia and 9/11? Well, they have proven they don't mind taking down planes with civilians inside of them. Who is in OPEC with them? You think Russia doesn't have middle eastern ties? You think our deep state won't cover up attacks by Russians on our soil? If it did turn out the Russians had something to do with this, do you think we would be told? Hell no. They don't want Americans calling for war with Russia. Just a theory. I suggest reading the list of inmates at ADX Florence and you will see that spies for Russia are locked up with violent terrorist, at least one of which was a known test subject for MK Ultra and a "lone wolf".

       Lack of photos/videos from social media like instagram. I saw more personal posts of the Fyre Fest fiasco than this.

       Also the overall lack of blood. There's even a blood stained wheelbarrow. Where did a wheelbarrow come from?

       I also wonder how he was able to break the hotel windows. That's not an easy feat. It has to be structural glass several inches thick.

       1) It happened a little less than 24 hours ago, investigators are still likely combing through every detail and there is likely a wealth of information being held back from the public. If, in a few weeks, a motive is still not detectable, then this concern becomes more legitimate. Its not the plot of a hollywood thriller that one can immediately check wikipedia on a confusing detail when it arises.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I am sure there is footage and this is being combed over by investigators. Again in the coming weeks this will likely be released and if it isn't then we can query why. Also just a quick note. I am sure he wasn't skipping down the corridors with his m-16s or whatever in plain view, they would have likely been concealed ina suitcase or bag.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) No his GFs gambling ID was found in the room, not her passport. I am sure that you don't need the former to travel internationally.
      </p>

       I mean what you have done here is start with the premise that something is afoot and continued to try and present some shaky 'evidence' to back up this premise.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not one of those people who believe that it is unheard of for the government or a hidden interest group to initiate some deadly attack in order to scare a population into submission, we all know that happens. What I find confusing is that some people seem to think that this is THE ONLY thing that happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, we all accept that it is likely for some little asian pot smoker in a western country somewhere to realize the meaningless and futility of life, decide to go out with a bang and get famous and try to murder as many people as possible - all whilst trying to legitimize it under a label of a religion that they previously didnt care for nor really understood.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why is it beyond many of you that sometimes, maybe sometimes, some white guy somewhere flips, decides to go out with a bang and murder a bunch of people so that at least his name lives beyond his life? Why is this so impossible? The government, whilst no doubt behind some shady and evil stuff, isn't responsible for everything?

       Its not math, it doesn't have to add up.  The government isn't going to realese that stuff in a timely manner.  It doesn't do them any good to show how easily the veneer of civilization can be shattered.

         There are hints that the shooter might have been distraught over gambling losses, but it's too soon to tell. We don't know why.
