        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Stephen Paddock wasn&#39;t the shooter.</p>

<p>Why do we believe he was? Because that&#39;s what LVMPD says? Do we have any other evidence? Photos? Video? Motive?</p>

<p>No, we don&#39;t. We have the LVMPD&#39;s word that they found him in that room. That doesn&#39;t mean he was the shooter.</p>

<p>Paddock is a 60-year old retired dude. Filipino girlfriend who sends cookies to his mo. Texts his brother funny photos of his gambling winnings. Recently bought a new home in Mesquite - obviously ready to enjoy his retirement. Plays slots, poker. Not a single run-in with the cops. In 60 years.</p>

<p>This guy obviously was not the shooter. It is so obvious.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t just lap up what the media says. What the LVMPD says. You think they&#39;re going to come out and say he wasn&#39;t the shooter and that they never caught the shooter.</p>

<p>What happened is he was in the room when they got there. They blew down the door after he wouldn&#39;t open. Smoke cleared, he was dead. Shot himself.</p>

<p>So they said he was the shooter, because that&#39;s when the shooting stopped. The swept the room, sure, but whoever was behind this had a plan. They knew exactly what would happen after they&#39;d been shooting a while. The cops would come up the stairs of the hotel. There are only a few staircase, and it would be easy to monitor them. They had a plan - we don&#39;t know what it is, but they left Paddock in that room and shot him when the cops knocked. Then they disappeared (perhaps to the next room over).</p>

<p>We have no testimony from any of the dozens of people staying in that hallway. None from the rooms next door, for whom the shooting would have been incredibly loud. No, it took the cops more than an hour to find this guy, because whoever was planning this had much of the floor rented out. It&#39;s so obvious.</p>

<p>Paddock rented a room to spend the weekend in Las Vegas while his girlfriend was out of town. To gamble, fool around. Like one does in Vegas. He picked the wrong floor - whoever was behind this shooting knew that room would be occupied by a stranger, and they barged in around 8pm, tied him up, set up, and started shooting. When the cops were halfway up the hotel, they went to the other rooms on the floor and told the cops they know nothing - that they were scared for their lives, they don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, etc. etc. The cops come to the room they&#39;d identified as the shooter&#39;s lair, barge in, and Paddock is dead - supposedly shot himself.</p>

<p>No, he didn&#39;t shoot himself. They shot him and pinned the whole thing on an obviously innocent man.</p>

<p>They got away with murder, literally.</p>

<p>Anyone can see this. Don&#39;t try to bend over backwards to make sense of this guy&#39;s motives. There are none.</p>

<p>Frankly, they kinda screwed up, Paddock being the one to rent that room. He&#39;s so clean. So squeaky clean. They risk getting exposed. Too bad it wasn&#39;t some Saudi gambler, some black drug lord, some crazed right-winger.</p>

<p>No. It was squeaky clean Stephen Paddock. An obviously innocent man that, deep down, we all know is innocent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, he&#39;s dead. LVMPD found him dead and named him the shooter, though they never actually saw him shoot anyone. He was simply in the room, dead, by a shot to the head, when they walked in.</p>

<p>Lazy policing. Of course this came up during LVMPD meetings today, but what are they going to do, say that they actually didn&#39;t get the shooter and that they don&#39;t know who or where the real shooter is? No way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll bet the real story is that someone else on the floor was the shooter, and they staked out the hotel to know when the cops would show up. They used his room, shot up the crowd, then shot him when the cops were close. Went to their other room(s) and pretended like they knew nothing.</p>

<p>Poor Paddock was set up. Just rented a room for the weekend while  his girlfriend was gone. Now the face of hate?</p>

<p>We shouldn&#39;t just eat up the media&#39;s narrative. It&#39;s not fair to Paddock until we know the whole story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. We have no evidence. We have literally no evidence that Paddock was the shooter. We may not have evidence in other cases, save for the cops&#39; word, but in those cases the shooter is insane, has a history of criminal activity, left some manifesto, bigoted against white/black/gay/Muslim. In this case, we have a totally normal, decent guy that we&#39;re supposed to believe killed 60 people.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t have to believe that just because we&#39;re told.</p>

<p>The cops have access to forensic evidence. I&#39;ll believe that when I see it. But for now, I&#39;m not going to believe this absurd story. So yes, I&#39;ll believe my ideas, until I see the evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course. But you can&#39;t believe forensic evidence over me if you haven&#39;t seen said forensic evidence. I&#39;m explaining why I think this story is absurd, and what I think is a far more likely scenario.</p>

<p>To put it very simply, I believe someone killed Paddock and was using his room to shoot, and escaped before the cops arrived.</p>

What we are being told happened seems much more logical. You have no idea what was going on inside his head or life at the end of the day. If what you say happened then the dude who killed paddock had to them get all the guns he had in there after that, and set up that room. So it&#39;s like, I doubt that happened </p>

And also,  considering he isn&#39;t military,  how did he modify these guns on his own?

<p>PLUS,  he built platforms as well? </p>

<p>But I welcome your comments. What I DON&#39;T welcome are people who&#39;s argument amounts to: &quot;But the official story is different, and they are cops and they must know more than me.&quot; Because if there&#39;s anything clear here, it&#39;s that the cops have presented no evidence he was the shooter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you think that casino is canvased in thousands of security cameras? It&#39;s very easy to debunk this totally unfounded theory of your and I&#39;m sure the FBI already has. You&#39;re also deciding that Paddock is squeaky clean based on nothing. Everything we know about him right now is based off what family and neighbors say. People who have an incentive to say there was nothing amiss about him. Think about it, who would say, &quot;I knew he was deranged&quot; if you were someone who had the potential to stop him. That&#39;s a recipe for death threats. And millionaires can be deranged too. Psychopaths are often very charming and successful in business. Also, this guy&#39;s father was a psychopath and we know that can have a genetic component. My sense is that you want this to be a conspiracy because, yeah, it&#39;s more interesting to think that the illuminati or whoever is behind this. But you&#39;re coming of as fanatical by taking an opinion based on no evidence, deciding it&#39;s &quot;obvious&quot; and running with it. </p>

<p>Sheriff Lombardo said that Mr. Paddock fired through his hotel room door at security guards, striking one in the leg. The guard is still alive, he said. SWAT officers went in after the guard was shot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except for the fact that the first officer on scene was shot. They then called swat to come help. If he&#39;s not in this room and shot the cop, who did?  Someone who happened to also put 30 guns at his house?
You conspiracy guys are funny sometimes but this is sad. 
It doesn&#39;t help any of the victims when you throw around nonsense. He did the shooting. He&#39;s a piece of shit. The government isn&#39;t covering anything up. They didn&#39;t when Obama was president and they aren&#39;t now that trump is president. 
There&#39;s crazies. We need to keep crazies from getting guns. Until we get that done there will be more of these shooting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly have no idea. I&#39;ve been thinking about why you would do something so heinous and I can&#39;t figure it out. 
My guesses would be: dying and wanted to go down in history. Had been a recent convert to some crazy religion.  Maybe he had A massive debt problem and some massive gambling loses and just decided this was what he wanted to do and he lost his mind and did this. 
We might never know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. Where is the hotel footage from the lobby and hallway(s)? I Googled to see if anything had shown up today and found tons of hotel surveillance of some girl in NY that died in the hotel freezer last week, but not a single thing in this. I am a rational person that isn&#39;t big on conspiracy theories, but things don&#39;t add up here.</p>
