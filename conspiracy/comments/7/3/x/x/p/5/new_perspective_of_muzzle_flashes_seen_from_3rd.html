       A lot of people were skeptical of the other videos showing muzzle flashes because of the poor quality. Heres a better angle that was taken by a taxi driver i believe

       . It's good 720p so it can be worked with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind you need to download the video and slow it down to see this. I found 20% speed enough for the quickest events.
      </p>
      <p>
       32 seconds: shooting sounds stop
      </p>
      <p>
       34 seconds: the strobing light is still flashing when camera pans away.
      </p>
      <p>
       38 seconds: quick pan over the source, light strobes
      </p>
      <p>
       40 seconds: quick pan over the source, light strobes
      </p>
      <p>
       42 seconds: very quick pan, blur of light at source
      </p>
      <p>
       45 seconds: quick pan, light strobes

      <p>
       46 seconds: quick pan, light strobes

       49 seconds: very quick pan, blur of light at source
      </p>
      <p>
       49.5 seconds: shooting sounds begin again and video pans away until the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       The light can be seen strobing for approximately 17 seconds with no shooting sounds.

       Please explain any logical reason there would be a strobe light at the window of a hotel room, with the lights off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen this mentioned many times, but never a reason why this makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm more inclined to believe this is a false flag
       <em>
        because
       </em>
       people keep using strobe lights as a
       <em>
        perfectly logical reason
       </em>
       to trust the official story. Because I simply can't imagine why someone would use one, in a hotel.

       I simply analyzed a video that has shooting and non shooting parts with the light source present. Anyone can duplicate my work easily. I don't have a hypothesis what it is. I'm pretty sure in my findings it is not a reflection or the shooting. If you have any counter arguments to how my analysis is incorrect please enlighten me.

       My computer died, so at the moment all I have is my Android phone.. I imagine you used VLC in order to slow things down, but to the best of my knowledge I simply don't have something capable of doing what you did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've watched many videos at this point, and there seems to be differences between how often/how many shots were fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, because things don't seem to sync up, I'm more skeptical of those that seem to have an agenda that simply backs up what mainstream media is saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I'll just have to wait to see if someone reproduces your claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I'm still waiting for a legitimate reason it is a strobe light or anything else that makes sense logically.

       Some of the videos seemed suspicious to me too. Which is why I analyzed it myself rather than rely on others to tell me what to believe. It's good you don't take me for my word and intend to replicate my findings when you have the opportunity. I used a modified media player classic, however VLC should be able to do the same. It's pretty clear in the slowdown, but you could probably get more specific time-frames for the sound looking at the waveform.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know much about sound relating to bullets, but I imagine 17 seconds is too far a spread(pure speculation). Also videos with 720p are hard to come by, if you have more I would be interested.

       Basic math, unless you're really far, or right up in the action (incredibly close, too close), a delay of about a half a second is about right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm glad you took the time to respond, in an authentic way.. there's far too many people, being far too active in too many places.. and none of them take the time to reply to criticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I'll say, since no main stream media is reporting the same news.. this is an obviously complicated thing to comment on.

      <p>
       I wish there was a megathread, a place that reported all the claims, but also pointed out what's total bullshit.

       It's interesting because Time magazine's video is the only video of that angle where they light is flashing at such an even pace &amp; for such a long time as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dan Bilzerian's twitter just posted a vid from his phone where it the cadence is not so even &amp; the sounds stop on cue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying Time Magazine is trying to feed establishment bullshit to people via a cheap After Effects edit.
On youtube a new video has come out from a different angle where the lights stop &amp; sound stops at the same approx time.

       Read the comments, people explain the delay, and it checks out. Of course others blame a reported strobe light as well..

       Anyone else think a random strobe light being by a window at a hotel is odd? I can't remember the last time I've seen one used at all out in public..

       So your reason that someone left a strobe light going in a dark and empty hotel room, is that people in Vegas party? Sounds like you're willing to dismiss something based on.. nothing.

       Well, I guess you can either dismiss something based off of nothing or attempt to confuse the currently known facts based upon the same nothing.

       It was going off on live TV last night after the shooting.

       I'm actually sad there isn't a megathread, because if we tracked what is confirmed, what is questionable, and what is complete bullshit.. it would make life easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hid something about an active shooter last night, dismissed it as something important, and woke up to absolutely crazy shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is so complicated, I don't trust anything that was said that early on. Even now, what actually happened doesn't seem consistent when you look at multiple media sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, I'm looking to the people trying to claim something is fake, to give a logical reason why their claim makes sense.

       Watched the video from the car.  My first thought was, "hmm it's too quiet to be coming from there."
      </p>
      <p>
       But you can see a reflection in the sidewindow, maybe it's quiet because the window is closed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The flash seems to match in the beginning but continues when there is no sound. The sound of the barrel firing would be the last thing you notice if this was a gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be a T.V, reflection of a T.V or a strobe light. It's Los Vegas.

       Even if there is a strobe light going on in this hotel, it baffles me that it wasn't shut off once they hear gunshots.

       . It's good 720p so it can be worked with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind you need to download the video and slow it down to see this. I found 20% speed enough for the quickest events.

       32 seconds: shooting sounds stop
      </p>
      <p>
       34 seconds: the strobing light is still flashing when camera pans away.
      </p>
      <p>
       38 seconds: quick pan over the source, light strobes
      </p>
      <p>
       40 seconds: quick pan over the source, light strobes
      </p>
      <p>
       42 seconds: very quick pan, blur of light at source
      </p>
      <p>
       45 seconds: quick pan, light strobes
      </p>
      <p>
       46 seconds: quick pan, light strobes
      </p>
      <p>
       49 seconds: very quick pan, blur of light at source
      </p>
      <p>
       49.5 seconds: shooting sounds begin again and video pans away until the end.
      </p>
      <p>
       The light can be seen strobing for approximately 17 seconds with no shooting sounds.

       I simply analyzed a video that has shooting and non shooting parts with the light source present. Anyone can duplicate my work easily. I don't have a hypothesis what it is. I'm pretty sure in my findings it is not a reflection or the shooting. If you have any counter arguments to how my analysis is incorrect please enlighten me.
