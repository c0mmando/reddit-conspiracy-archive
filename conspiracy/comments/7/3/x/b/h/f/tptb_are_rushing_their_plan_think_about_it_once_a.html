       They have a bunch of shit they still have to cram in before they orchestrate their economic/social collapse. More and more people wake up every day. And you can't UNWAKE people. Once that cat is out of the bag, you can't get it back in.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Some sort of gun control legislation, likely just a registration of firearms, so they know where every gun is in every house in the country for confiscation during the collapse. This is incredibly important as they cannot have their world order without a disarmed population. This entity is following the Mao, Stalin, Hitler model.
      </p>
      <p>
       -I think they need to "nudge" us toward embracing a single global currency, potentially via RFID chip implants. We recently saw them acclimating us to the chip concept a few months ago, when that company decided to have their workers implanted with chips.
      </p>
      <p>
       -More racial division and social tension needs to be created. People are still getting along too well. In crisis scenarios like an economic fallout, people tend to unite. They are trying to make sure that doesn't happen in advance, by brewing racial/gender/religious/political party tension between us.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Further militarization of the police is necessary as well, and not just militarization, but getting us to ACCEPT and DESIRE more of a  police presence for our "safety"
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a perfect catalyst for this collapse of society and this racial tension, and they are using him as a sock puppet to carry all of this crap out. I believe this was all planned in advance prior to the staged phony ass election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Expect more false flags. Expect more racial division and films/TV shows that encourage it. Expect more economic downfall and "terrorism", and expect more of your civil liberties to be taken away.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are acclimating is to "accept" this new surveillance state and police state as normal. Slow and steady wins the race, but their time is running out as the word of liberty and resistance spreads across the globe. Continue to resist.

       Ignore that guy. I suspect he gets paid to infiltrate this sub and try to confuse/extinguish discussion that is dangerous to TPTB. He seems to show up when we have 6,000+ users here...when the norm is like 1.5k.

       Perhaps the talk of the NWO kept their plans in check in 1989-1990.  Famous people often hear things we don't.  President Trump is a member of the World Wrestling Hall of Fame and CEO of the WWE is in the Administration.
