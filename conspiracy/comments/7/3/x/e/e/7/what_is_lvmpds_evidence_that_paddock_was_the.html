<p>Officials have found ammonium nitrate, a high-nitrogen fertiliser often used in homemade bombs, in the car of the Las Vegas mass shooter.</p>

<p>Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters the chemical compound was found in Stephen Paddock&#39;s car after he opened fire on concert-goers in Las Vegas, killing at least 59 and injuring more than 500.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll allow for the possibility that this guy actually was the shooter, and that there was some reason which drive him to commit this act.</p>

<p>However, there are just too many things which don’t add up:</p>

<ul>
<li>No discernible motive (at least not disclosed)</li>
<li>ISIS claims he converted and did it on their behalf (hardly believable)</li>
<li>Brother said he “wasn’t a gun guy” (10 or more rifles and ammo)</li>
<li>Brother said he was a millionaire (probably led a comfortable life)</li>
<li>The media (and others) keep claiming the venue was a target because it was country music (Republicans), but look at all those videos, it’s mostly 20-something’s which probably aren’t politically active or affiliated</li>
<li>Found “Antifa” literature (like who the hell brings Antifa literature to a hotel room where they plan to commit a mass shooting? Sounds a lot like finding hijacker passports on the ground below WTC)</li>

Why not barricade the door? ? ? ? </p>

Sure
Could the cameras have alerted the gunmen 
Sure
Could they have them shot “the lone wolf” calmly walked to the room next door?
Sure, why not?</p>

<p>Could his high priced call girl girl friend and him bit off more than they could handle, or could she have set him up to keep the money rolling in?</p>

<p>Sure - </p>
