       This guy seems squeaky clean. More likely someone was shooting from his room and killed him, than that he was the shooter himself.

       What's LVMPD's reason for saying he was the shooter?

       Bingo. How do we know he wasnt being held hostage and executed? How do we know he wasnt being forced to shoot and then executed? How is it that some nuts on a conspiracy forum can think of these questions but police and journalists cant?

       If it was another person setting this up that goes a little outside the norm of raving lunatics. Who would have a motive to set up such a thing? Who would want a human sacrifice in front of the pyramid?

       Forget the pyramid. And no one was standing there making him do this. He was simply renting the room when whoever was the shooter took the room over and killed him.

       Right, no one would notice a dead body on the ground in front of the hotel with 200 cops/swat covering every square inch of the place.

       Oh and PS all the other "dead bodies" were at the concert venue far across the street.

       This plan is relatively simple. Hijack a room and put everyone on this innocent guy's case. Seems to me the easiest part of the whole thing would be to have someone monitor for when cops get close, and then just go into another room on the floor. Literally just call it quits and walk over to another room.

       No. They simply jumped to conclusions with no evidence save for a dead body in the room. That proves exactly nothing about the shooter's identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       They know this now, after they said he was the shooter. But it's not like they can come out and say "Yeah, um, sorry we had the wrong guy. The real shooters are still out there somewhere."

       I'd like an actual count of how many guns were in his home, and whether it's truly an unreasonable amount of guns. No, I don't think anyone went so far as to stock his house with guns.

       I just reread your comment. There was a report of live monitoring equipment and its very possible hallways are not monitored by cameras. It will be interesting to see what evidence is made available to the public.

       You're right about the guns in his home. But I haven't read anything definitive about that. My uncle has tons of guns and tons of ammo - has shot his guns maybe twice. This guy could be the same.

        Officials have found ammonium nitrate, a high-nitrogen fertiliser often used in homemade bombs, in the car of the Las Vegas mass shooter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters the chemical compound was found in Stephen Paddock's car after he opened fire on concert-goers in Las Vegas, killing at least 59 and injuring more than 500.

       I’ll allow for the possibility that this guy actually was the shooter, and that there was some reason which drive him to commit this act.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there are just too many things which don’t add up:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        No discernible motive (at least not disclosed)
       </li>
       <li>
        ISIS claims he converted and did it on their behalf (hardly believable)
       </li>
       <li>
        Brother said he “wasn’t a gun guy” (10 or more rifles and ammo)
       </li>
       <li>
        Brother said he was a millionaire (probably led a comfortable life)
       </li>
       <li>
        The media (and others) keep claiming the venue was a target because it was country music (Republicans), but look at all those videos, it’s mostly 20-something’s which probably aren’t politically active or affiliated
       </li>
       <li>
        Found “Antifa” literature (like who the hell brings Antifa literature to a hotel room where they plan to commit a mass shooting? Sounds a lot like finding hijacker passports on the ground below WTC)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Nothing really adds up...

       My Favorite thing is “conspiracy nut” - 
Biggest hole I see is - the room had “video surveillance if the hall” this guys has some big guns and is some what ready..... 
built shooter plat forms-
Installed some cameras in the halls-
      </p>
      <p>
       ?????? Odd why not shoot the walls when the cameras pick up the cops in the hallway?
Why not barricade the door? ? ? ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible he is a Patsy 
Sure
Could the cameras have alerted the gunmen 
Sure
Could they have them shot “the lone wolf” calmly walked to the room next door?
Sure, why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could his high priced call girl girl friend and him bit off more than they could handle, or could she have set him up to keep the money rolling in?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure -
      </p>
      <p>
       Could he be a crazy fucker that snapped when he found out his girl friend was sucking off old fat rich cats for vacation money...
      </p>

        sure

       I was just about to post this same question. We don't know that the picture of the man they are showing everyone is the shooter. No one at the concert would know what the shooter looked like.
