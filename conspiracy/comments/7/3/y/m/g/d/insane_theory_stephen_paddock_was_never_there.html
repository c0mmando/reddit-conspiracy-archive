        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My crazy theory: He wasn&#39;t even there.</p>

<p>&quot;Dying&quot; was a perfect way for him to escape his gambling debts, and his lack of political/religious/ethnic affiliations made him a perfect scapegoat choice for the certain powers behind the scenes (because the follow up narrative is all about gun control instead of being clouded with debates about political party/religion/ethnicity). </p>

<p>So he exchanged his identity and reputation for a fresh start somewhere under a new name - that&#39;s why the media is only using that picture of him from 20 years ago; so he doesn&#39;t get recognized at his current age. </p>

<p>He was literally the <em>perfect</em> type of person to commit a mass shooting for the purpose of pushing gun control/increased &quot;security&quot; screenings/government control. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just too clean of a scenario. </p>

<p>There&#39;s the fact that his record was spotless before this, the fact that there were so many weapons, that they were all snuck up to the room somehow, and that his girlfriend was coincidentally out of the country at the time, but somehow isn&#39;t a person of interest in the investigation. </p>

<p>And there&#39;s the fact that he left his position as principal manager of <a href="https://www.bizapedia.com/tx/mesquite-central-park-apartments-gp-1-llc.html">Mesquite Central Park Apartments Gp 1, Llc</a> on September 4th - 24 days before checking in at the Mandalay Bay Resort - and the fact that his brother Erick Paddock was the person who <a href="https://companiestx.com/company/32015211173/mesquite-central-park-apartments-gp-5-llc">replaced him as principal manager</a> seems like too clean of an exit.</p>

<p>The fact that <em>all</em> major media keeps stressing his lack of political affiliations should tell you how important that is to the narrative. Why else would they be pushing that so hard (instead of the &quot;police are still looking for a motive&quot; line they always use) if it wasn&#39;t vital to convince people of it? And then there&#39;s the fact that Hillary started to push the &quot;NRA is evil&quot; message almost immediately, which was a bit on-the-nose.</p>

<p>I keep seeing the same cycle each time the news coverage mentions it: <strong>1)</strong> &quot;he had no affiliations&quot; (to imply that it wasn&#39;t politically motivated) <strong>2)</strong> &quot;here&#39;s what people are saying about it&quot; (all about gun control), and then <strong>3)</strong> &quot;listen to these accounts from victims&quot; (to drive the point home with emotional manipulation)</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s all a coincidence, but I can&#39;t think of a more perfect person, event, or media follow-up to further the gun control agenda, and the fact that all the parts came together is almost unbelievable.</p>

<p>It could be just throwing out the association of &quot;gambling debt&quot; = &quot;desperate/bad person&quot; to let people come to the conclusion themselves that his motives were nonexistent and it was a case of a man having a violent breakdown. </p>

<p>The one I see the most is <a href="https://i.imgur.com/841gq8n.jpg">the one with him drinking a shot with Marilou Danley at his side.</a></p>

<p>I read in a couple of places that he had been transferring thousands of dollars a month to the Philippines.  How about  the possibility that she drained his bank accounts, left him and moved back to the Philippines?  Not very conspiratorial, but a possibility.</p>

<p>I actually think this is more likely to have happened.</p>

<p>Like someone else mentioned, they could have offered him the deal and just killed him to tie up loose ends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll entertain this notion. Even though my theory is that he was lashing out against the Casinos. My theory is that he developed some mathematic system for how to win a &#39;top of the heap&#39; amount of money. Only when all of that failed something snapped and he felt like the world itself was conspiring against him. So when he shot people it was less that he was firing at different people and more like he was shooting at what he believed to be one entity that&#39;s sort of like...kinda like the movie &quot;They Live&quot;</p>
