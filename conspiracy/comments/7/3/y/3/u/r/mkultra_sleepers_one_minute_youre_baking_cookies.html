        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>US Government Mind Control
How the United States Government Finds, Chooses and Creates &quot;Sleepers&quot;
There is a huge effort to supress any and all information regarding the United States government sponsored experimentation on human subjects for the purpose of mind control and ultimately assassination. Early US efforts at developing the methods of mind control date back to the 1950&#39;s project Monarch and the infamous Project MK-Ultra (The MK, in spy-speak sophistry, stands for Mind Control)</p>

<p>Through a combination of hypnosis and powerful drugs it was discovered that a human subject could in fact be programmed to kill at hearing a &quot;trigger&quot; word or command that had been planted in a subject&#39;s mind through intensive programming effort.
<a href="http://www.thewatcherfiles.com/sleeper_assassins.html">http://www.thewatcherfiles.com/sleeper_assassins.html</a></p>

<p>Through these mind control techniques, subjects are first “de-patterned” by manipulating their individual mental states and altering their brain functions. This is done through E.C.T (Electro Convulsion Therapy), the administration of drugs, hypnosis, sensory and sleep deprivation, isolation, verbal and sexual abuse, as well as other various forms of torture.</p>

<p>Jesse Eisenberg is a stoner and a sleeper assassin in this bloody <strong>American Ultra</strong> 
American Ultra sees him play a stoner convenience store clerk turned into a super-lethal sleeper agent by a code word. As the movie&#39;s new red-band trailer shows, he&#39;s suddenly able to disarm goons with his hands, ricochet bullets off frying pans into torsos, and murder people with spoons.</p>

<p>I met an MKUltra Trainer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow. I know I could get incoherent when I was having a panic attack (used to happen due to meds, not anymore), but this is on an entirely different level. The most surprising aspect is that they continue to ramble on, long after noticing that they&#39;re not making any sense.</p>

<p>Granted, part of it may be due to a monitoring malfunction. If the news readers get their own voice fed back to them (I&#39;m not sure that they do) the way singers on stage do, it could occur that some kind of hardware issue introduces a delay in the circuitry that feeds them back their own voice a couple of moments late. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaEylsKpi70">It becomes virtually impossible to talk coherently from then on.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t address what I said at all.. in fact it just complicates things further... Why have a sleeper if there are others involved... do you picture the other assassins also being programmed? If so Why? Aren&#39;t sleeper agents used for infiltration? Isn&#39;t it a spy tactic? Your train of thinking is irrational.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. 100% bullshit. It&#39;s a cinematic/literary plot device and everyone seems to have bought into it wholeheartedly thanks to -
 GASP! - being brainwashed by films and TV shows!!! Congratulations. You just admitted you are being mentally controlled!</p>

<p>Writers love to write themselves as the hero. You used American Ultra as a reference, a movie written by Max Landis, a known socially-awkward and spoiled stoner brat. The lead was Jesse Eisenberg. Hmm. Is it really believable to you that the uttering of a codeword could enable someone to commit spoon-murder or any other sort of superhuman feat? </p>

<p>Never mind the mental aspect - how do you explain the physical aspect? Muscle memory? I was out chopping wood last week. Haven&#39;t chopped wood in probably fifteen years. Sure, I remembered how to chop wood - but holy shit after ten minutes I was struggling to swing the axe. The next day I could barely move. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure someone could be swayed and actually consciously convinced to commit some heinous act - but to outright just completely snap and go from Mall Santa to Supadupa Ninja Warrior all of a sudden? Nope. Bullshit. </p>
