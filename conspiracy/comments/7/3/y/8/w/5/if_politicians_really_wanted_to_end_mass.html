<p>no it isnt:</p>

<p>you are safer not in a car than in the car.</p>

<p>you are safer not on the motorcycle.</p>

<p>you are safer not falling in the sky.</p>

<p>you are safer not around dangerous chemicals.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>again, the logical fallacy. so you are saying it would be safer without guns. by that same logic it would be safer without airbags, helmets, parachutes, and hazmat suits.</p>

<p>the world is a dangerous place. the US would be dangerous with or without citizens being armed. terrorists will get guns anyways, and if somehow they cant, theyve already proven they will use trucks. </p>

<p>at least since we are armed we can protect ourselves. antigun legislation makes no sense because criminals dont follow the laws. its illegal to shoot someone, if they are willing to do that, they are willing to get a gun even if its against the law. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ. We are talking about countries. We are comparing countries. Your stupid attempt at anologies make no sense. Let me explain this like you were 5.</p>

<p>There are many countries in the world. Out of all of them, we have the most guns per capita. So out of the entire world, we have the most guns. </p>

<p>You think that if only more people had guns, this place would be safer. So if we compare this place to every other place on earth, this should be the safest one, compared to all the other places who have fewer guns. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that guy is turning a crisis into an agenda.
That&#39;s what DNC/GOP does.
The guy you replied to made reasonable comments about
how adding more guns doesn&#39;t fix things.</p>

<p>I hate the concept of guns entirely but
I also think there are better ways to tackle gun crime
in a country that has so many guns,
than taking guns away (you know, because the tyrannical gov can
get violent).</p>

<p>For countries that don&#39;t have many guns, adding
guns would ruin everything (don&#39;t fix what&#39;s not broken)
and increase gun crime exponentially from almost
none to an epidemic level.</p>

<p>But it seems the U.S. is the breeding ground for
the NWO. New Babylon?</p>

<p>IMO, if we had a benevolant gov,
we could have just had universal healthcare to reduce
mental illness, police going after violent gangs, 
an education system that teaches ethics and logic,
better psychological checks for gun customers,
end the CIA (MKULTRA), get rid of the elites, nationalize the FED, etc.</p>

<p>But adding guns is not going to fix it.
There are betters ways to reduce gun crime
than adding or removing guns.
Those two options are overly simplistic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. Not just for mental illness but single payer would
generally reduce the costs of healthcare over time (kicking out parasite big pharma and insurance companies unless they play by ethical rules)
as well as remove the financial incentive to scam patients
(secure decent paying government jobs for doctors/nurses would mean no conflict of interest, just honest diagnosis and treatments).</p>

<p>Another thing that would help stop these attacks
is ending the CIA (because MKULTRA),
nationalizing the FED and kicking out the parasite elite bankers,
reforming political campaign finance (get money out of politics),
etc.</p>

<p>Stopping aid to Israel would also help
(because Mossad).</p>
