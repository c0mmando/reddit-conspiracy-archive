       Yeah I just imagine that even if they prioritize releasing these videos (which they won't because remember, our media is profit driven and boring videos like that doesn't drive views) we probably wouldn't see them for at least 48-72 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the alleged shooter is dead, I'm sure they will be going over these tapes to determine if there were accomplices. You don't want to reveal every piece of info to the public right off the bat.

       Yeah it's not difficult to imagine at all, the point is if that's what happened then ther'll be footage of it. People want to see evidence that it was him that carried this out alone. If he did carry it out alone, there will be footage of him carrying large bags, either enough at once to account for all the equipment in the room, or enough over a period of time to account for them. It shouldn't be hard at all to pull up that footage. And if there is no footage that accounts for him having brought those guns in, then the footage needs to be examined for who did bring the guns in, i.e. what other people carrying bags went into that room?

       You're being glib. It's quite clear that I just want to see videos of exactly HOW those weapons got into the room and also specifically WHO did it. I don't care whether they were moved by hand, by cart, or by telekinesis, I just want to see whoever did it doing it.

       I do get what ur saying. But if it was a bellhop...perhaps people would say he isn't really a bellhop but instead someone in on it. I understand wanting to see...I just don't see how it will answer anything. On a side note...just saw on the news that a lot of hotels are now checking inside bags and are going to try to implement a rule that if u don't let them in ur room for more than 48hrs they can come in anyway and check.

       They won't because it's an inside job, but not the way you're thinking. They chose Mandalay Bay because it hosts Defcon every year. Darknet connected mafia from China has slowly been moving in more an more in the city and now we witnessed our first turf war between feds and reds.

       And the rabbit hole starts going even deeper and more crazy the more you dig. Can't prove it yet, especially getting more tired as night goes on, but I have a hunch today might have been because of the 6trillion in crypto stolen off of alphabay.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one knows where it went. But the dude who founded alphabay in Canada, he died when he got caught and murdered in Thailand on a "vacation"

       There seems to be a lot of sketchey references on darknet forums about using medical tourism services to get networking for their supply.

      <p>
       And there was a short lived medical tourism place in San  Francisco founded by a Chinese/Canadian student with a masters in cryptography that pulled in like 4mil in VC cash but didn't bother renewing their Domain name after a few weeks.

       This is a quick summary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock also worked for Lockheed Martin for five years before retiring, then once dark nets take off he suddenly has all this cash to gamble?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lockheed was also the first defense contractor to adopt blockchain tech. So who knows what he did for them years later in secret. He feds hired him out from Lockheed, it's not too much a stretch to think its cause he was connected in cyber crimes.

       He worked for subsidiary of Lockheed Martin in the 80's, well before any cryptocoins or blockchain existed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also working in "blockchain tech" doesn't allow you to mysteriously conjure coins out of thin air, not to mention there is no evidence at all that any of this has to do with cryptocurrencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your image says "collected coins", which is laughable. You somehow extrapolate that to think that means cryptocoins? The brother hadn't talked to him for 20 years, and collecting physical coins is a fairly popular hobby.

       Nothing solid, you just have to connect the obvious dots. Trying to google anything Mandalay brings up shooting info.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Defcon is held in that hotel every year, the casino paddock was a regular of, the same hotel that the other hackers involved with darknet shit always made it a point to stay at because status symbol. He was caught at "a hotel" in Vegas while running the server in his room under his legal name. But he wouldn't have only stayed at Mandalay because also it would have been the only place with enough infrastructure to Handel silk roads traffic.

       I'm sorry, it might not have been the same floor. That was tired mistake. It was definitely in that hotel though. It would have been the only place it could have run.

       Are you under the impression that the darknet is beyond the capabilities of the alphabet soup agencies to monitor?

      <p>
       Hate to be the one who has to break the news,but that isnt the case.  The fact that every piece of IT made for sale andd use in the US is required by law to have built in backdoors for use by LEOs,along with the fact that the software architecture for darknet use is relativly simple, makes it way to easy for it to be monitored.

       Ive watched continuous footage, from one camera of the entire incident. Gunfire came from 1, perhaps 2 rifles, of the same caliber and style.  What is called a Bump-fire stock was likely used, this is an accessory adapted to various rifle types that allows a semi-automatic rifle to be fired as if it was full auto, without modifying internal parts of the rifle. The varying rate of fire is absolutely a characteristic of these devices.  A standard full auto rifle such as the M16, as issued by military, has a continuous rate of fire when on full auto. It is clear form multiple videos that the rate of fire was variable.

       Why does everyone keep insisting it was a bump fire stock and that this is indisputable? The weird changing rate of fire sounds much more like the hand crank than a bump fire stock and would make way more sense if he had it mounted on a tripod like mentioned.

       Ah, thank you! That's the first time I've actually seen it reported on as a fact and not just a guess. I still wonder if that's actually what was used or if they were just on some of the other guns found in his room? Bump firing is horribly inaccurate, especially at 500+ yards. And I still swear the sound in the video I heard was way closer to thank of a crank fired gun.

       You should watch a few videos on youtube. The gat crank sounds nothing like a slide fire bump stock. The cadence of the gat crank is very uneven albeit fast. A bump stock  equipped rifle sounds exactly like full auto with little practice. While the burst from a bump stock is a tad slower, its a very consistent pattern just like the firing audio from the videos at the scene.

       I know, that's what I'm saying! Except that in the first video I watched when my phone woke me up to the news alert yesterday morning, it definitely sounded like the rate of fire was inconsistent and changing throughout the burst of fire. I'll see if I can find that video again because I know I'm not the only one who thought the same thing.

       Thank you for the link! With the previous videos id seen the audio wasnt very clear because of the distance and reverberation. Probably didnt help I listened through a junk phone. This audio DOES sound more like the gat crank. It is possible to be very bad at using a slide fire and not get the FA cadence though. I have owned a slide fire. It was pretty easy for me to learn and emulate FA. Some of my friends were terrible at it, however, and produced an uneven pattern.

       I wouldn't say converting an AR to full auto is super hard to do by any means. The hardest part would be getting all of your paperwork in order.

      <p>
       But bolting on a bump fire stock would be much easier.

       Unless he has a special gun manufacturing license you can't modify any weapons to be select fire unless it was registered to a civilian before May 1986.  Suspect this was a slide fire or bump fire accessory you can buy for about $500.

       you can buy a slide fire stick for about 120 bucks. Or less. You do not need a special ANYTHING to illegally modify a weapon. Do your homework before jumping out there.

       Read his comments. He's referring to a legal internal altering means which is still restrictive.  I'm not talking about a bump firing stock/trigger..It's just not about having paperwork for class 3 guns.  It had to to registered 32 years ago to be legally owned by a civilian.  That's why machine guns are $20k+.  The good slide stocks that actually work are pricey.  Yes I know you can get them cheaper.  The cheap ones don't work very well.

       And I was correcting YOU.

      <p>
       You said the bumpfire stocks are $500.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you mentioned the conversion to full auto requiring special blah blah.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also not true. Several ways to do it, all searchable on YouTube. And also highly illegal to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention the fact that the dude had money. A lot of it. Money makes people forget that FA parts kits aren't supposed to be in the hands of civilians. Also illegal.

       The guy just murdered 50+ people and wounded another 500+. Call me crazy, but I highly doubtful he would have been all that concerned about the legality.

       I'm not disagreeing with you on anything really lol.  Ok so bumpfire stocks have come down in price.  It has been a few years since I priced them.. thanks for the correction.  Just wanted to make a point you can't have new conversion paperwork on anything these days and it be legal.  Didn't we say the same thing?  Sigh.

       On several weapons it's super easy to file down the sear face to such a fine touch that it's technically still semi-auto but in use it's effectively full auto.
      </p>
      <p>
       The downside is you usually lose all control.
       <br/>
       Once you start the clip.  It's going to fire until empty.  You can't stop it.

        When police stormed his room shortly before midnight, Mr. Paddock lay dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He left behind 23 guns in the hotel suite, including two rifles mounted on tripods, 19 guns in his house, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, broken windows, and a trail of questions by family members and neighbors who are struggling to make sense of his motive. His car remained parked with the hotel valet.

       Everyone needs to keep this in mind.  We are totally relying on corporate (state run) media to provide us the information we are processing.  100% chance the information, at the very least, is unintentionally inaccurate.  90% chance is pure disinformation.

       I love pondering the idiocy of that logic.  If someone shot someone I loved to death, I'd only want more guns, seriously that is all I conclude.  When I think about people being hurt, raped and killed in large numbers, I just want to arm everyone I know and love to the teeth everywhere they go.

       See... Youre seeing it from a covilians perspective. Think about it from someone pushing the agenda. If we kill people and blame it on some Joe then we can get people to think we need more gun laws so Joes cant get guns as easily. Clearly that's not how we are thinking about it

So whether or not more weapons would have stopped the shooting is one issue, but whether it drives up demand for weapons is another. (

       That's not the point.  You're telling us a fact.  Facts are for logic and reasoning - this kind of thing is a matter of emotions.  Most people will fit what they think to how they feel about it and the demographic we're talking about arguably tends to include the kind of people who feel like arming themselves in response to feeling unsafe.

       Yeah gun law advocates think that since big stupid aggressive people exist (and will likely run out and arm themselves and their families the instant any panic drops), that it's safer to take everyone's guns away.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think either are very good solutions, but I also can't see anything else that would work. It's a touchy topic.

       typically, those who purchase and carry firearms are EXTREMELY law abiding people.  us CC holders are VERY careful and VERY responsible with our weapons as well as everything else in our lives.

       Remember pal, good guys with guns stop bad guys with guns.

      <p>
       What happens if someone gets shot on the street corner, and a police officer witnesses it? He calls for backup, aka MORE GUNS, and engages.  So yes, in most cases, more guns is ultimately the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I already went and bought 2 firearms this week.  So yes, its pretty much the first thing a lot of us think about.

       A lot of people point out the dangers of guns, but for the number of legal gun owners out there, you don't hear much about them.

       Guns simply aren't what kills people.  It takes a human with the will to kill. Thank God this guy didn't have explosives too.  I was reading that he was shooting at jet fuel tanks 1000' from the venue. Should we ban jet fuel if he had happened to cause a explosion?

       I never understood that logic. It's like when people said Obama was coming for their guns. Which all that did was bring gun sales up higher.
      </p>

       Than you have a shooting like this which I'm told is supposed to make people change their minds? If anything it's things like this that cause more gun sales.

       Gun sales go up because they think they will get banned or harder to get.  Source: I am a stock market junky.  Every shooting they go up on the speculation they will be taken away, which never happens.

       Exactly, someone or something has a built-in incentive to sponsor or commit acts that might raise the unrealistic threat that the guns will be taken away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which like you say never happens. If it didn't happen under Obama why would it happen now? Unless Trump just 180s. Which I guess he could?

       Yeah, but the incentive enough.  There are way more ways to do shady stuff with stocks.  When I said they went up, it was only approx .34c or 2.4%.  there are way easier ways to make money current relevant example: look up the volume of puts on Equifax before they released the news, then look at historic volume.

       Gun sales are going to go up because gun control is brought up again. They fell when bush took office and repealed the aw ban, and they've fallen now when trump took office and promised to uphold amendment rights.

       Is this a rise because people are scared of loosing their rights, or are sales being driven up by people seeking guns to protect themselves?

       Or do gun sales/stocks just go up after every mass shooting?

       It makes more sense than just a random shooting by a retired millionaire. 
Gives trump a chance to bring the country together with kind words for the victims. Allows trump to give liberals a win with stricter gun laws. 
Also probably a unplanned happy coincidence for trump. Now he doesn't have to stay long in torn apart Puerto Rico and can quickly run over to one of his cushy hotels in Vegas.

       Because it never is.  Terrorist organizations want to take claim when an Islamic radicalist goes crazy, and their is normally evidence that the group was linked to the radical.  No such evidence here.  Now, a day later, the noise about this being something other than a loon deciding to kill a bunch of people, with high powered, hard to obtain, militaristic weapons, is starting to make some sense.

       Do you remember Heather Heyer?  They love to point to her death as some sort of white supremacist nazi thing.  Although the circumstances were insanely suspicious, she was an inactive morbidly obese smoker who actually died of a heart attack, someone was tossed by a car, but nobody seems to know who they were or where they went.

       I know right, if it was a false flag why would they send in the most obvious old white guy. I love the conspiracy subreddit, I try not to criticize conspiracies because that's what we're here for. At the same time, this seems to obvious for false flag or any kind of gun grab.

       The majority of outlets aren't run by the state
      </p>
      <p>
       There are outlets like the Guardian (vehemently independent of UK government, broke Snowden/many Iraq stories), it's direct competition (e.g. The Telegraph, the Observers, the Times -
 all with their own editorial freedom, responsibilities, credibility, accountability standards in
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       news stories) - the media watchdogs that overlook them, the independent journalists, freelancers, Nordic outlets (Norway, Finland, Sweden - considered among the free-est in the world) which is all a drop in ocean compared to the thousands of outlets all over the world
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of these scouring, researching, interviewing, cross-checking - the emergency responders, the police, investigators, hospital staff, doctors, the hundreds of people injured in wards, witnesses, neighbours, friends, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       So far in the last 17 years or so I've seen every major terrorist attack and shooting (911, 7/7 London, Madrid train bombings, Sandy hook, Boston Bombing, Columbine, Charlie Hebdo, Aurora, Paris attacks, multiple recent London attacks, and many more) labelled as false flags or inside jobs on forums within hours of the event
      </p>
      <p>
       The typical progression is that shortly after the attack posters start proclaiming the event is "fishy" or "strange". Other's group-validate that. Others point out not to trust the media/authorities (stage we are at now), then down the line comes the photos with the circles in them and youtube videos with collections of "discrepancies/doubts/holes" in order to discredit the "official" version of events, then interest dwindles until the next major attack/shooting

       that worked out so well after 9/11, why not double down?  i say we ban all automatic weapons and microchip people so that we know where they are at all times and can shut down their heart with the bush of a button, then we'll never have mass shootings! hooray freedom!

       Put multiple, conflicting stories out there and they'll never figure it out, has been an FBI/CIA technique since 11/22/'63, and it has worked fairly well until recently, when an increasingly large proportion of the US population have finally raised their consciousness, and seen the BS. Once you see it, you never unsee. So we have multiple deep-state-run shooters at Las Vegas. Their purpose: flush out Trump supporters, kill them, and then neutralize the president, starting right about now, or within two weeks. Then, police state, for your protection, with a catchy name for it. Beware.

       I agree. Plus we now have video cameras on every single person. Older people that stage and plan these things tend to get caught off guard because tech evolves faster andchanges society at a faster pace than ever before. We could crowd source all video and photos and recreate the event and know for sure.

       I've seen the picture, he wasn't shot in the back unless there is more than his head wound.  The picture is him laying on his back with his head in a pool of blood and a revolver near the outside frame of the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       From seeing Bud Dwyer suicide, it looks similar to me, he was standing or sitting shot himself through the mouth, fell to the floor with the gun, and the blood pooled out of his mouth and back of the head.

       That's actually not the full picture.

      <p>
       The full picture extends downwards another 5 inches or so, and there is blood on his shirt in the abdomen area.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying I believe this but it's conceivable that he was shot in the abdomen area - either front or back - and the blood out of his mouth is aspirated blood.

       If you see the Bud Dwyer suicide which happened live on TV, it would make sense if he was standing or sitting to shoot himself through the mouth, fall back, and have some blood splatter on the front, before the majority of it went with gravity across his face lying down and out the back of his head.

       There is a part of me that thinks it could be controlled oppo making the wildest of assertions.

       And if you think about it, there's a lot of sense in planting wild theories in a conspiracy sub in order to discredit the whole of the conspiracy body.

       I sometimes wonder whether Alex Jones is controlled oppo or is at least partly funded by a shadow government agency out to discredit conspiracy theories in general. As in, "oh, you're think there's such things as conspiracies like that lunatic Alex Jones?"

       The rifle with the fore grip was .223 and did have a bump stock, and what appears to be a Surefire 100 round magazine loaded, with a rather large stack of similar magazines next to the pillar.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other rifle, with the bipod, appears to be an AR-10 chambered in .308 with a standard 30 round magazine, a magnified scope, and no appearance of a bump stock. One thing worth noting though, bump stocks and bipods are not very comparable with each other.

       The FBI reported yesterday evening that 12 of the 23 weapons found in the hotel room had “devices” that allowed them to “mimic” an automatic method of fire. So far the only pictures I’ve seen has been those two rifles and the pistol which he presumably suck started to end his life.

       I don't understand why he wouldn't put the bipod on the one with the bump stock. It would increase the stability and accuracy and would probably help regulate the rate of fire to prevent malfunctions. I've never shot a rifle with a bump stock though so I don't know if thats true

       From my understanding, with a bump stock, you seat the buttstock into your shoulder and place your finger in the trigger well. You use your off hand to move the rifle forward, thus pulling your finger back into the trigger and firing off a round, then the recoil makes the rifle itself go back and forth causing your finger to quickly release and pull the trigger in rapid succession which effectively replicates automatic fire. The key to this working is the buttstock staying firmly seated in your shoulder, your finger remaining firm against the plastic part of the bump stock at the trigger well, and the rest of the rifle itself actually moving back and forth. A bipod would prohibit the rifle from moving forward and backward. That’s why bump stocks are fairly unreliable and not very accurate... but for this guy, he didn’t have to be all that accurate, he was basically trying to “hit the broadside of a barn” here.

       The bump stock acts like a second spring (in addition to the buffer spring in the rifle) that uses recoil to bounce the rifle off your shoulder. Most people also get a gunsmith to modify the trigger so it has a shorter travel length and lighter breaking weight so that when the gun bounces forward and then back again, it shoots another round while you keep your trigger finger in the same postion

       The key being the rifle “moving” to make a bump stock effective. Even with a trigger adjusted to have a very light trigger pull, the rifle itself still needs to move. For bipods to be the most effective, they should have sandbags or some kind of weight behind and/or in front of the feet of the bipod, and firm pressure should be applied to the buttstock. Enough pressure that if you didn’t have sandbags, the bipods and rifle itself would skip forward.

       Ok yeah that one definitely has one. I wonder why he put the bipod on the other one though. If it were me I would want as much stability and accuracy as possible on my most effective, casualty producing weapon

       Most stable and effective would be using a tripod, or bipod if needed. But like I said, they aren’t very compatible with a bump stock. He would’ve been better off using a trigger crank, a modified sear, or buying an illegal but legitimate fully automatic weapon or two from the black market. Obviously money wasn’t a huge obstacle for him, but maybe he viewed those options as too risky?

       True, but in theory, that would require him to trust whomever he asked. That’s not a legal modification, so you can’t just go to any fab shop and ask for somebody to make the modification for you and hope they don’t report you to the authorities.

       I didn't say just any shop. I said a shop that was willing to do it. They are out there. And they aren't going to report him if they already sold him the sear.

       True. It still would’ve taken trust. Guess we won’t know until the official findings come out, or never, if any of the weapons had modified sears. Even if he found a shop to do that for him, he easily could’ve gotten a couple done, but when you ask for 5-10+ Modified sears, that might raise the suspicions of people that are willing to perform the work for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He definitely used a bump stock for one of the rifles though, and as pictured, it appears he had a Surefire 100 round mag loaded into the rifle and a considerable stack of similar magazines next to the pillar, which tells me that rifle was his primary choice. We’ve only seen pictures of two of the rifles within the room though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the videos I’ve seen and heard have a very inconsistent rate of fire within a single burst, which leads me to believe that a bump fire rifle was his primary weapon of choice over a rifle with a modified sear.

       If you listen to the police scanner you can hear the breach charge then a while later after the suite is cleared they just say 1 suspect down.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's easy to see why that would be mixed up. They don't use the police scanner to share gossip just relevant facts.

       Have you seen Shooter with Mark Wahlberg where they do the same thing and it works, and they brag about it working a bunch of times before. Also the premise of that movie would line up well with this, with a remotely controlled gun. Before you start being a douchebag, remember I'm just the arising and I don't necessarily believe this happened.

       But what could be the point of shooting indiscriminately at concert goers?

       Don't need to tell them that. Vegas hosts shot show every here and I'm sure there are other gun conventions every weekend. No one would bat an eye if they were guns, but he would have to be concerned that someone might break into his room and steal his shit!

       I believe the argument is whether or not he did this himself, or if he had help for a false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which if this was a false flag, I feel like they wouldn't release the footage if it could be proven that he wasn't the shooter.

       I find it insane you expect evidence like this released a day after the incident. It's not that they are hiding footage from you, it's that it is under a microscope and they will not just release this stuff until they comb it over thoroughly

       Well, if you're shooting into a crowd theirs not too much to control, and moving between guns really depends on how capable he is. I know 70+ year olds who walk the course multiple times a week, and &lt;60 year olds who can't move very well. As far as moving the weapons idk.

       But moving weapons should be easy.  Don't they have those dolly things you can toss them on?  Or get someone to simply help.  They're in a bag, no one is going to care.

       I don't know what world these people are living in where it's hard to move stuff around a Vegas hotel. They provide carts for free that require no proof you're even staying there to use AND many even have human beings to help you move stuff. They ALL have elevators and places you can pull your car right up to the front door.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention, guns don't have to be in giant metal cases. You can take them apart and just put them in a suitcase. It's not even insane for a 64 year old to do this. My father is 65 and still mows his own yard, does all his own gardening, shovels snow out of his driveway, and walks a minimum of five miles a day. 64 year olds aren't feeble and incapable either.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is impossible and people who are saying it is proof of a false flag are being willfully ignorant of possibilities so they can fuel their own beliefs.

       Yea that's just weird.  Is everyone really young on this sub?  Have they never seen a person in their 60s?  Retired people still go for light jogs, bike, workout, cruises, cook.  Shit I knew a 90 year old woman who still maintained her cow/milking place (fuck if I know what they're called).  It was the largest on the western side of Colorado.  She had help obviously but was in charge still.

       Nah, it's cool. My cousin's 100 year old grandmother could have probably managed to move 10 guns into a hotel using dollies, valet help, and rolling suitcases over the course of four days.

       I'm an old man and get underestimated all the time. Young people assume that everyone over 50 is decrepit, demented, and impotent. However, for context, when Expendables 3 was made in 2014, the average age of Stallone, Statham, Ford, Schwarzeneggar, Gibson, Snipes, Lundgren, Banderas and Jet Li was almost 60.

       You're right but usually you have the bellman take the bags up. There should be a vid of that. And if he took them himself he would have to make multiple trips. Like you said not impossible but he would be on video a bunch going through the lobby

       They have luggage carts that hold a lot of bags. Even if the bellhop took them they wouldn't have thought anything of it. I don't see how it matters if he took his bag or if the bellhop did. It is easy to take a lot of bags to ur room...in one trip or many. They don't check ur bags and a lot of luggage doesn't raise concern. I'm not sure how his luggage plays into anything.

       I don't see how people could be so dumb to think that if a guy spent 4 days in the room that he could nonchalantly carry multiple bags, across multiple shifts that it wouldn't be plausible. Hell when I traveled across country in the Navy, i had 4 bags just by myself. But for me it was obvious I was active duty. But still 10-15 bags is a cake walk especially after being there for 3.5 days.

       Valet is the most logical way to park your car. Everyone uses it multiple times in one day. It is free and u don't have to search for a spot. U can carry ur own luggage or get a bellhop but either way ur luggage wouldn't get a second look no matter how many bags you had.

       They just show on Las Vegas television surveillance video of Paddock drunkenly falling in the Cosmopolitan (2011) &amp; trying to sue them.

       The arbitrator said Paddock was not aggressive &amp; most likely just liked to gamble &amp; drink.

       I can watch football players beat the shit out of people in elevators,subway restaurants and bars. You can watch robberies on any gas stations surveillance. The point being made is if it involves tabloid or everyday citizens it usually makes it to the internet for us all to gawk at, but all these agenda driven shootings never once have anything leak. And they always leave questions like why is there always an active shooter drill scheduled the same day. And why does the crowd always act different than I would being shot at.

       Oh you mean you watch footage of petty crimes happening after the trials already been concluded? Not ones with an active investigation that started less than 24 hours ago? Yea you're right that's really strange.

      <p>
       And you're telling me that after a day of drinking while on vacation in Vegas, at a concert with music blaring and a crowd of people all around you, you'd correctly identify gunshots coming from several stories above your head, and let's not forget that the majority of those people probably haven't heard a gun outside of an action movie. You're a real fucking modern day James Bond.

       A case where someone beats the shit out of another person, it is pretty cut and dry and there is little incentive to protect the evidence. If they have a bunch of footage, and there are more people involved, it might make sense to hide footage so they don't "tip" anyone off.

       Have you been shot at? Or, more accurately, have you been in a situation where you are being shot at but are not sure if it is fireworks or not? If not, you have no idea how you would act.

       They release what they want you to be outraged by. Just like they only release the staged film footage so it is controlled to their narrative. I'm not saying this didn't happen I'm just saying they never happen the way we were told.
      </p>

       No I haven't been shot at and you're right to the point I don't truly know how I would react. But I'm not sitting around questioning. I'm just leaving.

       There are all kinds of motives for releasing things. However, the reality is that I think there are more motives to keep shootings like this underwrap than there are for celebrities doing stupid, abhorrent shit. And more motives to release the latter.

       Unless you are questioning whether or not it is gun fire at all. You are at a concert, it is loud, no one else is running, you are maybe not completely sober, so putting myself in their shoes, it makes sense to me that they may not even realize it. On top of that, you don't know how you are going to act when that "shock" overtakes you that your life might be immediately on the line. It's easy to say what you would do when you can sit and rationally think about it, its much different in the heat of the moment. I'm not so confident that I wouldn't act stupidly as well.

       Judging from your rant you probably didn't know that the camera's are owned by MGM and it's MGMs discretion on when to release the footage. I'm sure they were asked and complied to hold off on releasing the footage as this is an ongoing investigation.

       So when you give your shit to the police for an investigation, you can't somehow release something you don't have. Good god. It's a casino, they don't triple back up their video. Probably one HDD with the footage that was given to the popo right away.

       See you won't believe it.  It is like the flat eathers no matter what they say they will accept as evidence once you provide it they say it is fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know, or should know, that footage like this isn't normally released in the early stages of an investigation unless doing so would help them find people involved or people in danger.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get why people who think this is a hoax think those behind it are so remarkably dumb. It stands to reason that, if this was a hoax, those behind it would plan it better than a high school one act play.

       Yes they can and typically do release such information early like this.  You spin typical behavior as conspiratorial because you are unwilling to examine things with an open mind.  You appear to already know what happened and are search for evidence to
       <em>
        prove

       Actually it seems like there’s a lack of an investigation. They didn’t even need to release anything about this guy until they knew 100% what happened. He’s already been found guilty by the court of public opinion. If they don’t release security footage from outside of his room, it’s shady.

       They can’t. Someone in this thread was saying they worked in the casinos and 9 out of 10 don’t have cameras once you get away from the elevators. That’s not accurate at all. They claimed they don’t worry about guest security as much as their money which is probably true. But one thing Vegas doesn’t fuck around with is liability. Anything that happens in their hotel they want it on camera. Obviously there’s not a camera on every door, but every hallway is covered.

       McDonald's can have cameras everywhere because the average McDonald's is 4-5k square feet.  A 32+ story hotel would need hundreds to thousands of cameras to meet the same coverage.  It's not a  feasible comparison.  They'll have cameras covering the major common areas, but it's not unreasonable that they won't have complete and constant coverage of all areas of individual hotel hallways or room entrances.  They likely have footage of the guy in the main common areas, and with luggage, but that's likely it--and as the investigation is ongoing, I wouldn't expect a release for some time.

       Many people called saying they saw more shooters. These 'shooters' were SWAT teams with guns entering the hotel. I also heard off-duty cops were in the area with weapons.
      </p>

       Just because some civilian saw someone with a gun, doesn't mean it was another shooter.

       Wow, that's interesting...maybe the Cosmopolitian wanted to make sure he wouldn't file any more lawsuits against them. Casino has more than enough money to hire psy ops, they're probably intertwined with the CIA putting money into their slush fund, so it would just be another false flag operation to them.

       Couldn't you just bring them in in golf club cases the airline ones? Broken down you could fit a couple in, maybe more, if you do it over the course of a few hours, nobody is going to notice.  It's not like he has to walk in with ten rifle cases.

       Nobody is saying they expect to see him walking in with rifle cases. But the footage must exist because these cameras are everywhere in Vegas. If we don't see the footage we know something's up. That's the point.

       Do you honestly think that reporters aren't scrambling to get that footage? That they aren't willing to pay for an exclusive report showing him walking in. What about the other casino owners that would want to see the footage to know what to look out for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, I never said anything about them taking too long to show the footage or that we should have already seen it. But if it is never released then we should be suspicious of that. I would expect it to be released relatively quickly since the shooter is dead.

       I guarantee you that footage of Stephen checking in would be useless and would look completely normal. As someone who works in large casinos and hotels, it's not uncommon at all to have somebody walk in with multiple very large luggage bags. It's not surprising or suspicious. Have you ever taken apart a gun? Cleaned a gun? You can make an AR rifle fit into a small backpack, and tripods and other modifications are made for easy transport most of the time with foldable parts. Here's what you'd see...
      </p>
      <p>
       •Older man with large bags at hotel desk surrounded by hundreds of others with large bags.
      </p>
      <p>
       •older man getting into elevator with his bags.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you're lucky, the hotel floors themselves have cameras but I've worked at 2 large resorts and both of them had no footage on the floors themselves. Only downstairs where all the assets are, and the elevators going up to the hotels. After that? Zip.

       It would still be useful to see that he did actually have large bags with him, to support the fact that it was he who brought the guns in, and he who used them. If they came into the room to find this man dead on the floor by all these guns, who's to say someone else didn't just choose a random person's hotel room, shoot him dead, carry out the attack, and then make it look like he was the only person there and had committed suicide?

       Yeah, I get that. But there's also nothing stopping him from leaving and coming back multiple times throughout multiple days. You'd need footage of his vehicle and every time it left, if if did. If his vehicle was parked in valet it should be under surveillance. If it stayed parked for 4 days, and the footage of him checking in doesn't look suspicious... then we have something.

       That wouldn't be hard to do. Who cares show the footage in the elevator or the story is bullshit. Point blank period. Every mass shooting never has any footage, sandy hook, Orlando, and now this. Of course he could have done it over multiple trips. Compile the footage and release it. You act like the media wouldn't be all over that film if it actually existed.

       It 100% exists unless the surveillance department erased it. Which would be EXTREMELY suspect. I agree I think they should release it, they have nothing to lose of their narrative is correct.

       They're not. You're right, and I think we will get a lot more info soon. It's quiet right now because it's still very fresh. There's nothing on the surface to really point to here so it's going to take some digging from the authorities.

       Yep. The footage has been taken by federal investigators and won’t be shown because there won’t be a trial since the suspected shooter is dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they do show surveillance footage in trials. There was a camera outside the church in Charleston that captured the killer entering and exiting with a gun in his hand.

       Its been a while since ive seen any of the footage.  Not sure where to find any these days. And considering how hard various gun lobbyist work to defend their bullshit, it wouldnt surprise me if it has been hidden on the best place to hide a body-on the second page of google search results.

       Yeah, the people calling for the release of the tapes know this, and know it won't be released until an investigation is complete. They're propagating a condition to believe the shooting that is impossible to meet so they can use it as FALSE FLAG evidence.

       no, like if they actually involved us in the process so there was some sort of baseline for operations, where people could give information to the police and then the authorities determine what is use-able and what is reddit bullshit.

       I disagree about 'nothing to lose'.

       I would like them to release this footage, but as I said elsewhere in this thread, Vegas is about 80-90% about the prestige. Showing a terrorist / madman going past their security with bags of guns would gain them nothing but could harm their future business.

       If I was in the same position they were in, I'd give the footage to authorities, but I'd fight to keep it out of the public eye. It just makes more business sense.

       Do you think after they found him dead, they wiped the room clean and took everything out? No... They do an investigation which will include checking to see if there's residue on his hands, fingerprints on the guns etc..

       He'll likely have many marks on him that verify he was the one shooting. They don't just say 'Welp, he's dead, clean this place up and bury the body'.

       Very likely won't have that footage. 9 times out of 10 the surveillance coverage stops after the elevators. Surveillance would be able to determine who got off on his floor but not be able to confirm who went into his room and when. I can only think of one Vegas resort with hotel surveillance coverage, and that's Caesars. Casinos care less about safety of the guests and more about their assets and employees integrity.

       Electronic locks keep a record of everyone who accesses them. There may not be video footage, but we could knot without a doubt every time his room's door was unlocked while he was checked in to that room. No matter what there is useful information that can be obtained, assuming the investigators working the case are doing their job properly.

       No it keeps a record of a key being used and what time the keys aren't necessarily registered to an individual, just to the room. It really proves nothing. He could have gone out to the hallway to get ice 20 times and the key would register as 20 entries to the room.

       You're bringing up a lot of valid points and info that the counter argument will make later on.  Doing this helps break down the various options and how things could have gone down.  Plus you're not being hostile or a dick so keep doing you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing the key log may not give us the smoking gun but it may give some helpful info.  Like say some one entered the room after we see Stephen getting on the elevator to go down stairs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And seeing what kind of luggage and how many pieces of luggage will help decide if he really did bring 23 guns and ammo and all the other equipment.  23 guns will not be light, so he would have most likely needed large rolling luggage.  It also wouldnt be a cloth or stiff fabric kind.  It would be a hard shell.  But if he is seen making multiple trips with small bags then that would also be a possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot of ways he could have gotten the guns up there. But if the videos don't show lots of trips with small bags or one very large piece of luggage(or two or 3)then he most likely didn't bring them up(or had a helped who is still on the loose).
      </p>
      <p>
       If he had a helper and the investigators saw that then they are not going to release the tapes and tip off the helper, so they can go into hiding. Or speed up a second act.

       I'm sure there is video. I don't know how long a hotel like Mandalay Bay tends to keep video, I'd imagine that it recycles after a period of time unless there's a reason to keep a segment.

       My guess is that a hotel like the Mandalay, with a casino and a huge amount of traffic, will keep it longer than a Motel 6. The FBI probably already has the footage in their possession and is reviewing it to see if they can find anything.

       Thanks. I keep my mouth shut about stuff when I don't know what I'm talking about, but this is something I have particular insight into because of my line of work. Just trying to think rationally and go one step at a time until more info comes out. This sub needs to go back toward skepticism and critical thinking instead of the echo chamber of fanatics that think everything is a conspiracy by nature just because It was posted here. Some things in this world are super fishy, some are simple and as they seem.

       It's saved locally on the electronic keypad. In order to retrieve the info you need to take a reader up to the room and download the data off of the keypad. All the places I worked at, that's how it was done. It wasn't sent to any sort of server or cloud.

       Yeah when you check into a hotel room in Vegas you typically get 2 hotel keys for that room unless you ask for more, then they'll give them to you. The keys have a temporary access code on them and if you use one on the keypad, it will leave a timestamp and tell you which key was used. But like I said before that doesn't mean much if there's no videos in the hotel.

       I agree with what you're saying. But if you match that with videos, one day we could have something. I know there's an "if" in there, still worth having if possible.

       Maybe where you work, but those things have to communicate with a server to check if a key is still valid. Were there other keys (besides housekeeping) that could open that door that would allow someone else in? (Even housekeeping isn't foolproof, they make skimmers for every reader imaginable)

       I don't have much experience with the key in systems personally. I have worked investigations and security and surveillance. When we need information on key-ins, we leave it to the locksmith to come up and run the info. So maybe there's a step im missing. I wasn't a tech guy.

       While there are systems that report back,they are usually of the type used in situations where access is needs to be strictly controlled due to either the sensitive nature of whatever is being protected or because of the monetary value of what is being protected.

       Why do people keep lying about this? The electronic doors used in hotels keep track of when they're accessed and by what type of key. There's no "reporting back" necessary. The information is stored on the lock and it can be retrieved electronically by employees if the need arises. Source: the hotel where I have been working for the past decade has allowed me to personally witness the engineers using a special device to retrieve such information from room locks. They call it lock interrogation.

       Yeah I'm telling you that most of them do not have hallway coverage in the hotel towers. I don't need to "give you a break" when I've literally spent the last 6 years of my life working In Atlantic City and Vegas. I can't speak to the hotel that the shooter was in, as I haven't been in that one specifically.

       So most modern hotels have key cards. I would love to see the hotel run a report of how many keys were issued. Most times when you check in, they give you at least two. Im curious to see if there were more than two keys issued.

       I would like to see it as well. Mostly because I work surveillance and one thing Vegas doesn't skimp on is surveillance. If they try to say the footage doesn't exist I will become highly highly skeptical because i know for a 100% fact that anyone who checked into that hotel WILL be on surveillance no fucking exceptions.

       is it possible that the powers that be don't see a need for the public to see that footage?  For one, they are still pouring over it themselves, 40 hours after the crime.  For another thought, why do they need to share that with us?  This crime has been committed, no one in the public caught it before hand, and no in law enforcement was any better at it.

       the point would be to start piecing together what people thought happened, with actual pieces of facts. If he checked in with one single small bag or something, well then how the weapons got up there becomes a whole different story. Its not about
       <em>
        confirming
       </em>
       the entire investigation based of the video of him checking in, its about creating a timeline and validating things you believe to be true.

       I mean if you think a guy walking up to a room with a couple big bags automatically confirms they're full of rifles then sure. You're not going to see someone carrying guns through the lobby. If he looked innocent enough to check in, the video will be innocent enough to still leave tons of speculation.

       Some random guy yeah it is meaningless. But if the suspected shooter carrying several large bags into his room is a totally different story. 19 long guns even broken down still would take up a bunch of bags. It is so odd you would be so against looking at security camera footage because it would be "useless", it just simply wouldn't be, it would serve some purpose.

       Why does it matter where he parked? They physically had to pass through the entrances to get to his room. I really don't see how that makes a difference unless you're implying there was an entrance he found in the parking lot that had 0 cameras ever on him.

       Okay well it's a budget thing. Why would they put cameras in the hotel towers when it doesn't benefit them financially? A casino/resort is a business. Of course downstairs is LITTERED with surveillance but it costs millions and millions to build a surveillance infrastructure throughout a giant hotel and if they don't care what goes on up there, (most don't) why spend the money? I'm just telling you what I KNOW from experience and years in the career field. You guys can keep speculating and acting like you're the experts but I have no reason to lie to anyone about it.

       I could envisage situations where someone fakes a bad fall or physical/sexual assault incident in the hopes that the casino will give them a settlement. Cameras could protect against that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying you're wrong of course, but that would be a potential financial incentive for a wider security system.

       If he had as much ammo as they claim, the videos could show the older man slightly struggling to carry it up.  Ammo is heavy as fuck.  Even for handguns.  If he had thousands of rounds for 10 rifles, that shit would not be something easy to be carrying around

       Yeah but the only reason the Sandy Hook conspiracy is "insensitive" is because it's allegedly a hoax. We already know this isn't a hoax because theres tons of actual footage of people being shot and dying. People don't generally say that false flag conspiracies are insensitive, they only get testy when you allege that the victims didn't actually die.

       It's traumatic for anyone who knows the person, even more so for the ones who survived. I remember a while back, a news company did actually show it and the backlash from that was EXTREME.

       The school had a brand new security system installed including a camera that would take a photo of someone walking to the front door. Since Lanza supposedly entered the school through the front door there should be clear footage of him. Yet it has never been released.

       There was one camera, on the front door, that had no recording capability. It was simply used to visually observe who was at the front door. This is a typical setup for front door cameras used on buildings everywhere.

       literally how it works in CT. there's a camera at the front door so you can see who you buzz in. otherwise, everyone in the buildings are either kids or teachers, and who the fuck pays into the education budget so much for full security cameras and 100% monitoring up time? Not CT, I can tell you that. Not even my HS had an all day camera station.

       I’m not even on the “Sandy Hook was a hoax” bandwagon, but I didn’t know there was NO footage until your comment. I assumed it was sealed. What kind of school doesn’t have cameras in this day and age? My middle school had them in 2001.

       I would think a lot of schools. Like most in rich suburbs where there aren't many issues that the school would feel the need to get cameras.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to this,
       <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=334">
        about 75% have cameras.
       </a>
       But that doesn't make it clear (at least from my quick glance) if Sandy Hook, because it has this monitoring device on the front door, would be included.

       My school was in a rich white suburb, even more reason to have cameras because they probably have a decent budget. My sister is in high school and they’ve had locked doors at all times, metal detectors, and multiple cameras for almost a decade in a very rich suburb.

       You are confusing the ability to afford it with the need for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew up in a rich white suburb. Almost nothing went on at my school except for the occasional fight, or kids smoking pot in the parking lot. It would have been completely silly for us to have had cameras installed everywhere, even if they were able to afford it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, anyway, I gave you the numbers and there is no evidence that Sandy Hook had any cameras, other than the front door one, which had no recording capabilities. Whether or not they should have is another story.

       Oh, I'm no "sensitive" to them, I was just pointing out that, rather than address the actual argument, you resorted to personal attacks alone. It sort of puts you in a weak position as far as your argument goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm absolutely here for genuine conversation. I've been following
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy

       much longer than I ever knew
       <a href="/r/TMoR">
        /r/TMoR
       </a>
       ever existed (though admittedly, I did take a break from
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       for a bit when it was overrun by white supreamcists/anti-semitism, which seems to have died down).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, back to the argument you made: if you think that you are entitled to any and all information, even information currently being used in an investigation opened less than 24 hours ago, where do you draw the line? Can I have your tax returns? If not, why is THAT information off the table, but you feel entitled to the video from the hotel?

       I think they are allowed to but not required to.  For instance they can release a photo or video of a suspect if they want the public's help finding him, but I don't think they have an obligation to "prove" anything to the public except at a trial.

       Just from short clips when the shooting starts there's a definitive sound of at least 2 guns dumping rounds out. He's not dual wielding rifles with that power, AND the picture of his hotel floor shows TWO windows busted out, on opposite sides of the room.

       Man, you haven’t really read shit about this have you? It’s explained and highly believable that the echo of gunfire and actually sound of bullets clapping above concert goers more than makes up for the multiple shooters. Also, why wouldn’t he break two windows for multiple vantage points? If every window was broken out, could really say that there was 10 shooters?

       If there were 23 guns I'd think he'd have them all loaded and ready to go, and yes I would think he'd just swap them out as they ran out of ammo to reduce time between shots.
      </p>

       The thing is that I hear two guns overtop of one another. One sounds crank operated, and the other sounds like it's firing in controlled bursts.

       I stay out of this sub typically, but I feel I need to comment on this.  Supersonic ammunition will make two sounds independent from one another that becomes more distinct the further you are from the discharge.  Meaning, you'll hear the ammo hit BEFORE you hear the discharge because it is traveling faster than sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       This explains the delay of the sound, and why sounds of slugs impacting the concrete are intermingled with the discharges.  It gets very confusing to establish point of origin once you factor supersonic ammunition and acoustics.

       The shooter was most likely switching to the other window every other time. So once was right above him then pause... Then it was farther away.

       Lol who in TF uses the word "Larper"? That's probably the dumbest shit I've heard all day. Secondly I saw ex military people saying it sounded like M240 gunfire so I listened to M240 gunfire and I'd say it sounds identical. How about instead of trying to personally insult somebody you tell me why it's not M240 and what gun or guns were used? If I'm wrong which I could be why not tell me why I'm wrong instead of calling me a "Larper"? Which is also just an inaccurate statement.

       It's up to 65,000 dollars to buy one though. I wasn't talking about a tax stamp. I'm talking about the price of the gun which I'm certain it was clear that's what I was stating. Also it's heavily regulated and difficult to get a fully auto light machine gun. You were right it wouldn't be a heavy machine gun it would be a light machine gun. What guns do you think were used?

       And do you really expect all valets to have a detailed recollection of all the people and suitcases they deal with on a daily basis? If you've worked any sort of retail job with lots of customers, you'd know that you pretty much forget someone 7 seconds after they walk away unless they draw some sort of special attention to themselves.

       Absolutely, but that won't make your recollection any more accurate. You can't remember what you didn't even pay attention to in the first place, although you can certainly convince yourself that you did remember.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a great many studies about eyewitness testimony in particular, but more generally about memory recollection and the role attention plays in perception.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that he's trying to filter his recollection through information he found out later makes it less reliable, not more.

       The details themselves don't even need to be suggested--even the wording of the questions they use can influence your recollection.

      <p>
       The classic psychology study for this was in 1974 by Loftus and Palmer.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the second iteration of the experiment, different groups were shown a video of a car accident and asked to estimate the speed of the vehicles and what they saw afterwards. By changing
       <em>
        one word
       </em>
       , in asking "what happened when the cars smashed each other" vs "what happened when the cars hit each other", people estimated the cars were going much faster, and even described seeing things that hadn't happened, like seeing broken glass on the ground.

       i posted a comment about shots echoing and thundering off of walls as it travels giving false impression of where shots are being fired from. Your average person doesn't have the experience or training to pin point fire location. So people calling in on their cell phones could be misleading the police.

       Don't believe that stuff....People make videos on Youtube to get views. I wasn't there but i have shot an light machine gun while serving, and the thunder and clapping of the rounds bouncing off of walls and streets could have given a false pretense there were multiple shooters. One video i saw on YouTube claims the the police scanner audio calls for a shooter about a 3rd of the way up and half way up. He even points out flashes from the building. What you don't see anywhere are broken windows like from the 32nd floor. So until they share actual evidence of a 2nd shooter I'm not convinced.

       That video only shows the point of view from the concert area. It sounds like that because of the echo and ricochet of bullets landing around you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a video someone took directly under the shooter at ground level, its pretty clear there is only one gun being fired with a bump stock.

       I know what part you're talking about, and I just showed you a video that proves there was only one gun. He is shooting in a sweeping motion towards the camera at some distance. The part where you think you hear a second gun is just ricochet and the bullets breaking the sound barrier.

       If there was a camera right below the shooter, how well would that pick up other shooters? You can't discount other evidence because yours fits your agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there were ricocheting bullets sounds, then there would be some consistency (I would think). We need to look deeper here, as we know our government has consistently lied to us.

       Yeah... could have had them in the storage area on the first floor, then called them up one at a time with different bellboys throughout the day. Snowboards, golf clubs, guitars, plenty of cases are big enough to fit guns and not look like guns.

       I’m a firm believer that this was an inside job. So many people claiming that “10ft” walls barricaded them inside the concert area. Some dumbass putting a spot light right into the middle of the crowd? Making them an even easier target? My mind is all over the place about this.

       10ft walls didn't barricade them in the concert area. It prevented the people who didn't pay $210 a ticket from getting INTO the concert area.

       Like....have you never been to a ticketed event in an outdoor area? Huge chain link temporary walls is pretty damn common.

       No sir, I’ve never been to a huge concert event before. My apologies for not knowing the protocol to keep people from moving in. I’m just saying, most people that paid to attend knew where the exits were FOR THE MOST PART and the majority are saying that there was no way out. All I’m saying.

       All concerts have a way out. They’re generally exactly the way you entered. The issue is getting through the crowd back to them.

       It is never enough for you though.  They could show him bringing three bags in and you'd scoff and say it should have at least taken five bags...You'd just pull something else out of your ass without caring about any facts.

       More than likely it would just be a few suitcases which he could load up on one of those luggage dollies.

       You're kidding right? We already have 46838 stories as to how he could have done this, light suggesting on motivee, background check stories on family members... Don't piss on my leg.... Release the camera footage that shows him in the place they claim he was. It's proof.

       Then I'm sure it will be released once the investigation is finished if it is indeed in the public interest. OMG 36 hours later and they haven't finished their investigation into the largest mass shooting in US history yet??! What a conspiracy!!

       Is it just me, or does anyone find it strange that the ONLY popular photo being circulated through MSM is of Patterson with his eyes closed. I mean they interviewed his brother. His brother seems to be knowledgeable of the other brother...so why not ask him if he's got a pic. 68, no MO, worked at Military Industrial Complex as accountant/auditor. "Not even a parking ticket..." sayeth the bro.

       Well, you are in r/conspiracy. Also, Lockheed isn't exactly the most trustworthy company, employing the likes of John Ramsey and his Father in Law. Also, they're involved in multiple government contracts, and we all know the fine print in those contracts (most of the time) is fairly suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not you g to jump to conclusions...yet. I will say it makes for an interesting take on the whole situation, but it's nothing concrete. Just take that information and keep it tucked away until it's relevant. If it is, it will be brought back up.

       they won't release these tapes because the real criminals behind this have already confiscated the tapes probably on the basis of national security. As for Stephen, the man is a patsy. I'm surprised more people didn't die, the way the crowd just sat there.

       Where's the usual CT skepticism? Wouldn't the hotel be "in on it", and if they released a video it would show nothing out of the ordinary, just a guy slightly/closely matching the MSM's description of the guy

       If it shows nothing but him carrying in bags 5 times. Then that all we see. I am not asking for a smoking gun. But they have high res video and everyone knows it. So we just wanna see it. Its like a dashcam only way better megapixels and not shaky.

       Haha, so ironic. But seriously, I don't think this thread is advocating surveillance, it is asking why the msm hasn't released cam footage like they usually would.

       I mean I do not agree with the Patriot act, but I still ask why terrorists are able to blow up pipe bombs in Manhattan. Isn't the NSA or DHS supposed to catch this stuff?

       So the going idea that the NSA/DHS/alphabet agencies are monitoring all communications traffic isn't true, or they can't possibly filter out all terror comms from every platform - which makes sense, if you take half a second to think about how many communications platforms actually exist.

       Christtttt haha I never said I’m cool with it man. I guess my comment didn’t state I’m 100% against it (which I am) I’m just saying it’s already there. They claim we need it. It’s not insane for people to want it to be used now. Someone probably has video of me jerking it that I have no idea about. We’re under surveillance 24/7. There should be footage of this guy.

       That would be a start. Hell with how many guns they're claiming he supposedly had, there should be a good amount of footage of him back and forth whether it was over several weeks/days etc. Hopefully we'll see it, but I'm not holding my breath. Fully expecting it to be grainy and low light if they do release it since this is 1990 and not 2017.

       Am i the only one that sees the real problem with this narrative? He didnt need 17 rifles to do this. Hell he didnt even need 5 rifles to do this. An AR with a slide fire and several drums would have fit the bill. If he was worried about the barrel getting too hot, then sure bring an extra rifle. But 17?!? Bullshit. The guy wasnt stupid by any means. Why would you risk bringing in that much hardware when two at most wouldve done it. Am I supposed to believe he was going to tape them together like ridley on aliens and go to the gambling floor hipfiring all the bluehairs sitting at the slots? Gimme a break.

       I hate to say it but that could've been exactly the plan. The smoke from the guns and the smoke detector giving away his location would be the thing he didn't count on. There was also explosive material found in his car, so I think it's obvious there was some further plan after leaving Mandalay Bay, it just never got that far.

       Are they though? I've heard this before, but I know not all Vegas hotels are created equal. Mandalay Bay may seem fancy, but in terms of Strip hotels it's probably considered 2nd or 3rd tier at this point.

       Again, i doubt he was that careless if he planned it out logically. I find it hard to believe he was planning on going mobile at any point. The average number of firearms used or brought by mass shooters is roughly around four. Granted, there have been more shooters that conducted their assault on foot with smaller firearms as opposed to a static position such as this. A static position makes more sense to have a larger cache as fatigue isnt as much a factor as in a mobile attack. But 23 is much higher than the norm. The room screams last stand yet there was ammonium nitrate and other guns and ammo in the car. That explosive alone wouldve accomplished an incredibly higher loss of life if driven into the crowd and detonated. Its easy to see two very different planned methods of attack which doesnt fit.

       I could see him planning everything out methodically and then overlooking one small detail. It goes along with him not having much/any military experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing that really sticks out to me is him having video surveillance in the hallway only to shoot himself prior to SWAT breaching the room. In theory anyone could have used that video surveillance to warn them of oncoming police presence and then exit the room leaving Paddock's body behind with 'self inflicted' gunshot wound to the head. I think these scenarios are the ones police/fbi should be investigating.

       I think he thought he could get out. He had two adjoining rooms. Maybe thought he could get out of the second room while they were evacuating people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if the dummy couldn't find his key to the second room and foiled his own plan.

       Replying to your chain of comments in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's assume the "lone wolf" crap is true. Let's assume it's a rampage shooting [which yes, is a big assumption to make] and not politically/religiously motivated. The problem is you're looking for a needle of rationality in a haystack of irrationality. Sociopaths are often intelligent, but also do a lot of shit that doesn't make sense. So yes, just because he was effective at achieving his goal doesn't mean he had it planned out all that well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd argue that he went ahead with the "plan" well before it was ready. He obviously was going the explosives route, but for whatever reason abandoned it (praise jesus). Maybe he got spooked and was paranoid his purchases would raise suspicions. Maybe he wanted to do it while the Filino was out of the country. Maybe he just ran out of time. Who knows. Maybe the explosives were going to be a diversion (ie he calls in a bomb threat which prevents police from storming the building). Maybe there was originally a "getaway" in the making and he thought he could confuse the cops on how many shooters there were if he had multiple guns. Or hell, maybe he had 4 weapon configurations he liked for various purposes. IE 4 with bipods+scopes, 4 with bump mods, 4 with close quarters sights etc.,
      </p>
      <p>
       All his actual "planning was" was to buy a shitload of guns and get a good vantage point. Everything else was thankfully a complete failure.

       Only reason I know anything about the Holmes trial was that my step-mom's grandson was shot while using his body to cover a woman and child.  He has lingering neuropathy, but is still going about his life.

       So as a disclaimer we can agree that video footage can be doctored/altered/created on the internet and be totally fake. On that note its possible I could have seen a video of what hit the Pentagon on 9/11. Some non-mainstream youtuber I came across during the last election began to act a little strange at one point during a brief period of time; sounding a little worried and hesistant. He usually commented on WikiLeaks and Podesta stuff etc. Then all of a sudden for about a week or so...no new content. Then one day...a video is posted...its about 6-8 seconds long...of a missle hitting the Pentagon. Then another short period of no new content. He's back doing podcasts now with callers and he seems back to his normal self talking about WikiLeaks and other stuff.

       She wasn't even in the country and is/was visiting family in the Philippines. Could she have knowledge he was going to do this? Possibly, but she has no physical link due to the distance.

       We need to find out what kind of guns first. I have quite a few guns myself. Guns can be taken down and then they can be concealed in bags/garment bags. The largest piece obviously being the barrel.

       The guy who shot the politicians was shot at the scene and died at the hospital. The guy who ran through the people in a car drove away and was apprehended soon after. This guy was found dead in the hotel room where he was attacking others. What are you talking about?

       I do, but there is no context. Prior to being apprehended? Prior to the incident? Prior to being born? Prior to the universe forming? My response is clearly about the time between the incident and being apprehended. Who knows what OP is talking about.

       First, anyone firing into a crowd of country music fans is doing so because they are patriotic white Americans. It is the whitest, most Republican event you can possibly attack. Country music is one of the last remaining cultural symbols of American patriotism, however flawed it may be. You must count that.

       Shootings happened right on Yom Kippur. An event in Judaism, when escape goats are killed as a sacrifice to Azazel - Demon of the Desert (Las Vegas). This is ancient Jewish tradition. This is center of their Cult.

       More coincidence - this happened right in front of of Luxor Pyramid Hotel (NOT Mandalay Bay Hotel, like News says). Look at this photos:

       It didn't happen in front of the Luxor. The front of the Luxor doesn't have a venue. Mandalay and Luxor are close to each other. It was on Mandalay grounds and because the Luxor is big it looks like they were at the base. They weren't.

       I can't find it, but it was a gif that showed the hotel, there was a big sign on the right side, and next to it you could see the flashing coming from the upper floor of the hotel. Let me keep trying to find it.

       If they released the tapes, you would demand footage of him opening the bags and pulling out the guns. So tell me, what would be the point of them releasing the footage to appease some random internet poster? You've already decided it was a false flag, and your paranoia has already driven you to fantasize about some shadowy organization staging the shooting for some shadowy agenda that is targeting you for some shadowy purpose.

       Normally I'm the first one to say 'what the hell has [X] got to hide by not showing this footage?!', but in this case I actually think there's a fair argument for them not to show the footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most Vegas hotels are basically kept afloat by their prestige. It would do almost nothing
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       them by showing this video, and would potentially harmful their future business, footage of a terrorist / madman carting stuff past their unwitting security.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I'm all for this footage being released, but they will never, ever do so unless compelled to do so.

       That, and they may not want to inadvertently reveal wholes in their camera setup to people out to cheat the tables. There's a number of reasons not to release the footage actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest thing for me though, is it's a private business. If this were a public camera, like a traffic camera for example, I'd be more willing to push for the release of the footage, since we don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy in public and because we've paid for those cameras via taxation. The casino's cameras are theirs, they paid for them. I wouldn't want a huge spectacle over people I don't know demanding me release to the public footage from the CCTV security setup I installed in my own home, so it would be hypocritical of me to demand the casino release theirs.

       It won't happen because there prob isn't any. By that I'm not meaning he isn't on their cameras.  He is just never on their cameras with anything that might even slightly resemble a rifle which would then shit on the narrative being pushed by the MSM.  They are people too who fuck up, BUT they know how to cover their tracks

       The difference is, it would make somewhat sense that one person goes crazy and we don't undertand why or the motive. It would not make sense for the CIA to have a whole super secret plan carefully executed where they pick a guy who makes an awful fallman

       Actually it makes the whole thing more plausible to the general sheep. Now that they can rule out terrorism, disgruntled military, etc... they can focus solely on gun control, which is what this is probably all about.

       There's just so much fishy about the whole situation. I was reading some comments elsewhere, and someone suggested checking out Paddock's tax returns, because the multimillionaire gambler angle was suspect. Another user suggested checking to see if any victims were slated to testify in high profile court cases or something similar. The lack of any discernible motive warrants investigation, and the "he snapped" angle is too convenient.

Either way, These guns can be easily broken down and put in a duffel bag or rolling suitcase and not raise an eyebrow.   What are you inferring?  That it didn't happen, or the CIA helped him?

       if you are just using your hotel for sleeping then you don't really need room service. sometime you just ask the maids in the hall for a fresh towel and say "do not disturb". probably even more common in a casino hotel where you don't want the maid stealing your cash or uncashed in poker chips.

       Wow, the comments are extremely frustrating. So many people saying that the footage won't prove the guy did this.  That's not the point though! If there's nothing to hide, then they can show the footage. I can't believe people are like "nah I don't want to see the footage, it proves nothing". Fuck that, I want to see EVERYTHING available.

       It shouldn't be anyone's business how many you buy but 60?!? That's outrageous. I could see if you were like an antique collector or something and had accumulated that many over your life but 60 in 2 years is insane.

       What about the distance between the hotel, and the concert? Can we assume bullets travelling that distance would reach its target accurately? I say there were snippers closer, and this is just a cover/BS story.

       A term like area of effect comes to mind. Someone shooting accurately and slowly depending on a range of factors can proficiently hit a quarter at 2-400 yards. Hitting a 500x1000 foot area that is packed with people? That is the metaphorical "Hitting the broadside of a barn".

       I get alot of the speculation on this entire situation but him bringing in this many rifles to a hotel room is not that hard to do over several days.
      </p>
      <p>
       First a rifle can be
       <a href="http://www.gunsandammo.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/2/files/how-to-clean-an-ar-15/001_disassembling-your-rifle.jpg">
        broken down
       </a>
       into smaller pieces pretty easily and stored in a suitcase. Hell depending on the suitcase, you could easily fit more than a couple into one. It's the same thing with the tripod.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, everybody talking about "oh they didn't notice this guy bring in several suitcases to his room". Look at the size of that fucking hotel. How many people are leaving/entering daily? How many are lugging suitcases back and forth? How many of you have had hotel parties where groups of people walk by the front counter into a hotel room and the clerk doesn't notice? Now imagine some random old white guy in Vegas(there are plenty I promise) over the course of several days. How much attention do you think was on him?
      </p>
      <p>
       The real challenge for him would've been the ammo. Ammo is heavy and can take up alot of space. But if he broke it down out of the packaging, again he could fit fucking plenty into one or two suitcases.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are plenty of questions about this entire situation. How he got that many weapons/much ammo into his room is not really that hard to fathom.

        The real challenge for him would've been the ammo. Ammo is heavy and can take up alot of space. But if he broke it down out of the packaging, again he could fit fucking plenty into one or two suitcases.

      <p>
       Were all firearms of the same caliber? If not, why bring them all along with the variety of necessary ammo types when he could have just brought a one or two with a lot of magazines with minimal variety of ammo calibers? That would have been so much lighter and minimalistic. I mean, is that not common sense?

       I guess we should all get ready for it: the same way that bags going on airplanes are checked and scanned, or carried on and scanned, they will be doing this in hotels next.  Whoever sells those XRay machines is probably a public traded company with lots of politician investors.  Every fucking Hampton Inn from Miami to Tacoma will be installing them in the front lobby now.  I mean, what's the difference?  Yeah, a plane is a moving object, with dozens if not hundreds of people on board.  A hotel is just a NON-MOVING object with dozens or hundreds of people inside.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just turns my stomach when we have a disaster like this, and the stock markets surge, and some companies in particular, like the gun manufacturers, have banner days.  It makes people more wealthy from tragedy.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's my biggest problem with capitalism.  For one to get rich, someone else must suffer.  It won't end well.

       I wasn't there, I don't know, but I can imagine someone said something to the effect of: "the lights are making it easier to see them!"

       There's also the possibility of exposing LEO in the area. Kill the lights to not give your position.  Again, I wasn't there, just my 2 cents.

       Everyone keeps making it sound like he would look out of place or odd in some way while transporting the guns to the room. Those rifles break down and would easily fit into a normal wheeled suitcase, he had rented the room for many days so him coming and going with a suit case each time wouldn't be at all strange.  He wouldn't have looked like a guy checking into a hotel with normal luggage.

       I hope these answers can help with some of the questions I'm seeing. I've been in the hotel business for 15 years, from a bellman all the way to a General Manager. I hope I can answer the following questions with some insight from my career:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Why didn't anyone stop and question someone transporting luggage full of guns?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       A: Very few hospitality employees would ever question a guest walking through a lobby. People transport massive amount of baggage and boxes throughout the day. In an operation on the scale of the Mandalay Bay, he could have had 20 duffle bags full of guns and no one would bat an eyelash. Vendors for a trade show alone often have that much.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Why didn't anyone question why a single traveler would rent two rooms?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       A: Simply put, hotels don't care. If your credit card goes through and you want two rooms, more power to you. It's not as uncommon as you think. Especially in a "quirky" guest environment like Vegas.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Did Housekeeping see something suspicious and if so, why didn't they report it?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       A: Housekeepers are judged upon their productivity (how long it takes to clean the room). Unless the firearms were completely displayed for all to see, no housekeeper would care. In an environment like the Mandalay Bay and the size of that room, Housekeeping would have about 30 minutes max to clean that room. I'm surprised a person plotting a mass murder would not have a Do Not Disturb sign to be honest.

       Remote drones satellite operated from a distance.
Small weapon drone test, Several Drones.  No one mentions area 51 transport planes near the area  named Janet Air - government run airline who transports people to area 51 to a weapons testing facility......
You need a live scenario for testing the weapons with the drone possible a test for North Korea as well as other governmental agendas.

       I screen shot a pic from google maps of a traffic camera opposite of the tower where shots were fired. I be this camera would have it in the view of where shots were fired along with how many windows shots were being fired from.

       Doesn't matter if video is released. There will be people here who will figure out the make and model of the suitcase, it's dimensions and yell about the suitcases being too small to transport that many gubs.

       I'm a little dissapointed That no one here has come up with the "Tom Petty did it" conspiracy. I mean his death the same time as this Vegas shooting? Clearly Tom Petty snapped and killed those people. His family and record label scared of losing all that money then paid off the coronor to claim heart attack. Come on sheeple!! Tom Petty did it. It's right in front of your face!

       Paddock owned many rifles. Owning does not mean that he has any experience or competency in loading/reloading, shooting accurately, etc. One photo showed a rifle with a 'red-dot' type sight, not a scope. Hitting targets at 300 yards, even within a couple hundred square foot area, takes some practice. With .308 ammo especially, keeping on target with a high rate of fire, is very difficult with the amount of recoil. Even when using a bipod. He had no military or other relevant experience that anyone has shown. If he had visited rifle ranges or gun clubs, it seems that such info would have come out by now. No one has said that they had ever seen him go out shooting, maybe it was out in the remote desert ? Were any targets or (used) gun cleaning supplies found in his home? He had a fishing license once. What is missing?

       It is irrelevant. Unless ur saying he didn't bring the guns in himself. There is no evidence to be gained by seeing the guy give the car to valet and carry his luggage in. It is all very normal hotel activity.

       What, in your opinion, makes a weapon "high-powered?" Is it the caliber its chambered in? The rate of fire? What? This term is nothing more than a scary sounding buzz-word used by the media to demonize guns. An AR-15 chambered in .223/5.56 is not really that "high-powered" compared to pretty much any basic deer rifle. Much less something like a military machine gun chambered in 7.62. And that term is most often used in reference to your everyday semi-automatic AR-15.

       I wouldn't say converting an AR to full auto is super hard to do by any means. The hardest part would be getting all of your paperwork in order.

       Wtf do you mean? It sounds exactly like an M240. Exactly like it. So to say it sounded in no way like a heavy machine gun is idiotic.

       Thanks. I keep my mouth shut about stuff when I don't know what I'm talking about, but this is something I have particular insight into because of my line of work. Just trying to think rationally and go one step at a time until more info comes out. This sub needs to go back toward skepticism and critical thinking instead of the echo chamber of fanatics that think everything is a conspiracy by nature just because It was posted here. Some things in this world are super fishy, some are simple and as they seem.

       It's up to 65,000 dollars to buy one though. I wasn't talking about a tax stamp. I'm talking about the price of the gun which I'm certain it was clear that's what I was stating. Also it's heavily regulated and difficult to get a fully auto light machine gun. You were right it wouldn't be a heavy machine gun it would be a light machine gun. What guns do you think were used?

       On several weapons it's super easy to file down the sear face to such a fine touch that it's technically still semi-auto but in use it's effectively full auto.
      </p>
      <p>
       The downside is you usually lose all control.
       <br/>
       Once you start the clip.  It's going to fire until empty.  You can't stop it.

       The majority of outlets aren't run by the state
      </p>
      <p>
       There are outlets like the Guardian (vehemently independent of UK government, broke Snowden/many Iraq stories), it's direct competition (e.g. The Telegraph, the Observers, the Times -
 all with their own editorial freedom, responsibilities, credibility, accountability standards in
       <em>
        all
       </em>
       news stories) - the media watchdogs that overlook them, the independent journalists, freelancers, Nordic outlets (Norway, Finland, Sweden - considered among the free-est in the world) which is all a drop in ocean compared to the thousands of outlets all over the world
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of these scouring, researching, interviewing, cross-checking - the emergency responders, the police, investigators, hospital staff, doctors, the hundreds of people injured in wards, witnesses, neighbours, friends, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       So far in the last 17 years or so I've seen every major terrorist attack and shooting (911, 7/7 London, Madrid train bombings, Sandy hook, Boston Bombing, Columbine, Charlie Hebdo, Aurora, Paris attacks, multiple recent London attacks, and many more) labelled as false flags or inside jobs on forums within hours of the event
      </p>
      <p>
       The typical progression is that shortly after the attack posters start proclaiming the event is "fishy" or "strange". Other's group-validate that. Others point out not to trust the media/authorities (stage we are at now), then down the line comes the photos with the circles in them and youtube videos with collections of "discrepancies/doubts/holes" in order to discredit the "official" version of events, then interest dwindles until the next major attack/shooting

       Yeah I'm wondering if they returned fire through the door and came in and found him dead from the exchange.  Decided it was better to say self inflicted.

       Many people called saying they saw more shooters. These 'shooters' were SWAT teams with guns entering the hotel. I also heard off-duty cops were in the area with weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because some civilian saw someone with a gun, doesn't mean it was another shooter.
