       salty ungrateful foreigners and anti-american types downvoting, of course. but when it happens to france, it's #prayforfrance ... where is #prayforusa where are the world leaders condemning or individuals or groups of any country of USA or outside USA saying anything ... the silence is deafening and we hear it

       no I am not satisfied with the response, give me some foreign news sources to show mass vigils and prayers and people with USA painted faces and sending money to victim charities and all of that - masses of peoples and their leaders.  so far it looks like a fuck-USA all the way around

       you remember when everyone put a flag filter on their profiles for france and any other country that had a similar attack, and the twitter and facebook trends were positive and genuine messages of people from all over the world?  where was that for USA?  all we got was total bullshit.

       Lol I donâ€™t see Facebook trying to get strict Muslims to wear a filter . Who the fuck cares ? Itâ€™s our country. We donâ€™t really support others ( and you think youâ€™d be happy with a Facebook filter ? Hate to tell you that doesnâ€™t do shit )

      <p>
       We send aid and military . Weâ€™re number one , but asking to have our dicks sucked just sounds weird. Support your neighbor . If you think other countries citizens think like us at all you really need to get out more . Calm down bro.

       USA gets no foreign news, all we get is news about what a piece of shit country and president we are, and how we are so corrupt and always under investigations from both major parties.  They pump fear and division to the extreme.  It is a living nightmare.  No one in USA has any idea what is going on outside of USA they keep us in informational control manipulation bubble.

       Just FYI the constitution was designed to grow and change . Yeah gun rights were written by in but the founding fathers expected progress and change. Obviously even in 1700s we knew society would invent and progress. Iâ€™m not saying take away guns but Jesus , think of what the founding fathers would have written maybe if they knew you could fire a thousand rounds a minute and be a one man army ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just calm the fuck down. No ones saying take t away but fuck man, if you wanna join the army you gotta take a personality test right ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe do that shit ? Sure it would catch everyone but it could easily catch some. Itâ€™s like a car man, you wanna drive on the road ? Maybe take a gun test showing you know safety. I bet youâ€™d have a ton of red neck fathers in the south loving that shit ; imagine, raising your kid on guns, practicing with them, then the big day comes they take their gun license , pass their mental state and every 5 years have to take the test again ( only if they wanna renew it )
      </p>
      <p>
       Iâ€™m just saying I could see it as a bonding thing for familyâ€™s .
      </p>
      <p>
       Driving is a privilege right ? Well maybe make gun owning a right that requires certain goals be met and as an American if youâ€™re fit , boom youâ€™re allowed. But Jesus man there does need to be a change.

       I don't have to imagine what they think they wrote it down in the founders documents and notes stating clearly that USA citizens will have "of like kind weapons" of that of the military and each citizen will have a rifle and ammo "of like kind" when you attack this you attack USA

       Israel, noted.  This is how a true friend should behave.  Yet Israel gets shit on here, isn't that interesting.  Where is Macron and Merkel crawling on their knees with tears - or their populations?  In natural human gatherings or in social media?  Where were the top-trending sympathy hashtags?  Where was the outpouring of support that has similarly followed such events from USA and the World in other countries?  Where is the message from the Pope and Vatican Officials?  Are all their words just divisive bullshit calls to attack USA Constitution - how insulting on top of an insult.

       That's pretty bullshit, the CIA are a small number of people compared to the population of the USA and all the USA people have done in all of history to support freedom around the world sacrificing their blood for others are you saying the USA people who were murdered like dogs at a country music celebration are not worthy of pity that is pure evil and I will remember you said that for next time you are insulting and ungrateful what country do you claim for your own so I know whom you represent with that comment.

       This universal hatred of the USA that you are alleging is artifically manufactured propaganda and not representative of factual reality in that many countries and peoples love the USA deeply as much as or more than even their own countries even in spite of them being constantly bombarded just like the people inside the USA are with anti-USA hatred.  The hate-USA narrative is a conspiracy as is the suppression of news to the USA of countries or people outside of the USA who have or would express their love and support for USA and what it stands for.  The anti-USA machine is cranking overtime, this event proves it even more.

       I do agree that there is propaganda out there to make people hate the USA and I think the amount of movies and series that feature the USA have created a generation of "America fans" that wish life was like the TV and know too much about the US and know English (Im one of them), these people will always act as ambassadors for the USA, there is love for the USA out there, but they are surrounded by people who have been trained by the globalist left to hate capitalism.

       Oh I am in the USA but in no way am I proud of that. I hold so much hate for this evil country. We are bullies. Not to mention greedy, fat, selfish, careless, fucking idiots. Our government kills our own people all the time and we just watch we don't care. They divide us and we let them. They spend money on military that should be spent on healthcare and education. We kill countless people in other countries. We elected a god damn television star who did nothing to get where he is. He was born rich and stayed rich. We kill and we consume and we have no respect for anyone or anything. We as a country are fucking terrible. I am in no way proud to be an American. Maybe someday when things change when our water and our air isn't poisoned. When every color, sex, sexual orientation, religion can accepted each other and not kill each other. Maybe when our police stop killing people. Maybe when our government stops blaming their agendas on made up terrorist. Maybe when we stop fighting pointless wars. Maybe when we stop wasting money, maybe when our homeless have respect and help. Maybe when healthcare and mental health and education are taken seriously. Maybe when poor families aren't shoved on the back burners and succumbed to drugs, prison, or just a personal everyday hell. Maybe when the rich start giving a fuck about anything but themselves. You see though none of that will ever happen. The last thing I give a flying fuck about is if other countries care that an American person (government) shot a bunch of people. Bad shit happens every fucking day and it just keeps getting worse. We can't expect all the other countries to stop and give a fuck about 58 dead people when they have acid attacks, bombs, on purpose accidents killing people, our soldiers killing their people. So yes what a hateful and selfish post.

       Two out of three buddy! I am not anti USA. I am more anti government. The USA is what it is we aren't the only shitty country in fact we may not even be the shittiest. However we are terrible and no one really gives a fuck and that's the problem. I am a girl and a young one and I work a good job and I pay my taxes, and I stand when they sing the anthem, and I feel for our military, I have many family members who were in it and are reallllll fucked up because of it, but the GOVERNMENT (who I am really against) doesn't help and doesn't care. I support the right to have guns, and I support the right to say what the fuck you want when you want to, and I support the amendment that says if the government is shit we as a people should abolish it. However we as a people are so brainwashed we just sit and watch tv and eat food and browse the web and consume consume consume. You are apart of the problem so proud of your country (a stolen country) but why? Why are you so proud? What is there to be proud of? You are so concerned with other countries yet you can't see all the problems with your own beloved country ....
