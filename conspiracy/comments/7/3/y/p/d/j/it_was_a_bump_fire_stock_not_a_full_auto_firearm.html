        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know its kind of a dark thing to bring up; but, I also have other questions. Was it just me or did anyone else hear more than one firearm being discharged? From the first video I saw I thought there was more then one firearm being used. I also took into account acoustics and still couldn&#39;t justify in my mind that that was a one man operation. Am I the only one?</p>

<p>Part of the reason I&#39;m asking this question is because I can see a bump fire giving me this impression but what I heard was full automatic. I don&#39;t watch tv or follow any mainstream news beyond my local paper so I&#39;m not up to date on the &quot;facts&quot; given us by the talking heads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You guys can keep your guns but the bump fire stock needs to be banned. Automatic weapons are illegal. This device turns your semi automatic into an automatic rifle and you can buy the thing online and install it yourself. It&#39;s absurd that these things are legal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no it turns a semi-auto into a semi-auto with a very high rate of fire. Fully automatic means you just pull the trigger and let &#39;er rip. But i do agree bump fire stocks could use some modified regulations</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really dont agree. But only because a well trained shooter doesn&#39;t need a bump fire stock to level 50+ people in a couple of minutes. Rounds shot that quickly are for suppression so the actual marksman can take out enemies. This is something you learn with guns. Automatic fire is not &quot;more&quot; deadly. In fact it is probably worse on body count than a well trained marksman.</p>

<p>I guess thats why USA failed so miserably in Vietnam/Iraq/Afghanistan.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t win with conventional warfare against an insurgency. A civil war would involve exactly that, patriot insurgency.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t underestimate the ingenuity of people during an insurgency. Watch that video of a guy in syria sneaking up on a tank and tossing a small grenade down the muzzle, destroying the whole thing. </p>

<p>Sorry that you are such a victim of your own countries propaganda that you feel so totally owned by your own military that you don&#39;t think you would stand a chance. I feel sorry for you.</p>

Who did such with weapons against their own government, their own &#39;military.&#39; The reason our rights allow us to keep arms is so we, the people, aren&#39;t suppressed by our government. They were quite open about the reason we should have weapons. The world has changed quite a lot since then, morals/greed/power haven&#39;t. Needless to say, I am a proud gun owner.
