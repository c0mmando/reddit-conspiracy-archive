       I know its kind of a dark thing to bring up; but, I also have other questions. Was it just me or did anyone else hear more than one firearm being discharged? From the first video I saw I thought there was more then one firearm being used. I also took into account acoustics and still couldn't justify in my mind that that was a one man operation. Am I the only one?
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of the reason I'm asking this question is because I can see a bump fire giving me this impression but what I heard was full automatic. I don't watch tv or follow any mainstream news beyond my local paper so I'm not up to date on the "facts" given us by the talking heads.

       You guys can keep your guns but the bump fire stock needs to be banned. Automatic weapons are illegal. This device turns your semi automatic into an automatic rifle and you can buy the thing online and install it yourself. It's absurd that these things are legal.

       no it turns a semi-auto into a semi-auto with a very high rate of fire. Fully automatic means you just pull the trigger and let 'er rip. But i do agree bump fire stocks could use some modified regulations

       I really dont agree. But only because a well trained shooter doesn't need a bump fire stock to level 50+ people in a couple of minutes. Rounds shot that quickly are for suppression so the actual marksman can take out enemies. This is something you learn with guns. Automatic fire is not "more" deadly. In fact it is probably worse on body count than a well trained marksman.

       What the fuck? How is an automatic weopon not more deadly when you're firing into a huge crowd of people? No human can finger could pull the trigger as fast as it pulls when you install the bump fire stock.

       No but you are being silly and quite silly with your comments and understanding. You probably weren't taught at a truly liberal school growing up though. So it stands to reason your emotional state.

       If all 19 weapons (and 23 at his home) were all semi automatics that he purchased legally we would still see similar discussions about the 2nd amendment because it would have been just as effective if he was trained.  Do you think this 60+ y/o wealthy retiree whose own brother debunked any interest in guns/politics/religion purchased and meditated this tragedy when it is obvious there is more then one actor

       I guess thats why USA failed so miserably in Vietnam/Iraq/Afghanistan.

       You can't win with conventional warfare against an insurgency. A civil war would involve exactly that, patriot insurgency.

       Don't underestimate the ingenuity of people during an insurgency. Watch that video of a guy in syria sneaking up on a tank and tossing a small grenade down the muzzle, destroying the whole thing.

       Answer: No, you couldn't buy a tank at Wal-Mart because it wouldn't fit through the door.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was kinda a silly question, have you ever been in a wal-mart?  You couldn't even fit a decent sized truck through the door.

       Stupid answer. Forget the fucking Wal-Mart part then. Should I be allowed to buy a tank and a rocket launcher?

       Hm... but you were using the Wal-Mart part in an attempt at reductio ad absurdum.  Do you think I'm going to let you try to pretend you were being serious and arguing in good faith the whole time?

       Although most people don't read anymore our fathers of this great nation were REBELS. Who did such with weapons against their own government, their own 'military.' The reason our rights allow us to keep arms is so we, the people, aren't suppressed by our government. They were quite open about the reason we should have weapons. The world has changed quite a lot since then, morals/greed/power haven't. Needless to say, I am a proud gun owner. I don't ever plan to use my weapons on anyone but they are there if I need them. Every minute of every day.

       I like how if I refined the mod to say, fire 1500 rounds a minute, somebody would split hairs and tell me it's still a semi auto. It's most def a worthwhile discussion to say "should joe public be able to lay down rounds like this."
