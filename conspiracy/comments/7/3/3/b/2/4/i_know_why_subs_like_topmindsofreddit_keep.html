        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After my experience with a group of you this afternoon I entirely understand why anti-conspiracy subs keep popping up. It isn&#39;t because you&#39;re on to something, or because some 3 letter agency has it out for you. It&#39;s because a vocal, hostile, ignorant, and possibly mildly retarded group of you rudely attack anything that goes against the leading &quot;theory&quot; accepted here. </p>

<p>Funnily enough, it&#39;s exactly the same mindset the anti-conspiracy subs have, except their &quot;theory&quot; is the official line. </p>

<p>It is entirely possible that there are shills in there, maybe it was even started by some. </p>

<p>But many of them are probably real people, who got berated, called a shill, and told to go fuck themselves in this sub when presenting factual information.</p>

<p>I know what I&#39;ve said is not representative of everyone who participates here, I have some pretty good conversation and debate with some of you, but unfortunately you share a sub with these cretins, and they really do deserve every bit of the mockery they get. </p>

<p>If you want places like topmindsofreddit to go away eventually, you&#39;re going to need to change the way you handle information at odds with your beliefs. </p>

<p>Be better than them, or at least be polite.</p>

<p>Granted, after being told to &quot;fuck myself&quot; I got angry and said a few choice words myself that deserve some downvotes. A look at my comment history will show my downward spiral from there. But that&#39;s exactly how <strong>r/conspiracy is recruiting for topminds.</strong> You are adding to their userbase, and posts keep popping up wondering &quot;why we keep getting messed with&quot;</p>

<p>You do it to yourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jesus Christ, do you know why they use medical helicopters? They took the injured (of which there were very few) to a hospital 11 miles away. You don&#39;t call in multiple medical helicopters for a 11 mile car trip that is a straight shot down the highway. They use medical helicopters when the distance is far enough that it&#39;s speed would be significantly more beneficial for the patient. Not just for the fuck of it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you fully understand the concept of &quot;evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>I know firemen were passing out pizza slices at one point. People have to eat in order to survive though, so I don&#39;t see a conspiracy with that one. And people have to shit and piss. It was a large event, they&#39;d be there for awhile. Why is that weird?</p>

<p>Again, please provide some sort of evidence or proof to support your claims. I&#39;ve heard about the &quot;everyone must check in&quot; sign before, but I&#39;ve seen no pictures to prove it. I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s unreasonable to want to make sure that there aren&#39;t any unauthorized people entering a crime scene like the one that was at the school.</p>

<p>Please, source SOMETHING. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats a good method , usually I just take a minute and look through their comment history. </p>

<p>Really don&#39;t care about the drama between the two subs either.  I haven&#39;t been active here in years. I&#39;ve seen the question of how people can be so anti-conspiracy come up often. How they&#39;ll &quot;never wake up.&quot; </p>

<p>Well.... Try not being a douchebag when explaining your &quot;theory.&quot; People might respond to that better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand what you&#39;re saying, but only to an extent. Just as there is right and wrong here, there exists right and wrong on that sub. They have the same type of sycophants, only those who relish the opportunity to take a few toxic jabs at this place. Two wrongs don&#39;t make a right. This isn&#39;t (necessarily) a place for hate, but it is the very foundation of that sub. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what that is.</p>

<p>All I know about them I learned in that stickied post this week. I used their hatesub to illustrate the idea that telling people to go fuck themselves and generally being a doosh isn&#39;t helping the percieved problem, just makes it worse by adding to their numbers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m subbed to TMoR mostly because i think many of the conspiracy theories are bloody hillarious, though there are the ones like vaccines that actually cause harm to people.</p>

<p>This sub could have been a great place to discuss things off the widely accepted rhetoric, but instead it has now mostly become a Trump lovin echo chamber. You get a few people like yourself who go against the grain slightly in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and get abused.</p>

<p>Honestly though, the vast vast vast majority of TMoR people are just like me, we&#39;re not some mad brigade against conspiracies.</p>
