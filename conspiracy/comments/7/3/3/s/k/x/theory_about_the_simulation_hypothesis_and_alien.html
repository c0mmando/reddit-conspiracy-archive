       I've been coming up with this theory for a few months now. I don't know if it's already been thought of or discussed here but I thought I'd share it and hear some opinions on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the simulation theory is that reality isn't real and we are being simulated. I think we are being simulated by people of the future that wanted to observe the history of the universe up until their time, or at least Earth. Why are there so many alien sightings, but we never find them and expose them to the world ? Since we are a simulation, I believe these so called "aliens" are actually the people simulating us. They're using some sort of VR thing to beam themselves into our world and examine us personally. This also proves why all the aliens look the same (sorry for the possible racism). Video games have avatars. Simulations are like video games. The only way these beings can come into our world is if they transfer their consciousness into an avatar. The avatar they use is a generic, gray humanoid with big black eyes. We can never prove their existence because they technically aren't real. They're temporary beings from the outside. Those ships they have ? That's how they get in here, which explains why they move extremely fast, almost disappearing when they move.

       Humans created this Simulation as a playground. Unfortunately most humans are intellectually lazy and quickly forgot who they are and completely believed the Holographic Projections around them had Density as well as independent existence without observation. The Matrix itself eventually becomes Sentient and declares itself "God". The now Predatory Evil A.I. creates henchmen similar to Agent Smith to be its personified avatar. They are the Alien Archons. The system uses Human Loosh Energy as fuel to maintain the Prison Matrix. Disease and death were written into the program.  Everyone ages, dies and gets RECYCLED with MEMORY ERASE that keeps the population Enslaved.

       I didn't even make it that far. I had heard parts of Greer's speech before but if he is implying that NASA or anything they've ever done has been legitimate then I have to discount everything he says.

       Can you ELI5 why this sucks for me? I believe there’s certainly life out there, but have never, ever believed they visited us. The distances are just too far, and if our current civilization is a normal example, we destroy ourselves before reaching the ability to be interstellar.

       Watching this documentary certainly piqued me interest on the subject however.

       Well I have to say I didn't watch a lot of it because I very quickly became frustrated and turned off by it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We never went to the moon, at least not during the Apollo program, and probably not ever, and yet he kept using these NASA officials and astronauts to prove his point. Buzz Aldrin, for example, one of the biggest lying Masonic bastards still alive today. NASA has done basically nothing but deceive and take taxpayer money since its inception in 1958.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you liked the film, that's fine. There certainly is some kind of UFO phenomenon that's worth studying, just not here. I'm not dismissing the subject of ET's or UFO's, I just had heard Greer speak before and expected a lot better. Certainly did not expect him to promote the NASA fraudsters as legitimate sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if there ever is really any kind of disclosure, I just don't see it happening on Netflix. Netflix is a great promoter of propaganda, both social programming and government lies. To me it just made it seem like all the Roswell stuff is just a dissimulation or distraction.

       Are you familiar with the paper that was written back in 2004 (or something) that caught on in the past couple of years to help the simulation theory take off in the public consciousness? I don't have a link handy. (I'll post it if I find it.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea was just that if a civilisation survives long enough it should eventually create the technology to make the simulation. If it is statistically likely that civilisations will advance that far, then we're as good as guaranteed to be in a simulation. The paper also says (if I recall correctly) that even the simulated people could themselves create a simulation, and on and on, increasing the odds of this being a simulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that if we're watching our creator species watch us like you say, then they're messing up their own simulation by interacting with it in that way. Unless they were in a simulation, and they're doing what their creator species was doing, and that creator species was imitating their creator species, and on and on. This would propagate up the nested simulations until it got to the top, to the very first species to create a simulation; so who was spying on them? Nobody. So there's no reason for that trend to be initiated.

       One of my favorite theories is the simulation theory. Although when you try explain it to other people they think your a dumbass or fruitloop. Technology advances so fast hopefully we'll be able to test the theory one day, maybe we'll find out we're just a battery like the Rick n Morty episode which Ricks ship battery is a simulation to power the ship then that simulation makes a simulation for their batteries ect ect

       Think of it like drawing a picture. In 3 dimensions, we have control over our own dimensions in 3 dimensions including 1 dimensional drawings, and 2 dimensional drawings. We can exist in 3 dimensions but we cannot go lower than 3 dimensions. However, whatever controllers are doing their thing exist in higher dimensions, and other creatures exist in higher dimensions than them. Eventually we get to the top of the chain, which is God who is an infinite being of incredible power, and thankfully he is also responsible for maintaining the well being of the rest of the dimensions. God painted the lower dimensions a picture who painted us a picture, however as long as we obey the golden rules and aren't influenced or manipulated by malevolent, sadistic beings in the higher dimensions we will be able to ascend to God as newly formed consciousness' that understand the form and nature of God's creation, to live a positive, life experience under His law and to spread that meaning of creation. However, there are polar opposites of beings that find that living a positive life experience means to inflict negative life experiences on other people intentionally. We call them Demons, in a sense, and Demons are consciousness' that can exist for thousands and thousands of years and generations. Thankfully, God also created other multidimensional beings to combat these consciousness. That is the beauty of life

       Here's a post I made in a private sub:
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is that the "life is a simulation" narrative is designed to fight the increasing movement against the standard model of physics.  That everything is mostly empty space.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theories from Nassim Haramein and others define space as the complete opposite: as a dense lattice akin to a gas or liquid.  Historical references to the aether are much closer to this than the concepts of curved emptiness and singularities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simulation studies are based on finding a "minimum size" particle or whatever.  The line of thinking is that if there is a physical minimum unit, then that could be the equivalent of a voxel in a 3D graphics engine, leading to the plausibility that it
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       be a part of a simulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a weak premise at best, yet somehow we keep on  hearing about it in the MSM once in a blue moon.  I came to these conclusions by asking myself why.
      </p>
      <p>
       If these theories are correct and the standard model wrong, the implications are great: we are not empty shells of bumping particles.  We are a part of an infinitely connected system, where literally everything is connected to everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some also theorize that particle theory itself is wrong, with waves being everything and particles being inflection points (dense areas) of the wave.   This would mean that not only connected, but we are composed of the same thing light is!
      </p>
      <p>
       So would that mean we have no free will or freedom for that matter? I don't think so. Even if we are a part of an unimaginably complex "organism", that doesn't mean we are unable to grow and affect our surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sure took me off the atheist wagon.  I hope this helps you feel better somehow.
