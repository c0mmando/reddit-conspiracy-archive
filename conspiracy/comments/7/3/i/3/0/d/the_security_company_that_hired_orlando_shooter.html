        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>G4S, a global security firm, and basically a scam ran out of the City of London, suddenly replaced the old security team at US Bank Stadium.  US Bank is where the next Super Bowl will be held in 2018.</p>

<p><em>&quot;U.S. Bank Stadium operator SMG abruptly terminated its contract with security provider Monterrey Security one year into a three-year contract for sloppy recordkeeping, as well as inadequate training and background checks, officials announced Tuesday.&quot;</em></p>

<p>My first thought...but the same people who are responsible for the Orlando Shooting were hired as a replacement?  DOESN&quot;T MAKE SENSE.</p>

<p><strong>Minneapolis Star Tribune</strong>
<a href="http://www.startribune.com/security-firm-at-u-s-bank-stadium-is-fired/447991883/">http://www.startribune.com/security-firm-at-u-s-bank-stadium-is-fired/447991883/</a></p>

<p>Cathy L. Lanier, former Chief of Police for D.C., was appointed as NFL Security in September of 2016.  Cathy is a well connected person, a Knights of Malta member, friend of the Podestas, and with her background in terrorism...I&#39;m looking at this security replacement a little closer, especially with the ANTHEM PROTESTS.</p>

<p>Right now, repairs are being made to stadium, but the <em>&quot;costs of the repairs remain a mystery&quot;</em>. That&#39;s odd because its heavily tax payer funded, and they&#39;ve made other cost disclosures throughout process for add-on features.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m also, not sure what from my comment made you think my OC had anything to do with it being the same stadium every year. These companies aren&#39;t dumb.... If they were your thread now would be neutralized and forgotten into the winds. My small tech company plans out its business opportunities in terms of 2 weeks sprints 3 years in advance..... They make about 20 million a year..... </p>

<p>You think it&#39;s impossible for a security company that obviously can&#39;t be blamed for something pretty obvious, taking over the security of the largest and most grossing sporting event of the year. It&#39;s just that I&#39;m trying to look at it more dynamically. Than what looks like obvious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re involved in some shady shit- but they&#39;re also the world&#39;s largest security company.  I&#39;m shocked that they didn&#39;t already have the superbowl contract.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realize this is quite late to your thread, but I have been thinking about the same thing.           </p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it&#39;s how I found your thread. Anyway, this is all I could come up with;          </p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/Kjn23#selection-983.0-983.101">https://archive.is/Kjn23#selection-983.0-983.101</a>                </p>

<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4562788/eBay-touts-try-cash-Manchester-tribute-concert.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4562788/eBay-touts-try-cash-Manchester-tribute-concert.html</a>          </p>

<p>I <em>SWEAR</em> I heard the same security company mentioned from Manchester/Grande concert bombing was taking over the Super Bowl, too. You&#39;re not alone in remembering that ~          </p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep digging, although I am a complete noob and cannot/don&#39;t know how to &quot;dig&quot; like the real MVP&#39;s like the chans, etc.          </p>

<p>EDIT - holy shizz, I think I was searching &quot;GS4&quot; instead of &quot;G4S&quot; <em>derp</em>         </p>

<p>While I still believe info has been scrubbed from search engines, (even DuckDuckGo it seems) at least I got a <em>few</em> more results using <strong>&quot;G4S&quot;</strong>  and <strong>&quot;G4S SECURITY&quot;</strong> and I&#39;ve linked them below. Maybe you or somebody with better digging skills can do something with it?          </p>

<p>I pray we&#39;re not too late, and I pray nobody is injured or killed. Hopefully the Q-level White Hats have already thwarted it or are ready to anyway.         </p>

<p>In moving to deny the license renewal, board Chairman Richard Hodsdon said Monterrey had “hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of individuals performing security functions” who weren’t properly trained or licensed to perform the jobs under Minnesota law.</p>

<p>The report even included a photograph of a felon wearing a Monterrey uniform standing on the field, checking security credentials, during the Vikings game against the New York Giants game last year. That man, Ricky Pouncil, was sentenced to 13 months in an extortion case involving a man who was having an extramarital affair and killed himself.

    <div class="md"><p>Looking into the second security company hired, Whelan Security, and it looks like something weird is going on in the glassdoor employment ratings.  </p>

<p>Overall the company has about a 2.5 star rating but when I filter specifically to the MN location it comes up as 4.8 out of 5 stars, and the overall trend graph for the location says that it was at 1.5 stars a little prior to March 2016, then spiked almost straight up to get to its current rating.  </p>

<p>There are only 8 reviews which obviously can skew the numbers drastically but I went through each of the 8 ratings (overall rating + the sub-ratings on work/life, benefits, etc.) and there&#39;s no way the numbers could get to a 4.8 overall rating without weighting the reviews in a mathematically unrealistic way. </p>

<p>Also, if you look at the dates of the ratings they don&#39;t correspond to the trend line graph. There aren&#39;t enough reviews prior to the huge spike in March 2016 to improve the score that quickly. And even if there&#39;s a ridiculously heavy skew on the more &#39;recent&#39; reviews vs. older review, the trend line would look different (drawn out over more time vs. almost straight up).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve definitely seen some skew on employer ratings before on this site but this seems blatant and misleading, not to mention suspicious!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm this is curious indeed. If they are up to no good, they certainly have enough time to set it up and put it all into place. Maybe they let the former agency go because they couldn&#39;t buy off the people needed to go along with it. Or didn&#39;t trust them enough to approach them with the idea of whatever is planned.</p>

<p>I would like to think this NFL issue is settled though in the next couple weeks at least. I so looked forward to fall and the season and now it&#39;s all just blah.</p>

<p>Nice catch OP. I wonder if we have any members that live near that stadium that could keep an eye on it and see if they notice any extra coming and goings of things moving around or whatever. Would be great to have photos in advance of any disaster if you know what I mean</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Superb insight! Unexplained costs of repairs sounds like false flag territory for sure. Jesus, a stadium with that much glass that seems to be flimsily installed is suspicious as well and a prime target.</p>

<p>Speculation activated:</p>

<p>Perhaps she was given a cushy job to shut up about Seth Rich after stepping down amidst her remarks of rampant corruption in the DC Metro Police force. Possible she will be the fall girl for whatever they are planning at the super bowl as well.</p>

<p>Perhaps she is now on their side (TPTB) and is actively covering up DC Metro, and G4S corruption. A pretty face helps ease peoples minds even if just subconsciously. Considering G4S&#39;s track record they make a very odd pick. This might be a way to set off a loud harmless bomb and have some panels shatter,  cue crisis actors. </p>

<p>However I believe they will need a group of &quot;perpetrators&quot; to try and push us towards war with another country.  Lone Wolf explanation wont convince enough people. My Money is on Venezuela as they don&#39;t have a superpower to back them up. Plus they can manufacture stories about revenge against America and the CIA, which rightfully they should be mad at. I mean it wasn&#39;t long ago that Venezuela had a hijacked police helicopter drop some sort of explosive on government buildings. The &quot;hijacker&quot; was a famous police officer known to do movies. Accusations of CIA air support was rampant as well.</p>

<p>Then there is the possibility of this being a way to have us digging into a lead while they actively pull some shady shit elsewhere. Oh the possibilities! :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice job.</p>

<p>We should probably all be keeping eyes out for, and then sharing, odd coincidences/items-of-interest.  The US wants a war with NK and we&#39;re not shy about false-flags.  A big, national pride event like the super bowl would be just the thing to get us to start <strong>another</strong> war with a country with &lt;10% of our population.  It would also need to be a large enough catastrophe to garner enough international good-will to <strong>let</strong> the US start yet another war.  South Korea certainly doesn&#39;t want to re-ignite hostilities.  So a false flag has to have pretty major casualties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ugh, G4S are notoriously awful. There have been a lot of scandals in the UK involving them, including things like abuse, child abuse (that old chestnut that keeps popping up whenever you peek into these large global contractors and institutions), deaths, being terrible at security, overcharging, etc. Have included a couple of more recent scandals and then an article about a few of their scandals from earlier years. This stuff just goes to show how the whole free market capitalism thing is a lie, because why would a company this consistently terrible keep getting awarded government contracts?</p>
