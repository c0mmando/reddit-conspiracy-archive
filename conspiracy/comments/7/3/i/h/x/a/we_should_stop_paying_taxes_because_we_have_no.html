Our representatives don&#39;t even write the legislation and do not listen to us, the FCC and net neutrality are a good example. Puerto Rico pays so much in taxes yet can&#39;t even get military help. Hundreds of communities have polluted water. Our president mocks us and wastes money golfing and travelling in luxury while allowing the bottom 80% foot all the bills for the top 5%. We build the NFL stadiums only a microfraction of citizens get to use. We can&#39;t even get 20% of our taxes to pay for our health. Its time to take the power back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The system wants to truly benefit anyone but themselves. It&#39;s all about money, not about human rights, societal/technological advancement or anything like that. No ones actively working on the solution to world peace. They profit too much from war. </p>

<p>You&#39;re right though, if enough people stop paying their taxes, their funding would be cut but they&#39;d turn the rest of society against them with media spin. Hopefully it&#39;d be enough to halt it, but that&#39;d be anarchy. It&#39;s a tough situation. Too many corrupted people in power that have forced us to rely on them, we&#39;re in pretty deep but I believe we can come up with a peaceful solution. </p>

<p>Ftr, i took a vow of poverty years ago, i stopped filing taxes four years ago. </p>

<p>Now, bc i am in the poverty bracket, and if anything i would get money back, idk if this will bite me in the ass, but it shouldnt, ethically.  I dont take any govt monies, i wont give them any to involve me in their schemes. The majority of the wealth goes to help Israel, the Rothschilds and the Queen, in however convulated a way possible.

</blockquote>

<p>People who don&#39;t pay their taxes generally don&#39;t get arrested at all. People who willfully evade the tax law <em>can</em> be charged with a felony, but it hardly ever happens. They just get fined instead, set up a payment plan or whatever, and go on about their lives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is Tether (<a href="https://tether.to/">https://tether.to/</a>) which pairs crypto currency to the dollar and soon there will be crypto which is tethered to gold. But anyway youre wrong also because it&#39;s possible to have small amounts of bitcoin to pay for random stuff and that is way easier to use than paypal, credit cards or western union. Not everyone lives in the USA either. </p>

<p>In the mean time there is <a href="https://www.goldmoney.com/">https://www.goldmoney.com/</a> which is an organization which keeps a gold account for you in fort knox and allows you to spend your gold like a debit card. Blockchain technology is still better though but I agree that volatility is not a good thing for regular people although it&#39;s a lot of fun to day trade. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You must of never been to a place where America under budgets the initial construction then bitches when it&#39;s not billionaire quality. You do not understand class division in infrastructure.... And you&#39;re believing lies that the wealthy spread about the lazy poor. The rich can buy the means to put the poor to work and call it community development but bc of austerity, the people can&#39;t do this. You have no idea about the actual world and live in a fantasy of being able to exploit in times of need. They are Americans like flint Michigan but are fucked bc the people who exploit won&#39;t help when a crisis v happens. The wealthy took too much during development that the base necessities were done subpar so now everyone is fucked, even the rich. The rich will stay clear till the poor do all the work, then slow back up and act like they are responsible for everything. Fuck you you lazy piece of shit surviving off everyone with a high head even though you&#39;re retarded and lazy just have the backing of money and a psychosis that makes you unable to realize how useless and incompetent you are. I challenge you to a task, any task, that we each have to completely do and I&#39;ll laugh when you fail and try to buy Success bc you&#39;re worthless without community. You&#39;re the biggest problem in our world. Bring it You piece of shit. Youre the bottom of the bottom and if love to prove this to you but you&#39;ll be a little bitch until everyone does the work and you can claim it. You&#39;re trash and incompetent.</p>

Every day for a month our neighbors have been going into each others houses and tearing out all the drywall, carpet, furniture, power washing the foundation, hanging new dry wall, etc. Some of my neighbors lost everything. The only help we&#39;ve seen from the government is the county sending a massive garbage truck to pick up everything we have to drag in front of our houses. We&#39;ve seen a lot of help from the local churches. You went on a totally irrelevant ramble that has nothing to do with what I fucking said and lectured me about not understanding class division. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been kicking around the idea for a couple of years now of a system where a tax-payer gets a say in where a percentage of their taxes are spent. It is debatable on what that percentage should be as the day-to-day operation of the government would have to be taken into account. But imagine how much more control over our government we would have if we could dictate how our tax dollars are spent (directly)! Don&#39;t want war? Then allocate your tax dollars to health care or education. The real difficulty in this is that we must <em>educate</em> (as opposed to our current system which indoctrinates) thoroughly on finance and government operation so that citizens can make informed decisions and be able to separate fact from manipulation. Easier said than done. ;)</p>

<p>Take your money out of the banks. Or at least most of it. Use cash, gold and silver, goldmoney.com.</p>

<p>Stop buying shit you don&#39;t need. Starve the corporate giants like Walmart and apple. Buy local. Buy used. You don&#39;t need that new X</p>

<p>Grow your own food. Get away from this toxic garbage and go organic. Even if it&#39;s only a small amount; every little bit counts.</p>

<p>Go outside and exercise. It&#39;s good for the mind and body. Get away from this negativity. Turn off your tv and don&#39;t mindlessly consume this inane media. </p>
