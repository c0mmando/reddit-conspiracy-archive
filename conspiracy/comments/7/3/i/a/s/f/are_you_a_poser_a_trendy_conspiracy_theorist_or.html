       Many people here are "posers". Meaning they think this place is a cool trendy joint to hang out and talk about fantasy Pandora's box type shit like the existence of Elf people, hollow moon, what's going on in Antarctica, lizard people. There is NO proof for any of these things, so you can talk about them for years and years and never get anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, the rest of us want to discuss social and political drawbacks of this secret group of elites, and how they plan and plot events and orchestrate things to inch them closer to their ultimate goal; One world government. There are mountains of evidence that support the existence of this plot, so why are we spinning our wheels on shit that has NO evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       That should be the whole purpose of this sub. Serious discussion of the New World Order and the global take over. They aren't just doing this for shits and giggles guys, they are working toward a sinister goal. And every "mini" conspiracy is a step toward this global domination, one currency, one governing force.

       A global economic and political system is inevitable and not automatically bad and in fact can be beneficial or harmful depending upon what kind of system is put in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of opposing something that is inevitable we should be demanding a say in what it will look like and by "we," I mean the 7 billion of us versus the few hundred.

       I think its completely fine for anyone to discuss both out of the ordinary strange conspiracies, and political conspiracies. Nothing wrong with talking about big foot or aliens, and TPTB. In fact, I think this sub can use a bit more Antarctica and less Trump/Hillary.

       It's literally just a text post. Why are you so concerned over a short text post? And why do you think I'm trying to "stir the pot"?
      </p>
      <p>
       You do realize several of my posts have been gilded, made the front page, and a few alternative media websites even picked up some of my posts and produced articles based on them.

       This sub is a shit show, and the past year I have been trying to unite all of the critical thinkers under our common cause.

       You make yourself sound righteous.  If you are righteous, why do you need so many alts?  And being that you pander to lowest common denominator karma votes, sure, you get moved up.  And you're attempting to do the same here.  Why?  Why do it in this small sub vs the larger audience found in r/conspiracy?  And if you are gilded, I'd always wonder if you or one of your alts gilded you.
      </p>
      <p>
       You behave abnormally, which always makes me suspicious of you.  And as others in this thread pointed out, your type of thought police post isn't what this sub is about.

       lol your biggest mistake was branding me as a karma whore.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dude...the Alts have like a few hundred karma each? I could give two shits about that. This is about UNITING a shit ton of Internet posters and getting them on the same page. That's what I want, I envision a hivemind total focus solution. But we have to be united. We KNOW they brought the towers down, we know they staged Boston bombing, we know JFK was murdered because he had plans that went against the elites agenda.

       This is my strategy. I have dedicated many hours to helping people understand this. Your skepticism and attacks on me are only hurting the movement. I truly want to see a society where humanity flourishes. That is the whole reason I post here. I'm tired of being a slave.

       Say whatever the hell you want about me, but the truth is that I'm a real fucking dude. With real thoughts and a vision.
