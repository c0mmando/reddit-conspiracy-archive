    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, my coworker/boss (I&#39;m a sub contractor to him) thinks similarly.</p>

<p>which highlights the success of the bigoted dis-information campaigns.  #BLM is about advocating protection from power to those who have no power.  That it&#39;s original context was Black American&#39;s abuse at the hands of power doesn&#39;t diminish the white persons abuse, although without being willing to think about the larger context at face value &quot;BLM&quot; does <em>sound</em> like it excludes &quot;All Lives&quot;.  Sadly, the racist nature of the anti-BLM groups want to pretend (and judging by your words, succeeding) that it&#39;s about stealing something from whites.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the KKK is explicitly about using power to abuse minorities.</p>

<p>Conflating them is morally repugnant, and philosophically repugnant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There most definitely shouldn&#39;t be sides to this in regards to the tragic nature of this shooting. It&#39;s a fucking shame that people have it in them to do something so vile and unfathomable. This. Shooting. Was. A. Tragedy. Absolutely everyone who&#39;s sane should agree with that.</p>

<p>But, if you&#39;re trying to infer that supporting gun ownership has anything to do with supporting a fucked up person&#39;s horrendous action, you&#39;re not making a fair characterization. If that&#39;s the case, you&#39;re conflating people&#39;s opinion of the shooting with people&#39;s opinion on gun rights. People aren&#39;t so easy to pin down or generalize as all that.</p>

<p>These kinds of emotional appeals can be dangerous, because where is the cutoff for them? At what point will there be any issue that trumps the safety of us and our children? Sure, maybe heavily restricting or banning guns outright would be the last concession of personal freedom in the interest of safety. Maybe all of our future leaders will be wise, benevolent, selfless people and after we get rid of private gun ownership, it will be the last time I ever hear an elected official call on me to concede personal freedom in the interest of potential safety. Does that sound likely?</p>
