<p>from 1:12 the sound of the machine gun and its echo do not seem to match. How is that possible? Could someone who knows more about guns than i do , explain that please. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just listen to the sound from 1:12 till 1;14 . </p>

<p>You will first here a tack tack tack  tack tack sound ( 5 tacks) and then a <strong>PAUSE</strong> and then tack tack etc etc etc . </p>

<p>This sounds like its coming directly from the gun.</p>

<p>Right after the first tack tack tack tack tack you here a delayed echo , coming from a distant . A deeper more base sound. </p>

<p>However the echo doesn&#39;t have the pause. How is that possible?</p>

<p>Ps: I haven&#39;t heard anyone else talking about the echos, ( except from my own post at another sub, which unfortunately didn&#39;t get any where) so could you tell me / show me links on who else is talking about it? Thanks. . </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think itâ€™s a misunderstanding of how gunshots sound when you are on the receiving end. At that range you hear the high pitched crack as the bullet passes you supersonic then you hear the lower pitched sound of the shot. So like in the videos you hear crack crack crack pop pop pop and the occasional other ping of a ricochet of a bullet hitting an object near the camera. Echoes are of course a factor as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was one of the first explanations and it makes sense that the crack sounds could be the bullets creating supersonic shock s in the air , but the question is , how come the crack crack crack sound do not match the pop pop pop sounds. </p>

<p>Just listen to the video precisely from 1;12 till 1;14 . You will hear 5 crack s , then a <strong>PAUSE</strong> and then more cracks. <strong>AFTER THAT</strong> starts  the echo of pop pop pop sound but <strong>THERE IS NO PAUSE IN THAT</strong>. </p>

<p>How come there is no pause in the pop pop pop sound? </p>

<p>Basically no matter <strong>HOW</strong> those two different types of sounds were created , aren&#39;t they supposed to match?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well i don&#39;t see a problem with that, as long as the report and the echo match, i can imagine depending on the direction of fire, where you are etc etc , it can vary, but my problem is that in the video i have posted, the report and the echo do not seem to match. That doesn&#39;t make any sense  to me. </p>

<p>No matter which comes first and how much the delay maybe , they should <strong>ALWAYS</strong> match , right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the weapon is held still in some fashion and fired at your location repeatedly, you will hear the <em>tack</em> match with every <em>pop</em> because every bullet fired passes you within range to hear the supersonic crack. On the other hand, if the weapon is being fired in a side to side sweeping motion, not all of the bullets will come close to you, especially at the distance of these shots. You will only hear the <em>tacks</em> of the rounds that pass in close proximity to your position.</p>

<p>I remember being told this in training at some point. When you hear a <em>bang</em>, it&#39;s time to pay attention. When you hear a <em>whizz</em>, it&#39;s time to find out where they are coming from. When you hear a <em>crack</em>, it&#39;s time to get the fuck down.</p>

<p>In a recap, the <em>tacks</em> are the sounds of the rounds passing the cameraman. The <em>pops</em> are the sounds of the bullet being fired from the shooters location. Not two guns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I don&#39;t think they aren&#39;t going to match perfectly from a given perspective. You&#39;ll only hear the audible &quot;crack&quot; of a bullet passing within a certain range, and keep in mind the shooter could&#39;ve been sweeping the muzzle across the crowd, some &quot;cracks&quot; may not very audible.</p>

<p>At that distance and difference in elevation, rapid succession gunfire is going to be highly inaccurate so those bullets are hitting/passing all over the damn place, and to repeat my first point, you&#39;ll only hear the supersonic crack within a certain range of the actual bullet passing. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not exactly a ballistics expert, but IMO I haven&#39;t heard anything remotely definitive out of all of the videos I&#39;ve watched that there was more than one shooter. </p>

<p>And keep in mind when watching all of the videos through different perspectives, you could be hearing echos, bullets smacking pavement, supersonic cracks, ricochets, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am only talking about the sounds from 1:12 till 1;14 in the video. The tack tack tack sounds do not seem to match with the pop pop pop sounds. </p>

<p>To me it doesn&#39;t sound like these two sounds are coming from the same gun to me.</p>

<p>yes there are all kinds of ricochet sounds, echos etc etc but that&#39;s why i picked that specific point in the video because there s a long pause before it , from 55 second till 1;12 so any left over echos etc from previous shots are all gone by then. </p>

<p>It starts with 5 tack tack tack sounds then a pause and then more tack tack tack sounds , and then you here an echo of continuous pop pop pop sounds. </p>

<p>The problem is tack tack tack have a pause in between , but pop pop pop s don&#39;t have that. That doesn&#39;t make sense to me.</p>

<p>The tack tack tack sounds aren&#39;t going to be a constant. Meaning, you won&#39;t always hear a tack tack tack associated with the pop pop pop. </p>

<p>There really is nothing, in terms of available video/audio footage that has been released that indicates multiple shooters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thatâ€™s not how it works. The bullet is traveling much faster then the speed of sound. While the bullet does slow down constantly after leaving the barrel, at 400 yards a 5.56 or a .223 is still supersonic.

<p>Anyway, nothing I posted is wrong. I have experienced &quot;bullet crack&quot; personally while working at ranges so I know what you are talking about. The sounds in those videos isn&#39;t bullet crack. The bullet needs to pass by pretty close for that. And the timing difference is very slight at greater distances like 50 ft or more.</p>

<p>What your hearing is just the way gunshots sound on shitty cell phone mics, as the phone orientation changes, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The guy had like 19 guns. Instead of reloading he was just switching rifles to avoid too much heat building up. The different videos are taken at different times during the shooting so they sound different because he is using a different rifle each time. Sometimes it sounds like a bump fired gun, sometimes it sounds almost like a full auto and in the Dan Bilzarien video it sounds distinctly like a trigger crank. He was probably using all those different mods. He wasn&#39;t just using the same gun the whole time.</p>

<p>The best explanation till now must be the one from sencseruza IMO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing about a multiple shooter theory is that it doesn&#39;t make any sense. Say it is all a false flag operation. The official narrative is that it was a heavily armed single shooter with tons of ammo firing from an elevated position into a crowd for over an hour. He can do a ton of damage that way. I&#39;m kind of surprised only 59 people have died so far really. Why jeopardize the narrative that you are trying to push by throwing some shadowy second shooter into the mix. It would be totally unnecessary and could only serve to discredit the official narrative. Does not make any sense at all IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I also think that from the direction of the bullet holes etc it would be easy to determine if there were two shooters t two different locations. I mean so many bullets were fired , that you could probably locate the shooting position just from the bullets holes, and if there  were two shooters on two different locations it would be easily detectable IMO.</p>

<p>However what if there was someone else ( or multiple people ) with him in that room? </p>

<p>Yes of course that he could do a lot of damage even as a single shooter but that neither proves or disproves the existence of a second shooter. </p>

<p>I am not trying to jeopardize the narrative, just trying to figure out why the two distinct sounds do not match each other. I am sure there s an explanation for it , and i have even seen some pretty convincing explanations here . Check out snecseruza s explanation which makes the most sense in my opinion. </p>
