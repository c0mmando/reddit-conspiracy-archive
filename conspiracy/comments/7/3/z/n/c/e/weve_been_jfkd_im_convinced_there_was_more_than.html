       You've seen the 10 minute long video of the cab driver.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take a minute to just listen to the video there are MAJOR inconsistencies in the first minute alone with regards to the sound of gunfire. it's OBVIOUS there's multiple sources for the sounds. PLEASE watch it for yourself if you haven't, you'll know what i mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's the woman that allegedly warned the audience. Said "they're all around". MSN spun this story as the woman possibly being the shooter's girlfriend, perhaps to discredit any chance that the woman may have been a separate party, which would INSTANTLY conclude that this was a
       <strong>
        bonafide conspiracy
       </strong>
       to commit mass murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's been web chatter about something happening in Vegas  since August.
      </p>
      <p>
       There still isn't a clear motive for shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alleged shooter does not fit a standard psycho-killer profile, and his brother attested to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       and to top it off, our subreddit has also dug up some occult fuckery dealing with the location relative to distinct landmarks and numerology.
      </p>
      <p>
       i threw this in last because it's the least concrete bit of conspiracy theory, but those of you who like to dig deep into rabbit holes will understand.

       Actually this is pretty useful. There is clearly an additional shooter here. One close that echos. Than after some time (beyond that of any echos) the shot originate from the distance and then new shots from the closer distance

       What training or real world experience do you have to determine from listening to one cell phone video of a non-fixed recording position that there was definitely more than one shooter? If the narrative was preplanned as many say it was and they knew they were going to pin it on one guy do you think that they would take the chance knowing that they were targeting a concert with hundreds of cell phones recording to shoot from multiple positions with multiple firearms at the same time?

       An attack that makes sense won't work, it's not distracting enough. We're so accustomed to senseless crime here in 'Murrica that they need to feed us more interesting stories. A shooting? Naw I'm busy working on my mixtape.

       Leaving holes allows for conspiracy theories, which most people don't believe. That way, most people are more likely to view the event the way TBTB want us too because the conspiracy believers are portrayed as crazy. They probably could do it perfectly if they wanted, but if they ever did make a mistake, it'd be harder to cover up.

       he points out at 5:15 astronomy "coincidences". Saturn 22 degrees in the zodiac, known as "the assassins degree" and Sagittarius is the zodiac sign of archer shooting from a distance. The festival/concert called "the HARVEST" festival. Sacrifice. I also find it interesting how this festival called "Harvest" is taking place right next to a huge pyramid shaped building. Assuming we might all know just a little something about harvesting energy and the pyramids

       Everyone is talking about the 4th floor shooter, but I find it much more likely that if there is a second shooter, they might not have been in the same building or in any building at all (going by how hard it was to tell the direction of the shots and how confused everyone was by what direction they were coming from)

       Great. A lot of people who don't realize you can break a weapon down into small parts are going to do advanced audio analysis in an environment without talking into account the numerous factors involved.
Furthermore a small subset of these people will insist that their analysis is correct while the analysis of those trained to do this are wrong because doing this sort of thing is really really easy.

       I don't have evidence obviously but it seems to me this could have been done with an advanced military drone easily, rain down a hailstorm of bullets from far above, no one will know from where the shots are coming. Then plant your dead body in your 'crime scene' (or just report that it was there), easy hands-off operation.

       You're right it's logical that a 64 year old lone nut with many thousands of dollars of weaponry would open fire into a crowd of concertgoers for no reason. And blindly accepting the government and police force's explanations is also logical given how truthful they have been with us for many decades. My mistake.

       It's NOT " obvious" that from the video that there multiple shooters. There is a lot of echo. The cab driver is pretty much in between the two sides of the hotel room.
To call the video proof that there are more than one shooter is ridiculous.

       Everyone's saying there's a second shooter here, but what reason is there to have a second shooter. Even more, to lie about it?
