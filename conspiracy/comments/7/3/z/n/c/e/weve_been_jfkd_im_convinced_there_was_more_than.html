        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You&#39;ve seen the 10 minute long video of the cab driver. </p>

<p>If you take a minute to just listen to the video there are MAJOR inconsistencies in the first minute alone with regards to the sound of gunfire. it&#39;s OBVIOUS there&#39;s multiple sources for the sounds. PLEASE watch it for yourself if you haven&#39;t, you&#39;ll know what i mean.</p>

<p>And there&#39;s the woman that allegedly warned the audience. Said &quot;they&#39;re all around&quot;. MSN spun this story as the woman possibly being the shooter&#39;s girlfriend, perhaps to discredit any chance that the woman may have been a separate party, which would INSTANTLY conclude that this was a <strong>bonafide conspiracy</strong> to commit mass murder. </p>

<p>There&#39;s been web chatter about something happening in Vegas  since August.</p>

<p>There still isn&#39;t a clear motive for shooting.</p>

<p>The alleged shooter does not fit a standard psycho-killer profile, and his brother attested to that.</p>

<p>and to top it off, our subreddit has also dug up some occult fuckery dealing with the location relative to distinct landmarks and numerology.</p>

<p>i threw this in last because it&#39;s the least concrete bit of conspiracy theory, but those of you who like to dig deep into rabbit holes will understand.</p>

If the narrative was preplanned as many say it was and they knew they were going to pin it on one guy do you think that they would take the chance knowing that they were targeting a concert with hundreds of cell phones recording to shoot from multiple positions with multiple firearms at the same time? </p>

Then plant your dead body in your &#39;crime scene&#39; (or just report that it was there), easy hands-off operation.</p>
