      <p>
       A week ago an emergency broadcast aired suddenly in the US in which a short burst of static recording warned that something had taken over the military and infiltrated the government.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       This short 40 second alert broadcast the following from a male voice sounding upset and scared:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        ...the space program they've
        <em>
         (made contact/conned us)
        </em>
        with, uh, they-they are not what they claim to be, uh, they have infiltrated a lot of, uh-
        <em>

       </p>
       <p>
        [broadcast cuts off abruptly]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now, many might claim this is a hoax or a hacking but that's not what peaked my interest on a government emergency broadcast being hijacked with serious warnings.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, what got my real interest was the consequent media lies and coverup about it when they began "debunking" the broadcast with a
       <strong>
        completely different broadcast that never happened
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the broadcast that the media reported on after most of the West Coast began asking questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERoo4_xX478">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERoo4_xX478
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://archive.is/cQBC5">
        http://archive.is/cQBC5
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       A clear streamed message comes over the broadcast (though in the few videos i've seen it appears to come not from the TV but from speakers off to the side of the video):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Realize this: That in the last days extremely violent times will come. The term means hard, harsh, hard to deal with, vicious, dangerous, menacing. Men will be self-lovers and look at the adverse four rather than lovers of God. Verse 2, money lovers. Verse 4, pleasure lovers. Rather than God lovers.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Quite a
       <strong>
        lot
       </strong>
       different than what the original broadcast was isn't it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet it's
       <strong>
        solely
       </strong>
       the one the MSM is reporting on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other media outlets displayed the same thing with the same video:
       <a href="http://archive.is/cdn1h">
        Washington Post making absolutely no mention of the original broadcast.
       </a>
       Same for
       <a href="http://archive.is/cEATg">
        the LA Times, which also
        <strong>
         solely
        </strong>
        refers to the religious broadcast and makes absolutely no mention of the other everyone heard.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These MSM outlets all play a clip of what is being claimed was an "interruption" of the Emergency Broadcast of a pastors radio show (something that wouldn't happen on an Emergency Broadcast test, nor would it be something hackers play).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are multiple issues here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is the MSM
       <strong>
        solely
       </strong>
       and only covering one of the broadcasts (if the religious broadcast was even aired at all)? Why is the government lying about the broadcasts? Why is the government claiming it was a "crossed signal" when the Emergency Broadcast is specifically meant to stop that, especially when this religious broadcast appears to be a
       <strong>
        podcast
       </strong>
       and not any radio signal? Why, if we were to believe that it's not a coverup, would the government deny hackers took control of our Emergency network?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's either gross incompetence, blatantly lying, hackers or a coverup.

       The message is from
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee3bld4lTG0">
        an Art Bell show years ago.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's odd the MSM wouldn't cite this directly and blame it on a prank or hackers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Worth noting the Art Bell episode had its own mythos surrounding the incident. It cut suddenly near the end and Art's show went down. Claiming his electronics were fried.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that someone called in to state it was a hoax, but the voices were contested as being the different in the conspiracy crowd.

       I can't watch the video right now, but if this is the clip where dude calls in saying he is being chased by people from area 51or whatever, that story just gets more weird with the explanation of it being an actor. Because Art Bell did get his feed cut.

       Lol we put reflectors so we can point lasers at the moon to prove we were there. Lasers don't reflect off mountains.
