<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/09/19/surging-adidas-overtakes-jordan-brand-for-no-2-spot-behind-nike-in-u-s-sneaker-sales/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/09/19/surging-adidas-overtakes-jordan-brand-for-no-2-spot-behind-nike-in-u-s-sneaker-sales/</a></p>

<p>September 26th - NCAA and Adidas officials arrested over corruption charges for paying money to student athletes and families.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/26/ncaa-basketball-officials-arrested-on-fraud-and-corruption-charges.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/26/ncaa-basketball-officials-arrested-on-fraud-and-corruption-charges.html</a></p>

<p>So, the most public secret in sports that the NCAA is corrupt and that athletes are paid money behind closed doors comes out a week after Adidas becomes #2 shoe seller in US, overcoming Jordan and threatening Nike. </p>

<p>And somehow Nike isn&#39;t mentioned in this scandal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I must admit I am pretty ignorant to most things sports, but it is pretty plain to see that the NCAA and the colleges themselves are making enormous profits off college athletes. Hell we can see that sports programs in general are better funded in lower education<br/>
 (K-12). I suspect it is because they want to develop the sports culture at a young age so when these children become adults in the workforce they will cling to their teams and be blind consumers of sports. I think its great that kids are encourage to join teams but we spend absurd amounts of tax payer money on High School Stadiums when the district is struggling to pay for staff and fund other departments. It makes no senses unless you see it for what it is. The education system in this country and it funding needs a complete overhaul. Time to do away with property taxes that fund public schools, why fund these schools if they aren&#39;t producing better students. But it isn&#39;t just the schools themselves that need change the whole community needs to make changes and reevaluate their focus. What is the main objective in their community. What is the main objective of our country? People need to start asking these questions and discussing the answers. IF America as a whole had a goal, we would achieve it. We have no main directive as a society. This is what allows all the corruption to take place. Since we have no clear goal for our country we can&#39;t hold our politicians accountable. Sorry for the tangent guess I just needed to blow off some steam.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but for the TPTB to work they must compartmentalize everything. That means that not everyone knows the plan, it creates strife, and perhaps the different groups and or sub groups involved have different agendas. how you interact with you community. If we put focus on negativity then the product of that focus will be anxiety. If you approach the subject in a calm manner and not with the attitude of defeat then you will be able to sleep.</p>

The problem is people are taking advantage of athletes at a young age in AAU, grooming them, and moving them to schools, or pro teams based on money.  The other problems are fraud, bribery, tax evasion, and scholarships in public universities. So far ASM sports, Nike, and Adidas are all roped in. A handful of schools are also in the limelight and the Associate AD at Alabama has now stepped down also.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Under Armour gets roped into this too. </p>
