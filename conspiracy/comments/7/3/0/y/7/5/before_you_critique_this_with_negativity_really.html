        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I am trying to figure out a good test to do for this but the scenario that brought it to mind is the shower. </p>

<p>Some days before I get into a shower my thoughts will be nothing but negativity. I will be beating myself up, I will be hating on the world and everything around me and ready to fucking kill myself. </p>

<p>I work from home and some days I don&#39;t leave the computer for quite a few hours so my interaction with dirt etc is not that often.
I am not able to use many cleaning products because they make me break out horribly. I will use just a wash cloth and water most days to get the stink off and I will exfoliate every 3 showers. </p>

<p>I will washcloth off my body in quarters (ill let your imaginations run wild with that), and every quarter of my body has quite a bit of black (what i once thought was just dirt) wash down the drain. 
When I clean my hair it&#39;s like rinsing out a paintbrush that was just used to fill in a black sky or a black backdrop. SO much of it i watch come out of my hair and wash down the drain. Today I closed my eyes for most of the rinse and when I opened my eyes I swear to bob my colors were twice as bright and my once begrudging attitude to start the day was turned upside down and into a chipper, happy go lucky.  On days that I condition and wash my hair (once a week), I have noticed the change in thoughts and my over all demeanor 2 to 3 times greater than just a body wash. </p>

<p>I am wondering if there is a mold or fungus spore in the air that could be contacting to our skin and changing our happy into depression...  </p>

<p>If anyone has an idea of how to test this theory I am all ears.  </p>

<p>Thank you for your time. 
Love &lt;3 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happiness is truly a state of mind, or a philosophical perspective.</p>

<p>I found as I grew up, that Thanksgiving and Christmas had me thinking of these perspectives the most.</p>

<p>My previous point though, is that up until the Renaissance, and for many after it, happiness was not the goal, but survival. Simply living another day was enough to be thankful for, or living in an area where you work with your neighbors like a team, making sure everyone survived.</p>

<p>We are all different, but we all fall into similar fails. Being thankful for what you have, instead of what you don&#39;t is a helpful first step.</p>

<p>For me I find it important to avoid expectations, to keep myself from depression.</p>

<p>I can go more into this, but this is getting kinda long, and my neighbor or is messaging me for some ibuprofen, so I&#39;ll leave it there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hallucinogens can be a great tool. I have learned a great deal about myself with the aid of LSD. However doctors can help in ways that hallucinogens cannot. For example, a doctor can verify if mold is the cause of your issues by doing a skin prick test or antibody test. They will also know about other potential causes and be able to test for them. I understand why you might hesitate to trust a doctor, but there is really nothing to lose by seeing one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s certainly possible. I&#39;ve heard that the chemtrails have microscopic computer chips meant to be inhaled. Who knows. Maybe they spray your area with aluminum if not computer chips and you don&#39;t have an air filter to catch it. It could be dye from sheets or clothes. When I&#39;ve worn fabrics tend to leave stains on my skin like that. Mainly black clothes like sweat pants or socks. If you live in an area that is near where forest fires happen or other fires outdoors maybe. Your moods might be controlled by inaudible high frequency noises or some electromagnetic waves meant to effect mood or mental/physical health. There&#39;s also the possibility that there is a spiritual world and that there are evil spirits all around us affecting us emotionally and physically in ways we don&#39;t realize. (This last sentence I&#39;m pretty sure us true.) when it comes to demonic attacks or oppression, supernatural things can occur. If your house is clean and your mentally and physically fine then I&#39;d get an air filter and see if anyone else locally has that issue. The CIA likes to experiment on random towns too so they could be up to shananigans. They once put lsd in the water of a town to see what would happen. Where I live the military base nearby has their own water tank</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you give any credence to the concept of human energetics and their being able to affect mood, water is allegedly a particularly effective &#39;reset&#39; button for that system. It&#39;s claimed that energetic contamination is an actual thing in that you can literally pick up the emotional states of people and environments and you can also wash them off. Whether that&#39;s whats going on, who can say, but I&#39;ve also noticed absolutely bizarre mood changes that seem to be corrected by showers and mineral rich food consumption. The former is a puzzle, the latter probably has to do with mineral imbalances in the various nervous system electrolyte balances.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, it seems insane to think that terrestrial human parasites don&#39;t have some sort of influence on human moods and behaviors. They have been observed doing such things to pretty much every other species and I see no reason to believe humans are somehow protected.

<p>I am wondering if there is a mold or fungus spore in the air that could be contacting to our skin and changing our happy into depression...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe traditional &quot;Black Mold&quot; which often invades houses (inside the walls, etc) can cause major neurological and autoimmune issues when exposure to it is chronic (like when you live in the house and work from the house a large part of the time).</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a question for you: </p>

<p>Have you taken any long-ish trips/vacations where you stayed away from home for a while (I&#39;m thinking like 2 weeks)? </p>

<p>If so, did you feel better during that time? If not, maybe you should consider trying it. </p>

<p>I know one of my best friends was a mess for a long time - they finally figured out that it was black mold in his house. He&#39;d feel markedly better when he went away from his house for more than a couple days. He got some testing done - positive for mold. Filed homeowners insurance claim and had mold remediation team deal with problem. It was expensive as hell but his insurance was good and covered it. After remediation he&#39;s much better overall (less nervous/anxious/depressed, sleeps better, autoimmune symptoms significantly reduced, etc..).</p>
