    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link, but I&#39;m not very trusting of Neon Nettle.  Is there any more info available, such as when the interview took place and with who?  It seems there&#39;s just snippets, but you&#39;d assume there would be a full article with the entire interview available.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pointing out that there might be a problem with the source because it could reflect poorly on you and your efforts if it&#39;s shown to be bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I scratched pretty hard on comments credited to her about pedophilia and Stanley Kubrick, and again, there was just a lone source and it was not legacy media. </p>

<p>I use a lot of alternative media. I use it because it presents a viewpoint more attuned to my own, and because we all demonstrably see mainstream media lying to our faces every day.</p>

<p>But as this episode illustrates, care is needed. NeonNettle publishes much true reporting, and I mostly used it as a springboard to sites that they linked to in their reporting. The Robert Downey and the Brad Pitt articles were exceptions, and that should have clued me in. </p>

<p>But I missed the clue. As I said, confirmation bias got me and I <em>wanted</em> those interviews to be true. </p>

<p>I am thinking about writing a separate piece now about fake pedophile articles. I am a believer in false flags, and I also believe that there is organization, power, position and money behind some pedophilia activity. It is not out of the realm of the feasible that someone, something, is planting faked articles like these, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>As this is the Conspiracy sub, this is the right place to present a thesis like that. MMFA and various shops sheltering under Podesta-linked entities are likely culprits. </p>

<p>Hollywood people I absolutely believe are having sex with underaged people in the classic casting couch situation- people are pimping themselves and their children for points on shows or to get parts, I don’t consider it a conspiracy per se since it’s not a secret really and the only tool is money- like I don’t believe there is any mystical or really blackmail aspects to this outside of std stuff like how Jim Carey killed his gf for threatening to put his std

<p>Usually, and especially on r/conspiracy a 9 day old account comes up and makes claims like these, people tend to be a little skeptical.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve asked that people basically take your word for things here.  Do you or can you show something add to the claimed credibility?  I can say anything I like online, nothing prevents me from it. </p>

<p>Also, can you give your feelings on the cases laid out in the documentary &quot;An Open Secret&quot;?  Your previous comments say that in some cases some people are simply looking for attention, what do you say in the cases shown here?  Are they also just seeking attention and looking to &quot;cash in&quot; or do their statements hold up in your opinion being so closely tied to the &quot;mega rich&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in finance but I am not going into any details since I don’t want dox or ban hammers </p>

<p>Everything I claim about people who are not myself I cite </p>

<p>I have never seen an open secret but from what I have heard it makes claims similar to what I am familiar with, people take advantage of the talent, usually their parents or their reps, in exchange for roles or points. </p>

<p>I say with absolute certainty that if they came forward it’s because they did not get what they where promised on there deal- that’s why Hollywood is not constantly being over run with allegations, it’s because for the most part the sex for points pays out- these kids get roles and money, take their gigs and shuffle on- it’s when they don’t get the money that you get this movie </p>

<p>It’s all just sex and money. People with lots of money can use it to do lots of stupid shit and people who don’t have money will resort to selling themselves or people close to them for acess to money REALLY fast. </p>

<p>No one here needs to believe anything I say about anything that is just my opinions, if am asserting a fact like how Jim Carey killed his girlfriend over std blackmail I will cite it</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So you&#39;re saying they&#39;re <em>absolutely</em> attention seekers even though these people went to court and got people sent to jail?  They made it up and somehow got people arrested and incarcerated.  That is an amazing claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I say with absolute certainty that if they came forward it’s because they did not get what they where promised on <strong>there</strong> deal</p>

<p>You work in finance and don&#39;t know when to use &quot;their&quot; instead of &quot;there&quot;?  Really?</p>

<p>Thus....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People with lots of money can use it to do lots of stupid shit and people who don’t have money will resort to selling themselves or people close to them for acess to money REALLY fast.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just people clamoring for money, nothing to do with sexual predators or pedophiles.  Going back to the people in the documentary, those people like Mike Egan, fabricated everything?  Quite the claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I like Reddit because my job is dull and my friends enjoy hearing me discuss the latest weird thing you people decide is true</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re here for funsies then.  Thanks for that tidbit of information.</p>

<p>There is not a single thing you can say to give you credibility, and you managed to cite snopes in a previous comment.  You <em>claim</em> to work in &quot;finance&quot; with the &quot;mega rich&quot;, don&#39;t know when to use &quot;their&quot; instead of &quot;there&quot; and are also bored and rich enough to come online and tell &quot;us people&quot; what is true and what is not.</p>

<p>Show your proof.  You can claim doxxing and all that garbage and downvote all you like, no one here should listen to or upvote anything you&#39;ve said.  Your lax comments passing everything off as money driven, disregarding or being ignorant of the court cases and convictions show where you really are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone in &quot;finance&quot; and works for the &quot;mega rich&quot; doesn&#39;t bother with coming online to defend hollywood pedophilia while sitting on the shitter.  Besides, its been 30 minutes since that comment, you should probably pinch that one off and get on the old lappy and be consistent with your grammar. </p>

<p>No one in that industry would take you seriously if you could not get them right when you produce a report for them.  For &quot;there&quot; portfolio or &quot;their&quot; portfolio.  You would look like quite the fool.  I challenge a claim like that, and the claim you&#39;re just here to &quot;help&quot; by posting snopes as a credible source.  </p>

<p>You can say anything you like, the fact that you&#39;re not even aware of these actual court cases means you don&#39;t know anything about the subject.  Yet make claims anyway.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t need to believe a documentary as gospel, I know what went to court and who went to jail.</p>

<p>What I do know, and its funny you mention &quot;where these people are right now&quot;, is that Marc Collins-Rector, one of the men shown in the documentary has actually disappeared!  Authorities don&#39;t currently know where he is.  Funny eh?</p>

<p>Mike Egan, the man who got Marty Weiss sent to jail can probably be found pretty easily, as he dropped his lawsuits against Bryan Singer after his lawyer withdrew as council.  He can reapply.</p>

<p>I think a 9 day old account (now 8 day old) who comes here for funsies, apparently so he can chat with his finance buddies about how foolish people are on reddit, should stick to &quot;finance&quot; instead of sleuthing via snopes and the like.  All you&#39;ve demonstrated is ignorance and given people who read your comments zero reason to believe you.</p>

<p>But that has nothing to do with Brad Pitt. As I see it, NeonNettle has a track record that is comparable to that of The New York Times. Except that The New York Times publishes outright lies. </p>

<p>NeonNettle posted this article, and it cited Brad Pitt. His publicist has not disavowed the quotes, nor the article. NeonNettle has not published a retraction. </p>

<p>In a perfect world, people like Brad Pitt would rush to correct or reinforce the record. </p>

<p>We live in the real world. If you prefer, read what Nicole Kidman said. Read what Elijah Wood said (and yes, I am aware that he walked back his comments). Read what Corey Feldman said. </p>

<p>I make no claim to omniscience. But I do try to do good research. In retrospect, I would rewrite the section citing Mr. Pitt to simply say, &quot;It is alleged that Mr. Pitt did not make these statements, and NeonNettle is the lone source. Mr. Pitt has not disavowed the quotes, and his publicist has not corrected the record. NeonNettle has not issued a retraction.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/world/from-the-editors-the-times-and-iraq.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/world/from-the-editors-the-times-and-iraq.html</a></p>

<p>That’s a big difference, the NYT is not perfect, will make mistakes, can be misled, but there is accountability there. (Easy to say after they helped lead us to war) Neon Nettle is not accountable in anyway, does not explain what happened when stories were wrong, or make an effort to be open and honest with their readers, even if it was after the fact. </p>

<p>Beyond the Iraq War the NYT has a pretty damn awesome track record of legitimate reporting, and continue to do so to this day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Accurate, perhaps overly critical. Maggie Haberman (sp?) seems to have a connection with Trump where he enjoys talking with her. You could characterize their coverage as excessively negative, but I’d contend the adversarial nature of the president kind of makes that a self perpetuating cycle, and his disregard for convention is in itself newsworthy. They helped break the Don Jr. email story. I’m not sure if the 17 intelligence agencies vs 4 agencies and the head of intelligence snafu fell on them, but they did report it that way, and deserve some editorial shaming for not catching that distinction. If there’s anything else they’ve gotten objectively wrong I can’t think of it or find it right now with a quick google search. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One final comment. Brad Pitt recently endured a divorce from Angelina Jolie. There were leaks to media that Mr. Pitt was not a perfect father. </p>

<p>Shortly after that happened, there were leaks that Ms. Jolie is involved with the Illuminati, and an infamous home video where she made pertinent comments was posted. </p>

<p>Suddenly, all disparaging leaks about Mr. Pitt&#39;s credentials as a father immediately ceased. </p>

<p>And the divorce was concluded. Like most divorces, its terms remain private. </p>

<p>The home video of Ms. Jolie is unarguably her. She makes the statements that she makes. </p>

<p>Is it possible that the NeonNettle article is fake? Certainly. Is it equally possible that it is correct? Again, yes. </p>

<p>I have no respect for anyone who relies on Snopes to tell them what to believe. This is clearly a case where anyone who actually cares about the issue should indeed do their own research. </p>

<p>So I did my research. I concluded what I wrote. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and thanks for commenting. </p>
