       The
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hueyatlaco">
        Hueyatlaco
       </a>
       site in Mexico shows evidence of human activity 250,000 years ago. However, this evidence has been forgotten because it contradicts the established narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is what a paper in 1981 had to say:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The evidence outlined here consistently indicates that the Hueyatlaco site is about 250,000 yr. old. We who have worked on geological aspects of the Valsequillo area are painfully aware that so great an age poses an archeological dilemma [...] In our view, the results reported here widen the window of time in which serious investigation of the age of Man in the New World would be warranted. We continue to cast a critical eye on all the data, including our own.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's basically it. A "we'll keep that in mind". They still teach that humans never entered the Americas before 15k years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/04/mastodons-americas-peopling-migrations-archaeology-science/">
        Here
       </a>
       researchers found evidence of human activity in California 130,000 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/11/30_fp.shtml">
        Here also
       </a>
       we also see human footprints dated to 1 million years ago in Mexico. Nobody disputed they were human foot prints until after they were dated. Dishonest huh?
      </p>
      <p>
       I quote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "You're really only left with two possibilities," Renne said. "One is that they are really old hominids - shockingly old - or they're not footprints."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The evidence Paul has produced by dating basically means that this argument is over, unless indisputable footprints can be found sealed within the ash.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       See the double standards here? They accept other foot prints of equal quality when the dates are as expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, their strongest argument:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "If they were hot, why would anybody be walking on them?"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is another thing we always see whenever controversial finds are found:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Bournemouth, was quoted on a Royal Society Web site as saying, "Accounting for the origin of these footprints would require a complete rethink on the timing, route and origin of the first colonization of the Americas."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Maybe it's time for a rethink?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are scientists so hesitant to change their theories?

       I think science, particularly archaeological research can be quite depressive, people spend their whole career believing something that can be disproved by a new piece to the puzzle. In other words, people dont like it when their life's work becomes obsolete. Human nature.

       Of course, but you have to admit thqt it is quite romantic to believe Scientists research for the betterment of their field but like with all other jobs, eventually it turns into a paycheck for most. In science, specifically, being well known and published ultimately leads to preference on results that appease the status quo rather than shattering it. Scientist are incredible people but most succumb to personal agendas like most of us do.

       For example, we all know that humans have an impact on Climate change but thanks to resources like this sub, we know this data has been heavily doctored to push the narrative that humans are solely responsible for this. What happens, scientists almost across the board agree that climate change is human creation and defend flawed data supporting that theory in order to keep their career intact because society for the main part wants to hear that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do humans impact climate change? Sure, are we solely responsible or does the planet have a track record of change? Yes, but you won't hear that from a scientist.

       Nobody wants to hear that we can't do anything about climate change, we want to believe its man made, TPTB want people to believe it as well as to profit off it. That way everyone thinks they are helping save the planet. But the climate will still change, TPTB will claim it is because we were too late in our efforts. Hiding the Truth that Earth has a cycle of destructive weather that kills off civilizations.

       I even edited a climate change paper today that basically said scientists put forward projected climate change timelines on the basis of political considerations, not scientific ones. Although their argument was that climate change is going to be much worse than currently stated, which was scary.

       The planet is actually getting warmer. That's a problem we need to solve real fuckin' quick or we're quite literally toast. Reducing CO2 emissions is a great start, because we know that they do have an impact, a sizeable one, to the effect that reducing them substantially will at least buy us some time. The thing about the climate change issue that really pisses me off, is that people will acknowledge that humans must be contributing to the planet getting warmer-even the most adamant deniers will indeed acknowledge that-yet there is no call to action to do what we can do reduce the heating of the planet. It seems like many people that are skeptical of and deny climate change are content with just letting the planet get warmer because there's nothing we can do, a sentiment I don't share as a skeptic of the official climate change narrative.  Something about their belief in revelations and the end times I guess.

       I think the “will at least buy us some time” is probably wrong. 
The time it will buy will be available after we’re all dead or back in the Stone Age.
The lag of damage done by GHG emissions, along with the positive feedbacks all ready set in motion, have likely sealed our fate.
We can’t just give up though, we should go down fighting if it comes to that. How that could be achieved requires a solution that’s way beyond my comprehension.

       Think about how much time, energy, and resources are devoted to warfare, or taken by corruption and bloat. The lacking emphasis placed on learning science. I imagine when doom is imminent that we will find a solution somehow.

       Solvable is not how I’m thinking.
Our situation is a predicament. We more or less have to bring Armageddon upon ourselves in an unlikely gamble to save the biosphere.
We have built our numbers to 7.5B with fossil fuels, we’re hopelessly addicted and totally reliant upon them.
Renewables are an extension of our FF addiction, they cannot be built or maintained without FF’s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because fossil fuels are finite, so too are renewables, but what renewables do do is allow us to use FF’s for longer, they are extending the burn. That is what is buying us time. Whether or not in that extra time, some miracle can be discovered, is some reason to hope but not just hope and do nothing. Certainly a very small fraction of 7.5B will make it through the coming bottleneck.

       True. There will be a point when battery and electric vehicle technology advances enough to replace FF burning and greenhouse gas emissions 100%, but I'm not entirely optimistic. My plans are to do what I can, save up, prep, and be crawling out of the debris piles and rebuilding civilization in the scorching wastelands in 20-30 years, or however long.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's going to take major social/political reform to fix this, and we can only hope it happens. But we can do what we can to speed it along.

       Wouldn't be scorching, but okay. It'd be slightly warmer in some parts of the world, but also much much wetter overall. XD alarmists paint this hilarious picture of what our world looks like once GHG have exacted their toll on man.

       I got my PhD in chemistry (molecular biology) and a really well-published who graduated really screwed over my entire lab, and probably other labs as well, because he almost certainly faked data.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were focusing on a specific protein involved in muscular dystrophy, and he had published this article showing that it preferentially bound to a double-stranded RNA "hairpin loop." After 5 years of running and experimenting on this assumption, another lab comes out with evidence that it binds to single-stranded RNA. We were unable to replicate those results, and it turns out he had lots more shady results we had run with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, he went on to a prestigious post-doc and probably doesn't even regret what he did.

       I guess, but I for one would be ecstatic to see new evidence brought to light in my field(if I were a scientist of some sort).   I would not care that it shattered something I had held as the truth and would look at it as exciting times ahead.  That's what science is all about.  I see this type of thinking in the Astronomy fields a lot.  They love finding something that completely throw's the accepted model into chaos.

       For example, we all know that humans have an impact on Climate change but thanks to resources like this sub, we know this data has been heavily doctored to push the narrative that humans are solely responsible for this. What happens, scientists almost across the board agree that climate change is human creation and defend flawed data supporting that theory in order to keep their career intact because society for the main part wants to hear that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do humans impact climate change? Sure, are we solely responsible or does the planet have a track record of change? Yes, but you won't hear that from a scientist.

       Nice post. I'm not a scientist but it's interesting how multiple dating tools suggested the 250,000 year time frame. It's just sad to see radical ideas not being investigated, one would think those would be the most exciting. And for a legitimate hypothesis to be called a "conspiracy"...

       It wasn't really multiple methods though, they all involved dating the surrounding strata, not the tools themselves, and no erosion is taken into account in these later "headline making" studies, all they do is piggyback on the initial, unlikely challenge to the strata-erosion study.

       You aren't making sense. The methodologies in each study were not different - in the case where multiple geological data are explored, the relevant organic/erosion data is not included and vice-versa. This is what a lot of scienc-ing is, though. It doesn't prove anything broader the majority of the time, and as well in these cases, none of the conclusions are agreeing with your pat tabloid nonsense, sorry.

        thus combining older and newer strata and complicating dating..... In 1973, Virginia Steen-MacIntyre, Malde and Roald Fryxell returned to Hueyatlaco to re-examine the geographic strata and more accurately determine an age for the tool-bearing strata.

       They didn't rule out shit, they just retested the geologic material. Never proved that the specific strata was "tool-bearing" in the first place, and that's the problem. Rock specialists clashing with strata-specialists. With a dearth of organics study, this equals ZOMG humans must have been here hundreds of thousands of years before all of the other evidence, ie the body of global human migration evidence that's mostly agreed-upon, suggests. I maintain that none of these studies were conclusive too

       Plus you can't date the artifacts themselves directly because the you'd get the age of the rock itself, and not the age when it was turned to a tool. That's why you can only date the sediment layers it's in.

       This is not the actual study, no actual study was able to "rule out" the streambed hypothesis, either.

      <p>
       Simply, strata dating is unreliable and an "indirect" method of dating adjacent non-organic material. You are reading about the dating of geologic material, not the tools themselves.

       Like I said, you can't date the stone tools themselves because that give the age of the rock itself, and not when they were used as tools. For that reason precisely you date the strata it's deposited in.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is literally how scientists date most other stone tools that are accepted as evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's quite amusing to see the double standards employed here when facts don't fit the model.

        “An artifact like a tool made from flint is usually not dated directly but instead according to the age of the sediment layers it is found in,” said Dennis V. Kent, a research scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.

       Yes? But when the  motivation of the study is to hypothesize a vast shift in dogma like this, it is scrutinized by various disciplines before it becomes the new reality. No one will touch this because there is no other evidence pointing to a culture of an age vastly earlier than is already evident. No. Other. Evidence. Besides this
       <em>

       Since I can't copy from the pdf text above, read top of page 9 of it. They ruled out the hypothesis in 1973 by identifying the stratographic sequence. They concluded that the artifacts did not lie in a stream channel, and so cannot be younger than the ash deposits that covered them.

       Yeah, AGAIN, that's opinion. I'm done going around with you, you clearly are seeking a fantasy explanation at all rational cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, I've been loathe to bring this up but since this is my last post I will - the tools themselves were from non-local materials and it's possibly they were planted there by people working on the initial excavation, before any of these geologists were even on the scene. And this explains them not "fitting" in the strata. So most reasonable scientists would stop reading, right there, having heard the ludicrous date proposed by the study, after seeking out the circumstances of the tools' first appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway take care. I've just read back on your comments and aside from the supernatural stuff it appears we're in agreement about the real-world conspiracies,t eg the Ukrainian coup and the Syrian "civil" war and probably more I'd wager if I looked back further. Cheers.

       Oh FFS your own links contradict your "point".  The Heuyatlaco site is an example of two groups of scientists having a low-key decade long feud over who had superior dating techniques, and neither of them EVER published a conclusive report on the site itself - the sencond "challenging" group of scientists who proposed the even earlier date abandoned their study and published on their method itself(volcanic ash dating).

       The initial study did NOT conclusively date it. The rest of the papers bolstering(actually just piggybacking) on the challenging study were using the same methods, basically just copies of copies of copies from scientists trying to make a name for themselves. The differences in the later studies are that they claim "proof" whereas the initial early dated study knew better than to make that leap.

       The initial study DID conclusively date. What makes you think they didn't? Even if you claim they didn't, several modern tests that came after that time did date correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the dating methodologies show a consistent dating of 250,000 years ago.
       <strong>
        4 different methods were done to arrive at that date

       I quote:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The paper reported the results of four sophisticated, independent tests: uranium-thorium dating, fission track dating, tephra hydration dating and the studying of mineral weathering to determine the date of the artifacts. These tests, among other data, validated a date of 250,000ypb for the Hueyatlaco artifacts. They wrote:
       </p>
       <p>
        The evidence outlined here consistently indicates that the Hueyatlaco site is about 250,000 yr. old. We who have worked on geological aspects of the Valsequillo area are painfully aware that so great an age poses an archeological dilemma [...] In our view, the results reported here widen the window of time in which serious investigation of the age of Man in the New World would be warranted. We continue to cast a critical eye on all the data, including our own.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also read this from other scientists about the initial team:

        and attested to the integrity of the excavations and the professionalism of the group's methodology.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The site IS dated to 250,000 and it is proven by the dating. And you have  is argument to the contrary.

But to lump all of these conflicting studies(with all of the latter ones being obvious "comtroversy"-piggybacking) together as evidence of some greater as "proof", fine. Knock yourself out.

       The geological data ... yeah - they have no explanation for the much later adjacent organic data. My point stands and no, it's not conclusive, not scientifically - which is why we have these challengers and their fringe-theorizing stepping up to the plate like thirsty vampires, and the cycle begins..the layman is utterly confused and ripe for the theorizing.

       At a certain point, denial of anything that upsets the established theory becomes far more complex than just changing the established theory. I'll bet your the type of person that will refer to occum's razor on nearly every other subject just to prove the 'crackpots' wrong. You think that dogmatic faith in established science makes you appear to be the smartest guy in the room, but in reality it just embarrassing.

       Nope, not that "type" at all. There are a lot of things about history that are clearly unknown and even more that isn't agreed upon, for good reason. This particular nonsense is out of the realm of anyof that , and out of the realm of possibility, it's just clowning and distraction imho.

       But how can you be sure of that? If our established history theory is wrong, which everyday it appears more and more to be the case, then who is to say what is nonsense or not? It's arrogance to assume that if we got it wrong we only got it wrong by small details.

       There is a spectrum of rationality, this is not even on the spectrum. fwiw I don't agree with most of the accepted timelines, and most prehistorical anthropological theory is still in the hypothetical phase as well. Most scientists would probably disagree with me. But this million year old civilization shit is for entertainment purposes only, and it used to be regarded correctly back when most of it was first conceived, as fiction. That people really think it's all "possible" is just another sign of the new idiocracy. As the common man becomes more removed from science and exploration, his cultural preference for myth returns, aided by snake oil salesmen like Hancock and the clowns who appear on the "History" channel. We might as well call it the new dark ages.  Or perhaps the common man is just reverting back to his natural state, having had a brief glimpse into non-essential education.

       Overall, he relies on myth and apocrypha to craft his theories. He literally pulls stuff from fiction. You can't even argue with a person like that. I mean, he's doing it all for money. He requires his audience to have a dearth of basic knowledge. It's all non-sensical. I actually view it as performance art. He's an immensely dedicated producer, I'll give him that, even though most of his material is pulled from old fiction it's also clear that he's an intelligent person.  The way he compiles it is very compelling to a certain gullible slice of humanity. And this really, imo, paints him as a charlatan. He knows better. And it's not like we've scratched the surface of prehistorical man - instead of seeking reality, he's chosen  performance art, on a mission of stale rehashing of old hoaxes over a real purpose. He's either lazy or greedy or both.

       Fair enough. I personally think we shouldn't be so quick to dispel myth as fiction. Especially considering that a decent amount of it says the same thing despite it being from peoples and regions that could not have had contact with one another. You kind of contradicting yourself when you say old myths are idiotic stories while in the same paragraph praising ancient mankind for his brilliance.

       I completely agree that myth contains fact. What Hancock does is take the completely ridiculous decorative embroidery from myths, and leaves the substance behind. Along with his feigned Pareidolia
/Apophenia, it makes a potent potion for the moronic among us.

       Interesting perspective. What about similarities in myths from say South Americans and Australian aboriginies, who could have had literally no contact, unless there was a previous global civilisation, which is what Hancock is a main champion of? Also what's your opinion on Velikovsky?

       So what's your cutoff. Thousands of years is acceptable but millions is not? So we can be incorrect. But not "that" incorrect? I know big numbers are scary but just because it's illogical doesn't mean it's wrong.

       "I" don't have a cutoff, but since humans didn't even leave Africa at the point these "studies" are claiming, I think you can extrapolate accordingly yourself. Or are you one of those people who don't believe in evolution? Who believe we're descended from aliens who poofed our embryos out of their asses like dandelion seeds, populating the entire planet a million years ago??

       There IS NO evidence with which to "reconcile", but if there were, the standard is to scrutinize that evidence itself when it remains aberrant to or challenges the

       It's. Not. Evidence. And again, the standard is to scrutinize the anomalous evidence first. Which hasn't been done. Because it's not evidence. We could go back and forth like this for years.

       the biggest reason is i believe two things. it destroys religious narratives formed by the fairy tales they are AND at the same time it takes out darwin. both camps will not acknowledge these discovery's. the vatican, and the smithsonian. niether will fund excavations or investigations. both have been proven to hide or outright destroy evidence of far more ancient and honestly technologically advanced cultures.

       The planet is actually getting warmer. That's a problem we need to solve real fuckin' quick or we're quite literally toast. Reducing CO2 emissions is a great start, because we know that they do have an impact, a sizeable one, to the effect that reducing them substantially will at least buy us some time. The thing about the climate change issue that really pisses me off, is that people will acknowledge that humans must be contributing to the planet getting warmer-even the most adamant deniers will indeed acknowledge that-yet there is no call to action to do what we can do reduce the heating of the planet. It seems like many people that are skeptical of and deny climate change are content with just letting the planet get warmer because there's nothing we can do, a sentiment I don't share as a skeptic of the official climate change narrative.  Something about their belief in revelations and the end times I guess.

       Personally I think these scientists are inclined to reinforce their existing narrative because they've already amassed large amounts of evidence to build this existing narrative. Instead of logging away all exceptions to their narrative so they can be accounted for and taken into consideration, they just forget about them. Even if you did take into account all the evidence, if the evidence really is as old as tests would suggest, you wouldn't have as much evidence for an older human presence as you would for a younger human presence. Archaeological evidence is destroyed by time.

       Right but if you don't have a model to support the existence of people 20,000 years ago, you just throw that evidence out-regard it as an outlier and assume it isn't what it looks like, because if you don't, you'll have to replace the existing theory and all its models with something new, which you have no evidence for (because it has been thrown out every time this happens instead of used to create another theory).

      <p>
       Models are made based on actual observations, yes, but the number of actual observations that suggests the present young human working model far exceeds the older human model, so every time new evidence comes around it gets disregarded.

       Yes but if 90% of the evidence and existing models you find contradicts that older model, you won't gain any support. You'll be ostracized by your peers.

       But why would scientists immediately come to conclusions and create models based on limited evidence? I mean, before creating models, shouldn't they wait to see if evidence of ancient human activity comes up?

       For example, the "out of Africa" theory was based on a few fossil finds.

       They did wait to see if evidence of ancient human activity came up, and it didn't. In fact very little evidence did come up at all, so they had to come up with something.

      <p>
       It's not like there isn't data to support a younger human civilization now. That's not the point. The obstacle anthropologists face is connecting all of their data in some way so as to acknowledge discarded data points (connecting the older artifacts to the newer ones). No one will do that because they will be ostracized and won't get funding to do it.

       I agree with you about everything except this part:

      <blockquote>

        They did wait to see if evidence of ancient human activity came up, and it didn't. In fact very little evidence did come up at all for anthropology in general, so they had to come up with something.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Michael Cremo in his book
       <em>
        Forbidden Archaeology
       </em>
       shows that from the beginning, shortly after Darwin published
       <em>
        On the Origin of Species
       </em>
       , scientists had an inherent belief that humans were a very recent species. He documents that scientists of that time period discredited archaic finds by saying things like how it's "impossible" for humans to be that old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cremo also shows that before, and shortly after, Darwin's publication, scientists were discovering several artifacts showing human activity going back to even hundreds of millions of years ago.

       Right but there was an extreme absence of data-not like the volumes of anthropological data we presently have, so if you are presented with very little data for either worldview, and you have to make a judgment call, you're going to go with what seems to be informed by other, tangential or non scientific information, which is what young human theory seemed at the time. I'm not trying to defend it, I'm just articulating that anthropologists at the time were faced with a shit situation and tried to make the best of it. Soon after they were presented with heaping piles of evidence that supported their decision, which was good.

       "unless you were spawned from Lemurian rectal dust, these are your ancestors too." Interesting statement... so you believe in Lemurians but not Atlantians? (Which is in essence what I am calling the Amorites) :p
