       I thought I remembered seeing this debunked because the FBI listed it as a massacre or something like that. Sandy hook is still bullshit though.

       I definitely recall coming across that reasoning as well — that since it was considered a mass shooting the numbers weren't included in the homicide stats — though not sure one way or the other of its legitimacy.

       Crime stats come from whatever department has jurisdiction. At Sandy Hook, the state police was in charge, so the stats would come from them. The Sandy hook murders are included in the state totals.

       Do you know any parents of the victims personally? Do you know any parents of any children at Sandy Hook? What did they tell you about the situation? Did they see anything first hand or second hand from parents, children or teachers?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one conspiracy I never really bought into. It seemed too far fetched and twisted (even more far fetched and twisted than blowing up the twin towers). But, I decided to watch the video with an open mind, and there are indeed a lot of anomalies with this case, and Wolfgang Halbig brings up some interesting points. In particular, why were the students in the Sandy Hook choir that sang at the NFL given a gag order never to speak about it? Why weren't the students officially recognized in the School Board meeting minutes or celebrated in any way? Why were some of the parents of the children displaying "dupers delight," ie strange smiles and laughter on camera? I recognize that this is all circumstantial. And I find it impossible to believe that an entire town of 27,000 people was in on this if it was indeed a Hoax. But making it illegal to receive access to any records via FOIA requests to any of the Sandy Hook documents is incredibly suspicious. The names of the students and their parents have already been released, so blocking any records release is not about keeping the victims' privacy. If its not about that, then what was the reasoning? This, and the convenient repeal of the law prohibiting the use of Propaganda against the American people 6 months before this incident, just leave me with an unsettled feeling.

       Ultimately, a lot about the case doesn't add up, but the fact remains that if it was an elaborate drill/hoax, it would be incredibly difficult to cover up. For those who believe the kids didn't die there are only two possible conclusions: 1) the children never really existed (this would be easy to disprove if there is first hand testimony from the kids' classmates, a little internet digging and I can't find any interviews of the surviving kids, but thats not surprising given privacy laws of minors, still a little suspicious); 2) the children were actors, and were whisked away to their homes after the incident (if this were true, eventually one of these kid actors will have remorse and might come forward, but night for risk of going to jail due to gag order).
      </p>
      <p>
       The parents' unusual reactions to their children are still incredibly strange, the gag orders the government issued to survivors, and the sealing of all documents related the case are what is going to continue to fuel this conspiracy, and with good reason.

        know

       You know, I have a really hard time with some of you conspiracy guys. I enjoy conspiracy as much as anyone else on this sub, but there's a huge difference between finding a conspiracy in the facts, and creating one regardless of the facts.

       Is it possible the incident was designed to promote an agenda?

       If you actually took the time to look at the facts that you are ragging on about, you'd find the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       There is dash cam video out there from an on scene officer at Sandy Hook showing the entirety of the Sandy Hook parking lot and giving full view to all alleged evacuation points.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are documents containing time stamped entries of when and where officers, with alleged children, were coming out of the school.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you compare the time stamps in these official documents to the police officer's dash cam, THERE IS NO ACTIVITY DURING THESE TIME STAMPS. The officer is set up to see the whole area. There is no stream of kids with escorting officers. There's barely any activity on cam that indicates a shooting occurred at all.

       Also everytime Sandy Hook is mentioned and someone from Newtown shows up they always use the same appeal to emotion fallacy.  "THINK OF THE CHILDREN!!!"  Yeah, i'll think of the children when I see proof of their existence or death.

       Sandy Hook seems like such a frikking hoax though. It's what actually got me into conspiracy. I was so gutted when it happened, just so sad, crying at my desk and I started searching it and things just seemed so weird. Not one single person ever cried one actual tear in any available media and I was bawling in my car driving home every day for a couple weeks after it happened. And eventually it seemed so obvious that it just didn't happen--or it happened entirely different than what was claimed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have close and personal experience with a popular conspiracy subject and I know with 100% certainty the truth about it. I tried in the past to post about it, but no one believes me and I just get mocked and downvoted, so I don't try anymore and I just let it go.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe you are telling the truth.

       You think you're going to see blood from news helicopters?

       Yeah I would expect to be able to see some blood from a news helicopter at the site where 26 people were shot to death. I would also expect to see some footage of the other children at the school being evacuated. Where were the other &gt;450 children that were supposed to be at school that day? And why was there so much mold on the building? It's as if the school hadn't even been in use for several years.....

       The shooting took place inside and you wonder why the news helicopters didn't show any blood?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what you got from the helicopters. You really think it would show any blood?

       By the time the news choppers were there, the kids had already been evacuated.
      </p>

       If you look at the hi-res photos in the crime report, the school wasn't in that bad of shape. It's about what you would expect for a school that old.

       Look at the pictures and video taken at the school.  It was Dec and cold.  Yet not one winter jacket, hats, mittens, ...what you do see are stand up fans in nearly all the rooms...in winter? Other parts of the school even have open windows ...You dont see school work out on desks... most if not all desks appear empty.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rooms should have coats and jackets everywhere. Nothing.
