       I was talking to my neighbor he's about 15 years younger and I asked him he understood the roots of the US hated if Iran. I understand schools not teaching this: 
The 1953 Iranian coup d'état, known in Iran as the 28 Mordad coup (Persian: کودتای ۲۸ مرداد‎‎), was the overthrow of the democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in favour of strengthening the monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi on 19 August 1953, orchestrated by the United Kingdom (under the name "Operation Boot") and the United States (under the name TPAJAX Project or "Operation Ajax"). It's a true conspiracy, but something out government wouldn't want people to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       But not teaching about the hostage crisis that students like me counted the days in school seemed strange. This may not fall under typical conspiracy, but kind of curious what kind of American history is taught in school.

       I was joking, should have added the /s. I've never seen amistad, but they made us roots and the morning after. The morning after was about nuclear holocaust and roots was slavery. They also made us all watch the space shuttle blow up, but that wasn't planned and fucking terrible too.

       It's only taught as a primary factor for Carter losing. And not to get people to feel sorry for carter, just to plant doubt about Reagan's popularity.

       Carter was and is a great human being, probably a saint from my atheist view, but not a great President. He really meant well, but the hostage crisis was one oft his many failings. Gas lines really killed him.

       Not all his fault, though, because Reagan's people were working with the Iranians.  It's not a coincidence that they were freed immediately when Reagan became president.

       He is most certainly the best ex-president we've ever had and probably will ever have.

       You are living in that history, have you ever felt threatened by Iran? Bedsides the scare tactics, nuclear ambition, fighting terrorists that have never attacked us and something Russia. It's the same with Cuba. How fucking scary is Cuba? It's not, but the baby boomers (got called out for Trump generation, but don't want to over or under include) have a ingrained fear of Cuba, it's stupid.

       Most US public schools focus heavily on 1607-1950 when it comes to US history.  It is a deliberate way to censor and stop the youth from understanding how the national security state operates.  Worse yet, with the introduction of Common Core, children are now losing the heavy exposure to the American Revolution and Constitutional foundation.

       Thank you! That's what I was aiming at. We have all sorts of conspiracies on here about who controls what and so many are true. I can say the same for the Korean War, I thought the show MASH was about Vietnam for a long time as kid, because government didn't really want us to know about that quagmire.

       Fair. I think it may just be recency bias that we hear more about Vietnam, but Korea is definitely the forgotten war of the 21st century by comparison.

       Really up until the mid 90's, I never heard of Kim Jung IL. I of courses knew that there was a Korean war, but I couldn't tell you the outcome and was in the Navy in the 90's. Korea really was forgotten until recently.

       Since it was never brought up, and maybe not you personality since you're here, but what is the context for the US hatred of Iran? Or was it ever brought up? I guess terrorism, but they're link is really weak and nuclear ambition, but Pakistan is nuclear and more staple then Iran.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of counting the days in elementary school and truth hunting, I've always known the US reasons are based in bullshit, we fucked them first. Trump reminds me Bush Jr going after Iraq over a grudge, he's a lot older and hate of Iran is ingrained, in my opinion.

       Yea that's basically it: nukes and terrorism, some mention of their alliance with Russia too. No discussion of the petrodollar, private central banks, oil lines, or the Shia/Sunni conflict. I think trump will continue the trend, seeing as how military "aid" to Saudi Arabia and Israel has continued unabated under him.

       Umm history in public school is an absolute joke. They only talk about Great America and anything heavily involving us. Anything else is looked over and not seen as necessary education material.

       I guess what's interesting to me about this is that is actively not taught in the generation of most of your teachers and parents. If you were in school at any age in 1979, you know how many days they had our hostages. It was 444 by the end. This was an event and the reason for Trump's hated if Iran. From the post comment out obviously goes back further.

       One of the things that's heartbreaking too, is that your teachers and parents probably counted the days on the chalkboard like I did. In many ways they have erased my peers memory of the event. To Trump's generation the overthrow if Iran's government is the same as 9/11 being an inside job. So my parents have an ingrained hated if Iran and do no matter what Iran does is wrong. I'm not saying the leaders of Iran are great, they are as bad as the rest of the world, but just wanted to add insight.

       Trump's generation, I should say baby boomers. I'm a gen-x'er, as they call it. I think they're are divisions in the baby boomers of weather they were the free love hippy or the conservative bunch. Trump was part of the conservative bunch and many hippies went that way as well. Regardless, the baby boomer generation came after the overthrow of Iran, but nothing was released about it until long afterwards and it was belittled as conspiracy. I shouldn't of said Trump's generation, but painting to broad or narrow strokes of a time frame and perception is difficult.

       In fact I really didn't learn much about recent history until college, seems like every year was focusing on the revolutionary War, civil war, and some ancient things like the church reformation and things like that.

       I just read parts of your history and you are very well informed. The sad part is this isn't even a conspiracy, President Carter sent in a rescue mission that failed and killed people (not looking up at the moment, so don't remember how many). It was THE of all of the news of 1979. Along with long gas lines and shortages, which I'm realizing you didn't learn about at all, either.

       The scariest part of 1984 to me was removing words from the dictionary, that's removing knowledge and wisdom. Removing common knowledge or memory of events that happened while over 50% of the population is still living is truly Orwellian. Ask anyone over 45 and they'll tell you about the hostages.

       I'm going to assume you're a senior or recently graduated. Do you know if they teach anything about the stock market or how out works? It was never taught when I was in school and I'm wondering if that's still true.

       we did like some stuff around the stock market in financial literacy which was a required course, but not really. we just did the stock market game and they had us pick stocks and justify it, but they didn't teach anything really. Economics we did more, but nothing crazy in depth just basics on how it works what some of the stuff means etc.

       This may be the biggest conspiracy of all. It's how this country became the wealthiest on earth. I have Bloomberg or CNBC on all the time, and I've started asking everyone I know if they know what any of it means and the answer is always no. 
Not teaching the population how to generate wealth will ensure they stay poor and obedient.

       Idk the influx of dumb money would probably be good for smart investors. The thing is that most people just dont really care and claim they dont have time and shit and they wont ever understand that stuff or whatever. I told my mom years ago a couple stocks to buy and to invest her money and she still hasnt taken any action even though she knows that its good for her. Most people hate the chance of them losing money even if odds are over the long term they come out on top.
