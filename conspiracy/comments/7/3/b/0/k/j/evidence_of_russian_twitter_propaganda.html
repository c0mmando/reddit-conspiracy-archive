I am really interested to see it because it must have been really good if it brainwashed so many Americans into voting for Trump. I mean, correct the record and media matters couldn&#39;t convince enough people to vote for Hillary but 200 Russian Twitter accounts got the job done for Trump. Seriously, it must be some really good propaganda if it was so effective</p>

He was on the news 24/7 if you don&#39;t remember. He got more air time then any other candidate, I think he got something like a billion dollars worth of free air time because they reported on him every single day for months on end</p>

<p>It is no-ones fault but Hillary and the DNC for fielding the shittiest of candidates.</p>

<p>&quot;I have an idea. Let&#39;s sandbag the best candidate. Let&#39;s give him shit coverage. Let&#39;s show the people how out of touch we actually are. That will <em>definitely</em> work&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I believe you. The only problem is, I don&#39;t use Twitter, I don&#39;t follow Donald Trump, I never have. I honestly don&#39;t like him at all, I voted for Bernie who is basically the very opposite of trump in terms of policy and politics in general. Honestly man, I don&#39;t want to argue with you about trump, I don&#39;t care about trump. I want to talk about how to make this world a better place to live in. Straight up, that&#39;s what I want. I get caught up sometimes and angry about the state of Reddit and the media in general but all that anger and energy is just misspent. I just like this website, I only joined to follow Bennie&#39;s campaign at the beginning, but I guess I got sucked into Reddit somewhere during along the line.</p>

<p>Anyways, it&#39;s sad that this site has degraded into such a dismal state. There is no conviviality, no manners. It&#39;s like a free for all of pure negativity and hate. R/s4p was such a wonderful, positive place. We accomplished so much just on our own, no authority to tell us what to do, we all just phone banked and donated on our own, just for fun I guess you could say. It was so empowering being part of the effort to get Bernie elected. I wanted something and I was proactively contributing towards making that goal a reality and it felt great.</p>

<p>Then, Reddit got shitty with shills everywhere and it has sucked ever since.</p>
