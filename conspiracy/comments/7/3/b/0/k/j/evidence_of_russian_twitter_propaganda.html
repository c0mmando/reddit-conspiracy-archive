       Does anyone have some evidence of the Russian Twitter propaganda? I am really interested to see it because it must have been really good if it brainwashed so many Americans into voting for Trump. I mean, correct the record and media matters couldn't convince enough people to vote for Hillary but 200 Russian Twitter accounts got the job done for Trump. Seriously, it must be some really good propaganda if it was so effective

       Op That is a really pathetic talking point since billions of dollars are spent influencing people and the sole purpose of Fox News to influence people like the Trump voters and yourself.

       And you are showing us you don't know how Twitter works, but are here pontificating as if you do.  Twitter is all about how many followers you have.

       Cool, so you must have at least a single example, like a tweet or a Facebook post. It's really hard to combat Russian propaganda when I've never seen an example of it

       I haven't made a claim that Twitter or Facebook produced propaganda, you are here making that claim to promote a conservative created talking point.
      </p>
      <p>
       The talking point being that people are not affected by propaganda.

       You asked how 62 million people were convinced he would be a good president, I'm saying that he probably didn't need to convince that many. He was on the news 24/7 if you don't remember. He got more air time then any other candidate, I think he got something like a billion dollars worth of free air time because they reported on him every single day for months on end

       But unfortunately, she didn’t campaign in some states at the end, people don’t want to feel ignored, and she didn’t get out the vote. All those buses used to bus protestors around should have been bussing people to the poles.

       (shrugs) he wasn't Hillary? I don't like the asshole either but its not a conspiracy and the electoral college isn't either. Yes she won the popular vote blah blah. That's not how this works.

       It is no-ones fault but Hillary and the DNC for fielding the shittiest of candidates.

       So, the Russians could do this but Hillary's campaign couldn't? Didn't she spend like millions of dollars in her campaign? And that couldn't defeat the Russians Twitter bots?

       If you want to see evidence of twitter bots take a look at Trump's twitter feed the first comments are almost always a bot spamming a bunch of pro or anti trump messages.

       Pick any post by Trump. It is a bot spam war and this is after Twitter removed 200 users/bots (lol).

       Ok, I believe you. The only problem is, I don't use Twitter, I don't follow Donald Trump, I never have. I honestly don't like him at all, I voted for Bernie who is basically the very opposite of trump in terms of policy and politics in general. Honestly man, I don't want to argue with you about trump, I don't care about trump. I want to talk about how to make this world a better place to live in. Straight up, that's what I want. I get caught up sometimes and angry about the state of Reddit and the media in general but all that anger and energy is just misspent. I just like this website, I only joined to follow Bennie's campaign at the beginning, but I guess I got sucked into Reddit somewhere during along the line.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, it's sad that this site has degraded into such a dismal state. There is no conviviality, no manners. It's like a free for all of pure negativity and hate. R/s4p was such a wonderful, positive place. We accomplished so much just on our own, no authority to tell us what to do, we all just phone banked and donated on our own, just for fun I guess you could say. It was so empowering being part of the effort to get Bernie elected. I wanted something and I was proactively contributing towards making that goal a reality and it felt great.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, Reddit got shitty with shills everywhere and it has sucked ever since.
