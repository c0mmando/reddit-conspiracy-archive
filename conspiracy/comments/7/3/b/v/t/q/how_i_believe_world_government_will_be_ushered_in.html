        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The first two world wars taught a lot of different types of people a lot of different types of things. For bankers and other members of the financial class, war was good for business. </p>

<p>It taught the titans of industry that they could profit from war, too. Remington made typewriters before the war. They&#39;re now best-known for their firearms.</p>

<p>It taught those in power the absolutely incredible persuasive power of effective propaganda. This style of harnessing the power of persuasion was adapted for use during peacetime and exists today as the advertising and public relations industries. </p>

<p>It taught thinking people that war wasn&#39;t really about freeing the oppressed or spreading democracy or protecting the homeland. It was the powerful sending the powerless to die for, ultimately, monetary reasons.</p>

<p>Most importantly though, it taught <em>us</em>, the everyday people, the human cost of war. The death toll figures from World War II by themselves make us quiver at the thought of such widespread conflict ever occurring again.</p>

<p>Then they developed the bomb.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t alive during the time of the &quot;Cuban Missile Crisis&quot;, though I have studied it extensively. We&#39;re even more afraid of a nuclear World War than a conventional one. </p>

<p>It&#39;s no secret that there are people in power who would like to see to it that a world governing body is established. With it would come one ruler, one currency, one ministry of truth, one media—you get it. Many &quot;globalists&quot; as they&#39;re called, make no attempt at keeping this desire a secret.</p>

<p>The new &quot;Allied Powers&quot; are the American Empire and its allies. The new &quot;Axis Powers&quot; are Russia and China and their allies. Forget about North Korea. This is a distraction. </p>

<p>I believe we will, at some point, be artificially brought to the brink of what the media will surely call &quot;World War 3&quot;. The use of nuclear weapons will be said to be all but inevitable by the talking heads on the television. This will be drilled into the minds of the populations all over the world. TV shows will depict a post-nuclear American wasteland. Markets will become unstable. Markets can be artificially manipulated by those with the keys to the kingdom. The war propaganda machine will be performing at full capacity. People will be <em>terrified</em>. </p>

<p>The United Nations will hold meetings, special diplomatic conferences will be convened. But in the end, it will all be for naught. </p>

<p><strong><em>Finally, they&#39;ll offer us the solution to the &quot;problem&quot; they created, and the masses will be so terrified of our &quot;eminent demise&quot; that they&#39;ll gladly accept this new system and even thank their masters for &quot;avoiding catastrophe&quot;. They’ll apply for the new jobs at the new bank. The new world police force and military will need officers and troops. They’ll join. They’ll enlist.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>They’ll submit.</em></strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. The threat of global war is is a pretty strong pursuador. Fear just might make even the best of us common folk buy into a one world agenda. There a more powerful tools though, disease, manufactured catastrophes, money market collaps, false flag ufo&#39;s, etc. etc. I think any or all of these will be used in combination with the threat of WW3.</p>

Then they&#39;ll &quot;unite&quot; (in reality they both already have militias and unity) and that&#39;ll be the world government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it would be even worse, although I&#39;m definitely not a fan of government, especially in its current form. The corporatocracy would be overt and tremendously violent, as it would pretend to be voluntary.</p>

<p>For example, Google could say &quot;you don&#39;t want this chip in you arm/brain? Fine, you&#39;re free to leave, and to go fend for yourself in the wilderness&quot;. That wilderness of course would be where the majority of humanity is, and where the corporations would be free to bomb/enslave/experiment/etc.</p>

<p>But ultimately they will fail, because an increasing number are <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5tdzyh/if_you_realize_all_your_sensory_experiences/">awakening to the truth</a>. Also because technology is an extremely assymetrical weapon: it is much easier to hack/destroy a complex and centralized system than it is to secure/maintain it. The chief revolutionaries of tomorrow will undoubtedly be hackers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The New World Order will be characterized by the perfection of the ancient systems of control via our tech.  Gradually cellular technology will be tied to one&#39;s financial, medical, social and legal identity.   The cell phone is already the new confessional and the sacred confidence is a facade now as then.  The cellular_computing information network will ultimately serve the historical functions of the church, state,  and many institutions in defining mass consciousness and directing the human swarm in emotion,  thought,  habit,  action...  I believe a cataclysmic war will be the platform under which the network will be openly weaponized and unified with the legal/financial systems...   It would be highly inconvenient to implement in the absence of a thought radicalising conflict.  </p>

<p>Once the system is perfected the gradual population reduction already proceeding will continue and grow more violent and open... And the people now under their technological yolk will be powerless psychologically and spiritually to resist as they slave away in manifesting an apocalypse of the soul..</p>

<p>Or maybe not and a new age of creativity and collective accomplishment will be ushered in.   Maybe both.</p>
