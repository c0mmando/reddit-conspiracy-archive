       , not
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       . Post things that spark actual investigations, or hold actual evidence of something you're claiming. People on here recently are just finding shitty ass articles written by no-namers with the same repeated bullshit media story or scientific study. No one here should fucking care what document Trump just signed, or whatever he is doing, unless you have a conspiracy to back it and that involves it. I don't give a fuck about the seventh dude to give a 3 hour lecture on the CIA or Prophecies. This sub should be about constructively using information provided to us like this and creating our own ideas about things and conspiracies. Posts should be original content in my opinion and in those original content posts is where these links can go.
       <br/>
       &amp;nbsp;

       As for the crazy people of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       that post those long-winding stories about how reptilians already control us or how everything is a hologram, keep it up. Just actually find some proof through research to back it up, because spouting nonsense isn't productive.
       <br/>
       &amp;nbsp;
       <br/>
       TL;DR: Reptilians control us and are telling me telepathically to improve the  quality of the sub.

       I don't think so. There's hardly any 'conspiracy' in this sub. Just links to videos or stories that often just filler like "US is controlled by the Deep State" and everyone just eats it up and rockets it to the front page.

       I never posted here before, but I've been lurking for some time now and I noticed how posts about whatever crazy creatures already control everything hardly ever even have one shred of evidence or even observations.

       People wanna talk about the conspiracy of bankers that keeps us all desperate and poor, and that's an avenue to start a discussion. If you don't like it, you can downvote it and not engage in the comments. No one is forcing you to read it or participate in the discussion.

       I completely agree that the tweet should be able to start a discussion. But I think just posting the tweet is ineffective and against the point of the sub. Why not incorporate the tweet into a conspiracy you have if you really think it's important enough to be posted.

       Couldn't agree more, we're becoming r/news2.0
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of links to MSM sites or quotes from them boggles my mind. Choose a side, we chose a long time so to label the MSM as BS and for the most part the enemy. So when they come out and say something that sorta goes along with what we generally have been pushing, guess what? It's part of their agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't say "Hey guys the MSM says Christianity is bad!" Ask yourself why they want to label them the enemy! If the MSM and politicians​ (Red, blue, green and orange) are the enemy then those they stack must be beneficial to making too some degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, you can hate religion if that's your thing I don't care. The top dogs off every religion may all be corrupt and swimming in piles of money, maybe maybe not. BUT I believe they are stacked and smeared in the news not because "on that point the MSM is right" but because religion isn't it's leaders, it is it's teachings and parishioners and if it's parishioners lead more moral lives because of it's teachings then they are harder to control. Drugs and sex are MEANS OF CONTROL, if you avoid them you are or controllable. So they smear those organizations to keep you away from them, not because they have your back.

       It's because everyone feels like they have to contribute their 2 cents on the political subjects. It's disheartening to open a post and then see a bunch of communists circle jerking...
