<p>Me to, and I agree with your four no&#39;s.</p>

<p>If this is scripted it will continue to unfold in many different ways--like the JFK assassination or 9/11. </p>

<p>And Trump is not a victim of this hoax, he&#39;s a willing participant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange can never admit Seth Rich was the leaker if it is true, as it would seriously harm Wikileaks&#39; ability to get leaks in the future.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t see actual evidence of Russian interference because there isn&#39;t any.  The most you&#39;ll get are testimonial lies from CIA/NSA employees.</p>

<p>Sadly, Trump probably will end up on top somehow, but I don&#39;t think this issue will be why.</p>

<p>No one will ever face retribution for spreading lies about &quot;Russian hacking&quot;.  All these weasels are in bed with each other, whether there is a D or an R in front of their name.</p>

<p>It would also prove him to be a liar. The whole point of wikileaks is the system that guarantees anonymity. So he doesn&#39;t know. If he does know, then he&#39;s been lying too the world for over a decade about the site. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree.  We know manning and Snowden were both WL sources.  WL has never admitted it, but its obvious and its known by the world and by WL itself.  And Seth is the source in the leak this time.  Theres no other explanation why WL would spend so many tweets about his death, offer a reward and then up that amount.  Continually draw attention to his death and all but name him as the source.  He&#39;s clearly the leak source.  And if Aaron rich was paid for the leak WL knows that as well, I assume they dont blindly give money and not have it cleared by the organization as a whole.  </p>

<p>Its not anonymous to them, WL.  Its anonymous to us.  They know who sent them information.  They chose to not release it because they protect whistleblowers but its ridiculous to assert they themselves dont know who leaked the information.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>additionally I think its clear Charles Murray played a role in it.  Assange said he Murray spoke out of turn, but I do think he was a intermediary or middle man for all this.

<p>Who specifically is trying to start a hate fest? Libertarians? Have you really been convinced that freedom is bad? Jesus man you have really lost it havent you?</p>

<p>Have you ever actually listened to infowars? Have you listened to Alex Jones&#39;s older broadcasts? He may be wrong sometimes and he also is admittedly on Trump&#39;s <em>team</em> but he is also right about a shit ton of fucking shit. Like he predicted 911 and frogs really are being turned into hermaphrodites by atrazine. </p>

<p>Atrazine was actually discovered by a cross dressing black man so libs should love him, <em>very brogressive xDd</em>:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmytXKe0OcM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmytXKe0OcM</a></p>

<p>Also 911 prediction: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8Hk1-BpXO8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8Hk1-BpXO8</a></p>

<p>He knew because of this:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_Ladin_Determined_To_Strike_in_US">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_Ladin_Determined_To_Strike_in_US</a></p>

<p>Also Alex Jones is not some fucking racist like everyone thinks he is hes a fucking suuuuuuuper open minded guy. He is just the only one with balls enough to call out radical Islamists on air. He also features Muslims on his show sometimes and they even talk about how fucked up parts of the fundamentalist culture are. <em>What happened to liberals rejecting dogma!??!?!?</em> </p>

<p>If you found this post informative and ironically become an Alex Jones fan in the future please consider buying some water filters or dick pills from him:</p>

<p>Also I comepletly disagree with her but Abby Martin is my favorite liberal political activist. Her and her brother have a podcast which is good because theyre red pilled on most things even though theyre infected by the socialist mind virus:</p>

<p>I was mostly pointing out the federal government claimed 20 states were <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-states-election-hacking-russia-20170922-story.html">&quot;hacked.&quot;</a>:</p>

<p>The federal government on Friday told election officials in 21 states that hackers targeted their systems before last year&#39;s presidential election.</p>

<p>And many of those states claim Russians are behind it, as noted in the article linked above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Wisconsin Election Commission, for example, said the state&#39;s systems were targeted by &quot;Russian government cyber actors.&quot; Alaska Elections Division Director Josie Bahnke said computers in Russia were scanning election systems looking for vulnerabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And even California claims its the Russians:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is completely unacceptable that it has taken DHS over a year to inform our office of Russian scanning of our systems, despite our repeated requests for information,&quot; California Secretary of State Alex Padilla a Democrat, said in a statement. </p>

<p>Seth Rich was not in a position to leak the emails, but if you pretend he did, it still doesn&#39;t matter because there was nothing in the emails worth killing for.  </p>

<p>Assange could put a stop to the speculation, but he won&#39;t because he can&#39;t.  He enjoys the attention.  He likes to say he&#39;ll never reveal a source for their protection, but if Seth&#39;s the leaker and he genuinely believes he was killed for it, by either Russia or the DNC,  it&#39;s irresponsible to keep that to himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not specifically.  Im just talking about anything that would be publicly stated or shown that would prove Trump/Russia is a lie and hoax.  Theres alot of people, left and never trumpers who are all in on the Trump Russia thing.  They are 100 percent convinced that Trump is a russian spy/agent and so is JA.  My main question is regarding whether there will be fallout when its proven there is no Russia connection.  Russia didnt hack anything.  Trump isn&#39;t friends with Putin and Russia didnt influence the election.  And WL and JA have no connection to Russia.  When that comes out, Im wondering if the people who are pushing this witch hunt will have to face justice and say sorry for putting the world and Trump himself through this absurd coup attempt</p>
