       In the press conference the Sheriff says that a "maintenance worker for Mandalay Bay was also on the 32nd floor, and that Compos 'prevented him from any injuries'"... who tf is this maintenance worker? Why haven't we heard his story? If there was a maintenance worker on that 32 floor WITH compos, AFTER compos was shot, then WHY THE HELL didn't Compos go back down the elevator with the maintenance guy?? Because on the scanner audio, zebra-20 I believe, was the one in the stairwell or hallway right by the shooters room and when the dispatch or whoever asks for roll call, Zebra-20 (or the other team) names the officers he is with and also says "and a security guard from MB"... no mention of any maintenance worker, or anybody else for that matter... so
      </p>
      <p>
       If what the Sheriff said about a maintenance worker also being on floor 32 with Campos (campos was there first though, and had already supposedly been shot) is true, then that means the maintenance worker obviously left the floor at some point before the cops arrived. Right?! So two questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) if the maintenance worker just happened to stumble upon Campos bleeding by the elevator when he got to floor 32, then why the fuck did he not immediately take Campos with him back downstairs to safety and medical attention?!
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) where did this maintenance worker go? Did he report it? If not, was he involved? I really really really want to hear his side of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shit is not adding up to me at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why did it take police so long to locate the shooter's room if this maintenance worker was able to make it back downstairs? You'd think the very first thing he would do would be to inform security and police of which room the shooter is in? And also that there is a wounded security guard on floor 32? This is Sketch City.

       But according to a police scanner I listened to, the guard was waiting at bottom of elevator when police arrived at 32nd floor.

       Yeah the arms deal that was going down with weapons bought in the shooters name from regular gun stores lol. What a highly sophisticated CIA organised gun running ring he was involved in right?
