    <div class="md"><p>It would make sense if he got hit in the chest. Would make sense about the long relods and the differing fire. Could of been shooting at door and then shooting out window. Panicked because he got caught early.it would explain the varying sounds and sounds of multiple/simultaneous gunfire. Maybe I just got brainwashed into thinking that or that explains it. Hope to find out more friday and get a more accurate timeline. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At Sunday at almost 10pm, someone fires 200 rounds into the hallway on the 32nd floor on the Mandalay Bay. No one calls 911? No one calls the front desk saying they heard what sounded like gun shots? Bullets would have sprayed into the rooms across the hall. But 911 was never called until the shooting at the concern starts. That seems odd.</p>

<p>But without question, Campos forced Paddock to start early. Whether the drilling part was true, the door was left open, he committed suicide even before the police got there, there seems to be some level of panic created by Campos wandering by. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haven&#39;t seen anyone say this yet, but if the door was open I have more than one ideas :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Maybe Campos saw Paddock outside the room and then Paddock ran in and grabbed a gun to start shooting at him. This seems most likely. The shooter&#39;s actions seemed unplanned in some ways. </p></li>
<li><p>Paddock caught something on fire while setting up (Super unlikely) and opened the door for ventilation. </p></li>
<li><p>Gunfire in an enclosed space could be very disorienting, maybe he opened the door for that reason. Reports that he didn&#39;t wear ear protection as well. No source. </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Was not ajar, not was it responsible for triggering the open door alarm. </p>

<p>As reported by the undersheriff last Thursday: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>An open door <strong>a few rooms away</strong> from the Las Vegas suite of the man who was gunning down concertgoers at a music festival <strong>set off an alarm that prompted a response from a security guard</strong>, Clark County Undersheriff Kevin C. McMahill said Friday.</p>

<p>The <strong>alarm from a room &quot;a number of doors down&quot; from Paddock&#39;s likely was a coincidence</strong>, McMahill told CNN&#39;s &quot;The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.&quot; <strong>The door was not forced open, had been open for a while, and Paddock didn&#39;t have the keys to that room</strong>. McMahill said <strong>that door either had been left open or didn&#39;t shut completely</strong>.</p>

<p>And re-stated by the Sheriff in today&#39;s briefing. </p>

A room full of supposedly fully automatic weapons, semi automatic weapons and the “skill set” to do what was done.... then a revolver. An unlikely every day carry weapon of choice by a sweatpant, loafer wearing video poker player. Seems like the kind of weapon a hotel security guard might carry though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if Campos was the arms dealer?
He can get guns in and out of the casino easier than a hotel guest and access to where cameras are.
He is using Paddock to legally purchase guns to resell and/or to launder the arms money. 
A casino guard can&#39;t deposit large cash amounts without drawing red flags, but not as suspicious with Paddock laundering the money playing video poker at almost 100% return.
A gun accidentally discharges or there is an argument.  This would explain the first 2-3 random shots before everyone is shot at the concert.  Paddock was either intentionally or accidentally shot and they shoot him again to kill him.
A guest calls in about the gun shots and Campos/gun buyers now need an escape plan.
They shoot up the concert.  Campos has a key to all rooms so it would explain access to another or second room.
The last pause then few random shots are when they shoot Campos to make it look like an accident and the buyers escape.
Footage hasn&#39;t been released because A) Mandalay Bay is liable because Campos is the reason and B) they don&#39;t want the gun buyers to know they are looking for them.  There is a larger network of gun buyers they are trying to track down.
It would also explain why we haven&#39;t heard from Campos - perhaps he is the main suspect who is being interrogated.</p>
