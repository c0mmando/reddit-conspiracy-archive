       Just a theory... 60 minutes had an interview with the makeshift SWAT team tonight. I have a feeling that somewhere recorded in that interview they alluded to Jesus Campos being shot prior to the shooting and that part was pulled. Why do I think this? Because it is now known that he checked in Sept. 25 and not the 27th. It was only when Laura Loomer pushed the question through, that they finally addressed the discrepancy. My point is that they have shown that they are only willing to change the official narrative when they are backed into a corner and have no choice. I don't for one second believe they willingly offered up that change in the timeline unless it was absolutely necessary.  Something or someone pushed their hand.

       I just posted this on another thread, and thought I’d share it here, too:

       //

      <p>
       I can’t believe I’m actually posting a ‘theory’... But a wild idea just came to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there any chance Paddock was prepping for more would-be attackers to show for an attack later (that night? Next day?) and in the process of setting things up (there has been some chatter that he was still drilling at/around the time Campos showed up?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Campos threw him off, so he went balls-out and started shooting earlier then originally planned. This may give some explanation as to why none of Paddock’s cameras were operational yet (IF there even were cameras capable of recording.)

       Bullshit. It's our collective incredulous attitude that is exposing their fabricated narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI and LVPD should be freely and willingly giving the public all the information they can. The security camera footage should be shown on the news by now. There should be more interviews by survivors. We should be told exactly what purpose the 'battery charger' in the room serves.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like the FBI/LVPD will admit to truths only one tiny bit at a time - which will drive the feelings that there's something much more sinister than a 'very wealthy old gambler who went out of his way to not exist online who used to do work for the government just snapped and shot a bunch of people.'

       Possible for sure, one of the journalists from the press conference today asked something along those lines after hearing of the timeline change for Campos. 
(Something like, would you say that the Campos encounter w Paddock made Paddock hastily jump to action instead of executing his plan fully later on?)

       Changes a lot. They previously told us that the reason it took 72 minutes to apprehend him, they weren't as concerned because Campos has foiled his shooting rampage. Which is completely false. 911 received the first call 3 minutes into the shooting. That means that for at least 9 minutes Campos nor Mandalay Bay relayed this to the police.

       I'm not saying it isn't important -- what I'm saying is that it takes several reviews of the event before a solid understanding of the actions is possible.  This is called an After Action Review.

       Shooter was waiting for FBI agents (Buyers), maybe for a possible "Bust"! Shooter gets Squirrely because of security guard. Starts shooting pre-bust. That or FBI knew about it and was waiting for other associates to show up.

       agree with what you are saying and feel it is also because it didn't go down the way it was supposed to.  Now they have to do an actual investigation to figure out what everyone knows so they can craft their story.  It's similar to what everyone is saying about they will wait a couple leaks so they can release a narrative that covers all the conspiracy theories, but I think they are fighting that couple with the fact that something went wrong and their original script doesn't work anymore.  They can't just stay silent for two weeks with all the attention this has so they have to give some details.  They probably thought the Jesus story was air tight and after they released found new evidence that they were worried would get out.  Changing your story on your own looks suspicious, but not as suspicious as it would have if they stuck with their story that was supposedly based on first hand evidence by a living hero and then the evidence came out proving them wrong.
