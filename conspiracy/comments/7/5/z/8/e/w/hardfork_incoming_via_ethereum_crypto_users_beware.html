<p>This will likely tank btc back to 4900-5100 usd-
All growth for past months cut in half within the next 48 hours</p>

<p>Hard fork on the 16th. Beware between today and the 17th. </p>

<p>Might wanna get outta this bull run by tonight. If you want to keep your profits stacked. </p>

<p>Just sayin-</p>

<p>Ltc may hit 62.00usd. This is the pull signal- I&#39;d literally pull early then get back in on the 18th for maximum insurances, (plus being able to buy back on a low). </p>

<p>KK. Thats my btc news. Happy to help @ <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users</p>

That is 14% by your math, and losing 700.00 per share over night, is certainly not a good feeling to most people... </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t think that 300.00 is a &quot;tanking / loss&quot;. You can prove this by making a donation to redcross or a charity you factually approve of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose its a matter of etiquette. There are 200+ Price prediction threads. Many of which are BTC community related. The users in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> are more welcoming. I truly value their continued commitments to getting to the bottom of many issues. 
My main focus is to self industrialize and self improve. 
I merely lack the capital. </p>

<p>I figure that the more users I remain dedicated too, the more valuable a contributor I am. This entitles me to growing via social networks, and committed individuals which often reach out and help me with whatever it is I am currently working on. </p>

<p>So aside from the controversy of just my admissions from something like this in the btc forums etc, I suppose its considerably easier to post here, in large; Then to sacrifice all my time into helping a disenchanted community, which would only begin to painstakingly attack me for my every position on the &quot;technology&quot;. </p>

<p>That and I really like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> as well as the mods here. 
Its not that I don&#39;t frequent the crypto forums to read from time to time. I just am not a dedicated member of them. Sooo ya...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I leave this advice because some users have multiple coins. A 500.00 potential loss is bad. Multiply that by say 10 or 100. Thats nuclear losses...</p>

<p>I just assess data and give an educated opinion. </p>

<p>My analyses indicated a drop. </p>

<p>So I urge others to consoder this. </p>

<p>I can say Ive steered <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> right on most losses all year.</p>

<p>I wont say this is a nuclear loss period and to abort cryptos. That isn&#39;t what I am saying at all. What I will say is the price is about to tank upto 500.00 due to ethereum. Within 120hrs tops. </p>

<p>So if this affects your portfolios significantly. Then trade into usd tether or equivelant and rebuy at the drop. </p>

<p>Thats my advice-</p>

<p>Likely will see ltc bolster to 63.00 prior to a full pull-</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its always been a scam. I.e. cant buy anything with it. 
Coindesk essentially talks in investors. Bulstering the price. Then developers cash out to &quot;build on the technology&quot;. </p>

<p>All the while the un. Refugee program also scams the network. Using baiters to talk up the coin on the trading floor. Just to rob them days later. Hence all the non / broken english people telling users to buy eth on the forum. </p>

<p>Its a scam / vampire coin designed to slow btc&#39;s growth. Case in point the usa created it as a tool to monitor and prepare the intel services for the incoming market and vadt amount of early adopters that will become millionaires off the btc model. </p>

<p>So they design eth to slow that giving then time to make important legislation on &quot;taxing users&quot;. </p>

<p>Its just a money grab on crypto holders. Eth wont be worth anything until amazon steps in. My guess is eth will try to land amazon pre btc. This effectively being a myspace vs facebook situation... </p>

<p>Eth being fb ans btc being myspace. 
We all know what happens when the nsa approved networks take control. Hence eth being nothing more then a hatteick and btc being a patsy. </p>

<p>I dont think it will kill btc either way. But if eth beats btc to amazon. People will lose millions over night-</p>

<p>Thats my thoughts really. </p>

<p>No 7.0s for awhile / few days. I am trying to push a good hit soon; but alas the sun is calm. :/</p>

<p>I have now got an ex microsoft guy. Which has accepted my projects stage 1 data creation. But I need a coupke grand (to pay them). Also one of my best data producers was &quot;warned&quot; I am a scammer. So I am factually being undermined by users attempting to call me a &quot;scammer&quot;. Because I once attempted to fast track my idea. </p>

<p>Kinda rough. I respect the users if they genuinely feel that way. But the reality is I do this all for free. It genuinely shows a significant corelation and I wish to do more but am financially unprepared for the initial project. </p>

<p>What hurts me most isnt that I am being undermined. But the fact that I am trying to create a useful system. Which in itself could be remarkably accurate. Leading to vast changes in earths natural disaster mitigation. </p>

<p>Its pretty obvious ive made a humble attempt to produce this tool. So I don&#39;t see why others are kiterally going out of their way to contact my online collaborators to scare thrm away from participating. </p>

<p>Kinda a conspiracy in itself/if ya asked me. </p>

<p>So ya. Not too much happening lately. Mainly just doing work as the world sleeps.  While preparing for some interesting updates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this has spun off topic for bitcoin lol but your theory is Astro turfed really hard in the science subs even though there is in my opinion evidence to correlate the events. I spent a day once trying to get reasonable arguments out of those subs and all they say is &quot;the science has been disproven already&quot;. </p>

<p>Well it would seem logical to me that the energy radiating from the sun has a direct impact on earth, considering our position to the sun is what makes our life possible. </p>

<p>Keep doing what you&#39;re doing. Don&#39;t worry about being labeled a scammer. </p>

<p>Also, maybe you should reach out to Tom Delonge. He just announced the other day the &quot;To the Stars Academy&quot;. This is a platform built on the ideas of promoting non mainstream and pseudo sciences. I&#39;m not sure how wholesome that program is but you can be the judge for yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually considered this. I was hoping tesla or microsoft would fund me, (Or even usgs). Hence my attempt to crowdsource. But I had to pull my campaign due to harassment from psychos. They were attempting to friend request me on facebook. Leaving scandalous comments on my campaign and bow they are going as far to urge others not to even consider helping me...?</p>

<p>I finally have the tools/ network to produce the data, and that will allow me to mark it with all event sequences from 2001- 2017; <em>(Which once marked)</em> we could begin stage 2 plans: <em>Imaging</em> (using machine learning to create plugins. (i.e. yes no answers) to be used towards a predictive algorithm). Which Is stage 3. </p>

<p>I took users advice on many oounts and have decided small steps will lead to less problems on the future. So I suppose its more so a redialing of past failures to oroduce future successes at this time. </p>

<p>Thanks for asking. Its awesone users care enough to support me on here. I just wish I could deliver more to the world. As I think its possible, I just have an extreme amount of situations holding me back from that progress at this time. </p>

I first encountered him and his delusional &quot;logic&quot; defending and pumping the most transparently obvious scamcoin I&#39;ve seen yet in crypto, &quot;EDOGE,&quot; and refusing to acknowledge the evidence. Now that coin&#39;s Reddit sub (/etherdoge) has been banned and removed, the dev got away with around 200 ETH from everyone who purchased from his own supply, while the publicly airdropped coins were locked by the smart contract, the dev lied about the unlock date twice, and now the price of EDOGE is effectively zero. It&#39;s a case study in delusional thinking, and for me it destroys this guy&#39;s credibility now and forever about any other topic.  </p>

<p>Its pretty obvious ive made a humble attempt to produce this tool. So I don&#39;t see why others are kiterally going out of their way to contact my online collaborators to scare thrm away from participating. </p>

<p>Kinda a conspiracy in itself/if ya asked me. </p>

<p>So ya. Not too much happening lately. Mainly just doing work as the world sleeps.  While preparing for some interesting updates. </p>

<p>This will likely tank btc back to 4900-5100 usd- All growth for past months cut in half within the next 48 hours</p>

<p>Current price: $5,507.39</p>

<p>How am I wrong?</p>

<p>I would really suggest finding a new way to beg for money, especially if you&#39;re trying to start a life with somebody else.  This clearly isn&#39;t working.</p>
