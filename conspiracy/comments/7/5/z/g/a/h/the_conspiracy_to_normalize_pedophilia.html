        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The rise of pedophilia and human trafficking awareness in the public eye is a refreshing development. While most consider it to be a heinous act comparable to crimes against humanity. There are those who wish to soften the perception of a sexual relationship between adult and child. This is an age old problem that has been around for centuries.. Evidence showing it has gone as far back as 1650 BC. To understand why it is such a widespread problem we must first educate ourselves in a bit of history. </p>

<p>There are many famous and well known examples of an adult marrying a significantly younger partner, sometimes as young as 10 years old. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed">Mohammed the prophet of Islam</a> is one such example.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Traditional sources dictate that Aisha was six or seven years old when betrothed to Muhammad, but the marriage was not consummated until she was nine or ten years old. While the majority of traditional sources indicate Aisha was 9 (and therefore a virgin) at the time of marriage, a small number of more recent writers have variously estimated her age at 15 to 24.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rome was also well known for its pederast societal members as well. While men were not looked down upon for premarital sex, women were expected to be virgins at marriage. So this led to a larger acceptance of adult men and young boys engaging in sexual activities in Greco Roman culture. It was less acceptable to engage in these activities for purely pleasure, and was less frowned upon when looked at as a loving relationship and friendship. It was often used in a military setting too.</p>

<p>Multiple Roman Emperors engaged in Pederasty including Hadrian, Tiberius, Caligula. Hadrian most famous for Antinous, and Tiberius for his palace of depravity where he had sex with infants and children of all sorts. He was also very bloodthirsty and tortured many people for entertainment before throwing them off a 300ft cliff. <a href="http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#43">More info on Tiberius.</a></p>

<p>I could bring up countless examples of pedophilia throughout history, but you get the idea. There are common themes that seem to transcend historical society norms with pederasty and pedophilia. There were also those willing to enable this behavior for money, political gains, and the covering up and hiding of these acts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>People with large amounts of wealth and power engaging in pedophilia.</p></li>
<li><p>Ritualistic abuse of children and rituals involving children which include, orgies, sacrifices, sex magic, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretan_pederasty">Cretan Kidnapping ritual</a>, and satanic or devil worship to name some of the many rituals done with pedophilia.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>- Pedophilia also used as political leverage and blackmail against leaders of countries.</h2>

<h1>Pedophilia in modern times</h1>

<p>Pedophilia in modern times is still as prevalent as it was in the past. With the invention of the internet like minded folks were able to connect from miles away across continents to conspire and commit these acts. There are many instances of pedophilia entrenched in modern social power structures. Here are a few examples.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Franklin Investigation</p>

<ul>
<li>This was an investigation that started as financial crimes but then soon quickly turned into investigating a wide spread US based child trafficking ring. This possibly implicated George Bush Sr and high ranking politicians in the United States along with many other wealthy prolific members of society. The abusers engaged in depraved acts of murder, rape, torture, and often made their victims have sex with dead children. One victim stated that a severed penis of a young boy was put in his mouth while adult males laughed at and raped him. Ultimately no one was charged with anything except financial crimes. This centered around Larry King and his close ties with Republican leadership. The FBI was accused of threatening witnesses and helping the cover up of this crime.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Dutroux Affair</p>

<ul>
<li>This was a serial killer who captured girls as young as 8 and held them captive in his dungeon/basement. This case was heavily criticized as the police almost seemed complicit in the acts. In conducting one search of the home two officers failed to locate two girls locked in his basement. The victims allege the police located them but left them there. The UK has had multiple scandals involving pedophilia and subsequent coverups. It is theorized it is deeply entrenched in their social hierarchy and government agencies. </li>
<li>On the witness stand, Jean-Marc Connerotte (fr), the original judge of the case, broke down in tears when he described &quot;the bullet-proof vehicles and armed guards needed to protect him against the shadowy figures determined to stop the full truth coming out. Never before in Belgium has an investigating judge at the service of the king been subjected to such pressure. We were told by police that [murder] contracts had been taken out against the magistrates.&quot; Connerotte testified that the investigation was seriously hampered by protection of suspects by people in the government. &quot;Rarely has so much energy been spent opposing an inquiry,&quot; he said. He believed that the Mafia had taken control of the case. Dutroux alleged he was part of a sex trafficking ring involving high ranking government and police officials.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Jimmy Savile</p>

<ul>
<li>A well known TV personality and TV show host was at the center  of many, many allegations of abuse. The coverup of his actions by BBC was alleged to be an open secret. Former Sex Pistols vocalist accused Jimmy of abusing children and it being public knowledge. It should come as no surprise as Jimmy was friends with Prince Charles and BBC recently was told to remove a pedophilia statue from it&#39;s building. <a href="http://www.news.com.au/world/bbc-told-to-remove-work-by-pedophile-sculptor-eric-gill/news-story/4faff31313e1d95b20e157858121d55a">source</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Jeffrey Epstein</p>

<ul>
<li>Known for &quot;Lolita Island&quot; and having many high ranking US government officials over at his island for parties. Bill Clinton is one such guest who even ditched his Secret Service detail multiple times on trips to said island. Also known for getting an extraordinarily light sentence for crimes only serving 10 months and being able to leave the country freely.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>There are many, more cases than what I have outlined and I implore you to research, explore, and spread awareness of these documented cases.</p>

<h1>The Effort To Normalize Pedophilia.</h1>

<p>Pedophilia has been labeled as a mental disorder. Those wishing to normalize such behavior in society argue that it is how they were born and are unable to change. A terrible argument that would excuse serial killers for having a disorder of wanting to murder others. However, the efforts are out there if you look around. I believe pedophiles are pushing the transgender issue as a way of riding the coattails of a legitimate cause and trying to legitimize itself by proxy. This indefensible act is a conscious effort to harm a child and that is the cold hard fact of the matter. It is a conscious decision no matter how they try to wrap it up in psychological excuses for their actions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/world/europe/greek-disability-groups-angered-by-new-categories.html">Greece labels Pedophilia as disability</a></p>

<p>I believe the effort to brand children as transgender is mostly inorganic and is social engineering to lead to a society where a child can make decisions independent of their parents wishes.
It starts with slowly seeding the idea into peoples heads by placing their propaganda in high visibility and recognized parental advice resources. There is a large amount of appealing to emotion and lack of studies that show what happens when children go through such changes such as sex reassignment. It is nothing more than cosmetic surgery but parents are being compelled into believing it is something beneficial for the child. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.parents.com/parenting/my-transgender-child-this-is-how-i-know/">http://www.parents.com/parenting/my-transgender-child-this-is-how-i-know/</a></p>

<p>Here is some examples of parents allowing extremely young children to undergo hormone therapy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/transgender-kids/jacob-s-journey-life-transgender-5-year-old-n345131">https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/transgender-kids/jacob-s-journey-life-transgender-5-year-old-n345131</a></p>

<p><a href="http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/04/california-family-discusses-4-year-old-transgender-child/">http://dailycaller.com/2015/07/04/california-family-discusses-4-year-old-transgender-child/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/03/health/trans-youth-texas-bathroom-bill/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/03/health/trans-youth-texas-bathroom-bill/index.html</a></p>

<p>There are large efforts underway to label children as young as 4 years old as transgender</p>

<p><a href="https://www.naturalnews.com/2017-08-12-transgender-summer-camp-now-enrolling-toddlers-as-young-as-four-years-old.html">https://www.naturalnews.com/2017-08-12-transgender-summer-camp-now-enrolling-toddlers-as-young-as-four-years-old.html</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.scarymommy.com/parents-of-5-year-old-transgender-girl-share-their-story/">http://www.scarymommy.com/parents-of-5-year-old-transgender-girl-share-their-story/</a></p>

<p>There are many stories similar to these. The common theme is that a <em>four</em> year old has the ability to decide if it can change its sex or not. Even though many trans-activists, pediatricians, and child psychologists consider this way too young, it is still being pushed. </p>

<p>I believe the end game is to have this question being asked on a large public scale &quot;Well a child can choose its sex, why can&#39;t it choose to have sex as well?&quot;</p>

<p>Sweden also legally acknowledged a child marriage from refugee&#39;s of muslim countries. Before they were introducing legislation to combat this same problem. <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20120524/41012">source</a> However, the agenda most be rolled out it seems as they are now backtracking on law passed in May of 2004 that outlawed any marriage under the age of 18. <a href="http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;amp;artikel=6096214">source</a> They have admitted it was &quot;a mistake&quot; but that does not excuse officials condoning this and having a special set of rules for refugee&#39;s entering their country as citizens. Had this not been in the media I believe it would of continued to set a precedent and push for younger and younger children making legal adult decisions. Europe seems to be a social engineering experiment as much as the United States and it is sickening they are trying to force this old archaic practice on modern society. It is done purposefully in my opinion.</p>

<p>I cannot see a purpose for pushing such an agenda except to weaken the family foundations and slowly creep in the public perception that a child knows best for itself rather than an experienced adult who has been down that road before. To open a path to separate children from parents by brainwashing the whole family unit to think this is acceptable for prepubescent children to undergo hormone therapy and cosmetic surgery! <strong>-More input needed WIP</strong></p>

<p>I am open to criticisms and ideas from anyone. If you made it through this disorganized mess of a post you have my thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve actually seen interviews where they were talking to a person who &quot;identifies as someone attracted to young people&quot; or something very close verbiage. It was a way to destigmatize the fact he was sexually attracted to people who are prepubescent.  He needs help, and instead, they&#39;re trying to legitimize him and act like he&#39;s discriminated against.  Guess I&#39;m a bigot by that standard...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Due to legal loopholes, more than 200,000 children married in the United States over the last 15 years, mostly girls married to adult men. Girls as young as 10 were among the minors who wedded under legal loopholes. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A bit older article from early 2017: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We learned that in 38 [US] states, between 2000 and 2010, more than 167,000 children — almost all of them girls, some as young 12 — were married during that period, mostly to men 18 or older.</p>

<p>Many of the children married [in the United States] between 2000 and 2010 were wed to adults significantly older than they were, the data shows. At least 31 percent were married to a spouse age 21 or older. (The actual number is probably higher, as some states did not provide spousal ages.) </p>

<p>Many of the states that provided data included categories such as “14 and younger,” without specifying exactly how much younger some brides and grooms were. Thus, the 12-year-olds we found in Alaska, Louisiana and South Carolina’s data might not have been the youngest children wed in America between 2000 and 2010.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That part is hard to say. There wasn&#39;t really an age where this happened, it was more about who you were and what you did. Anything under 17 was a non adult at any rate, but from 17 onwards it was largely about if you had completed military service, gotten married, etc. If a man was a NEET equivalent he would be seen as a young man for much longer than someone who served.</p>

<p>Sex itself wasn&#39;t always what we think either. Often the young man would cross his legs and his thighs were used.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also very important that &#39;receivers&#39; were looked down on as lesser men. You couldn&#39;t expect to become much of anything if you were used in that way so most were involuntarily used. </p>

My surgery was covered, thankfully, but I wish I had I put a lot sooner, even if it affected my development. These kids won’t have the luxury of having it done later for free.

<p>I think you are overestimating the “damage done” and also you’re wrong to assume that transitioning is damaging — it’s literally a cure for many people. What’s your horse in this race anyway? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What 5 year old knows what gender reassignment is? What 5 year old knows what surgery is without being hurt and experiencing it or being told? My point is, how can a child know it is in the wrong gender when they haven&#39;t even experienced it? </p>

<p>As a 10 year old I believed it was my right to smoke cigs, but obviously it&#39;s stupid and a bad idea. It&#39;s why we let people grow up before they make those kind of decisions. These kids are learning about &quot;trans&quot; and &quot;gender&quot; because it is pushed onto them. Otherwise they would just be a boy who likes barbies or a tom girl or whatever label you want to slap on it. </p>

<p>They have no idea how the other gender is either so how can they know? Unless they are being told what a &quot;girl&quot; should be and what a &quot;boy&quot; should be. It is extremely sexist. There&#39;s nothing wrong with being either so why are we having surgery to change that? Because people say so and are planting these idea&#39;s in kids heads. To clarify I&#39;m talking about 4-5 year olds here. That&#39;s what this post is about. Doing it early to save trouble down the road is an idea planted into their head! A child has no idea about any of this stuff. They are not even able to read at that age in most cases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really depends on the age. I am pretty sure that most 14-15 year olds (that have sex with each other) understand consent and if you don&#39;t teach them that they should always use protection they will just end up with STDs or pregnant. </p>

<p>I know that I was looking at dirty magazines at the age of 12-13 and in the day and age of the internet this must happen much earlier now. If you don&#39;t teach them at school they will learn it &quot;in the street&quot; because parents are often too scared to talk to their kids about sex.</p>

<p>For 10 year olds it is a different topic but they should definitely learn what sex/pregnancy is. Teaching them how to use a condom is bullshit though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that understanding consent below the age thereof would preclude one from believing he/she can consent.  If we are not teaching children to abstain until adulthood (preferably marriage, but that&#39;s another topic), then we are not truly teaching them the meaning of consent.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I understand your point.  It would be unfair not to arm young adults, or those on the cusp of adulthood, with the knowledge of preventative measures re: the risks of engaging in intercourse.  Even if they shouldn&#39;t need this knowledge, it may keep a bad decision from becoming an even worse one, such as abortion.</p>

<p>Still, I disagree with your assessment that 10 year olds necessarily need to know what sex is.  A 10 year old who is old enough to ask should be taught by parents in privacy, not by schools in public (in the company of classmates).  Unfortunately, we often encounter the problem of curious children receiving no guidance from either source.  What to do..?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In Islam, a woman has to have reached reproductive maturity to get married—she has to have had a menstrual period. Furthermore, she has to be able mentally and emotionally mature enough to <em>want</em> to marry the man who proposed marriage to her, and her consent is required. The marriage is conducted in front of witnesses, and a contract is signed stipulating the agreed upon conditions of the marriage.</p>

<p>Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, is the narrator of many ahadith (saying attributed to the Prophet Muhammad, upon whom there is peace), and she was married to him until he passed away. She spoke highly of her husband and his moral character. </p>

<p>You are speaking about something of which you have no knowledge.</p>

<p>Having sexual relations with/raping a prepubescent child is not the same as proposing marriage to postpubescent woman and living a happily married life with her until your death. The age of Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, is mere speculation, but she must have reached puberty before she was able to consent to marriage.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it was customary for women in pre-Islamic and post-Islamic Arabia (as well as other parts of the world!) to get married shortly after reaching puberty at that time. The idea that one becomes an adult capable of consent at 18 years old is a modern day practice. Men and women reach puberty at different ages; our biology clearly indicates when we, as individuals, have reached reproductive maturity, regardless of what generalized man-made laws dictate.</p>

<p>There are people preying on infants, toddlers and young, prepubescent children, and there are also people desiring sexual relationships with teenaged pubescents. These people are following their own depraved lusts and desires. Do not conflate this kind of sexual deviance with consenting, devoutly religious postpubescents publicly getting married and living as husband and wife. They are not the same.</p>

<p>There are rules to marriage in Islam, and we believe in Heaven and Hell! How can you believe that a Prophet of God would do anything immoral? How can anyone think that a person who rapes a prepubescent child would somehow rewarded with eternal Paradise in the Hereafter? In Islam, sex outside of marriage is considered a major sin, and marriage can only occur between consenting prepubescent men and women. Our religion is about self-control, resisting worldly desires and refraining from evil, harmful acts. People regurgitate this claim against the Prophet Muhammad, upon whom there is peace, over and over again, so lightly. Do you understand the gravity of what you are claiming?</p>

<p>At the time that the Prophet Muhammad, upon whom there is peace, was speaking about monotheism to the polytheistic pagans he lived amongst, they called him a madman and a sorcerer. Those who did not wish to worship a single Deity called him names and accused him of many things. They criticized everything about him that they did not accept. They did not, however, say anything about his marriages...because his marriages were not anything atypical in their society. Had it been an unprecedented act or something totally new to them...they surely would have tried to defame him because of it, but because it was totally normal. nothing was said about it. The historical context is critical when discussing this matter.</p>

<p>Although we should take what we find on Wikipedia with a grain of salt, this is what it says about the history of &quot;child marriages&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage#History">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage#History</a></p>

<p>&quot;Historically, child marriage was common around the world, the average life expectancy did not exceed 50 years old so it was seen as a better way to reproduce through child marriage. The practice began to be questioned in the 20th century, with the age of individuals&#39; first marriage increasing in many countries and most countries increasing the minimum marriage age</p>

<p>&quot;In ancient and medieval societies, it was common for girls to be betrothed at or even before puberty. As Friedman claims, &#39;arranging and contracting the marriage of a young girl were the undisputed prerogatives of her father in ancient Israel.&#39; Most girls were married before the age of 15, often at the start of their puberty. In the Middle Ages the age at marriage seems to have been around puberty throughout the Jewish world.</p>

<p>&quot;Ruth Lamdan writes: &#39;The numerous references to child marriage in the 16th- century Responsa literature and other sources, shows that child marriage was so common, it was virtually the norm. In this context, it is important to remember that in halakha, the term &quot;minor&quot; refers to a girl under twelve years and a day. A girl aged twelve and a half was already considered an adult in all respects.&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;In Ancient Greece, early marriage and motherhood for girls was encouraged. Even boys were expected to marry in their teens. Early marriages and teenage motherhood was typical. In Ancient Rome, girls married above the age of 12 and boys above 14. In the Middle Ages, under English civil laws that were derived from Roman laws, marriages before the age of 16 were common. In Imperial China, child marriage was the norm.&quot;</p>

<p>It is not right of you to act like a postpubescent 12 year old woman, who is biologically capable of giving birth, consenting to/agreeing to/wanting to have a public marriage is the same thing as a prepubescent child getting raped or sexually abused by a depraved individual in secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not your bro; I am a Muslim woman. I converted to Islam after a decade of Agnosticism.</p>

<p>You said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Did you know before jihad they are granted a request that cannot be denied and will not tarnish their reputation.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? What is your source? </p>

<p>First of all &quot;jihad&quot; means &quot;struggle&quot;. Jihad can mean defending yourself against an invading army who seeks to kill you because of your religion, but it is also used to describe the struggle we have against our own desires. We are fighting jihad against sinning.  You are saying that before defending yourself against an invading army, a Muslim can, like, put in a request to someone to do something—anything—and no one can stop them or look down on them for it and, apparently, it won&#39;t be considered a sin in the eye of God? Guess again. </p>

<p>No matter what the circumstances are, having a sexual relationship with a person of the opposite sex outside of marriage to them is a sin, and having a same-sex relationship is also a sin! You are combining these things together and saying that a Muslim, before engaging in defensive warfare, can have sex outside of marriage to a child of the same gender as them??? What??? This is patently false! If they do this and do not repent, when they die, they will be punished with eternal Hellfire! THAT is what Muslim actually believe.</p>

<p>You did say something, however, that is somewhat accurate. People with wealth and power do often abuse it, and in some cultures it is even more overlooked than others. Culture, however, is not religion. </p>

<p>There are indeed people claiming to be Muslims who ignore the rules of our religion and instead violate those rules, either as a result of cultural traditions or their own lusts and worldly desires. For example, in some countries, people who claim they are Muslims are marrying their children off in arranged marriages. In Islam, it is forbidden to arrange a marriage. A man and woman have to decide, suing their own freewill, if they want to get married or not. A woman&#39;s father, for example, cannot force her to marry a man she does not want to marry. Culture ≠ religion! </p>

<p>The Qur&#39;an is full of specific laws/rules/regulations. Do not make assumptions about Islam based on the wrongdoings of ignorant , fallible human beings who claim to be following it, but are in fact ignoring it in favor of their own preferences, desires, ideas and culture.</p>

<p>Those conspiring to mislead people away from understanding and accepting Islam have been largely successful in their deception; most people have been effectively indoctrinated to dismiss Islam outright without any independent research of their own. Many people who claim to question the mainstream narrative have so easily accepted the mainstream propaganda that casts Islam in a negative light, portraying it as the source of the world&#39;s problems, when in fact the opposite is true.

    <div class="md"><p>Forsure man. I see it in movies and TV-shows all the time. Referencing kids in sexual ways legit happens in so many goddamn movies. Since pedogate I have probably closed out of like 5 TV shows just cause they keep sexualizing the kids roles.

<p>Fucked up. Here&#39;s my conspiracy about it; If you are abused you are predisposed to be an abuser later in life. (data supports that) We are in the feed back loop of so many abusive societies. We gotta point it out, and correct it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, this agenda has been pushed for as long as I can remember.  The sexualization of children is beyond acceptable in movies and tv now.  It is truly disgusting.  </p>

<p>For another historical example, read Plato&#39;s &quot;Symposium&quot;.  Older men of wealth would take on younger men for sexual purposes.  It was believed to be the best sex.  </p>

<p>The question is, do we have a chance?  Up until a decade ago the idea of gay marriage wasn&#39;t even idea among the mainstream.  I&#39;m not equating the two, but the way gay marriage was pushed on us and the fact that you are no somehow a bigot if you are against it when every American had accepted the fact since the inception of our country is a strategy that the pedo&#39;s are following too.  Ask yourself why in early 90&#39;s virtually every sitcom had to have a likable, funny, gay character.  How long until there&#39;s pedo character that has the laugh track booming?</p>

<p>Why as a grown man should I care about any of this?</p>

<p>If they literally made child fucking legal tomorrow it wouldn’t effect me unless I have a kid and I don’t really plan on having one </p>

<p>If all the weirdos started walking around with kids on as sex slaves I still have to go to work </p>

<p>I don’t really like kids, and despise younger adults competing in the job market- so let them all become transgender hormone raped fucks- easier for me to get a job since they will all be killing then selves from depression </p>

<p>None of these anti pedo crusaders are going to do shit for ME- for the shit in MY LIFE for hard crap I have to deal with, but I have to listen to how I am supposed to care about kids I don’t know getting fucked by people I don’t over bullshit I don’t care about </p>

<p>Why don’t all you fucks put some effort into helping grown ass adult men who are tired of the bullshit in our lives instead of this conspiracy shit</p>

<p>Fuck the children, I don’t give a shit </p>
