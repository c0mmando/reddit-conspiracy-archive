       I'm sure she wishes she didn't take the hush money,  but none of us are in a position to judge her, there are lots of factors that we don't know about.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy to say she should have named names back then, but there were most likely examples pointed out to her of people who didn't take the hush money before her, and failed.

       Cory Fieldman talked a lot about this. Say what you will about the guy who put forth the allegations they did not deny big gay parties and the truth is likely somewhere in the middle but this was eye opening :

       nobody cared because corey feldman was a male. now that a female is speakign out and being "strong" everyone is onboard. its fucked up. people treat women like a fucking delicate flower and men like shit. either way this whole thing is fucked up but there have been countless others before her and everyone chose not to listen.

       You're kidding right??... For the most part, women are definitely not treated like a delicate flower... look at how the women who accused Bill Cosby have been treated in the media. Dismissed, called liars and money hungry, ripped apart by the media and society... Look at how the women that accused Bill Clinton were treated, or the woman that accused Kobe Bryant. The list goes on.. We live in a society where victim blaming happens constantly whether you want to accept that or not. Timing is everything and yes, right now women are being supported for coming out but you're a fucking fool if you actually believe women are always treated like "a delicate flower" Are you upset they're being heralded for their bravery????
      </p>
      <p>
       It's horrible the way that Feldman was ignored but I think that's probably for a few reasons. 1) studies prove that people find it harder to believe that males can be victims of sexual assault 2) he didn't drop actual names, only mild references to who he was talking about and it's clearly some big wigs in Hollywood. The women coming out right now have specifically named Weinstein... huge difference. 3) If Hollywood owns the media, did you actually expect them to welcome his accusations with open arms and show that he's a victim? And 4) there are SOOOO many people coming out against Weinstein right now that they can't deny it or bury this story and Feldman was the only one to make statements about what he endured.
      </p>
      <p>
       Praising women for finally coming out against their abuser doesn't equate to some kind of special treatment nor does it have any relevance to how Feldman was treated so get your mind right before you say dumb shit like that

       not upset that they are finally speaking out. upset that the issue has come up time and time before by men in the industry suddenly its a fuckin blaze because women are now speaking out. so buidl a bridge for yourself there. i know the fucking details. women get dealt a whole different card for the same shit men go through. so pull YOUR head out of your ass and realize this isnt the first time this shit has come up. most of my hate stems from abuse of my own growing up. tellign people and no one doing a god damn thing to help me. so you sir , lady can rightfully fuck off. women get the fuckign red carpet when it coems to speaking out. remeber #bringourgirlshome ? yeah the terrorist group that kidnapped them finally made a name for themselves when they kidnapped these girls but they had been previously killing boys at schools in hope for the same treatment. not until they took the girls that it became a world wide wide issue. women get a pussy pass all the time every time.  so yeah fuck off. =)

       can you list some of these men?  Other than Feldman.  I think op did a good job of explaining why feldman didn't get much traction, although i wish he would have.

       People cared when Corey Feldman spoke about this.   It has taken many people to set us on the course where this can be blown apart and discussed openly.

       McGowen just happens to be at the right place and the right time in this longstanding gunpowder timeline to light the fuse.

       Nobody cared for years about either Corey Feldman or Rose McGowan. If people in Hollywood really care now, they'll speak up about other abusers who are currently hiding in plain site.

       I’ve been in love with Rose since the start of her career.

       I’m glad to see her calling these people out for the filth they are.

       Sadly, Rose is now a radicalized feminist and has posted many, many times how men are trash and 2nd class citizens.

       no, just because she was "victimized" still doesnt give her that right. lots of peopel have been victimized and now because women ar standing out suddenly its a big issue. tmen have come forward as child victim and nobody batted an eye lash.

       I didn't say she had 'a right'. What I'm saying is that people often act irrationally after being victimized. Just have some compassion. Imagine being raped by that disgusting beast Weinstein and then consider how that might leave you not so balanced in your views after that.

       I can only be so supportive when she is asking for my support while periodically insulting me with radical generalizations about men. We are not all responsible for HW's actions. We are not all rapists.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone has been victimized at one time or another. I don't believe anyone gets a free ride. I've had another man try and rape me and had to fight him off. I've been sexually harassed by managers and supervisors at work. I've been sexually assaulted by a co-worker who then went on to stalk and harass me. None of those events have caused me to hate anyone else. I'm not a victim. I'm not a survivor. I'm just a human being and shit happens.

       The dude has basically publicly admitted all this, and he paid a settlement to McGowan to shut her up, because that was the only avenue of justice available to her. And yet, you still got to come in here and blame the victim!
      </p>
      <p>
       See, everything that happened to her demonstrates that a culture exists that uses politics, the media, and officers of the court to protect rich and powerful people like admitted "problem"-having Weinstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what you should really be concerned about rather than the physical evidence supporting McGowan's story. With like the vast majority of rape, there is none, because many rape victims need time, sometimes significant amounts of it, to actually process their violation(s).

       She's actually pretty cool. She was never on my radar as an actor either, but I got to hang out with her a few times and she was a nice, caring, and intelligent person.

       Totally into the message.  But I can see her starting to teeter a little into radicalized feminism and she's going to start losing people by being overly offputting and aggressive.  Now males saying they are with her aren't enough and she's effectively shitting on any man who is not currently DOING something.  I just fear she's going to start coming off as kooky and the message is going to get lost.  At least from her perspective.  Pandora's box is already opened.

       It was funny when everyone freaked out about her being banned when she fucking doxxed someone. Those same people were the people applauding twitter for banning Milo and Sargon. It was hard to not laugh at the situation, all of a sudden they don't like it when it happens to them.

       That's what I've been trying to tell people on reddit. Yea you're fine with them silencing the_donald, but wait until the admins start silencing shit you like. All of a sudden it won't be so wonderful - but you set the standard by allowing them to do it to them first.

       no, she's shitting on all of his friends who knew about it and went along, or worse, conspired in the coverup. Good on her. At this point, if you knew the dude and worked with him, you should be publicly distancing yourself

       No, I agree, she should out the people who helped brush it under the rug.  His business associates and people who allegedly called newspaper editors to spike exposes.  I'm talking about men with no connection to Harvey or with no knowledge, people like Ryan Gossling, who come out and make a statement in support of all this, and Rose dismisses it as "crap" because merely making a statement is not enough for her now that she has all this traction.  That kind of behavior, spitting in the face of people who are on your side, is going to put people off.

Entire industry is getting burned to the ground.  Just waiting for the Kirk Douglas rape rumors to resurface with a vengeance now.

        While I respect her speaking out, I'm unsure about the way in which she's approaching this. It's like she has a list of names that she strikes through one per day. Burning down as many people as she can.. (I'm not saying I don't believe they deserve it).
She dated a staunch luceferian, vocally supported Obama throughout his term and she is known for her involvement in paganism and the occult.
That isn't to say that I doubt any of her claims. I just want to point out who the individual making these claims actually is, and that perhaps the reasons for her actions aren't as apparent as they may seem. Looking for a hero to be a role model? Edward Snowden acted selflessly.. Rose Mcgowen acts to serve Rose Mcgowen's own interest.

       Since Rose McGowan took the $100k and kept her mouth shut, is she any better than anyone else who did not come forward?  By her accepting the $100k payoff and her continued public silence after her rape, how much does that make her an accessory to the further sexual predator behavior of Weinstein that could have been prevented if she spoke up?  I say she is right to call BA out on the hypocrisy of his Weinstein statement, but she is just as guilty as the rest of Hollywood for what happened to every woman after her.
