    <div class="md"><p>Buying semi automatic guns at market value in bulk and then selling them on the black market makes no sense for the seller or the buyer.</p>

<p>Why would a buyer want to procure 40 semi auto guns he could get himself with very little resistance from Craig&#39;s list?</p>

<p>Why would a seller risk such a potentially bad sale by procuring 40 weapons over the course of a year for what has to be next to no profit seeing as how they aren&#39;t fully auto?  Plus they&#39;re all registered to the seller?  If anything was to be used illicitly they would come straight back to him.  </p>

<p>Gun runner only makes sense if you believe Paddock was a complete imbecile.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s how arms deals are happening.</p>

<p>Let me slow things down for you.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>buying guns at retail that you turn around and sell for at or close to the same price because they aren&#39;t  fully auto and everyone has direct access to isn&#39;t going to net a seller any money so why risk it?</p></li>
<li><p>every gun he buys at the local gun store will return to him should they be used in any crime so why risk some nefarious drug deal in a hotel room with guns that can all be traced back to only the buyer?</p></li>
<li><p>all of the weapons he would be selling CAN be purchased one by one through private sellers online or otherwise so why would a buyer need a middle man to purchase 40 or so legal firearms?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so I know nothing about buying weapons, I just spent the last hour or so looking through web forums and articles online and this is what I&#39;ve found...</p>

<p>An authorized dealer will sell you a full auto Colt AR15 if you&#39;re licensed to buy one for around $17k on average.  </p>

<p>If you look on &quot;other&quot; websites the information I&#39;ve found says the cost of full auto Colt AR15 is around $5k.  </p>

<p>This lower cost holds true to semi auto variants as well.  A $1500 semi auto AR would cost less than $1000 on the &quot;Black Market&quot;</p>

<p>So explain to me how Paddock was some successful arms dealer buying market value AR&#39;s and selling them on the black market?</p>

<p>The whole premise makes no sense to me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I&#39;d like to know how this guy came into all of that wealth if he hasn&#39;t worked for 20 years. They say he &quot;made his $2,000,000 fortune in real estate&quot;... yet he gambled up to $800,000 - $1,000,000 per day? Really?</p>

<p>Sounds like an insanely lucky guy if he can gamble away 50% of his fortune every day. </p>

<p>Or he was playing with other people&#39;s money/laundering through the casinos in exchange for personal comps. </p>

<p>Gun running and/or drug running, given his numerous properties and his plane, seem to be a distinct possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The incident list from the LVPD, that night, starts with an officer down at the Mandalay Bay. Then, other gunmen are reported at a variety of casinos at that end of the Strip, where three separate SWAT responses deploy.</p>

<p>If anything, this all sounds like a distraction from a robbery happening at the other end of the Strip. But, casinos hide suicides, murders, rapes, etc. on a daily basis. </p>

<p>If a grocery store won&#39;t admit to being robbed on Xmas, then a casino isn&#39;t going to admit it was robbed, either.</p>

<p>But, at this stage, it seems that there are some ties to the intelligence community where planes involved may have some cartel ties. Since we know CIA planes have crashed with tons of El Chapo&#39;s cocaine, and MARSOC has been sent to kill Zetas, it seems the Sinaloa cartel is operated by the intelligence community.</p>

<p>With these connections, the evidence kind of goes everywhere. Was he a patsy? Was it a false flag? Was it a sacrifice in disguise? Was it the metal detector scam all along? Good questions.</p>

<p>Still, I think it is a perfect set up for a casino robbery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dont bother actually giving reasonable, logical responses. These people actually think isis would buy legal, traceable guns (without the supposed rfid chips) in Las fucking Vegas of all places. Why wouldn&#39;t they just buy some guns without serial numbers off a crate in a port city like LA, or NY. Or go to Mexico and fly them over in a private plane?</p>

<p>Instead they decide to buy guns in LV and decide hey let&#39;s shoot up that concert below us and shoot up the dealer as a cover. </p>

<p>Haha. Give me a fucking break</p>
