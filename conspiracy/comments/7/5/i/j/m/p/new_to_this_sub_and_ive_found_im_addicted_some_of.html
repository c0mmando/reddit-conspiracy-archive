    <div class="md"><p>In the vein of educating yourself a little more let me offer you a tip, which I hope you accept gracefully. In none of the languages which use the Latin script, including English, is an apostrophe (&#39;) used in expressing the plural form of any noun or pronoun.  In your specific instance the plural form of conspiracy is conspiracies, not conspiracy&#39;s. Please don&#39;t be offended that I offer this to you.</p>

I just use Truth to pass the cognitive dissonance centers and jump start people&#39;s common sense: another path to Critical Thinking.</p>

<p>&quot;I am in a cult where we brainwash people to think for themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>Your approach has much more finesse and patience which I guess I will learn in time! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know what&#39;s ironic is that social justice warriors flip out on grammatical purists yet social just warriors demand such grammatically (politcally correct) terms like &quot;person of colour&quot;, as opposed to the equally grammatically correct &quot;coloured person&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>My degree is in Social Anthropology with an emphasis on linguistics.  In a nutshell, it matters how we speak, our word selection, our phrasing, our diction and even our enthusiasm over or interest in what is being communicated, and this affects not only how others perceive &amp; evaluate us but it also affects how we perceive the world around us.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldn&#39;t agree more. As in 1984, limiting our vocabulary, expressions, and thoughts is detrimental to the establishment of totalitarianism. Few can see it coming. Scoffers call us grammar Nazis; meanwhile, they continue to embrace the very enslavement they think they are opposing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the post. I really enjoyed it. I&#39;m one of those conspiracy theorists who go way back to the early revelations about 9/11. It has been a tough decade and more, but people like you are suddenly making it all worthwhile. Thank you. </p>

<p>If you really want to get into an interesting line of inquiry, check out the drug war. The entire thing is a big government conspiracy to control minorities, etc. It is incredibly corrupt. A good source to start that investigation is the website fromthewilderness now found at <a href="http://www.copvcia.com">http://www.copvcia.com</a> </p>

<p>Have fun :-)</p>

Many events regarding countries with “evil dictators” were all because the country or leader of that country decided they didn’t want to sell their oil in USD anymore. They are swiftly taken down and the media paints a picture of a tyrannical government, whether there is any truth to it or not.</p>

<p>Some words of guidance for you.  This rabbit hole can be lead to some very dark and frightening places sometimes.  It can be enlightening, but also paralysing in ways.</p>

<p>The truth shall set you free, but first it will piss you off.</p>

<p>Go easy, find a comfortable pace, and remember to also &#39;not&#39; think about this stuff at times.</p>

<p>Balance is important in all aspects of life.  Its this duality that creates the momentum for change which is the fuel of our universe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This 100%. I saw UFO&#39;s in 2003. Changed my life forever. I spent years clocking in on my computer doing the hard research. Filtering through hours and hours of testimony, video, pictures, scientific leaks, documents from the CIA, FBI, NSA, DOD, DHS and Military. I petitioned Freedom of Information Act clauses. Then in 2015 the election came up and I dove in head first into the DNC and Clinton conspiracies. Pizzagate, the Elite, the powers that be, all the wars we&#39;ve ever fought and how they are all bullshit for elitists, how insanely corrupt our government is and how they are lying to us and making us dumber. The pedophilia rings in Hollywood. The sex trafficking among the wealthy. 
Look man at the end of the day..... There is NOTHING we can do about any of this. 99.9% of the public either don&#39;t know, or don&#39;t want to know anything about this stuff. So my best advice is just to not even go down the rabbit hole. Nothing good will come of it but anger, and depression. The truth is painful to know. I suppose that&#39;s why we are kept in the dark. </p>

<p>I feel people should explore the hidden truths, but in a way that is balanced and healthy for your mind and soul. Which is different for everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respectfully disagree, speaking as someone who had his ass kicked by the anxiety alone.</p>

<p>It was terrible but it has paid off greatly and I am generally not concerned about a whole range of trivial things in life that I used to be anxious about. Not even the implications of every conspiracy theory laid out in this sub and elsewhere.</p>

<p>I wish I had a textbook answer to how to cope with these things, that be for anyone that&#39;s currently diving into the rabbit hole, but I realise it may be very individual.</p>

<p>For me it&#39;s all about the bigger picture of what may be happening (more of a personal assessment that is), and having consciously trained myself to accept everything, even death itself, as I don&#39;t think it ends with death at all, which used to be alot more concerning. That feeling of urgency in having to figure it all out is not there anymore. That wasn&#39;t incredibly healhty to begin with.</p>

<p>Had I given up midway, I think I&#39;d be worse off nowadays.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAb98GbYEKY">Benghazi was caused by a video</a></p>

<p>The admin story was that it was a random attack on our compound by a group that was mad about an anti-Islam video. That was Sept 12, 2012 and Obama had Susan Rice run around to every news outlet to say that the attack was a spontaneous group that was mad at America because of some video they saw. Nothing to do with terrorism.</p>

<p>We knew that was a lie from the fact that this happened on 9/11. And we knew it was a cover up. And we eventually knew the whole thing was much bigger conspiracy to hide what really happened that day. </p>

<p>Alan Green discovers connections between Shakepeare&#39;s Sonnets and the Egyptian Pyramids:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaW6Jx_V7Jo">Part 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTlXOqriwwc">Part 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHiad18ZwcY">Part 3</a> (Not really part 3, but I recommend watching this one last due to the payoff)</li>
</ul>

<p>Excellent follow up concerning the builders of the Pyramids and other sites (<em>hint, hint</em>):

<p>I&#39;ve compiled a <a href="https://voat.co/v/911/2103536">list of 9/11 facts,</a> if you&#39;re interested.</p>

<hr/>

<p>This next stuff is common knowledge here, but it gets depressing when you&#39;re looking into it for days on end...

    <div class="md"><p>Here are some line items
-We never went to the moon. Research, NASA official video of astronauts faking earth view out window on their supposed way to the moon. NASA has lost all telemetry data for their trips to the moon. We haven&#39;t been back, and nobody else has either. We can&#39;t get through Van Allen radiation belts.
-Jewish bankers run the banks, most media companies...i.e., movies, music, newspaper and new media companies.  Research how many companies run the majority of all media.  Also research the supposed anti Semitic doc THE Protocols of the Learned  Elders of Zion.,,everything in this so called fake doc has either happened or is currently happening.
-Most upper level members of this conspiracy are Satanists, that are into pedophilia and child sacrifice. 
-As someone else stated, all wars are bankers wars..they fund  both sides so it&#39;s a win win for them, as well as it helps cull the heard.
-The war on drugs is a hoax...Watch the YouTube video Clinton Cronicals that documents how they smuggled cocaine into  Arkansas when Clinton was Governor, before he became president.
-911 was most definitely an inside job to promote never ending preemptive war...and as you&#39;ve seen we&#39;ve been in nonstop war since the false flag we call 911.
-Pretty much all actors/actresses and musicians have to sell their soul to become famous...There is a reason why you see the same people doing all the big shows and events...i.e., Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Madonna, Drake, Lil Wayne, Mylie Cyrus, Katy Perry..etc etc...these def are not the most talented entertainers...they&#39;ve sold their soul to the Devil for fame and fortune.
-MKUltra is a real thing, and it&#39;s still being implemented today.
This should give you some good starting points to research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get carried away. A lot of this shit is fake, fake news, and skewed. A lot of us get carried away with the circle jerk.</p>

<p>Make sure you read closely, check citations, check who your reading, ask questions, even post a follow up thread to get other users thoughts on the subject.</p>

<p>I have gotten hours and hours deep into conspiracies to find out they were total bull shit. I&#39;ve gotten heart attack excited about some titles then come to find out in the comment section OP was full of shit. </p>

<p>Wade in slowly, try not to get caught up in the circle jerk. We&#39;re deep thinkers, not conspiracy band wagoners.</p>
