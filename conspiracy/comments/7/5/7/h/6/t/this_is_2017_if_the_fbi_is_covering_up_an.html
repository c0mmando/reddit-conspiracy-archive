       — what’s to say they didn’t either record cover up footage (of just Paddock taking bags up alone, possible during some other trip or stay) or will release doctored footage?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       I’m not usually a hard-line conspiracy theorist, but the brilliant aspect of this situation (from the FBI’s view [or whoever actually perpetrated this]) is that as long as they are working with the hotel (legally requiring, bribing, threatening, etc.) they can control what footage actually comes to light.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the level of technology available today, how can we truly trust the footage? The local police didn’t even get 24 hours with it, tell me how any even
       <em>
        somewhat
       </em>
       neutral party would verify this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually believe many news organizations, although a little politically skewed, would try hard to get to the truth in a case like this. But
       <em>
        this * situation, the location, motive (or lack there of), and lack of background evidence (and the fact that he’s white is even better — no racial angle) makes this event is so clouded in mystery, one could say it was almost *planned
       </em>
       that way.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       That was my main point, now I’m just theorizing (thinking aloud hoping for feedback), so stop reading if you’d like.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Think of it. A place
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       public it’s obvious no one would notice — because no one cares.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think large arms deals don’t happen in Las Vegas? It’s the Macau of America. Hookers and strippers are the norm, so most people are so desentized they just don’t care. You see people coked out slugging back to the hotel at dawn; groups of Native Americans in suits, stoic as they enter a brothel in the evening; high as hell sleep deprived cross country drivers in the IHOP at night (me last year). So many people come in and out, do so many different things, sometimes extreme in their own respects, who has time to care?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, anywhere from one person to a group of guys go up the elevators with bags, a group of moderately dressed Middle Eastern (or even European, American, Asian — any one could be buying weapons for any reason, even as a service for a terrorist organization) gentlemen go up an hour later, deal goes bad, shootout ensues, continues on the ground with a mass shooting, taking advantage of the situation. Some don’t know how to fire the new weapons properly and not many rounds are expelled, even when they were prepped for more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock was the first to get hit, or the unlucky fall guy, or even the FBI agent who cased out the hotels. Popped, in any event, the FBI pose as police on the way out, and no one bats an eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know what really happened in Vegas, and I doubt I ever will. The sad thing is: I can’t even trust the tapped “proof”.
