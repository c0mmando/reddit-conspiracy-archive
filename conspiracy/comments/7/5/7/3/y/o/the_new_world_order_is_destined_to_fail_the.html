    <div class="md"><p>I get the pessimism, but here&#39;s why you&#39;re wrong:</p>

<p>A centerpiece of the new world communist order is arrested development. Meaning that all new research, tech and development is done under the total control of the elites, and the proles have no means of developing potentially disruptive tech whatsoever, ensuring their endless slavery. That&#39;s not yet the case. They still need to consolidate power, without making it obvious, at a speed faster than technological progress can allow for a (I know it&#39;s utopian bullshit to use the terms but it gets the idea across) &#39;global awakening scenario&#39;. And it&#39;s kind of getting interesting right now because with cryptography, blockchain and the rise of alt and indie media, their grasp for censorship, nonconformist bullying etc is becoming quite obvious. The coming decades will make or break the new world order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s where I&#39;m wrong?  wow.<br/>
If you think it&#39;s pessimism then you still don&#39;t understand it. As I said, people like you can just keep lying to yourself, it won&#39;t change the facts. You think they don&#39;t control the &quot;alt&quot; and &quot;indie&quot; media? I always laugh my ass off when I see you all throwing this &quot;global awakening&quot; shit all around. Not gonna happen. Everything is going according the plan, they made the internet for a reason, and they know how to control it. You under estimate them if you think their power ends at censorship.
If you choose to be a super happy optimistic hippie then fine, do it.
 If that makes you sleep better then just tell yourself that a miracle will happen and suddenly every human will just wake up and everything will be fine. The 2 billion facebook user indicates otherwise, but just keep being optimistic. Me, personally, I stay realistic. Even if the truth hurts, lies won&#39;t change it.    </p>

<p>Their hubris will not allow them to concede that their ideas are folly or that there are actual human factors that prevent people from moving away from tribalism.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m of the mind that someday soon the imposter Zionist &quot;Jews&quot; allow all of Israel&#39;s ultra-nationalistic activities to come to light.. 9/11, USS Liberty, Al Nakba, corruption of all US politicians (AIPAC)...etc (trust me the list is much longer). Combine this with a nutjob running N.K and America as well as several other countries(further proving the idiocy of representative democracy).... it leads to an all out nuclear war (Armageddon) that when finished, Israel and the rest of the world looks like Syria does now (google &#39;Syria Drone Footage&#39;), we will all be inclined to abandon our nationalist gangs and dissolve our national identities into a global / world citizenship and pound our swords into plowshares and swear off war forever as it has been foretold. </p>
