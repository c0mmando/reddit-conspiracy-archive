       unfortunately, this is not the truth.

       Everything happening now is a filler, using factions against others, riling all sides up, keeping it all muddy and distractions high and why?

       to keep us all busy till technological enslavement is complete. Soon, sooner than we think, mankind will be completely controlled via technological means, automated systems you're unable to stop/fight against.

       You are saying it because you are ignorant. The new world order is already complete, and successful, we did not even seen it yet. You can keep up the positive hippie vibe and you can pretend like the elites give a fuck about your reddit post and they are scared, but you are only lying to yourself.
       <br/>
       As long as you are part of society and technology you are their slave just like me and anyone else.
       <br/>
       Have you ever thought about why do they have a pair of compasses on their logo? Because they are the engineers. They are engineering your life, and they engined the life of your whole family tree and the savery of the entire humankind.

       I get the pessimism, but here's why you're wrong:
      </p>
      <p>
       A centerpiece of the new world communist order is arrested development. Meaning that all new research, tech and development is done under the total control of the elites, and the proles have no means of developing potentially disruptive tech whatsoever, ensuring their endless slavery. That's not yet the case. They still need to consolidate power, without making it obvious, at a speed faster than technological progress can allow for a (I know it's utopian bullshit to use the terms but it gets the idea across) 'global awakening scenario'. And it's kind of getting interesting right now because with cryptography, blockchain and the rise of alt and indie media, their grasp for censorship, nonconformist bullying etc is becoming quite obvious. The coming decades will make or break the new world order.

       That's where I'm wrong?  wow.
       <br/>
       If you think it's pessimism then you still don't understand it. As I said, people like you can just keep lying to yourself, it won't change the facts. You think they don't control the "alt" and "indie" media? I always laugh my ass off when I see you all throwing this "global awakening" shit all around. Not gonna happen. Everything is going according the plan, they made the internet for a reason, and they know how to control it. You under estimate them if you think their power ends at censorship.
If you choose to be a super happy optimistic hippie then fine, do it.
 If that makes you sleep better then just tell yourself that a miracle will happen and suddenly every human will just wake up and everything will be fine. The 2 billion facebook user indicates otherwise, but just keep being optimistic. Me, personally, I stay realistic. Even if the truth hurts, lies won't change it.

       Failed? We've been at perpetual war since the 911 controlled demolition, unless your believe that Tranformer super planes melted da buildings, wow and they ricocheted over and knocked another one over. Military-Industrial-Congressional complex feeds off these conflicts, while one of their main man inside John McCain chortles all the way to the bank. Trump didn't play along and suffered a unheard of media barrage and paid and duped idiots protesting nothing specific. But will he eventually be forced to pull the trigger?

       They will force the square peg into the round hole even if it is a temporary solution. They think this is the natural evolution of human governance through social engineering (we are one people, the human race) and this is the inevitable progression that seems self evident to their ideologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their hubris will not allow them to concede that their ideas are folly or that there are actual human factors that prevent people from moving away from tribalism. The idealistic would imagine this would end war and prevent human suffering by viewing the entire world as a single community, but the reality is it would just turn every war into a civil war and would require centralized asset management and with it the loss of personal property and individual agency.

       I'm of the mind that someday soon the imposter Zionist "Jews" allow all of Israel's ultra-nationalistic activities to come to light.. 9/11, USS Liberty, Al Nakba, corruption of all US politicians (AIPAC)...etc (trust me the list is much longer). Combine this with a nutjob running N.K and America as well as several other countries(further proving the idiocy of representative democracy).... it leads to an all out nuclear war (Armageddon) that when finished, Israel and the rest of the world looks like Syria does now (google 'Syria Drone Footage'), we will all be inclined to abandon our nationalist gangs and dissolve our national identities into a global / world citizenship and pound our swords into plowshares and swear off war forever as it has been foretold.
