       Don't know if I can post this here but I'm posting it here because I know you guys will find it interesting and I can possibly get some feedback and or a answer to what this is.

       First some backstory on how I found this location and possibly give it some validity on what I think it is. While browsing Google Mars as I do from time to time looking for anomalies I remembered theory of Valles Marineris being an impact site of some kind. Then it struct me, if anything were to survive such a impact it would have to be on the complete opposite side to stand a chance. So I go to the other side of the planet and by luck I land on the spot. It immediately stuck out like a sore thumb and I could tell from quite a distance this was different. Then there it was a pyramid weather natural or unnatural It is almost perfect and the shadow is very telling. there seem to be three of them differing sizes but in almost the same arrangement as the Great Pyramids. The largest most telling one is quite large about 4x as big as the Great Pyramid. I would really like to know if they line up with Orion but I'm not sure how to figure that out. This alone was quite intriguing but even without these the surrounding area is very anomalous. Im not going into detail as you can see for yourself. Another thing to keep in mind is the scale of these things as the are massive. This would make sense however if you take into account the CIA remote viewing documents. The viewer was explaining how massive the structures and building were. Whether or not this has anything to do with it I don't know I just thought it was interesting. Another thing is that the area was photographed in high resolution but has no labeling in or around the area. You would think that this would be labeled as it is different then any of the landscape on mars. We have all seen pictures of apparent "structures" or anomalies on mars but really nothing has ever really been convincing to me. This however has really got me intrigued as I have never seen anything like this. Now this could all be natural and just coincidental that I happen to come across it. Let me know what you think! And please use the coordinates from the images to check it out your self if you have the ability.

       but i honestly think this is just some image artefact that will vanish in higher resolution. just like the infamous face on mars.

       Not image artifacts, just erosion.  You can see that there are many flat features in the area.  These are probably made of harder stone with softer stone or debris under them.  As the softer material wears away underneath, the harder layer can tilt with edges suddenly rising up into peaks.  Now, view such a formation from above with a strong light from the side, and you can see very pyramid like formations.

       FWIW i would love to see something on Mars, but in this case i think its too easily explained and better evidence is needed.

       The face on mars was always dumb to me. It didn't necessarily look like a face imo and when the higher resolution images came out it was no surprise.

       MULTIPLE SHOOTERS.  CRISIS ACTORS.  MASS DELETING VIDEOS.   MEDIA FLIP FLOPPING THEIR STORIES. SHILLS BRIGADING SO HARD AND FAILING BADLY TO TURN THE NARRATIVE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Las Vegas false flag was so poorly executed it alone will bring down the crooks who think they control us.  I don't think you realize how many people out there know the truth since you're just hanging out in one of the most shill-infested areas on the internet.  Everyone I talk to knows there were multiple shooters and is confused why the news isn't reporting it.  They are collapsing, if you don't see that you are blind as hell.

       If neither Bush's went to jail, you can bet Hiliary isn't going. Those turds all protect each other so they themselves don't go to jail. Wtf has this sub turned into... I mean, I know, but come on.. Lets keep it real.

       I agree with this. If they send her to a jail that isn’t a 6 month resort (still might talk) she’ll tell everything she knows and the whole gang is going to jail.

       I mean you're allowed to be optimistic as well as being a conspiracy theorist. I personally think she will be arrested, hopeful or not maybe we can wait and see who ends up being right. I'm not saying the vegas massacre will do it but who knows, people think I'm crazy wither way so I might as well be hopeful

       I couldn't care less about being right or wrong about it; I hope she is arrested but I just don't think it will ever happen. I think it would have happened already if so.

       I hear you man, but you also have to think that somebody in her position of power and influence doesn't simply get arrested. Like you said I'm just hoping that its taking so long because there is some shit that needs to happen before she goes down. Anyways at least we know that she is evil which is more than most lol

       In thousands of years, all that would be left of our post apocalyptic world would likely be the pyramids, literally everything else would be dust and if our atmosphere was destroyed such as what happened on mars, all you would see is desert and the pyramids around the world.

       The CIA would use psychics to focus on and describe a time and location inside a sealed envelope. They tried to trick a psychic by making the location Mars and the time a Million years ago. This is the result.

       The Mars coordinates the CIA psychic was asked to focus on (in the newly declassified reports) are less than 10km away from "The Face on Mars", and Google Mars has a strange chatbot there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mars coordinates the psychic is first asked to focus on are 40.89 degrees north, 9.55 degrees west.

       The CIA was interviewing a self-proclaimed psychic. He was given an envelope containing a time (1million BC) and a location (on Mars). The interviewee in unaware that he is talking about mars. The only people aware of the contents of the envelope are those conducting the interview.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was not told the location or time, he was only given the geographic coordinate, and he was asked to envision the location at the time given in the envelope. He goes on to describe geological structures that we see on mars in present day, and remnants of a civilization. They ask him to go further back in time where the civilization still existed, and he describes tall, thin figures wearing strange clothes.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the interview, the tall dark figures appear to be in some sort of trouble. He interacts with them and reports that he thinks they perceive him as a hallucination.

       Given that the psychic was as accurate as he was, I wouldn't then refer to him by the marginalizing term "self-proclaimed".  Seems
       <em>
        actual

       at that point - not "self-proclaimed".

       Actually the CIA was using various methods to create psychics or boost the signal and abilities of people who demonstrated the ability to tap in.

      <p>
       What's interesting is that these "martians" are not little green men, but fit exactly the description of the giant beings from the sky seen in ancient hieroglyphs.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible that these were one of the exploration groups or the exploration group sent to find a new home.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some believe they were not able to, or refused to go back to Mars, so they set up shop here and helped advance civilization greatly, essentially viewed as Gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since that time, earth has had many mass extinction events, it's possible the martians eventually died off, as there were not enough of them to reproduce effectively. Some believe they were eventually able to blast off and explore other planets.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were on Mars and going off planet, where would you go first? Earth of course, it's what would have happened after that which is speculation but someone somewhere has the answers as these stories, even these fossils of giant beings are likely secured somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pyramids might have been built on earth for the same reason they were built on Mars according to this session, as the only thing strong enough to shield you from massive storms and geological events. They may have been ordered built by the martians as preventative maintenance knowing what happened to their own planet.

       Those are unusual to be sure. At first, I was willing to suspend disbelief. I'm not a geologist, and even if I was, then I wouldn't be an expert on why things form the way they do on another planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the sheer volume of prismatic boulders/geometric structures is beyond bizarre. I find it very difficult to believe that so many perfect right angles would occur naturally. Take

       Daamn.
Still though. Theories and speculation about life and civilizations on Mars have been around since at least the 18th century? A con artist could have potentially memorized a coordinate range for Earth, maybe specific countries, and even for Mars as well. I prefer that the experience was genuine though.  Also, has anyone looked up these coordinates to see if this info checks out?

       If you want the real treat, do the experiment on yourself, aka DMT, using holosync audio, etc.
      </p>

       You yourself can tap into the infinite knowledge of the universe, be careful though, enough of it and you'll start living your life and not be trapped by the materialistic, ego bullshit that makes everyone miserable.

       It's possible to use holosync audio and meditation but usually takes years of practice before you can effectively leave your consciousness, THC can help, mushrooms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Drugs make it much easier to open the doorway, holosync is interesting stuff, you should listen to an hour on your headphones, people have all kinds of experiences.

       What exactly does leaving my consciousness entail? Remote viewing? Astral plane? Psychic abilities? I'm not sure. And what kind of drugs? I've already had one experience with ketamine, courtesy of a trip to the oral surgeon, that was rather enlightening, and disturbing. As well as past experience with energy manipulation, and sensing emotions. However I don't think it'd be in my interests to attempt imbibing myself with psychoactive substances anytime soon.

       There are a lot of good resources when you google "remote viewing" and how to remove view. I have a friend who can do this, proven through testing we did. It was pretty wild stuff, and he was very accurate (we tested thing that were current and he would have no way of knowing. Anyway, he said it can be learned though some people figure out the process more easily than others.

       The Mars coordinates the CIA psychic was asked to focus on (in the newly declassified reports) are less than 10km away from "The Face on Mars", and Google Mars has a strange chatbot there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mars coordinates the psychic is first asked to focus on are 40.89 degrees north, 9.55 degrees west.

       I personally see this as proof that either aliens, or an ancient civilization that was more advanced than ours went to Mars, and has some connection to planets on Orion's Belt. This shit is wildly fascinating. Also, check this shit out:

       Mars was hit with the same genetic materials as earth was, the very same recipe was sent to both planets.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a few theories, some of the more reasonable ones are that Mars was able to accelerate life far faster than here and were far ahead of us, but also burnt out ahead of us.

       Whether they became interplanetary or were simply a highly advanced civilization that saw it's end where it started is up for debate. Also, even if they could get to Earth, it's possible our atmosphere at the time would not have been hospitable to them and they would have gone elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all the technology we discover, it's insane to think that similar life forms with a million plus year head start would not be flying around the universe.

       The universe consists of the same base ingredients, mars, because of it's proximity to earth was hit by the same amounts of materials the earth was, the difference is Mars was just a little too close to the sun, so it cooked everything faster, and burnt out faster. Many scientists believe Mars had an atmosphere very similar to Earth with massive oceans.

       Just curious how was Mars too close to the sun compared to earth? It's farther away distance wise.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought the theory was that when Mars had an atmosphere it was habitable but that atmosphere left early compared to earth as the mantle / core of Mars cooled and the magnetic field weakened.

       It was only just recently that the "no water on Mars or elsewhere in the solar system" team had to fade away into irrelevance.  So what's the next defensive to fall?

       I'm not necessarily buying any of this, but I think it's very interesting to contemplate and always best to keep an open mind...

       I would love it if someone could give these pictures to an archaeologist, and pretend they are from Earth, and casually ask what era/civilization they're probably from, and see if the archaeologist goes 'nah that's obviously just natural formations.' I haven't got a clue, but to my completely untrained eye they look like ruins, like an older more weathered version of stuff you see at ancient sites like in Malta or middle east/north africa etc. Honestly it gives me a little shiver down my spine seeing stuff like this.

       My theory: Mars is smaller and further from the sun, so it would have cooled first. Panspermia says that if life is on earth it was most likely on mars, just much sooner. Advanced civilization arises first on mars, then has to flee the planet due to core collapse similar to Vulcan in star trek. Again, mars being smaller would mean shorter core lifespan, no core no magnetosphere no atmosphere.

       Just a nitpick but it's technically a hypothesis because you don't have any way of proving your theory. Just a minute difference but it matters because this is why people are quick to dismiss evolution as a theory that anyone can make up, rather than understanding it as a solidified backbone of science that has been proven over and over again.

       You're right, as stated it was just a hypothesis. My theory of core collapse is resultant from what I believe is at the center of every planetary/solar body, a sub solar mass black hole. Over time they evaporate due to Hawking radiation. When they do the iron core stops spinning and the body is essentially dead.

       There a Graham Hancock book called 'The Mars Mystery', very interesting read.
      </p>
      <p>
       What everyone has to remember about trying to find evidence of civilisation on Mars, is that that planet got hit by something so powerful that it blew about a third of its crust straight off. If there were oceans on the planet, which it seems more and more likely there were, they would have completely destroyed
       <strong>
        everything
       </strong>
       on the surface as Mars's lithosphere cracked and the oceans washed around the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I would expect a planet to look like after that happening is exactly what Mars looks like. Dried debris absolutely everywhere, evidence of water erosion, and
       <em>
        any potential structures almost complete covered by flood debris and sediment
       </em>
       .

       Daamn.

      <p>
       Still though.  Theories and speculation about life and civilizations on Mars have been around since at least the 18th century?  A con artist could have potentially memorized a coordinate range for Earth, maybe specific countries, and even for Mars as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I prefer that the experience was genuine though.

       Does anyone have access to the photo of the 3 pyramids on Mars that are aligned in the Orion's Belt way, the same way the 3 Giza pyramids on earth are?

       I have already tried! No response from any of the ones I sent it too. That was my first thing I wanted to do was get a opinion on them from a professional then them them where they were located.

       Welder here. I've never built a pyramid. Can confirm that these are indeed pyramids.
