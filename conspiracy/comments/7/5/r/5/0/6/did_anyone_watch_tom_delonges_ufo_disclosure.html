       Heard it all many times before I'm afraid. The second they go down the road of saying " we have x, y, or z but all will be revealed the next time you buy a ticket!" it's pretty obvious what it all is, and that's a scam. If they had the evidence and weren't just interested in making money from the gullible, you would have seen it earlier today.

       They wouldn't just come right out and say they are scamming you but I'm afraid that's what's happening here. Trust me I was somebody who used to fall for this sort of crap all the time when I was younger and have had an interest in UFOs for years, everytime somebody new came along I wanted to believe so much that
       <em>
        this time
       </em>
       it's going to be disclosure. Every time though, every single time, it's just for money. They always seem like the real deal but there's literally never been a time where that has been the case. 
Just keep a look up to the skies and eventually you'll see something for yourself.

       You could very well be right, but when have people with credentials of this magnitude come out to flat out confirm UFOs?

       I personally think a bluebeam op is more likely than a money grab, Tom Delonge has been doing this for years, it's not like he's some nobody with no money. The frontman for Blink-182 isn't exactly broke, you know?

       I know man but it's best not to get your hopes up about all this because the track record is literally 100% always been a scam. I want disclosure too but just don't think these guys will be the ones to bring it. Nothing wrong with being open minded about it though. I used to be the same way myself before all the scammers hacked all my trust in these types away.

       Plenty. Defense Minister of Canada went on MSM for like 20 minutes talking about 4 species of alien visiting us for thousands of years. Astronaut Edgar Mitchell, astronaut Alan Bean, astronaut Gordon Cooper. Aerospace CEO Bob Bigelow was on 60  recently saying we’re being visited by ETs all the time, that they’re living here.  Governor of Arizona finally admitted to the Phoenix lights case was real after denying it years before.

       The common denominator in all those examples you provided is that they appeared on TV, which would have involved a fee. They also provided no real evidence apart from anecdotal. Disclosure has to come from a current world leader and I feel it would have to be a world leader from the UK, US, China or Russia to really hold credence. 
It would have to be a press conference with details and hard evidence. I understand that the thoughts of the people you mentioned you would think should be enough but it's easy for someone to turn around and cynically say they just did it to earn a couple of grand from a TV appearance. 
Also those examples you provided are slightly different to what I was talking about, I was talking about these groups that go on tour, sell merchandise, tickets, books and films always dangling the carrot of mind blowing evidence that never seems to materialise.

       Mh. Just saw this. Besides the familiar whiff of nervous desperation from a startup asking for funding that DeLonge exhuded, a couple other points have a bit of and odd smell...
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we're talking here of a clearinghouse, a (non) but still very
       <em>
        official
       </em>
       entity from where all info and
       <em>
        legit
       </em>
       research will funnel to and from? An entity for which individuals will become agents via apps and funding, and who will be monitored, identified and monitored in one way or another? Individuals that, should they happen to have an experience or contact, will have what kind of obligations or limits in their dissemination of any info given their relationship with this organization?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are these people serious when they talk about openly retrofitting outside tech that could make whole industries disappear overnight?
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole thing sounds like an overhyped fund campaign for some entertainment studio that wants to build some cred via these elderly gentlemen. Also, the
       <em>
        'I was shown all these top-secret things'
       </em>
       aspects of DeLonge's recount give me a very bad Greer-like vibe. Why him? Why was he
       <em>
        chosen
       </em>
       to be privy to this info?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is it a
       <em>
        soft introduction
       </em>
       of a bona fide disclosure to the masses?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, last kind of people that I'd like to engineer some kidn of
       <em>
        frist contact
       </em>
       are the likes of Podesta and company... but then again, if Alex
       <em>
        Male Vitality
       </em>
       Jones is right, guess that's already the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see many people funding this.

       Well, i enyoyed it, i had a good laugh and i could blow off some steam while yelling at the TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they actually thinking we will pay for disclosure and development off stuff that is known of and has been arround and working since the 1950's or so?
      </p>
      <p>
       And that we actually will believe that they will help us to sort out what they are hiding all along?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry, let me refrase that, they want us to pay, to let us do the work and uncover their hidden shit and believe that they will hand everything they know over to humanity?
      </p>
      <p>
       While at the same time giving us a convienient collecting and sharing point for UFO experiences and let the sorting out of real and fake over to the ones repressing the information all along...
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, i don't buy anything from this group, i hoped it would be a door to disclosure, but it is a money scam and repressing information at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It might be an opening to disclosure somewhere else, but this project won't deliver us what we actually want and need as humanity.
