    <div class="md"><p>Bruh, these were all invented during the campaign. After the election they all disappeared. If there was merit the MSM would have never let them go. They knew they were bullshit. In fact, the young girl who alleged he and Epstein raped her, who then mysteriously withdrew the accusations once he was elected and never showed for her press conference or court dates was probably entirely fictitious.</p>

<p>Could he be? Sure. Am I convinced he is a serial pervert? No.</p>

<p>Also it really irks me how people think the Weinstein thing is some sort of proof of pedogate. I want to expose it as much as the next guy, but no one is accusing him of being a pedophile - just touching actresses without their consent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because TPTB know that pedogate is a hot topic and has been for a year now for people like us that hold open minds against these sick people.

    <div class="md"><p>I think that is because the &#39;&#39;official story&#39;&#39; is kinda shoddy. so instead of constantly tacking onto it to try to keep it together they scrap it for something more glamorous. a distraction from a distraction if you will. all news will be redacted before long manipulate what you saw and what you heard and gaslight us all into believing something different that what actually happened. if you tell a lie often enough you begin to believe it. eventually the only thing you can be sure about is the fact that you cannot be sure of anything. I didn&#39;t see this or that so I have no choice but to believe everything I have heard about it from anyone even people who claimed to have been there are complete lies. you want to question the narrative? you want to argue what everyone else believes to be real true fact? you think you can change even a single mind? you ought not think that way. you are a crazy. someone might report you to the thought police. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Weinstein story is legit, but its been known for over a decade and the timing of this story blowing up all of a sudden is extremely suspect and should be the real eye opener. I personally believe its to cover up the Vegas shooting story over the Awan scandal since that&#39;s been on the down low for quiet some time now. The fact that the Vegas shooting narrative is falling apart makes me assume this. I&#39;ve never witnessed such a massive fuck up before. All these events push something in motion for sure, and much of it is kept hidden from the public. Something will come of this incident and it could be years from now where the story is pretty much dead to every news outlet besides independent researchers from places like here or 4chan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shifting narrative and conflicting facts the mainstream news media has dutifully reported but never questioned for some mysterious reason has only further diminished their stature and confirmed that they&#39;re really no more than puppets and mouthpieces for the authorities. </p>

<p>Obviously they&#39;d like to distract attention away from all that fumbling and bumbling and a nice juicy sex scandal involving plenty of gossip and innuendo with some well known celebrities names all thrown in for good measure is just the ticket to do that.</p>

<p>Fairly obvious too, that what they&#39;re not reporting are news items that they&#39;ve been expressly told to avoid or downplay as much as possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the addition of the fact that others are speaking out furthering distraction and helping push this story even more. This would explain my gut feeling this guy is being used as a scapegoat for distraction from more important stories, mainly the cluster fuck of a mess the Vegas shooting is. Thanks for the input.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Weinstein story is legit, but its been known for over a decade and the timing of this story blowing up all of a sudden is extremely suspect and should be the real eye opener. I personally believe its to cover up the Vegas shooting story over the Awan scandal since that&#39;s been on the down low for quiet some time now. The fact that the Vegas shooting narrative is falling apart makes me assume this. I&#39;ve never witnessed such a massive fuck up before. All these events push something in motion for sure, and much of it is kept hidden from the public. Something will come of this incident and it could be years from now where the story is pretty much dead to every news outlet besides independent researchers from places like here or 4chan.</p>
