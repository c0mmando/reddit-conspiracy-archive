    <div class="md"><p>If you are looking at the issue of Elite Sexual Abuse through a political lens, you are a moron.
Let me lay out the options:</p>

<p>Option 1: Many elite powerful people of either party take part in sexual abuse. The powerful people cover for each other and are engaged in mutual blackmail.</p>

<p>Option 2: ONLY powerful Democratic elites take part in sexual abuse. (Anthony Weiner, Convicted and jailed.)</p>

<p>Option 3: ONLY powerful Republican elites take part in sexual abuse. (Dennis Hastert, Convicted and jailed.)</p>

<p>Option 4: A few powerful moneyed elites of either party take part in sexual abuse. (Friend of the Trump&#39;s and the Clinton&#39;s, Jeffery Epstein; Democratic Supporter, Harvey Weinstein; Republican Supporter, Lawrence E. King Jr.*). Those few who have participated have been caught. No one else is taking part. There is no need to investigate any further. If the mass media does not talk about it, it is &quot;fake news&quot;.</p>

<p>If you read r/conspiracy and you don&#39;t believe in option 1 you are either a fucking idiot or you are pretending to believe in the other options for some reason.</p>

<p>I&#39;m one of the people who <em>you should ask</em>, being that I&#39;ve spoken plenty of times with most current/former mods here on a variety of topics (quite literally). Most tend to be more &quot;liberal/left&quot; leaning. One of the mods here, for example, supported Bernie Sanders.</p>

<p>The good thing about many mods here is that they do not necessarily let that hinder their modding which allows for the most part, open and free discussion on a variety of topics. To say this sub is being modded by pro-Trump people quashing discussion about him is quite absurd, imo. </p>

<p>Take that for however you want, just giving you my opinion.</p>

<p>You can pretty much talk about anything here as long as it follows the rules.  I don&#39;t see anything in the rules that says &quot;Anti Trump Posts Result in Immediate Ban&quot;</p>

<p>What do you have to talk about other than some statements Trump made and the fact that he was on the plane?  </p>

<p>Could he have been on the plane for a business deal with a pedo on board? </p>

<p>Could he be a pedo?  </p>

<p>Would someone have already made that accusation before now?  </p>

<p>First they banned a guy who was writing in one of the threads. </p>

<p>Then, they banned another who posted a NEW thread, designed to bring attention that unfair ban.</p>

<p>Then that guy was banned and the post was deleted. Like all of this shit is being scraped under the rug to hide something. I really don&#39;t trust the moderators here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is so silly. I rarely bring up politics <em>ever</em>. I didn&#39;t vote for Trump, I&#39;m certainly not &quot;all in&quot; on the guy, but I know a lot about elite pedophilia and have been through those subjects before. As I pointed out in that 95+ comment thread, there <em>is still</em> no evidence of Trump being on Epsteins island after a year of that poster reposting the same topic on a weekly basis.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll accept evidence if their was any, <em>but there isn&#39;t</em>. </p>

<p>The post was removed for Rule 12- self post with no context.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t looked at the mod logs, but I&#39;m guessing the 2nd post was removed for Rule 6.</p>

<p>There are fairly simple rules for this sub. Don&#39;t break them and we can discuss any conspiracy you want. </p>

<p>From Mar-A-Lago, it would be easy for Trump to bounce to Epstein&#39;s island by boat or his own shuttle. Not saying it didn&#39;t happen. But never seen any proof Trump was on that plane.</p>
