       I'm sure many elites have strong and exotic sexual desires. Trump is an elite. He could easily be a pedophile. People here are often very critical of Trump (and all governments), regardless of their political opinions.

       If you are looking at the issue of Elite Sexual Abuse through a political lens, you are a moron.
Let me lay out the options:
      </p>
      <p>
       Option 1: Many elite powerful people of either party take part in sexual abuse. The powerful people cover for each other and are engaged in mutual blackmail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Option 2: ONLY powerful Democratic elites take part in sexual abuse. (Anthony Weiner, Convicted and jailed.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Option 3: ONLY powerful Republican elites take part in sexual abuse. (Dennis Hastert, Convicted and jailed.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Option 4: A few powerful moneyed elites of either party take part in sexual abuse. (Friend of the Trump's and the Clinton's, Jeffery Epstein; Democratic Supporter, Harvey Weinstein; Republican Supporter, Lawrence E. King Jr.*). Those few who have participated have been caught. No one else is taking part. There is no need to investigate any further. If the mass media does not talk about it, it is "fake news".

       I am the guy who spammed the comment and the link above.  Yes, I posted the same comment in several different postings because it seems like some posts linking Jeffery Epstein to Trump were disappearing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a post disappears, then my comment is also disappeared.

      <p>
       U/Lowbrowunibrow suggested I make and original post, so I did.

       Quotes are absolutely essential here. "liberal" and "conservative" my ass. More like centrist corporatists when all is said and done. Things were fucked as soon as Admins were called upon to remove mods.

       I'm one of the people who
       <em>
        you should ask
       </em>
       , being that I've spoken plenty of times with most current/former mods here on a variety of topics (quite literally). Most tend to be more "liberal/left" leaning. One of the mods here, for example, supported Bernie Sanders.
      </p>
      <p>
       The good thing about many mods here is that they do not necessarily let that hinder their modding which allows for the most part, open and free discussion on a variety of topics. To say this sub is being modded by pro-Trump people quashing discussion about him is quite absurd, imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take that for however you want, just giving you my opinion.

       Trump is a cog in the machine.  I don't know why you're so scared of being banned, this isn't t_d.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can pretty much talk about anything here as long as it follows the rules.  I don't see anything in the rules that says "Anti Trump Posts Result in Immediate Ban"
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you have to talk about other than some statements Trump made and the fact that he was on the plane?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could he have been on the plane for a business deal with a pedo on board?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could he be a pedo?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would someone have already made that accusation before now?

       Dude I literally busy witnessed them delete 3 seperate posts regarding Epstein and trumps connections.
      </p>
      <p>
       First they banned a guy who was writing in one of the threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, they banned another who posted a NEW thread, designed to bring attention that unfair ban.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then that guy was banned and the post was deleted. Like all of this shit is being scraped under the rug to hide something. I really don't trust the moderators here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they may even be networking with opposition. Who knows. That's not a CLAIM, it's a vague idea I have. Don't ban me for that either. Christ. Mods here ban people over anything...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's unfortunate but you have to be careful because the mods will ban you here if you touch on a hot topic.

       If what you're saying is true than that's some pretty fucking ironic shit.  A conspiracy within the moderation team of r/conspiracy.

       And is technically allowed.  It's a conspiracy theory.

       Because they don't need total control of a section of Reddit of which the users are stereotyped as nutjobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need people to be confused to the point that anything that is being thought of isn't true; that all of the conspiracy theories that were on the right track have been convoluted to the point that nothing makes sense anymore.

       TPTB could perform a thinning by hacking select individuals cellular devices and placing child porn on them.  A few anonymous tips later, lives are destroyed.

       If we are getting too close to solving the riddle they will create another distraction that will be eaten up by the MSM and regurgitated until the next one.  Rinse and fucking repeat.

       This is so silly. I rarely bring up politics
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       . I didn't vote for Trump, I'm certainly not "all in" on the guy, but I know a lot about elite pedophilia and have been through those subjects before. As I pointed out in that 95+ comment thread, there
       <em>
        is still
       </em>
       no evidence of Trump being on Epsteins island after a year of that poster reposting the same topic on a weekly basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll accept evidence if their was any,

       I don't know why he would call me that, because I'm not a shill. I've dedicated hundreds of hours researching elite pedophilia and I'm going to call out BS when I see it. That particular user did get rule 10'd and I've seen it in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       The post was removed for Rule 12- self post with no context.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't looked at the mod logs, but I'm guessing the 2nd post was removed for Rule 6.

       There are fairly simple rules for this sub. Don't break them and we can discuss any conspiracy you want.

       Nobody has ever shown me anything that proves Trump was on Epstein's plane. He's not on any of the flight logs.
      </p>
      <p>
       From Mar-A-Lago, it would be easy for Trump to bounce to Epstein's island by boat or his own shuttle. Not saying it didn't happen. But never seen any proof Trump was on that plane.
