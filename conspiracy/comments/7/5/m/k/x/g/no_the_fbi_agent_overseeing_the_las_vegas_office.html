        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The FBI agent overseeing the Las Vegas office is NOT married to John Podesta&#39;s daughter.</p>

<p>This is Podesta&#39;s daughter and her husband.  </p>

<p><a href="https://onedublin.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dublin-school-board-provisional-appointee-megan-rouse-with-her-family.jpg">https://onedublin.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/dublin-school-board-provisional-appointee-megan-rouse-with-her-family.jpg</a></p>

<p>Podesta&#39;s son-in-law has the last name Rouse, and the FBI guy has the last name Rouse. However, they are NOT married.</p>

<p>John Podesta&#39;s Daughter, Megan Rouse Lives in Dublin, CA.
FBI agent, Aaron Rouse, of course lives in Las Vegas.
So again, I am guessing they are not married.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it is a fact that the FBI agent and John Podesta&#39;s daughter share the same name. A coincidence that someone carelessly or purposely decided to point out as a conspiracy. </p>

<p>The important thing is that we point out mistakes here on r/conspiracy.  I must admit that I originally posted a link to this bogus information. So, I am correcting the record, THEY ARE NOT MARRIED. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it possible that Comey appointed a compromised Podesta controlled FBI stooge to manage a complex false-flag and so then has to cover up the existence of the marriage with photos of a phony husband?  Possible but not probable. </p>

<p>I am just using common sense. Using a Pedesta-stooge would be a silly thing to do as it would attract too much attention. </p>

<p>The same family name is just a coincidence and people pointing out this false conspiracy are just looking for hits on their web page. </p>

<p>Instead, Comey just appointed a typical FBI stooge to do the job. 
That looks less suspicious. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is proof out there that Agent Aaron Rouse is head of the Las Vegas FBI office.  A newspaper article pointed that out in July, 2017. I am assuming that he now lives in LV.  Also, the husband in photo of Megan Rouse&#39;s family in California, does not resemble  Aaron Rouse at all.  </p>

<p>Finally, I assume that James Comey was not stupid enough to appoint the husband of Podesta to an position where he would have to manage a false-flag attack in LV. </p>

<p>Oh, and just because Agent Aaron Rouse is not married to a Podesta does not clear him.  His job history, his behavior at the press conferences and the investigation he seems to be heading are all suspicious as hell. </p>

The bigger picture here is the Nevada FBI have been excluded from the investigation, as well as las vegas PD, and the DC FBI have completely taken over the investigation. One of the MANY fishy things going on with this situation, something had to have went wrong in their plan for things to be this sloppy, or maybe (hopefully) more and more americans are starting to wake up to the bullshit they are fed on a daily basis.</p>
