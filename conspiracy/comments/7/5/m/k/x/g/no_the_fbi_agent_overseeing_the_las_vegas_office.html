       The FBI agent overseeing the Las Vegas office is NOT married to John Podesta's daughter.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is Podesta's daughter and her husband.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta's son-in-law has the last name Rouse, and the FBI guy has the last name Rouse. However, they are NOT married.
      </p>
      <p>
       John Podesta's Daughter, Megan Rouse Lives in Dublin, CA.
FBI agent, Aaron Rouse, of course lives in Las Vegas.
So again, I am guessing they are not married.

       Well, it is a fact that the FBI agent and John Podesta's daughter share the same name. A coincidence that someone carelessly or purposely decided to point out as a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The important thing is that we point out mistakes here on r/conspiracy.  I must admit that I originally posted a link to this bogus information. So, I am correcting the record, THEY ARE NOT MARRIED.

       Upvote this post!!! I appreciate this, not only should people be pushing conspiracy points, they should accept or be skeptical until they are irrefutable facts.  Then make sure everyone is aware of the information that breaks that theory.  If you are here for the truth, ypu should always be ready to weigh a situation and the facts without a bias.

       Is it possible that Comey appointed a compromised Podesta controlled FBI stooge to manage a complex false-flag and so then has to cover up the existence of the marriage with photos of a phony husband?  Possible but not probable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am just using common sense. Using a Pedesta-stooge would be a silly thing to do as it would attract too much attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same family name is just a coincidence and people pointing out this false conspiracy are just looking for hits on their web page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, Comey just appointed a typical FBI stooge to do the job. 
That looks less suspicious.

       There is proof out there that Agent Aaron Rouse is head of the Las Vegas FBI office.  A newspaper article pointed that out in July, 2017. I am assuming that he now lives in LV.  Also, the husband in photo of Megan Rouse's family in California, does not resemble  Aaron Rouse at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, I assume that James Comey was not stupid enough to appoint the husband of Podesta to an position where he would have to manage a false-flag attack in LV.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, and just because Agent Aaron Rouse is not married to a Podesta does not clear him.  His job history, his behavior at the press conferences and the investigation he seems to be heading are all suspicious as hell.

Aaron Rouse Named Special Agent in Charge of the Las Vegas Division
       </p>
       <p>
        FBI Director James B. Comey has named Aaron Rouse as the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas Division. Mr. Rouse most recently served as section chief in the Counterintelligence Division at FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr. Rouse entered on duty with the FBI in 1996 and was first assigned to the Washington Field Office, where he worked violent crime and was on the Joint Fugitive Task Force.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout his career, Mr. Rouse has held leadership positions in the Tampa Division, the San Antonio Division, and the Counterintelligence Division at FBIHQ.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr. Rouse will assume this new role in September.

       Who cares if the FBI agent in the LV office isn't married to John Podestas daughter?
The bigger picture here is the Nevada FBI have been excluded from the investigation, as well as las vegas PD, and the DC FBI have completely taken over the investigation. One of the MANY fishy things going on with this situation, something had to have went wrong in their plan for things to be this sloppy, or maybe (hopefully) more and more americans are starting to wake up to the bullshit they are fed on a daily basis.

       Some conspiracy websites and youtube video producers were claiming that the LV FBI Agent was married to Podesta's daughter.  It seems to be false information. I posted it because, false conspiracy info is a distraction and can be used to discredit r/conspiracy readers.

       You made several good points that we need to focus on.
