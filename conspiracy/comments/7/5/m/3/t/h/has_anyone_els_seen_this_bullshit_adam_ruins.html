       This show is a huge disinformation campaign. Yes, some of the things he speaks of are true but they way he explains how people think is complete BS. Please watch it and judge for yourselves but this is ridicules that the show or episode is even being broadcasted.

       A true examination of the topic "conspiracy theory" has to admit that real conspiracies happen all the time. When "conspiracy theorists" are targeted the true meaning is people who think people in power are comitting crimes on a massive scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy has some excellent videos. He has demonstrated in the past strong reasoning and ability to research and break down a topic. Its his whole niche. He abandons all that makes his show to say people who dont believe the 911 comission report (good conspiracy theory) are mentally superior to people who question that (bad conspiracy theory). You can do that same scenario for Waco, Ruby Ridge, Garry Webb, the list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the same old trick of having someone smart feeding unaware people false information and telling them they are smart for believing it. Tried and trued method for manipulating people and it is very easy to spot once you know. Not saying that is in fact happening, but it is a very strong appearance and this caliber of a show wouldn't normally risk its reputation for such a weak case.

       Exactly my point he uses his credibility in other areas to make this seem credible. Ones people start believing in someone and their facts they usually wont question them after they have gained their trust. This is how the news and media have become trusted sources of news; anything they put out most people believe it is true.

       No not at all. Like i said some things he spoke of are true. That is why he used those topics as his center pieces, so that he cant be proven wrong. For example the moon landings; they definitely happened we just don't know the main causes other than "the space race". When people don't "speak good of conspiracy theories" a lot of times they are right depending on the information they give and the theory they speak off. The only problem with this is that most of the time people do not use facts (same thing goes for some conspiracies) when trying to prove them wrong. No body takes into account history and how things have been done in the past. You need to look at everything before you state something as a fact. You may say I didn't for this but when watching the show the only time he states a conspiracy theory maybe real is when he talks about people who actually research them to prove them right. Other wise he just goes on and on about how people think irrationally and cant form rational conclusions. Most people just want the truth and can see through bullshit that is why most theories are formed in the first place.

       Very true about how it is up to the individual. I am not claiming anything other than the fact that he deliberately attacked conspiracy theorists claiming were all don't think rationally. Yes, no one forced my I watched it to see what he said and what topics he discussed. I find it hard to believe that all theories are irrational and it is insulting to say that because most people that work hard to investigate are critical thinkers and just want the truth. Also going on about the individual, in order for some one to decide they need to be informed before making a conclusion.

       If he said that all conspiracy theorists don't think rationally, well, that's a generalization, and that's the kind of thing that loses credibility.

       Yes, i now that i look at it I should have said it shouldn't have been broadcasted with the information he gave out. Not that it shouldn't have at all. The information needs to be corrected then broadcasted.

       He was a former writer/editor (I think) at cracked.com. I bring this up becausr I noticed sometime earlier this year that they were continually posting articles taking shots at conspiracy theorists to the point that it was an article a week.

       It was between this, the fact the new writers suck, and some of their heavy handed sjw topics that I stopped going visiting the site.

       Some of his other episodes are interesting like the one about pure bred dogs, flushable wipes, diamond industry, death industry of funerals.. I think most of us here appreciate it as a controlled opposition attempt to wake people up to some degree
