        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I know this sub generally sticks to governmental and societal conspiracies, but does anyone here have any great sports conspiracy theories to share? </p>

<p>Some of my favorites are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Bobby Riggs rigging the “Battle of the sexes” match vs Billie Jean King
A lot of reputable sources say there was a huge sports gambling market for that match, and that Riggs was in with the mafia for that match and made tens of thousands of dollars off rigging the famous exhibition</p></li>
<li><p>Michael Jordan silent ban from the NBA over sports gambling
The story is allegedly that his fathers death may have been a result of sports gambling debts, and it’s no secret that MJ was a huge gambler himself. When he left the NBA abruptly and played baseball, it could have easily been a silent ban from the NBA due to illegal gambling. Jordan was basketball’s icon and a public ban would have damaged the League incredibly.</p></li>
<li><p>The frozen envelope in the NBA draft lottery w Patrick Ewing, and the rigging of draws in general.
Similar things have been brought to light, including the potential heating/freezing of lottery balls in the UEFA Champions League draws as well</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Add to the list</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mcgregor and Mayweather was scripted in that Mayweather didnt just knock him the fuck out early. Its a weak one that I dont blame anyone for. People knew what they were paying for.</p>

<p>Penn State and some other schools are as bad as the Catholic church. JoPa conveniently dies and the world is shown how sick the worship of sports institutuons are.</p>

<p>It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if genetic engineering has a bigger roll in athletics then we know about now.</p>

<p>That pro teams defraud the taxpayers of their cities.</p>

<p>NBA refs routinely bet on games. Playoff series are stretched out and follow a loose script to avoid anti-climax.</p>

<p>NFL hid head injury damage because they knew it would drive down viewership.</p>

<p>Pete Rose is just an animal and is eiyher sleeping or conspiring right now.</p>

<p>The East German womens olympic teams that starting growing penises and beards. They didnt know they were being given testosterone. The sick part is they were assigned mentors by the government. When the girls started questioning things they were reporting themselves to state security.</p>

<p>Halftime shows used to be the worlds biggest stage. Of course its staged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>McGregor-Mayweather definitely scripted.  There was really nothing at stake, not even ego.  They got paid the same either way.</p>

<p>The whole Penn State thing is sickening.  I think the program should have gotten the death penalty, but Penn State would have trouble existing without football.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t remember hearing that the East German women Olympic teams were being given testosterone without their knowledge.  For no good reason I just thought they knew.</p>

<p>Really, I agree with everything else, although I haven&#39;t looked into the genetic engineering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Super Bowl XVLII power outage in the 3rd quarter.  It was turning into a blowout, so someone decided to delay the game to give it some drama.</p>

<p>The NFL tried to hide for decades that concussions caused brain damage.  I guess that&#39;s not a theory anymore, though.</p>

<p>The New England Patriots.  They&#39;ve been caught cheating a few times, and I&#39;ve always thought there&#39;s probably been times they haven&#39;t been caught.  Plus there&#39;s a website called your team cheats, and the Pats are only #17 out of 32, and they give a lot of excuses for them, so I&#39;m pretty sure a Pats fan started that website.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dale Earnhardt Sr. was killed in a last lap crash during the Daytona 500 in February 2001.  The next race the series ran at Daytona in July 2001, Earnhardt Jr. won. Ultimate feel good story. At that track they have little metal plates that restrict the airflow into the engine which reduces horsepower. If someone were to have a little metal plate that didn&#39;t reduce the horsepower as much as everyone else it would be a huge advantage. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Super Bowl 36. Right after 9/11. Seemed completely rigged to bring unity to the country. I remember during the player intros, the Rams came out individually to be introduced. When it was the Patriots&#39; turn, they all came out as a team and the announcer exclaimed, &quot;and here come the Patriots as a team in their RED, WHITE, and BLUE!!&quot;. 
Also the pregame was all politicians telling us to unify.
The Patriots kicked the game winning field goal, and there was like 3-4 seconds left on the clock, but they just let it run down. 
When they won, they dropped tons of red white and blue balloons. I thought they probably didn&#39;t have another set of yellow and blue balloons up there in case the Rans won. 
Who knows, maybe I was just bitter </p>

<p>Sac up 3-2 in the series looking to clinch.  thanks to a ridiculous chain of awful calls in the 3rd and 4th quarter, including Mike Bibby of the Kings getting called for a foul when Kobe Bryant of the Lakers hit Bibby in the mouth, the Lakers hung in the game and won, forcing a game 7.</p>

<p>The game was so suspicious many sports talk shows the next day openly speculated either a fix or ref influence, which says something considering only sparingly will a fix be so openly suspected and discussed. </p>

<p>A couple of YouTube vids break down the key plays down the stretch that robbed Sacramento of a legitimate win and trip to the NBA finals. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not so much a conspiracy theory, but the PGA has a history of covering up star players drug use by allowing them to take a leave of absence rather than face a public suspension. Dustin Johnson is the key example here as he had a DUI, failed a marijuana test and failed a first cocaine test before they finally suspended him for the second coke infraction.</p>

<p>Also there&#39;s rumors Tiger Woods steroid was using steroids in 2009 in an effort to come back from the broken leg he suffered in the 2008 US Open, and the PGA knew it and this was the reason they never instated PED tests as originally planned.</p>
