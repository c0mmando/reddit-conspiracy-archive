       Ive always had doubts ive always tried to seek the truth, but nothing has ever made me this mad. It's fucking unnerving how much bullshit they are saying. When I try to search anything about this incident all I get is don't believe the hoaxes, false info being spread, etc etc. It makes me so incredibly angry. It's so obvious we aren't being told the truth, it's so obvious what went on is known by the government investigative teams involved yet they will not tell us. People died we absolutely deserve to know what they died for. This is bullshit. Sorry for ranting but I just don't understand why people aren't in a complete uproar over this.

       The reason why open governance is absolutely necessary is without, worse case scenarios are assumed true by those who lack need to know. It fundamentally catalyzes schizophrenia in the populace. This is inhumane.

       I wasn't pissed about it, until this service elevator thing came to light. Fucking Steve Wynn knew about that this past sunday. Now they're telling us exactly that? How the fuck did Steve Wynn know this before the rest of the public? These fucks are clearly hiding something and not telling us the full story.

       I think it's time for a march on Las Vegas Boulevard. Crowds of people should be shutting that mother fucker down for days at a time, until we get some fucking answers.

       Why not try to organise something like that? A march? Someone has to be the first to say hey let's organise a march or a sit in or something. I bet you'd get a lot of people, if social media sites didn't shut it down.

       Well yeah, the president casually threatened to shut down NBC and half of the country believes he's the underdog sent by God to destroy Israel's enemies and bring about revival (for reals, this is what is being preached and promoted in charismatic christian circles for the last 18 months).

       Charisma magazine is a magazine that has ties to charismatic evangelicals...whether they be nondenominational, assemblies of God, vineyard. There are dozens of similar articles that mimic the following below. In addition the international house of prayer movement in kansas city, along with church leaders of jesus radicals and bethel church in redding, california, have either personally prayed/blessed Trump in person or they've sent a representative. Maybe you don't hear that, but I run in church leadership circles and yes, most of the charismatic evangelical leaders in churches believe that Trump is going to bring revival and turn America around. I hate it. It's toxic theology. But it's absolutely being said.

       How about the big Soros short of MGM stock and Murren selling 80% of his holdings just prior? Espcially after a stock buyback to raise the price, then short and disinvest before the shooting??? Talk about someone knowing about this beforehand?

       Having hundreds of angry people trampling around a crime scene is really counterproductive to the investigation, including OURS. I appreciate your sentiment, but something like this will only shift the focus from the massacre itself.

       All of Las Vegas Boulevard is not a crime scene. And you say "trampling" as if a crowd of protesters would potentially be destroying some crucial evidence. If that were true, then that evidence would already be gone anyhow considering traffic and tourists have been "trampling" up and down Las Vegas Boulevard for a week now.

       Part of that is the fact that Google/YouTube have changed their algorithms, publicly, because they were "displaying too much" of the LV shooting conspiracy videos/content. Do your best to not be lividly angry or hateful at them, because that is what they want. Do not give them your negative thoughts and consciousness towards this mass tragic event- that is the intention. Instead, channel this rage into productivity- red pill your family and friends, research, post here and elsewhere! Do not give up to despair and hate, for that is exactly what they want.

       What do you need to be taught?  That the idea a government would willfully gas its own capitol is absurd?  Seems like it should be obvious, but then again the fact that not a single talking head on tv mentioned this point, on any network, also seems like it should lead to an obvious conclusion.

       Well for one, they said it was sarin gas. Then they repeatedly showed the same clip of a doctor cleaning up a screaming kid, over and over and over. Guess what: if it was sarin gas, the kid would be dead and so would the doctor, who didn't even have gloves on. Sarin is extremely lethal and kills in minutes. The whole idea that Assad would gas his own people, who he desperately needs their support, is absurdly stupid.

       Hate to busy your guys' bubble but it's super common for people to be able to access a service elevator in a casino. Hell, one of the elevators at the casino I work at is used by both employees and guests even though it has access to floors they have no business being on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now for a high limit player, they'll let them use any elevator they want. Although I see that changing in the future now.

       I love a good conspiracy but I don't see any evidence of one here. Paddock was a millionaire who'd gamble fourteen hours a day. Casinos will bend over backwards for a customer like that. The use of a service elevator is hardly a peculiar request.

       Why is their claim always definitively one shooter/acted alone in planning? I could see claiming you were investigating and couldn't comment, but to come out and say "he acted alone" before an investigation is carried out makes no sense.

       It's obvious, because it's suppose to be, it's another way to demonstrate their complete control over the population, armchair conspiracy theorists that understand, that see the lies, they still won't do anything, there's no attempt at organization, just posting bullshit on reddit and other forums, and generally being angry,  if you want something to change, then TAKE ACTION, take risks, ORGANIZE.

       I'm mostly morbidly interested in the entire event after it took place. This sub seems to be the only one left actually talking about it and using it as a place of discussion. I hate that it has to be labeled
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       when like minded individuals are just trying to search and push for more info on something I personally feel should be shared with the public. Sure there are some insane claims and threads on here but I really think there's more logical discussion than anything going on here. At this point I feel like this is going to be our generations OJ Simpson trial (except a dead suspect), it's going to be a while until we get some answers I fear.

       Smh. Do you have proof they didn't? Take ur happy ass to Vegas and tell someone who works the er it was fake. Walk ur ass up to a victims family and say that. The proof was the dead bodies laying on the ground. The blood on the er floor. Vegas isn't small town USA where u can pull a Sandy Hook and it not have an effect. Faking a shooting in Vegas directly hits the feds pocket book. Tourism goes down. Don't be an idiot.

       Yeah. Ur the one that is delusional. People died. I could say how I know and u would have a smart ass comment about that too. It has only been a week it is way to soon to see if there will be long tern effects. My source of those wounded or dead...friend is an ICU nurse at Sunrise.

       Exactly. Guess it would be odd for an RN to know other RN's in a city they frequent often? lol. I also know a UPS driver wooooo. You are pathetic. Unlike Sandy Hook... The families of the Vegas shooting have already started lawsuits against Vegas and the shooters estate. Guess that's fake too? So, basically ever mass causality event is fake huh? U don't believe people died on 9/11 either do you? You disgust me. 9/11 was a false flag. Sandy Hook I'm not sure which. But this... This happened.

       so Ill ask bc I remember the same things being said when the disgruntled former new reporter shot and killed the news reporter and cameraman in Smith Mountain Lake, Virginia.   Ive seen so many posts about it being faked, about it not being real, about them being actors or plants and all kinds of other stuff.  Truth is people did die that day.  The cameraman who was shot was the son of my principal in high school who now sometimes substitute teaches my son.  It was real.  His son is gone forever. He wasnt some FBI plant and any of the other crazy things Ive seen on here.  Its easy to believe things are fake and dont add up, but when they happen in your own town and involve people you know it makes things alot different.   Obviously this is just my take on a separate incident, but the similiarities of people making crazy claims without direct evidence is scary and can cause actual inaccuracies and lies to be looked over.

       You don’t buy the Vegas story or the Smith Mountain lake shooting?  If you’re talking about the one at the Lake, what it is that “ you don’t buy?”   I know this is in the conspiracy thread and obviously I know people have great drawn out theories about what happened that day, but I would like to know specifically what you believe is not real and what is your reasoning for what happened?  Furthermore what in this particular shooting at the lake would you want to see to believe it happened or wasn’t fake?
       <br/>
       There are plenty of things that happen every day that don’t make sense and don’t add up.  Does that mean all of them are some secret government psy op?  I don’t think so.   Some do and are completely entitled to their opinion.   I just don’t see what’s to gain from it on such a small scale.  Especially if your response is the take away our guns reasoning.  Hopefully you’ll take the time to respond  and expand further past the just not buying it.

       So because you don't have unfettered access to all the information you want a week after a tragedy, it's a huge conspiracy? Gimme a break.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Challenger exploded, would you have been outside NASA accusing them of a cover up because you weren't allowed into the room to join in the investigation?
      </p>
      <p>
       You DO not automatically have the right to examine the evidence in a criminal investigation. That is not evidence of a conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       What doesn't add up to the vast majority of people outside the USA is how so many people are happy to jump on the conspiracy bandwagon before even looking at the obvious fact that easy access to guns allows these things to happen. The levels of cognitive bias on display are ridiculous.

       Really? Not old enough to remember 911? Do some research on the moon landing, chemtrails, freemasons, GMO, fluoride, pedophilia,  the Nazis, you are lied to constantly, hopefully this one will be what wakes you up to the world around you and what  really is happening.

       I think a lot of us have been aware of the staggering atrocities the assholes in charge are responsible for. We're just not shocked. They did 911, they did countless wars and they continually do soft-kill eugenics on the whole population. Sadly, it's just numbing to a lot of folk after a while. But don't worry, i'm pissed. I'm pissed about all of it.

       All of Las Vegas Boulevard is not a crime scene. And you say "trampling" as if a crowd of protesters would potentially be destroying some crucial evidence. If that were true, then that evidence would already be gone anyhow considering traffic and tourists have been "trampling" up and down Las Vegas Boulevard for a week now.
