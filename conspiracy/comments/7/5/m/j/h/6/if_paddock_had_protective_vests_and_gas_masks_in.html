       Campos might have forced him to start his rampage sooner then he wanted. Might have felt like the police would be close. The door was behind him, when he was shooting was pretty vulnerable. The status of how well his cameras were working is unknown, especially after firing at Campos. Even if they were working perfectly, it would still be a chore to keep an eye on them. He couldn't shoot out his window and deal with the police/swat. Stopping shooting to deal w/ the police was a no win situation. Maybe he kills one officer? Two? The risk is he gets shot, doesn't die, and gets handed around prison like a lolipop at the kids birthday party for the rest of his life wasn't worth it. They were getting close, his rampage was over, he had no military training, he was 64, and any swat team in the country would eat his ass up.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if the police know he's still shooting out his window, they're not just going to sit in the hall. Whether it means one, two or three officers get shot, they're storming in to stop him. Shitty position for the first officer on the scene but you just can't let him rain down bullets on innocent people while you come up with a plan. The only reason they did wait was because the shooting stopped. Had it not stopped, police would have been forced to storm in much sooner (and I have no question they would, they saw what was going on outside).

       Agreed with the killing yourself over being a prison lollipop ðŸ˜‚. Still wondering why have all the protective gear and not use it. More questions than answers as usual.

       He wouldn't even need to kill himself tho...

       The chances of him being taken alive with that amount of ammo is unlikely.

       How long does a kevlar vest take to put on properly out of curiousity?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can anyone think of any reasons he had the vests but chose not to use them? Are they really restrictive on your movement etc, the weight of them, i just cant see why even if interrupted by Campos he wouldn't have thrown a vest on.

       I watched a couple videos and it looks like it takes 30 seconds. Maybe a minute the first time you ever wear it to get the proper fit. Didn't seem awkward once you had it adjusted correctly. That was my question, why have all this equipment and not use it? Hoping someone else has an idea why.

       Good luck figuring that out, i've spent many nights with bong in hand trying to figure out why he stopped shooting, why wasn't wearing vest, how he planned on using the car with tannerite , why he believed he could explode those tanks (he was a pilot and intelligent, he would have had a lot of knowledge regarding jet fuel and it's ability to explode or ignite.

       For the same reason he didn't use tracer rounds on the airplane fuel tanks? He was rushed by security guard Jesus Campos?

       Is Jesus Campos the dead security guard?

       Was Paddock shot by a police officer and then Paddocked offed himself in the mouth?
