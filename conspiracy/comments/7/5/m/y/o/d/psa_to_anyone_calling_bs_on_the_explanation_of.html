<p>He typed them into his phone and it spit out the results and he wrote down the ones he cared about on that paper.</p>

<p>Maybe a silly question but i have no knowledge of massive tanks or jet fuels ability to ignite or incendiary rounds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok but again. Let&#39;s think this through. If he has no gun knowledge numbers wouldn&#39;t mean to much. Also when you have moving targets all your calculations go to shit. It really wouldn&#39;t be useful. The real question is if he had so many guns why is he reloading and taking more then a minute each time? I mean you have tons of guns grab another and go. Or grab a clip and go. Should take no more then 20 seconds and he&#39;s off killing again. You don&#39;t see all the guns in the photo. Which that in itself seems odd since you would want them close assuming your trying to get as many people as you can. And minimize reload times.( You want to keep the people in bigger groups)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>-I would say that someone with even the most rudimentary gun understanding, especially a lockheed engineer or whatever, he wasn&#39;t stupid, would be able to create and employ a drop chart. I don&#39;t want to say much more than that, but even without a tracking point it&#39;s <em>really</em> easy these days with little knowledge to get on target at 800 yards with a 308 within 3 shots just by filling in the blanks.</p>

<p>-Calculations don&#39;t go to shit, they give you a +/- window large enough if you started off right to increase your hit percentage whether people are running towards, away, or sideways from you.</p>

<p>-I agree that 3-4 guns max and multiple mags and if he didn&#39;t want to pause, we&#39;re talking &lt;10 seconds between volleys. I don&#39;t know enough to comment on that, but he could have been pausing to listen to police scanners etc, can&#39;t rule anything out or make too many assumptions.</p>
