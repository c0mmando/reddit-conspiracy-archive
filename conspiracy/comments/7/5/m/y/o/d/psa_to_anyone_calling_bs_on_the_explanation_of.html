       Not saying that this was in fact what was on the note, but,
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people that have shot past 100 yards would instantly recognize the numbers as being the calculated answers for the amount of drop at his (reasonable short) distance, and instantly recognize which unit of measure they were in. Calculated by him on that paper? No. In his head? No.
      </p>
      <p>
       He typed them into his phone and it spit out the results and he wrote down the ones he cared about on that paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only bringing this up see I've seen people thinking this is crazy when really it is perfectly likely and expected from someone with any knowledge or research or practice at longer ranges.

       Hit shot distance wouldn't have a noticeable drop, and he certainly wouldn't have cared as he was spraying anyways. The note wasn't calculations.

       Agreed.  Drop tables are used for precision shooting.   Not spray and pray with a rapid fire AR.

       That's even assuming he accurately replicated exact 10 round/sec fire for 100 bullets, out of a bump-stock AR-15. On the first try.

       Significant drop for the crowd, no, but noticeable yes, if he did want to aim tighter than spray and pray, and weren't the tanks quite a bit further out? They could have been for that or other targets.
      </p>

       The note wasn't calculations is my point, if it was a dope card, those don't have calculations, just answers.

       Wasn't up to date on that part, just always figured the note was something political, and that no matter what it was we'd never be told the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had just informed a few people in other in other threads that dope charts don't include calculations....hence my post out of a little bit of frustration that so many call bs on something they know nothing about.

       One thing I think you should consider is that you should actually read the stories they are posting about the shooting. Not one of them has a named or credible source, all are slamming Paddock. Something is wrong.

       This is a bullshit story if you know how a fucking fuel tank works. Fuel tanks don't explode if rounds hit them like in the movies. Also it's pretty convenient the sources are unnamed "people that were briefed on the case but not allowed to talk". That whole story reeks of anti-rifle Paddock slamming propaganda.

       Would it really not explode or even ignite with incendiary rounds??
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe a silly question but i have no knowledge of massive tanks or jet fuels ability to ignite or incendiary rounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the shooter was incredibly intelligent and a pilot so i would have assumed he'd have calculated whether it was possible..

       I read it but i thought " Of course they would say it can't happen because they wouldn't want copycats succeeding" .. mythbusters reckons it can't because of the lack of oxygen in a tank like that so the evidence is suggesting the air companies are right..

       It's not like in the movies. The LVPD and gov't are attacking the intelligence of the people by saying this shit. Only less involved and less intelligent people will swallow up the "exploding tanks" story as a danger. It wouldn't have been in any scenario. It also would have been way too far to hurt anyone, but no one seems to give a shit about that.

       To be fair you don't need to know a lot to have software do all the work for you. To not know that bullets drop at all would be a special kind of stupid.

       But would it? If your thinking of just shooting and killing I highly doubt your thinking numbers. And if he doesn't know much about guns the number won't help the second you pull the trigger. Seems really fishy

       As the crowd split up (much later than would have been nice...) if he wanted that last pack of 8 running away he would have wanted to know lead with width of the dot and a half, hold over of 2.5 dots or similar.

       If it really was a drop chart, anyone with any intelligence could figure out what his targets were and with which gun, as long as he input the data correctly.

       I was just saying any "but no calculations!" thoughts are wildly off from how it would work if, I repeat if, it was in fact holdovers/shooting solutions.

       Ok but again. Let's think this through. If he has no gun knowledge numbers wouldn't mean to much. Also when you have moving targets all your calculations go to shit. It really wouldn't be useful. The real question is if he had so many guns why is he reloading and taking more then a minute each time? I mean you have tons of guns grab another and go. Or grab a clip and go. Should take no more then 20 seconds and he's off killing again. You don't see all the guns in the photo. Which that in itself seems odd since you would want them close assuming your trying to get as many people as you can. And minimize reload times.( You want to keep the people in bigger groups)

       -I would say that someone with even the most rudimentary gun understanding, especially a lockheed engineer or whatever, he wasn't stupid, would be able to create and employ a drop chart. I don't want to say much more than that, but even without a tracking point it's
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       easy these days with little knowledge to get on target at 800 yards with a 308 within 3 shots just by filling in the blanks.

       -Calculations don't go to shit, they give you a +/- window large enough if you started off right to increase your hit percentage whether people are running towards, away, or sideways from you.
      </p>
      <p>
       -I agree that 3-4 guns max and multiple mags and if he didn't want to pause, we're talking &lt;10 seconds between volleys. I don't know enough to comment on that, but he could have been pausing to listen to police scanners etc, can't rule anything out or make too many assumptions.

       Police said in radio interview today he used many guns and of different calibers, many jammed on him and apparently he just tossed them and grabbed another..
Also the adjoining bedroom was setup solely for use of a single shot rifle aimed towards the tanks and needed that room for vantage point of airpoint and tanks.

       They've gone from saying it's a range card, to someone saying numbers, possibly phone numbers...
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the reports of video cameras, and (possibly less credible) reports that he was streaming video overseas, I wonder if they could be ip addresses that some people have misinterpreted... 🤔

       That would be a stretch, unless the person misinterpreting them is moronic.
      </p>
      <p>
       A range card would look like 1/2/1.5/2.2/2.9 etc or x3.6 those if he used moa, and ip numbers aren't in numerical order at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the flip side is the range card/dope chart, if true, sure wasn't for the guns with eotech red dots on them.

       Agreed.  Drop tables are used for precision shooting.   Not spray and pray with a rapid fire AR.

       Significant drop for the crowd, no, but noticeable yes, if he did want to aim tighter than spray and pray, and weren't the tanks quite a bit further out? They could have been for that or other targets.

       The note wasn't calculations is my point, if it was a dope card, those don't have calculations, just answers.
