        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Larry Campos - employed by CSC security is friends with mostly other security guards. EDIT: CSC is first to receive <a href="http://www.csc-usa.com/">Homeland Security certification</a> for private security at sporting events.</p>

<p>Most of them posted <a href="https://imgur.com/a/cB6I8">this memorial</a> on their profiles to honor the death of their boss and friend from CSC, a Mr. Chiedu Onwughalu, who died a day after the &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; concert was over on Sept 26th at 10:30pm, that was held <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/7981988/route-91-harvest-festival-history">AT SAME PLACE AS ROUTE 91 HARVEST!!!</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/ChiOnwughaluFund">&quot;...a freak solo car accident on the 15 freeway.  After working the past few days at the “Life is Beautiful” festival as a event security  manager in Las Vegas, Nevada, Chiedu Onwughalu was on his way home to see his family when the accident occurred about 10:30 p.m.&quot;</a></p>

<p>The &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot; venue was the same as the &quot;Route 91 Harvest&quot; ... <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/7981988/route-91-harvest-festival-history">&quot;The space has also hosted the iHeartRadio Festival&#39;s Daytime Village, as well as the 48 Hours Festival, Warped Tour and parts of the Life is Beautiful Festival over the past several years.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Larry (Jesus) Campos&#39; girlfriend is <a href="https://imgur.com/a/CoPqx">Adriana Lopez</a>. <strong>COULD THIS POSSIBLY BE THIS THE WOMAN WHO MADE THE PREDICTION THAT &quot;THEY WERE ALL GOING TO DIE TONIGHT?&quot;</strong></p>

<p>My theory:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Perhaps Campos and his CSC buddies are still in mourning over the loss of their beloved boss and friend Chiedu Onwughalu. Something could have gone down with the massacre venue and Vegas in general that they think caused their friend&#39;s death.</p></li>
<li><p>In September of last year, Mr. Onwughalu worked the concert that ended the 25th of Sept. Something made him stay behind another day since in the gofundme they make a point to say <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/ChiOnwughaluFund">&quot;he would regularly head out the minute that his responsibilities
were over to get back to his family as he was doing on Monday night when this tragic accident occurred. &quot;</a></p></li>
<li><p>The death must have really hurt the tight knit group of security guards at CSC since they put together a memorial FB image and started a gofundme page raising almost $50,000.  They said.... &quot;As Chiedu’s co-workers at CSC, who also had the privilege of being his friends, we are asking everyone that was ever touched by Chiedu’s life to help us help his family as they grieve the loss of an incredible man and adjust to a new life without their husband and father.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Could they have set out to avenge a death of their colleague, and perhaps kill supporters of the President assuming the sentiment within this tight knit latin community mirrors that of the rest of the population right now???</p></li>
<li><p>Possibly Campos is up there on the hall working for CSC not the hotel. Maybe he&#39;s with the venue security, but he could have been part of this and made up the whole story as cover.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps the other CSC guards conspire with Campos and set up a gun buy with Paddock?  Maybe they take either drug Paddock or overtake him when the rest of the CSC guards / conspirators charge the room to steel the guns?</p></li>
<li><p>Could it have been the CSC guards - maybe about 6-10 of them - who fan out across the city with their automatic weapons?</p></li>
<li><p>That&#39;s probably why there are so many people who say they saw &quot;police&quot; shooting people, that there were multiple shooters across the city and that there is video of what looks like a security guard shooting into the crowd at the venue.  </p></li>
<li><p>AND that&#39;s probably why there&#39;s no video released yet!!! Because the security guards could all be identified on fzuck boook with their profiles still up as well as their state licensing board page with their names.</p></li>
<li><p>LAST and this is a key detail from before I just couldn&#39;t figure out. <strong>THE WEIRD CHARGER</strong> is not a spy device... <strong>It&#39;s for vaping</strong>.....  and guess who is absolutely obsessed with vaping?....</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>There are more logical reason as to why this man was there then there are illogical ones like your suggesting. One that comes to mind, maybe the security were contracted to cover the event and hotels.

    <div class="md"><p>If it was just a bunch of disgruntled security guards, I don&#39;t think the attack would have been so coordinated and the investigation so secretive. Not to mention the motive...i mean, why on earth would a bunch of security guards plan a mass murder because their friend and boss died in a car accident? None of what you are proposing makes any sense to me...</p>

<p>My theory is trying to tie Campos to this since it makes no sense that he hasn&#39;t been put in front of 60 min or Matt Laurer etc. </p>

<p>What would &quot;Trigger&quot; a group of &quot;Event Security&quot; people to kill? Wow it is hard to imagine.</p>

<p>But then tell me why an <strong>event security company</strong> employee who works for the first homeland security certified event company is in the hotel investigating a &quot;door ajar alarm?&quot;</p>

<p>Campos was working for CSC managing security for the event, not the hotel. He would not have had a direct communication channel with hotel security. So when or how or who was alerted by Campos after the shooting? </p>

<p>Why was Campos in the hotel investigating a &quot;door ajar alarm&quot;? And </p>

<p>Why was a vaping charger found in Paddock&#39;s room?</p>
