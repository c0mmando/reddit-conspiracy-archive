        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">205</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-11 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/lylagarrity.html">lylagarrity</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am not sure where I am going with this or what it implies. I think my kneejerk reaction is that this is from an opportunist trying to cash in on the shooting somehow by using Jesus&#39;s name but given how truly odd this entire case is becoming I think we should add this to the pile of &quot;WTF?&quot;</p>

<p>Here is a list of oddities and discoveries that I&#39;ve found from doing some heavy digging today</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Lilliana Rodriguez is the creater of the gofundme account, &quot;Lilly&quot; for short. Last night when I checked on the fundraiser, her avatar must have been pulled from her facebook page. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3Eo5I">The avatar is gone right now</a> as is whatever facebook she was using (i literally clicked on about 200 Lilliana / Liliana / Lilianna / Lilly / Lily Rodriguez&#39;s in Nevada and the US and found no one.)...Her username on gofundme.com also claims to not be Facebook verified.</p></li>
<li><p>I went through the donations and she did not donate to this campaign herself. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s common but I thought it was worth noting</p></li>
<li><p>I found her twitter account (don&#39;t want to post here and break rules) which was created September 2017, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ifCZc">has no avatar photo</a>, only follows 4 people, and has only shared things related to the Las Vegas shooting, as well as replies to everyone like The Ellen Show and the Las Vegas Golden Knights with the link to her gofundme. It struck me as odd that her first tweet seemingly ever was on 9/22, only one week prior to the shootings.</p></li>
<li><p>The gofundme itself is void of actual details, said he was shot &quot;on random patrol&quot; and includes absolutely zero photos of Jesus</p></li>
<li><p>One of the people she follows on Twitter who seems to be her boyfriend bears a striking resemblance to the one photo that we did get of Jesus, less a few pounds. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/O5JkJ">judge for yourself</a>...his name is not Jesus according to Twitter. </p></li>
<li><p>His twitter is mostly likes of football and other sports but the night of the shooting 10/1 he begins @ replying to Lilly the news stories, almost as if they are concocting their plan</p></li>
<li><p>The only person who follows both this man and Lilly (and they both follow him back) is a guy who I added on Facebook and can confirm is an actual Security Officer at the Mandalay Bay since 2014.</p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;security certificate&quot; of Jesus Campos listed that he was hired 6/15/17, so him and this guy were probably not the best of friends, but i am still struggling to find a link between Jesus and these two people - and they out of all of the people in &quot;Jesus&quot;&#39;s life such as his family, would not be the ones doing this fundraiser for him. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>*I emailed both Lilly via gofundme to say I wanted to make a sizeable donation but would only feel comfortable if she could provide some kind of authentication and gofundme directly to see exactly how they know this is not a fraudulent fundraiser.</p>

<p>Is it possible the security officer has enough intel to know whether or not the Jesus story was BS and tipped his friends off to an easy payday knowing the authorities would never come out and claim that&#39;s not their guy?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what to think exactly but I just did some digging today and wanted to share!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OMG how did you find that. Now I&#39;m embarrassed. It confirms the twitter is hers that I found because she follows Game of Thrones and Jon Snow. Why no shares about the fundraiser if she&#39;s managed to get $36k so far. I just find it so bizarre. Twitter is strictly fundraiser, completely silent on Facebook. </p>

The reason she got this much is b/c damn news sites kept linking the GoFund me in their articles.</p>

<p>bthw, this is the REAL Lily, I believe, who probably has no idea (or maybe does, who knows):

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m with ya, I spent a couple hours last night and it&#39;s frustrating trying to dig up info. One item of potential interest is that the SPFPA is listed as (by far) the biggest donor on the GoFundMe page ($5,000). So that doesn&#39;t confirm anything by itself, but does seem to indicate that the SPFPA believed the GoFundMe page was legit.</p>

<p>I find this incredibly strange. Why would they be donating $5k to him? Mandalay Bay should foot all his medical expenses and give paid time off for an injury sustained on the job, in their hotel, in a massively high-profile incident. $5k will not cover that, not to mention they wouldn&#39;t be paying his expenses via GoFundMe. Can you verify that it&#39;s the legit SPFPA?</p>

<p>I do think that GoFundMe need to look into this fundraiser page though, because it would make my piss boil to know that somebody was using this as an opportunity to rip people off.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lily&#39;s campaign is tagged &quot;Medical&quot; and says: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am raising funds to assist Jesus Campos *<em>a co-worker</em>&quot;, that was injured during the tragic Las Vegas shooting. Unfortunately he was shot  while on random patrol.</p>

<p>Funds will be used to <strong>provide relief and financial support for him while he gets back on his feet</strong>. This is <strong>a young man that I work with day in and day out</strong>. Any financial support would be appreciated for the time he would need to recover. <strong>Any one of us could have been in the position he was in</strong>. Most importantly we are a home away from home and *<em>at the end of the day we are a team and we should all go home together</em>&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second campaign, which I linked to in my previous comment, is tagged &quot;Emergencies&quot; and says: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Encore Event Technologies is <strong>the AV partner to Mandalay Bay</strong>. Mandalay Bay Security Guard Jesus Campos, <strong>our fellow employee</strong> was shot and injured when he interrupted the shooter during the horrific events that occurred on October 1st, 2017. </p>

<p>This campaign is <strong>for Encore employees to have a specific place to make a contribution</strong> knowing that 100% of the funding will go directly to Jesus. Your voluntary donation is greatly appreciated as Encore honors him for his bravery and heroism.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr/>

<p>Okay, so:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They&#39;re both from alleged Mandalay Bay employees who emphasize that they&#39;re his colleagues and praise JC&#39;s heroic on-the-job actions. </p></li>
<li><p>They&#39;re raising money for his medical bills and getting him back on his feet financially. </p></li>
<li><p>The second one is specifically crowdfunding donations from fellow employees. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>This makes Mandalay Bay look like shit. Do they not take care of their own employees?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say everything actually went down the way the way they&#39;re saying it good. Jesus Campos was injured on the job, performing his job, at his place of employment (Mandalay Bay). He&#39;s completely innocent and followed proper protocol to notify central security and the police, and he even saved a fellow employee&#39;s life. Why wouldn&#39;t the Mandalay Bay be covering his medical expenses and paid medical leave? Why would the hotel&#39;s employees need to crowdfund assistance from fellow employees for one of their own? I mean, maybe if it wasn&#39;t a public-facing incident, the MB would be quick to skirt the bill, but with an event <em>this</em> high-profile, how can they not cover all of his shooting recovery expenses?</p>

<p>It would be one thing if his family was running one of his GoFundMe campaigns, but BOTH campaigns are from fellow co-workers. </p>

<p>Definitely fishy...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what it&#39;s worth, recognizing facial expressions and facial features is something I&#39;ve always had a knack for, and I&#39;m convinced these two pictures are of the same person.  </p>

<p>I wish we had a clear picture of the ears, as that would pretty much prove it, but what we do see of the ears matches up.  Both have detached earlobes. Everything about the pictures looks like the same person.  Second pic is more clean shaven, especially the chin and each side of the mustache, but you can see where the hair is starting to grow and it matches the first pic below the bottom lip and to the left of the mustache connecting the beard.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s no hair growing in the center of the mustache, directly above the center of the top lip.  In the second pic its also bare in that spot.  The eyebrows are the same shape.  In both pictures, the eyebrows are further apart than the center of the eyes are.  Also, in both pics, the inside of the right eyebrow (his left) is further from the inside of the right eye than the inside of the left eyebrow compared to inside of left eye.</p>

<p>On both pictures, the skull bulges out above the ears.  This is pretty unique.  The eyes are exactly the same.  The papillary distance is pretty narrow on both pictures for a man with a head that size.   </p>

<p>In the left picture you can barely make out the larger of the two moles, in the exact spot it should be.</p>

<p>I&#39;m convinced these two pictures are of the same guy.  If that&#39;s true than you&#39;ve made a hell of a discovery.</p>

<p>A google image search of Jesus Campos also shows a guy wearing a suit, who is clearly not this guy.  I think if Campos is a real person, then its likely that guy in the suit.  But this guy you posted is definitely this chick&#39;s boyfriend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy crap. Loomer is good. </p>

<p>As for the contents of the note, I think it&#39;s absolute bullshit. I don&#39;t see any plausible reason that he&#39;d need to make any calculations at all, because the mode of fire doesn&#39;t necessitate them. Based on measurements I acquired from Mandalay&#39;s wikipedia page and using a mapping program, I determined the distance from window to the venue to be approximately 365m. At this distance, the round drop would be negligible; mere inches. I don&#39;t know about the wind speed at the time, but worst case scenario, he&#39;d only have to fire &#39;half a target&#39; to the left or right of a person. The rounds would still have enough momentum to maintain their trajectory. Since he was firing into a crowd, it really didn&#39;t matter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lips are completely different, the boyfriend guy has a noticeable cupids bow and &quot;Jesus&quot; has almost no cupids bow. In addition boyfriends lips are almost the same length top and bottom whereas Jesus has a smaller, fuller upper lip and an underbite. </p>

<p>Hairline is different, Jesus has a widows peak and boyfriend has a straight hairline. Their noses are completely different, boyfriend has  a wider flatter nose than Jesus. Eyebrows are completely different and I was even trying to figure out how Jesus could have maybe shaped boyfriends brows to look like his current brows. It maybe could happen but Jesus has much fuller brow hairs than boyfriend--it&#39;s not possible without microblading, which still may not allow for the obvious arches on the top of Jesus&#39;s brows. </p>

<p>Also, they have different hair types and different beard hair types. </p>

<p>They aren&#39;t the same guys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very nice work with only couple of pictures of Campos!</p>

<p>My question is, who is Antonio Castelan and why is he the only one posting pictures of Jesus Campos on his <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/AntonioNews3LV/status/916429153729048576">Twitter</a>. He barely has any followers but yet the Polaroid picture was shared from him.</p>

<p>The picture you found in comparison with the released photo of Campos is totally him.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still confused with the Gofundme account part. With these kind of &quot;crisis&quot;, I always think the Gofundme donations are what pays these actors out especially what happened with the Pulse Nigh club incident. But say it is fraudulent and the pictures aren&#39;t even the real security guard, then there has to be people responsible for spreading bullshit links like Antonio Castelan. </p>

<p>Anyways, nice finds though! Gotta praise your persistence. Keep up the great work!</p>
