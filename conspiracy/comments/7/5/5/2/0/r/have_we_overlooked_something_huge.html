       Who was the adjoining room registered to?

      <p>
       Australian Brian Hodge said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He said police told him the gunman was in the room 32135, just one room away from his hotel room. "I'm room 32134 so I'm just so glad I didn't make it back to my room," he said.

       We've been assuming this whole time that Paddock rented the adjoining room. This room is where the first shots were fired from!  How the hell did Paddock get in this room to break the window and begin firing?! How is Brian Hodge not being interrogated, if the first shots came from his room?!
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is he mistaken about his room number?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or is this guy a pathological liar?
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we crowd source to see if there are any news articles that definitively say whose name room 134, the adjoining room where the window was broken, was under?
      </p>
      <p>
       Btw: Here's visual confirmation that the adjoining room where shots were fired from and the window broken
       <strong>
        is
       </strong>
       134:

       No but I might be blending two stories together. There was one guy who claimed to be in the room next to the shooter, and then it came to light that a.) He was on a different floor, and b.) He wasn't even in the hotel during the shooting. Trying to find it...

       She had the cell phone for that random charger in his room.  She monitored the baby monitors in an app on her phone and transmitted it.  Thats why the conflicting early reports about recording, broadcasting, etc

       Because I think this woman or someone had the phone that goes to that second charger they found in Paddock's room.  Somebody was monitoring the footage from and adjoining or neqrby room probably.  All the people on that floor need to be identified

       Surefire is a brand of flashlight that we were issued in the military. I don't know what voltage their batteries are, but they are a weird size and you can get generic ones that size but they suck. Surefire batteries are what go in your flashlight and nods(night vision) though.

       Sometimes hotels split the rooms in a hallway by even and odd numbers. Not saying this is the case with Mandalay, but I've stayed in quite a few hotels that had even numbers down one hall and odd numbers down another.

       I believe that was another commenter who mentioned the charger. And I'm pretty sure there were early reports that made it sound like they'd located his gf in Vegas before they started saying she was in the Philippines. I'm totally up to date on all the latest news, believe me

       I think he might have actually been the room across from the adjoining room. It could still be considered next door, but isn't the one with the inside door. The daily mail article directly makes it sound like he was in the adjoining room, but that could have been the writer's misunderstanding

       I stayed at mandalay back in may (25th floor i think). Adjecent rooms were laid out even one side, odd other side. For some reason that stuck out at me, as i was attending a show at the mandalay convention center and kept going back to my room a few times a day.

       Yep, definitively think so. Like someone else said, some people can consider being across as right next door as well. That makes sense too because i remember i was in an even number room and had a poolside view.

       How about video of the room?  I posted this earlier in the thread, but I will copy and paste:
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at this video of room 32-135:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0DluEQvs6I">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0DluEQvs6I

       You can see this starting at 0:42: clearly, there are three windows to the south of that pillar, followed by the concrete support.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://mgtvwkrn.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/ap_17275498021240.jpg">

       </a>
       The window broken was to the south of the concrete support in room 32-134. Either Brian Hodge is a liar, or he was letting Paddock use his room. The room service cart has a video camera on it, with a wire going into room 32-134.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brian Hodge even said the swat blew the door off his room. His room was used to shoot from! Add "brianahodge" to the end of a FB URL to see his profile.

       Look at this video of room 32-135:

       You can see this starting at 0:42: clearly, there are three windows to the south of that pillar, followed by the concrete support.
      </p>

       The window broken was to the south of the concrete support in room 32-134. Either Brian Hodge is a liar, or he was letting Paddock use his room. The room service cart has a video camera on it, with a wire going into room 32-134.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brian Hodge even said the swat blew the door off his room. His room was used to shoot from! Add "brianahodge" to the end of a FB URL to see his profile.

       The window in 135 appears much more haphazardly broken than in 134 as well.  134 was where the real shooting took place from.

       I think so, too.  There is a picture out there, taken during the shooting, where the window in 134 is clearly seen broken, and 135 is not broken.  Paddock was found dead near the 135 window.  This leads me to think that the picture with only 1 broken window was taken while Paddock was switching rooms and broke the 135 window later in the 11 minute rampage.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also shows that he was the lone shooter.  I am not convinced that he was the only one involved, though.

       How would this rule out more than 1 shooter? One shooter at a time maybe but it doesn't mean he was all alone or that he was the shooter.

       I think they would not be shooting from the same window at the same time.  I think the first window (134) was used to try to get the fuel tanks and the crowd.  However, the angle on the crowd was obscured by the stage, so as people started to scatter, he wanted to get a better angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing to consider is that maybe he broke into 134.  At some point, Paddock moved from 134 to 135, but he closed the doors between the rooms.  Perhaps he wanted to prevent the SWAT from breaking into 134 and coming in from the side.
      </p>
      <p>
       While you are correct that there may have been a second person, and they were taking turns shooting, I just find it hard to believe.  If they wanted to cause max mayhem, they would have shot at the same time.  I think alot of what was heard were echoes.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these weird conspiracies aside (shooters in the crowd, coverup at the Bellagio, etc, etc), the only thing that anyone SAW was shooting coming from the 32nd floor.  What people thought they heard is up to each individual.

       Have they released any photos from 134? maybe there's wayyyy more brass left in that room to support the amount of ammo expended...

       After looking at several sources I think he is consistent too.  I don’t think this guy is involved, but I’m open to the fact I could be wrong.  I still want to know if his was the adjoining room to the shooter. Everyone assumes that was numbered as 24 - making it his room. Can someone show me an article or floor plan that says the adjoining room was numbered 24?

       Thank you!  Well that just leaves me with more questions. Interesting that he never mentions being questioned by police. You’d think that he would be at least questioned at some point. I have a hard time seeing this guy involved, but if that was his room then how did Paddock gain access?  Stolen key card, inside hotel help, or did this guy allow him access?
