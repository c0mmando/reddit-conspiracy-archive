        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Awhile ago on the front page, there was some study that was showing that a driving factor in what we believe to be true, is our perception of what the majority of others believe to be true. I believe this is why there are no longer comment sections on sites such as msn.com or in my case, our online local newspaper. It seemed more and more comments were starting to question whatever flavor of bullshit was being served up. And since we rely ( whether consciously or subconsciously ) on what others believe to be true, they had to get rid of that little shadow of doubt that could be created by scrolling through the comments of people with conflicting info/opinions. While not a groundbreaking post, I thought it was interesting that there was always comment sections up to semi recently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A few years ago, almost every website had a comment section, and I always went straight to it. Slowly, all comments started having many jerks come in and say rude, insulting comments, literally attacking people. I knew it was fake then, and it is now obvious that it was done by paid shills, to censor people wanting to talk.</p>

<p>I find it disturbing that even local news hired people to attack others. Where do these people come from, on a smaller scale? My guess is that ghetto telemarketing firms are involved, but I don&#39;t have proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always assumed they were real people. But it could be all comment sections were targeted in this way nationwide.  Seems like a lot of work!  Much of the local media is now chain owned. If a few of the companies decide to end it a lot of websites would be affected at once.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does seem like a lot of work, and a lot of people willing to try to destroy free speech, for probably few dollars. As a creative person, I enjoyed hearing other people&#39;s true thoughts about interesting articles, and still do. It is very obvious people are not allowed to talk about what is going on. Now, we are expected to just listen. No</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i think when the smith mundt act was repealled a few years ago that kind of green lighted more propaganda.  If that is what is going on you cant have the comments sections blowing that effort apart.  Kind of like when a big politician tweets you get the immediate rebuttal on the other side.  Alot of these old media companies would rather have it the old way-  here is your news...you can write us letters about it.... We might publish a few of them.  And now it seems youtube google etc have gone all in on censoring and demonitizing.  Its a little shocking to say the least!  Who knows where the internet will be in a few years.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know that for smaller papers they do not want to pay someone to clean up constant spam.  And check threads for abuse.  In our case -  smallish size town in Texas -  the comments were the best part but often they would get abusive- libelous sometimes.  Also if the paper is pro on a stance - like economic investment to grow a city- and the comments are ripping them a new one - they are not a big fan of that I am sure.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the contribution. While I also don&#39;t agree/like with some of the hurtful/down right fucked up things people say, they have the right to say it. Censoring things because they might offend/hurt peoples feelings is a very slippery slope that has no easy way back, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Craigslist rants and raves is an excellent example of why everyone shouldn&#39;t have a sponsored voice. It&#39;s that, but everywhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In our case we had a group of trolls that were against almost everything.  I’m sure they were real people.  Just liked being able to criticize people while being anonymous.  I used to like the wsj comments but it has become the same people going back and forth with their political agendas.  Waste of time now I think.  </p>

<p>Daily Mail UK hated  anti-Clinton or anti Trump commenters questioning the primary/caucuses legitimacy &amp; started shadow banning those types of commenters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>also with imdb. not allowing comments on websites will of course lead to less people viewing said sites. But the corporations seem to care more about forming a narrative than making money. </p>
