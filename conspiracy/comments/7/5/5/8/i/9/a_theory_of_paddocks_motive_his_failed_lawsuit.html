        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We&#39;ve been told Paddock was wealthy, yet in 2011 he enters into a lawsuit against a Casino for a slip and fall event.  He fails at proving the Casino to be negligent.  </p>

<p>I have been reviewing the Hotel liability laws.  Is it possible that Paddock was attempting to create a huge negligence verdict against the Casino? </p>

<p>A summary of those laws and regulations can be found here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/law/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hotel-liability">http://www.encyclopedia.com/law/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hotel-liability</a></p>

<p>If the room was comped, from a legal stand point, the Casino would be a bit more open to liability.  How much would the hotel stand to lose in lawsuits brought by the families of those that died?  How much for the 500+ injuries?</p>

<p>Yes, his lawsuit was with a different casino... but what was his mindset in entering into that suit to begin with?  If he had it out for the Casino, his background as an accountant might point to a financial angle in his motive.</p>

<p>He couldn&#39;t win his lawsuit, maybe this was one way to get back at them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes the truth is the most basic and logical explanation. I don&#39;t feel like we need a crazy &quot;I converted to Islam&quot; motive. Sometimes people aren&#39;t right in the head and what compels them to commit such atrocities is never truly known. Their reality is almost always skewed and even without an official mental diagnosis&#39;, they most certainly have a mental disorder. Mentally sound people don&#39;t obsess over mass murders and definitely don&#39;t take it a step further to actually act it out. I guess what I am trying to say is I truly believe people can be sick and demented to a point where they can flip out over even a small catalyst such as losing a lawsuit. </p>
