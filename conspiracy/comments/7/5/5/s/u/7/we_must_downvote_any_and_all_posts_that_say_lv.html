       And that is why I say what I say, because we all should be seeking that, no matter what. How can we find the truth if we declare what can and cannot be talked about. OP has a lot of nerve coming on here (of all places) and posting that. Which immediately seems suspicious as fuck, imo.

       As I read this I’m automatically making generalizations- “well duh it’s a country music festival of course a lot of attendees are gonna fit a certain profile.” Then my brain starts to do the thing- Think- even so it’s odd that such high ranking officials were the victims. 
Now I do have a family friend who has in attendance and she was unharmed- and is completely traumatized. I cannot believe the hoax angle because of that. Red flag absolutely believable. It’s just dumbfounding how if it was an orchestrated attack that there are so many unanswered obvious questions. Wouldn’t “that” have had a better cover up story? And predetermined answers? I’m new to this sub, but have always questioned events similar to these. This one is just so sloppy.

       You saw "dead" people on a screen. Do you think people who "die" in movies are actually dead? There is no difference between the two. Devil's advocate (me) could say, the lack of footage from previous hoaxes and false flags prompted them to up their game a bit to make the show more convincing to those of us who call them out asking for evidence or proof.

       Release of all public records that would be typical of an ordinary death. Also, evidence that these people actually existed, beyond a shadow of a doubt. Families, friends, work history, etc etc. All of this information for the most part is accessible via public look up.

       Nope. I'm suggesting they're the ones most likely to have dropped their phones in a panic or had their phones knocked out of their hands by fleeing concertgoers. If they're filming (on their phones), their phones would be out of pocket/purse, held up and away from their body, vulnerable to being dropped/knocked out. The filmers who caught the most significant footage would probably be closest to the victims (or they may have been the actual victims themselves) and most likely to drop everything and run for their lives, aid others, etc. I'm guessing most of the phones abandoned at the venue were found in close proximity to deceased victims and/or lying in pools of blood. And I'm guessing that has something to do with why the LVMPD isn't returning property yet.

       Nothing wrong with keeping your opinions and options open. Without even looking at your history, I can recall many comments you have said in the past week because I like cats too, and never have I thought you sounded like a crazed, closed minded idiot, That's what this place is for!!!! Some theories defy logic and sound absurd, but hey this should be a safe place for wacky discussions. We entertain freaking astrology and numerology don't we? Nobody down votes the ever living crap out of those guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally don't believe it was a hoax, but that's my opinion that through my research and experience and sifting I have come to. I'm an X-ray tech and that video showing the victims blowing spit bubbles out their mouths 100% jives with my experience working with trauma victims. That's just me and I try to respect anyone else's beliefs. I didn't start out believing the victims are real, I can assure you. It's in my nature to automatically reject big events like this.

       Yo, the only thing with this entire case that
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       make it a complete fake job, with machine-gun sounds patched into the sound system, and crisis actors dropping down with blood packets tucked into their pants, is the fact that there are real victims. Or are there? I finally looked into one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Picked a random state's victim, and dug, for six hours, and got nothing but flip-flop reports of
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       witnesses who were supposedly 2 feet away from shit. This is documented by on-air testimonies this man made about his friend to news stations and facebook posts, etc. Complete changes of stories. Radical changes. One day, he says he stayed with his buddy for 30 mins watching him die, people doing CPR on him, etc, the next day he says he only saw him go down and that's it, and then got rushed out by police, and never saw his buddy again (for two days).. The shit stinks so fucking much now, I don't care anymore, but you telling people to shut up about what they think is no good,
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       since absolutely
       <em>
        nothing
       </em>
       can be verified.

       without giving up too much personal info i will just say I went to school with one of the victims and im friends with people who were there with her when she was shot.  I have spoken to them personally.  So unless she was an amazing actress and these other chicks are in on it then you my friend have no clue

       This is proclaimed so much in these threads it unfortunately falls on deaf ears for many of us. I am tired of all this shit behind the curtain, aren't you?? Fucking years and years of this shit.. No evidence of anything, ever. Not even a fucking pic. Ever. FOI requests get laughed at. Crisis actors laughing at you while lying about shit (see duper's delight).

       To top it off, you want to muzzle discourse, while saying you have

       it's all real, again, &lt;sigh&gt; without giving any proof. It's just so fucking old.. it's sad. cheers

       There were 22k people there. You can expect that several hundred of them will be public emergency personnel. These are people who've been trained to remain cool in high-stress situations and put themselves at risk to protect civilians. You really think it's strange for them to be overrepresented among the injured?

       You realize Irvine, CA is only like 2 hours away from Las Vegas, right? Driving to hours to a UC Irvine Medical Center, a Level I trauma center, from Sunrise Hospital, a Lever II trauma center that got 200 (more than 2/3) of the shooting victims that night, "of whom 16 died and 29 were still in critical condition. Of those, the hospital estimates about 120 had gunshot wounds, but did not release an exact figure."
       <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/10/04/555584905/sheer-number-of-casualties-makes-las-vegas-count-difficult">

       </a>
       There's legitimately nothing strange about that. The only thing that makes it sound weird is that he crossed state lines, when in reality he was going to the nearest available Level I trauma center.

       states were claiming a victim as from their hometown, with feature stories. He grew up in one state, went to college in another, works in another, etc.. So, like 20 news reports across a multi-state region proliferate this
       <em>
        one

       fairy tale, that's like a flip-flopping fart in the wind when you actually look into it. lol

       Why are you so bent on keeping the status quo? Why are you attempting to shut down any and all critical thought into this event? Wow, sure is a coincidence that we have yet to see any security camera footage proving he brought in all those guns himself, better not investigate it!

       Crisis actors acting like VICTIMS?  Why not just actually kill more people?  the logic isnt there.  The people staging these events dont care about human life.

       Public perception is more valuable to TPTB then possible criminal charges.... lol.  Like these dudes are going to jail?  If an event was proven to be a HOAX (most likely by one of the 100s of actors they hoped would be quiet) their entire cover is blown, man behind curtain exposed......  They arent worried about going to jail dude.....

       For anybody saying this or Sandy Hook is a hoax, the main question you should be asking is why fake it?

       It's a lot easier for TPTB to just wait for a mass shooting event, or even know it's going to happen and then to let it occur and then maneuver that shit politically after the fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would you even bother to stage this kind of shit when these things happen every other month and can be used just as well for the same reasons with zero risk.

       I never understood the HOAX mentality.  I understand false flag but HOAX? no.  Like you said.  TPTB don't give a shit about loss of life so why go through all the trouble of faking an event as compared to just making the event happen then lying about narrative.

       Since you're posting this response in multiple threads I'll re-add my response to you.

       Surely you're aware of the number of supposed attacks foiled by the FBI that were actually created by the FBI, yes?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also…your point that all TPTB need to do is wait for an actual mass event rests heavily on the notion that most mass events are not already carried out or at least manufactured by them.
      </p>
      <p>
       My take on LV is it was a false flag. Real victims…fake perpetrator.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as SH goes…well…after several years of investigation I have still yet to see any actual evidence (not a narrative or the word of authorities) that 27 people died. If you have feel free to pass it along.

       Yeah this was the causal root of my own post, because this shit wasn't a hoax, and neither are most mass shootings the product of the government.

       Yeah because they haven't been able to overthrow govs around the world…expand it's military might into 800 some military bases in 150 countries.

       Nah, let it be.  This is a free and open exchange of ideas and information, or so we must strive to preserve it.  The universe will work itself out.  It's one thing to try and understand a conflict, it's another thing to be drawn into it.  I often draw inspiration from this quote from Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I am reading newspapers. I know what is going on! But my reaction is not like yours. You are looking for a cure while I am concerned with prevention. As long as there are causes, there must also be results. As long as people are bent on dividing and separating, as long as they are selfish and aggressive, such things will happen. If you want peace and harmony in the world, you must have peace and harmony in your hearts and minds; it must come from within. Those who abhor war must get war out of their system. Without peaceful people how can you have peace in the world. AS LONG AS PEOPLE ARE AS THEY ARE, THE WORLD MUST BE AS IT IS.  I am doing my part in trying to help people know themselves as the only cause of their own misery. In that sense I am a useful man. But what I am in myself, what is my normal state cannot be expressed in terms of social consciousness and usefulness."

       It doesn't make sense to hoax a huge attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would then be depending on all police involved, all area hospital personnel, EMS, first responders, festival staff, airport staff, taxis and others that helped transport injured, and casino staff to play along. There is simply no way all of these people were convinced to lie. That's absurd. Way too many people are involved with the escape, transporting, and treatment of injuries for them to not actually exist.

       Exactly.  What's that saying the only way 2 people can keep a secret is if one of then is dead..

       I am an eR RN who worked for 16 hours that night. This definitely happened. I will never forget the large amount of critically injured people I saw flood into my ER that night. 
Definitely reeks of false flag but don’t tell me that this shit didn’t fucking happen.

       My mom works at UMC and says the hospital was so chaotic Sunday and Monday it was unreal the amount of injured people that came in. This was most definitely very real. 
I believe they hire crisis actors for the media, simply to cover up the truth. If they would interview real people it would raise too many red flags that this event was coordinated and the involvement of the FBI and CIA would be exposed. I also question the official number of deceased, many names missing from the lost the media has released.

       without giving up too much personal info i will just say I went to school with one of the victims and im friends with people who were there with her when she was shot.  I have spoken to them personally.  So unless she was an amazing actress and these other chicks are in on it then you my friend have no clue

       Nothing wrong with keeping your opinions and options open. Without even looking at your history, I can recall many comments you have said in the past week because I like cats too, and never have I thought you sounded like a crazed, closed minded idiot, That's what this place is for!!!! Some theories defy logic and sound absurd, but hey this should be a safe place for wacky discussions. We entertain freaking astrology and numerology don't we? Nobody down votes the ever living crap out of those guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally don't believe it was a hoax, but that's my opinion that through my research and experience and sifting I have come to. I'm an X-ray tech and that video showing the victims blowing spit bubbles out their mouths 100% jives with my experience working with trauma victims. That's just me and I try to respect anyone else's beliefs. I didn't start out believing the victims are real, I can assure you. It's in my nature to automatically reject big events like this.
