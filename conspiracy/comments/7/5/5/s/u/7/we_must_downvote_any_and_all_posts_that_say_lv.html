<p>And that is why I say what I say, because we all should be seeking that, no matter what. How can we find the truth if we declare what can and cannot be talked about. OP has a lot of nerve coming on here (of all places) and posting that. Which immediately seems suspicious as fuck, imo.</p>

Now I do have a family friend who has in attendance and she was unharmed- and is completely traumatized. I cannot believe the hoax angle because of that. Red flag absolutely believable. It’s just dumbfounding how if it was an orchestrated attack that there are so many unanswered obvious questions. Wouldn’t “that” have had a better cover up story? And predetermined answers?

<p>You saw &quot;dead&quot; people on a screen. Do you think people who &quot;die&quot; in movies are actually dead? There is no difference between the two. Devil&#39;s advocate (me) could say, the lack of footage from previous hoaxes and false flags prompted them to up their game a bit to make the show more convincing to those of us who call them out asking for evidence or proof.</p>

<p>You have to take other events into account. That is how it works.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What evidence would it take for you to believe people died?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Release of all public records that would be typical of an ordinary death. Also, evidence that these people actually existed, beyond a shadow of a doubt. Families, friends, work history, etc etc. All of this information for the most part is accessible via public look up.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, if you showed me all of that evidence, I would believe it wasn&#39;t a hoax, but a false flag were people actually died.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing wrong with keeping your opinions and options open. Without even looking at your history, I can recall many comments you have said in the past week because I like cats too, and never have I thought you sounded like a crazed, closed minded idiot, That&#39;s what this place is for!!!! Some theories defy logic and sound absurd, but hey this should be a safe place for wacky discussions. We entertain freaking astrology and numerology don&#39;t we? Nobody down votes the ever living crap out of those guys. </p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t believe it was a hoax, but that&#39;s my opinion that through my research and experience and sifting I have come to. I&#39;m an X-ray tech and that video showing the victims blowing spit bubbles out their mouths 100% jives with my experience working with trauma victims. That&#39;s just me and I try to respect anyone else&#39;s beliefs. I didn&#39;t start out believing the victims are real, I can assure you. It&#39;s in my nature to automatically reject big events like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yo, the only thing with this entire case that <em>doesn&#39;t</em> make it a complete fake job, with machine-gun sounds patched into the sound system, and crisis actors dropping down with blood packets tucked into their pants, is the fact that there are real victims. Or are there? I finally looked into one.</p>

<p>Picked a random state&#39;s victim, and dug, for six hours, and got nothing but flip-flop reports of <em>actual</em> witnesses who were supposedly 2 feet away from shit. This is documented by on-air testimonies this man made about his friend to news stations and facebook posts, etc. Complete changes of stories. Radical changes. One day, he says he stayed with his buddy for 30 mins watching him die, people doing CPR on him, etc, the next day he says he only saw him go down and that&#39;s it, and then got rushed out by police, and never saw his buddy again (for two days).. The shit stinks so fucking much now, I don&#39;t care anymore, but you telling people to shut up about what they think is no good, <em>especially</em> since absolutely <em>nothing</em> can be verified. </p>

<p>In other words, you&#39;re picking and choosing based on what fits the narrative you&#39;ve already chosen to believe in. Got it. </p>

<p>There were 22k people there. You can expect that several hundred of them will be public emergency personnel. These are people who&#39;ve been trained to remain cool in high-stress situations and put themselves at risk to protect civilians. You really think it&#39;s strange for them to be overrepresented among the injured? </p>

<p>You realize Irvine, CA is only like 2 hours away from Las Vegas, right? Driving to hours to a UC Irvine Medical Center, a Level I trauma center, from Sunrise Hospital, a Lever II trauma center that got 200 (more than 2/3) of the shooting victims that night, &quot;of whom 16 died and 29 were still in critical condition. Of those, the hospital estimates about 120 had gunshot wounds, but did not release an exact figure.&quot; <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/10/04/555584905/sheer-number-of-casualties-makes-las-vegas-count-difficult">Source: NPR</a> There&#39;s legitimately nothing strange about that. The only thing that makes it sound weird is that he crossed state lines, when in reality he was going to the nearest available Level I trauma center. </p>

<p>Is that the only one you found fault with?</p>

<p>Why would you even bother to stage this kind of shit when these things happen every other month and can be used just as well for the same reasons with zero risk. </p>

<p>Surely you&#39;re aware of the number of supposed attacks foiled by the FBI that were actually created by the FBI, yes?</p>

<p>Also…your point that all TPTB need to do is wait for an actual mass event rests heavily on the notion that most mass events are not already carried out or at least manufactured by them.</p>

<p>My take on LV is it was a false flag. Real victims…fake perpetrator.</p>

<p>As far as SH goes…well…after several years of investigation I have still yet to see any actual evidence (not a narrative or the word of authorities) that 27 people died. If you have feel free to pass it along.</p>

<p>Yeah because they haven&#39;t been able to overthrow govs around the world…expand it&#39;s military might into 800 some military bases in 150 countries.

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, let it be.  This is a free and open exchange of ideas and information, or so we must strive to preserve it.  The universe will work itself out.  It&#39;s one thing to try and understand a conflict, it&#39;s another thing to be drawn into it.  I often draw inspiration from this quote from Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj: </p>

<p>&quot;I am reading newspapers. I know what is going on! But my reaction is not like yours. You are looking for a cure while I am concerned with prevention. As long as there are causes, there must also be results. As long as people are bent on dividing and separating, as long as they are selfish and aggressive, such things will happen. If you want peace and harmony in the world, you must have peace and harmony in your hearts and minds; it must come from within. Those who abhor war must get war out of their system. Without peaceful people how can you have peace in the world. AS LONG AS PEOPLE ARE AS THEY ARE, THE WORLD MUST BE AS IT IS.  I am doing my part in trying to help people know themselves as the only cause of their own misery. In that sense I am a useful man. But what I am in myself, what is my normal state cannot be expressed in terms of social consciousness and usefulness.&quot; </p>

I believe they hire crisis actors for the media, simply to cover up the truth. If they would interview real people it would raise too many red flags that this event was coordinated and the involvement of the FBI and CIA would be exposed. I also question the official number of deceased, many names missing from the lost the media has released.  </p>

Nobody down votes the ever living crap out of those guys. </p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t believe it was a hoax, but that&#39;s my opinion that through my research and experience and sifting I have come to. I&#39;m an X-ray tech and that video showing the victims blowing spit bubbles out their mouths 100% jives with my experience working with trauma victims. That&#39;s just me and I try to respect anyone else&#39;s beliefs. I didn&#39;t start out believing the victims are real, I can assure you. It&#39;s in my nature to automatically reject big events like this. </p>
