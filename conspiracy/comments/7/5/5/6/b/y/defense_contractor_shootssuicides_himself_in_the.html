<p>This post is asking if anonymous &quot;John&quot; from previous 4chan Anon insider leaks is this same guy:</p>

<p>The supposed connection (I&#39;m still trying to substantiate this though) is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to this report, upon the FBI searching the Mandalay Bay Hotel room used by CIA gun runner Stephen Paddock, a cell phone charger was discovered that had no accompanying phone—with SVR technology experts noting that this type of charger is used to charge a CP502520 3.0V 600mAh Li-MnO2 Non-rechargeable Thin Cell Battery used in various communication devices by both US Special Forces and CIA forces.</p>

<p>The company making this unique lithium battery, this report details, is Ultralife Corporation, based in Newark, New York, that specializes in military communications systems for the Pentagon—and whose lead engineer for this particular communication systems development was John Beilman.</p>

<p>Listing himself as a “product design and manufacturing professional”, this report continues, John Beilman was employed by Ultralife Corporation between 2007-2012 where he worked on various top secret communications systems for the US military—thereafter his leaving to become a top engineer at the General Motors research facility located in Rochester New York.</p>

<p>Fearing that Ultralife Corporation had been secretly funneling their US military communications systems to the CIA, this report notes, this past Tuesday (3 October), the FBI raided the home of John Beilman under a secret US Federal Court warrant—and that caused Beilman, less than 12 hours later, during the early morning hours of Wednesday (4 October), to wheel out his severely disabled daughter Nicole into his homes backyard where she was executed, with Beilman then killing himself too—and that was followed 48 hours later (6 October) by the Pentagon awarding Ultralife Corporation new contracts valued at over $49 million.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, to be fair, dude might have been involved in some shady shit that has yet to, or might never come out. Whether that be CIA or FBI or just straight up illegal gun running. </p>

<p>But I definitely won&#39;t trust a source that jumps to those kind of conclusions before all the facts are even out. Tells you they&#39;ve already made up their minds on this shit and their confirmation bias will dictate the evidence in order to connect those dots.</p>

<p>Just had an argument with a guy who thought the brother&#39;s t-shirt was encoded by the freemason&#39;s with the 33rd degree. </p>

<p>If your mind is already made up, massive leaps in logic become just a hop and a skip away. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok got it. Yeah the phone/battery part is still unsubstantiated outside of neon-nettle fake news, but at the same time there is some plausibility to all of this.</p>

<p>If Paddock was an Arms dealer then he would have head secure com and possible access to high end mil tech. We&#39;ll see how it all pans out over next few days/weeks</p>

<p>Can anyone explain this apparent discrepancy to me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What sort of gov agency roulette is going on here?</p>

<p>How does it follow that the FBI, finding this charger at the LV crime scene, jump to the conclusion that the company is doing secret business with the CIA? Wouldn&#39;t that confirm that the FBI already knew that paddock was under CIA control? </p>

<p>This is too weird. There has to be more to this.</p>
