       I listened to this about 9am the next day. I remember when I heard someone call over and tell officers to lock their cars because civilians were trying to get in and find gun. I was like holy crap!!! Then came back and took it a step further with civilians were stealing patrol cars to use as medical transportation.  I, too, thought this was a HUGE deal and then never heard it repeated again. Nowhere in any update did I hear someone reference this craziness.

       Pretty sure it was that douchebag Dan Bilzerian. He posted a video running from the concert, hiding behind a cop car and getting into it, trying to get a gun and being a general douche.

       These scanner transcripts are amazing - cheers for putting in this time dude.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see this as one of 3 possibilities-
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Panic of people running from the shooter and multiple people calling police to report it
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Diversions called in - police were given multiple areas to investigate to split their forces and distract them, also points to this being a planned op
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
       <li>
        <ol>
         <li>
          Multiple shooters/accomplices - Mandalay shooter (I also have theories about the Delano) was primary, creating a diversion for other shit to go down elsewhere. Other reports of shooting was that shit going down.
         </li>
        </ol>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       What I'm really curious about are the reports of active shooters, and people shot at other casinos
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       Mandalay is reported as breached. If the official narrative is true (lol) then there should have been NO shooting after that breach
      </p>
      <p>
       Also interesting how scanner audio only records 1 breach. There are 2 reported, however zebra20 comes onto to main channel (after second breach) to report the suspect down...
