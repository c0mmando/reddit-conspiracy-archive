        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I get it for gun control. Not immediate, but setting up for it. And specifically for Sandy Hook, mental health was brought to the table, so now they can control guns and prevent &quot;mental&quot; from getting them, which we know means if you have anxiety or anything at all they can start to prevent you. It also set up the &quot;well if you are on no fly list then you can&#39;t buy&quot; argument.</p>

<p>But they didn&#39;t need to fake it. Columbine, VT, Aurora, I mean you don&#39;t have to fake this. They have already happened. its unnecessary. In addition, the best way to control the populus isn&#39;t with big impact moments. People forget them. Its with slow everyday things. </p>

<p>Investing in one big shooting is waste of resources when they can invest them in smaller every day teachings at school, MSM, hollywood, etc. </p>

<p>Plus its not worth that if they fail and get caught, they are fucked because then even &quot;drones&quot; wake up. </p>

<p>Why fake something that a real person will do by themselves? especially when its not effective in manipulating as other things are</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same here. People don&#39;t realize it&#39;s much preferable to fake it. They say the elites don&#39;t mind killing people, which is true, but it&#39;s much lower risk and easier to use actors and moulage. People also don&#39;t realize that the bigger the massacre the more evidence there should be that it happened. Especially in such a public and high-surveillance place like Vegas, and yet there&#39;s no avalanche of scenes showing actual damage and injuries and medical response that there would be in real life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming it&#39;s what I said about Statins and chemotherapy you find absurd I would say you&#39;d be amazed if you actually took the time to look into medicine yourself instead of trusting what you are being told. But few people do even though it can be literally life saving. I&#39;ve spent six years on it and my conclusion is that most so called modern medicine is utter bullshit. If I was in a car accident I would be happy to let trauma Medicine fix me up,  but in terms of chronic and so called western diseases it does more damage than good.

    <div class="md"><p>Among those that believe Sandy Hook was faked, is there any group consensus on what happened to the kids. 
1) The kids never existed?
2) The kids were killed, but not by Adam Lanza
3) The kids existed but were relocated to some secret govt island.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of them sang the national anthem at the Super Bowl the next year. </p>

<p>I think they used picture of kids who existed really but used younger pictures and different names to keep their anonymity. </p>

<p>Remember, Noah Pozner&#39;s image appeared to signify a dead Pakistani child on the BBC.</p>

<p>I believe Sandy Hook and many other false flags feature Mossad involvement. Some of the &quot;families&quot; could have flown back to Tel Aviv after their last CNN interview. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>*I&#39;m not 100% convinced the shooting was entirely fake, but the official story is riddled with holes and strange questions never answered by mainstream sources.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget the school was dismantled and shipped off quickly, similar to the World Trade Center steel.  </p>

<p>Was the school full of asbestos like WTC 1 and 2?  I don&#39;t have a link, but I read about the asbestos in the school a long time ago.</p>

<p>Also, if the pre-incident footage of the school is bonafide, then it is unlikely the school was in operation, or if it was, the school was a functioning liability due to it&#39;s poor condition.</p>

<p>A small town with heavy government ties gets a brand new school on the taxpayers dime.  The gun control angle would be a lesser motive, or a dual motive, making it much more plausible that the entire incident, or parts of it, were faked.</p>

<p>Why would Sandy Hook need to be faked?</p>

<p>because actually massacring people is &quot;illegal&quot;, while &quot;psyops&quot; are perfectly legal -- authorized by Congress under the Obama administration:</p>

<p>/sure, there is a risk that they will be &quot;found out&quot;, but if they are... the courts will dismiss any lawsuits because ... &quot;psyops&quot; are perfectly legal!</p>
