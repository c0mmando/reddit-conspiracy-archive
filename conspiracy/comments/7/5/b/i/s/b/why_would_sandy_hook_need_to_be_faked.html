       I get it for gun control. Not immediate, but setting up for it. And specifically for Sandy Hook, mental health was brought to the table, so now they can control guns and prevent "mental" from getting them, which we know means if you have anxiety or anything at all they can start to prevent you. It also set up the "well if you are on no fly list then you can't buy" argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       But they didn't need to fake it. Columbine, VT, Aurora, I mean you don't have to fake this. They have already happened. its unnecessary. In addition, the best way to control the populus isn't with big impact moments. People forget them. Its with slow everyday things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Investing in one big shooting is waste of resources when they can invest them in smaller every day teachings at school, MSM, hollywood, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus its not worth that if they fail and get caught, they are fucked because then even "drones" wake up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why fake something that a real person will do by themselves? especially when its not effective in manipulating as other things are

       these events are fake including the latest Las Vegas shooting. And then they cook up all kinds of conspiracy theories with the purpose to portray them as false flags. That's how the media works and has been working since day one

       terrorist attacks and shootings I have looked into turned out to be fake - Oslo, Paris, Nice etc. I cannot say all are because I have not looked, but I definitely see a trend so to speak.

       Same here. People don't realize it's much preferable to fake it. They say the elites don't mind killing people, which is true, but it's much lower risk and easier to use actors and moulage. People also don't realize that the bigger the massacre the more evidence there should be that it happened. Especially in such a public and high-surveillance place like Vegas, and yet there's no avalanche of scenes showing actual damage and injuries and medical response that there would be in real life.

       The goal of these events is not to kill people; it's to make a huge lurid and emotional production that justifies large cash donations and tyrannical police state legislation, and generally spreads fear and confusion.

       Assuming it's what I said about Statins and chemotherapy you find absurd I would say you'd be amazed if you actually took the time to look into medicine yourself instead of trusting what you are being told. But few people do even though it can be literally life saving. I've spent six years on it and my conclusion is that most so called modern medicine is utter bullshit. If I was in a car accident I would be happy to let trauma Medicine fix me up,  but in terms of chronic and so called western diseases it does more damage than good. If anyone actually got inspired to learn about this arguably important subject here are to YouTube's to get you started:

       It's possible yes, but if there are numerous problems with the imagery and the story indicating they cannot depicture a real event then that must be the conclusion. These are psyops with the purpose to make us afraid of each other and tptb

       Consider it an argument that you don't know what you're talking about and must get through kindergarten by researching Sandy Hook before you presume to tell me anything about false flags or declare that people died when you can't even demonstrate that a single real shot was fired.

       I think so. I think we all agree Paddock couldn't have done it and had no reason to. There isn't the real three-dimensional manifestation of a real shooting, with all the graphic images and realism there would be. We haven't even seen bullet damage, because it would be too hard to fake fire patterns coming from the 32nd story location they specified.

       People got injured, people got killed, I'm not sure how you can argue that it was a hoax but you've obviously made up your mind. Also, mass shooters don't always have any clear reason why they did it. Aurora, Columbine, VT, Sandy Hook

       Lets just say you are correct and that the windows did have alarms (I don't think they do BTW) the windows didn't sit there for hours busted...they busted right before he started shooting. The sensors wouldn't have done a damn thing to stop him. It began and ended in a span of 10 or so minutes. If they had sensors on every window they would get a lot of false alarms. Can you prove there were sensors? What are some others reasons you don't think he could have done it? Cause this reason doesn't hold water.

       They knew where he was based on the fire alarm and other guest hearing the shooting. They had to secure the floor and building first. Remove innocent people from the hotel before they can approach him. Or did you forget there were thousands of people there who could die if he blew it up?

       Among those that believe Sandy Hook was faked, is there any group consensus on what happened to the kids. 
1) The kids never existed?
2) The kids were killed, but not by Adam Lanza
3) The kids existed but were relocated to some secret govt island.

       I think they used picture of kids who existed really but used younger pictures and different names to keep their anonymity.

       Why is this down voted? It's exactly what happened. That dude is an actor and was faking that bullshit on command for the cameras. Anyone with half a brain can see that.

       *I'm not 100% convinced the shooting was entirely fake, but the official story is riddled with holes and strange questions never answered by mainstream sources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't forget the school was dismantled and shipped off quickly, similar to the World Trade Center steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was the school full of asbestos like WTC 1 and 2?  I don't have a link, but I read about the asbestos in the school a long time ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if the pre-incident footage of the school is bonafide, then it is unlikely the school was in operation, or if it was, the school was a functioning liability due to it's poor condition.
      </p>
      <p>
       A small town with heavy government ties gets a brand new school on the taxpayers dime.  The gun control angle would be a lesser motive, or a dual motive, making it much more plausible that the entire incident, or parts of it, were faked.

        Why would Sandy Hook need to be faked?

      <p>
       because actually massacring people is "illegal", while "psyops" are perfectly legal -- authorized by Congress under the Obama administration:

       /sure, there is a risk that they will be "found out", but if they are... the courts will dismiss any lawsuits because ... "psyops" are perfectly legal!
