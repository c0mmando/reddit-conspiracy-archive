<li>the fake panic and forced dialogue</li>
<li>they don&#39;t seem concerned about being in the line of fire, especially the camera guy</li>
<li>the guy reaching in his cargo pocket long and awkwardly.</li>
<li>the couple that comes running in starts talking with the girl in the middle and you can clearly see her smiling/laughing while they whisper</li>
<li>there is fake blood, nobody looks hit</li>
<li>one girl sitting down takes her phone out and puts it to her ear very shortly but doesn&#39;t do anything</li>
<li>that guy shouting &#39;we gotta go&#39; but doesn&#39;t run? why is he waiting for the &#39;strangers&#39; to go with him?</li>
<li>the fumbling around in the unlocked police car, where is the officer?</li>
<li>surprisingly low amount of people running by that specific area given 22,000 were evacuating</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would crisis actors, hired to make the event believable, be less convincing than actual victims running and fleeing and bleeding?</p>

<p>If video evidence is being scrubbed of multiple shooters, why isn&#39;t video evidence of these terrible crisis actors who risk exposing the operation to sleuths like you also being scrubbed?</p>

<p>Look, I don&#39;t doubt that crisis actors exist in this world, and are used sometimes, but what is the goal of claiming they were used here? Real people died, real people reacted to real shots, so adding some shitty crisis actors in does nothing but expose your op to scrutiny. It just doesn&#39;t make sense. </p>

<p>Also your bullet points here on the linked video are all opinions and are not facts. You have made observations about the video and have drawn conclusions supporting your own theory. This is bias 101. Some folks in a video don&#39;t behave how you THINK they should and so you find ways to explain that dissonance with your supporting theory. You are not being objective, my man. </p>

<p>There is no evidence here, and you&#39;re only speculating. However, I will say it is plausible that there may have been multiple shooters, but this post provides no new evidence to support that theory. I&#39;m not negating your theory, just the lack of evidence in your thread. </p>

<p>not completely sure why they orchestrated it this way, but those people in that video are definitely acting; watch it again.  btw your quality of life would be much higher if you didn&#39;t work at a shilling agency, trust me on this, your life sucks. </p>

<p>Your life would be a lot better if you entertained others viewpoints and engaged in actual discourse instead of just writing uncomfortable thoughts off as coming from a &quot;shill&quot;. I even lended credence to your overall theory, and only criticized your &quot;evidence&quot;. Or lack thereof. </p>

<p>1.). Overlapping &quot;gunfire&quot; confirms &quot;multiple shooters.&quot;
2.) Lack of &quot;Ah! FUCK, I&#39;m shot!  God damnit!  Someone, help me!  Please!&quot; in any of the videos confirms it&#39;s all a fraud.
3.) You bitching about someone posting about a topic most are interested in confirms you&#39;re a shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>an unfortunate truth. the third video was labeled &#39;shots from opposite direction&#39; or something because the banner kicks out towards Mandalay. After finding a site that lets you look at frame by frame at 60 FPS it&#39;s clear to me the banner went in the direction of the impact and recoiled back towards Mandalay in that shot.

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose that would be the only thing to make sense if it was indeed from the automatic type fire. The issue I have with that is when bump-firing an AR-15, you don&#39;t have the freedom to just throw your muzzle around. There&#39;s a sweet spot of pressure to the shoulder to get that stock to spring like it&#39;s supposed to. To say he went through multiple 100rd mags while flailing his muzzle left to right, it&#39;s just a bit odd to me. Not impossible, mind you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I looked it up:</p>

<p>Red tags - (immediate) are used to label those who cannot survive without immediate treatment but who have a chance of survival.</p>

<p>Yellow tags - (observation) for those who require observation (and possible later re-triage). Their condition is stable for the moment and, they are not in immediate danger of death. These victims will still need hospital care and would be treated immediately under normal circumstances.</p>

<p>Green tags - (wait) are reserved for the &quot;walking wounded&quot; who will need medical care at some point, after more critical injuries have been treated.</p>

<p>White tags - (dismiss) are given to those with minor injuries for whom a doctor&#39;s care is not required.</p>

<p>Black tags - (expectant) are used for the deceased and for those whose injuries are so extensive that they will not be able to survive given the care that is available.</p>

<p>To support my original comment, you don&#39;t use(lack of a better word here) limited resources on the deceased (Black Tags)</p>

<p>But, those are Actors you scream.  Okay, lets pretend that some were.  All of the shooters were <em>only</em> shooting near Actors?  The dead people and wounded ... were Actors also?</p>
