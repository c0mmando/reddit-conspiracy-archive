       People lying under oath, resigning, recusing themselves from investigations...isn't that enough evidence to pique your curiosity ?  When I searched recent posts, instead of digging into this, the topic is largely dismissed as being
       <strong>
        entirely manufactured by mainstream media.
       </strong>
       That's the part that I find confusing.  Like,  I get the media makes shit up, and everything is sensationalized, and that the information we receive is filtered through whatever bias of the source delivering it, but this stuff is going to court and people are losing their jobs, shit is actually happening.  You guys can run wild with just the tiniest bit of evidence, but this doesn't arouse suspicion?  And I'm not talking about the idiotic links that people dig up (people say shit like "Trump did business with Russia 20 years ago so he is a shill" and that's retarded, he did business with a lot of people) I'm focusing on the past few years right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, think of the reverse scenario - imagine Hillary was president, and imagine people suspected that Saudi Arabia secretly influenced the election to make her win.  Would you be quick to dismiss it, or would you want to know more?  Now imagine that her advisers and cabinet members were being linked to Saudi Arabia, some of them lied under oath, etc.  Would you guys dismiss it all as a mainstream media hoax?  It's not really a fair comparison, but, I imagine you guys would be going nuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is, why are people dismissing the entire story as a hoax?  Why do I feel like this subreddit leans to the right?  This is not an insult or a jab at you guys, I'm here to talk to different people and learn, but I'm also a leftie and I want to talk about leftie-conspiracies.  Please let me know if I'm not doing a good job of communicating calmly because I tend to get heated when talking politics.

       Shouts out to civil discussion and respecting people.  We should be able to disagree about stuff and still get along.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you want to learn the truth about something, it sometimes helps to look at it from multiple perspectives.  Like, if I'm biased, and you're biased, we might see the same thing two different ways and the truth is somewhere in the middle.  Hard to learn the truth about stuff when everyone around you sees things the same as you.

       People on this sub routinely accept far less evidence to justify looking into conspiracy theories.  Like half the people on this sub are ready to arrest John Podesta for child rape because he talked a couple times about one of the most popular food in America.

You're already insane LOL, no one needs to do that. For your sanity's sake you could just stop reading all this bullshit and go to work, home-then spend time in nature-it'll feel like the world is a decent place till you plug back in or go searching for something to agitate your political stance.

       Yo, I'm glad you're getting something positive from the presidency.  I don't think I have a single good thing to say about what he's done as president , so, I'd be interested to hear what you like about him.

       Why do people joke so much about blind loyalty to Donald?  Like, it's not just encouraged, it's almost expected from his supporters.  All these "anti-establishment" conservatives go crazy when you criticize the establishment now that Trump

       I think you've fallen for the empty rhetoric of the narrative.  Trump talked all about giving power back to the people and working for the people during his campaign; but, everything Trump has ACTUALLY done since he's been in office has been about strengthening the establishment and corporate interests.  He's not giving power to the people, he's not focusing on us, he's pretending to do it so people like you continue to support him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump lies constantly, but as long as they sound good the people keep buying them.  It's gross

       Agreed. Both sides are surely guilty of foul play/bending rules... the difference is that we have leaks that blatantly illustrate some* of the things that Hillary has done that are actually against the law.

       So far we've seen nothing of the sort from Donald's secret basement email server that he used to mishandle classified data domestically and internationally. Whether or not he did it intentionally.

       Okay, but it was Wikileaks Twitter that made claims about where the emails came from.  That's my point.  The Twitter account is not necessarily trustworthy, and I simply don't believe them when they say it was a hack.

       You don't sound intelligent when you make "muh" comments -- you think it makes a mockery of the allegations, but it just outs you as a partisan who has no intention of investigating the issue.

       I wouldn't trust a random anonymous quote from someone within the intelligence community.  But when
       <em>
        every single intelligence agency
       </em>
       signs onto the official consensus; when multiple agency officials
       <em>
        appointed by Donald Trump
       </em>
       confirm in Congressional hearing their confidence that Russia committed the hacks; when literally
       <em>
        hundreds
       </em>
       of journalists and Democratic operatives were hit with state-sponsored phishing attempts in 2015 and 2016; when literally every single professional privy to the raw information has signed onto the consensus that Russia is behind it; and when Russia has spent the last decade literally running this exact same playbook in former Soviet states -- yeah, it's probably an accurate assessment.

       Breitbart link, really?  "The Trump Russia story is fake news Trump's former campaign director said so, that proves it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, yes, 17 agencies.  Breitbart's deliberately misleading here.  Officially and technically, it was only four organizations that prepared the report, one of which was the office of the Director of National Intelligence, the overall umbrella organization.  None of our intelligence agencies, nor their administrative heads, has contradicted the conclusion of the report (including in testimony before Congress).

        Donald Trump Jr. agreed, adding that he would most likely bring along “Paul Manafort (campaign boss)” and “my brother-in-law,” Jared Kushner, now one of the president’s closest White House advisers.

        On June 9, the Russian lawyer was sitting in the younger Mr. Trump’s office on the 25th floor of Trump Tower, just one level below the office of the future president.

       After these emails came out, we learned that Jr lied about the number of people that attended. Turns out, it was 8 people. Here's a link with more info on that group:

       People here will say Vox and NYT are fake, but they link to direct sources. No one here will debate the actual content of the emails or the group he met with.

      <p>
       Now, think about how much Trump huffed about Russian sanctions.

       Yeah, like, that's enough to be suspicious, and there's a bunch of other shit that's questionable.  It's odd that so many people want to dismiss any and all claims related to Russian interference.

       The DNC leaks was the initial reason behind all of the "Russian Hacking" stories... this was pre-election, and honestly, one of the reasons it is hard for a lot of us to take the entire narrative seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       They laid out a grand scheme on how the Russians hacked the DNC (and John Podesta's email account btw - despite that being a phishing attack that he immediately fell for) and doubled down by having Crowdstrike provide "evidence" of said Russian hack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone that took a community college level Comp Sci course and reviewed those PDFs from Crowdstrike had a very difficult time holding in their laughter. It was pure silliness. Involving a script from a Ukraine origin that was an out-of-date piece of software that left geographically identifiable finger prints all over it. They only included snippets of the source, and not the impact/method used to "hack" the DNC. Then 80% of the document was a guide on how to maintain computer safety, looked like the copy/pasted right from a FAQ on Norton's website.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once that was swiftly debunked as being nonsense by people who know what they are actually talking about, the Russian hacking story devolved into this generic puddle of nonsense. Some on the left even began claiming that the contents in Wikileaks were entirely fabricated by Russia!
      </p>
      <p>
       Then they realized what DCIM verification was and realized this story didn't make sense either.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have the "Dossier". Do I really need to dive into this? It was more like a collection of tabloid stories that didn't make the cut, as opposed to any kind of meaningful intel. It was so bad that even CNN and MSNBC made fun of it, after apologizing for even running the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, what are we left with? Generic claims about "meddling", small ad buys that are traced back to Russia and focused on HRC/BLM?
      </p>
      <p>
       And the meeting with Manafort + Don Jr + Kushner... this is really what it all hinges on. We don't yet know the full details on Manafort's involvement, nor the implications of the Don Jr./Veselnetskaya meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was some form of collusion - and it can be proven/shown to us, I think the general consensus on this sub reddit will shift dramatically. But it needs to be real. We've been fed a load of shit so far.

       If Assange is a puppet, he's one of the American deep state. After his internet was cut prior to the  planned release of his October surprise (which never came) he no longer signed things with his PGP key, interviews that were given months after had signs of CGI, the data he kept as insurance was reduced, crowdsourced attempts to access it through the blockchain were doxxed and fragmented.  Align this with the obvious change in online persona, the appearance that vault 7 was a controlled release, the Assange we knew is likely no more.

       That's kind of what I'm thinking.  If the mainstream media had a big story to drop, they would have dropped it.  Since they haven't I can't imagine there's anything worthwhile that'll come out about Trump being a Russian shill.

       UNLESS...what if someone in the government has evidence of Russian collusion?  I would use that shit for HELLA blackmail for 4 years and then drop it right as Trump leaves office.

       Ordinary for Russia is
       <em>
        meddling in foreign politics and lying about it.
       </em>
       In that sense you're right - if we find evidence that Russians meddled in our election it would be proof of business as usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is that why people dismiss it?  Because they just expect it from Russia so it's not even like a big conspiracy?  That would be disappointing lol

       A big problem I have is that people use these vague accusations because they have no actual evidence against them. Russia "meddled," or they somehow "influenced" the election. So what did they do, exactly?
      </p>
      <p>
       Supposedly they hacked the DNC emails and leaked them to Assange, but that claim seems shaky at best. So now the story is that a Russian company bought some $10K in Facebook ads. Ok, so what did the ads say? Were they sufficiently targeted to the election to have violated Federal law? If so, fine them and be done with it. Its silly to think that such a tiny amount of money could have changed the outcome of the election, so I really don't care all that much. I'm sure they have done it for years and we have done the same, so the sudden concern is very transparent.

       Russian meddling wasn't a concern in previous elections.  Also, we don't know the extent to which Russian meddled, that's what I want to discuss.  We are like 100% sure they influenced the election but how did they do it, how successful were they, etc.  This shit is a great topic but it seems like people who sympathize with Trump don't want to explore it at all

       I can only speak for myself, but I personally do not care because this country has been bought and sold since at least 1871. This is why I find it amusing when people are bringing it up now, simply because they do not like Trump. It's hypocrisy and ignorance which makes me scoff at the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, if we don't want to go deep down the rabbit hole, no one really talks about how Israel influences and controls elections and foreign policy in the US. And, that's just one country, Saudi Arabia does as well. I have differing beliefs on how and why compared to others on here, but yea. Why isn't anyone talking about that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Really, because it boils down to the "left" trying to blame everything on Russia, when in fact, their own insanity is what made them lose, not Russia "hacking/interfering".
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my two cents.

       Awesome reply, thanks so much for taking the time to share that.  It's hard for me as an outsider coming in to understand how this stuff is being viewed (most of my friends are libs so I have to seek out differing opinions sometimes).

       Yeah because they don't want to blame Hillary or the fucking shitfest that is the DNC.  Hillary just isn't likable and the party is being run by buffoons who are out of touch, the guys in charge are making us look retarded.

       And that's not to say lefties aren't making lefties look retarded, they are.  I think that's a bit of confirmation bias though.  Conservatives often treat all liberals like the worst liberals, same as liberals often treat all conservatives like the worst conservatives.

       This is not the issue. Hillary is beyond unlikeable. She's a heinous criminal, who has been a full-on albatross for the DNC for years. It doesn't take much research to discover the source of her unlikable-ness, and I would fully encourage you to read up on her antics with an open mind.

       The DNC emails were released around the time of the DNC convention, but the Podesta emails dropped like half an hour after the Access Hollywood tape.

       So, you think the "dog and pony show," is coming from the universally respected former FBI director with a unchallenged reputation for integrity, and not the reality show host and lifestyle brand salesman who paid out an eight-figure fraud settlement for his fake college months before taking office, and has repeated easily disprovable lies every day he's been in office?

       I wouldn't call Mueller universally respected by people in the sub. He oversaw 9/11 for one thing. He's another power hungry psychopath carrying water for other psychos. Historically speaking, the US doesn't have a great track record for picking lead investigators into major issues.

       That picture could only be painted by someone with an ideological motivation to smear Mueller to protect the president's image.  "Power hungry psycho"? A guy who was set to retire before being asked to extend his term by Obama, and was happily humming along in private practice before Rod Rosenstein asked him to return to the DOJ to lead the investigation

       Because its the mainstream propaganda narrative used to attempt to delegitimize Trump's Presidency, likely because TPTB are worried about what he might do. Whether their concern is justified or not is up for debate.

       And yet nobody did anything illegal. Due to this charade, Flynn resigned for lying to the VP, and Sessions recused himself for saying that he didn't meet with any Russians while accidentally neglecting to mention that he spoke with a Russian for a brief time in public with people all around him.
      </p>

       Its not a right-left thing, its an Establishment narrative vs skeptics thing. Personally, I really disliked both Bushes, the Clintons, and the Obamas. Trump seems like a nice change to me so far, but only time will tell.

       That's not mainstream media influence, that's the gist I get from Trump and from talking to people.  When I'm reading the news I try to visit multiple sites (nytimes, fox, BBC) so that I can understand both sides' bias and I don't have cable so I don't watch the news.

       Because they have no evidence. You know it's bullshit when they had tried to get multiple different allegations to stick. They first claimed that the Russians hacked the voting machines, which turned out not to be the case. Then it was Hillary's emails, for which the DNC denied the FBI access .. Go figure. Not to mention Craig Murray from wikileaks claimed it was a DNC insider. Assange has also heavily hinted it was Seth Rich. Then it was just general collusion. Omg Trump had a golf course in Russia. Allegations failed to stick to Trump so they then went after Trump junior. The whole thing reeks of absolute desperation. Meanwhile the MSM shilled 24/7 for Hillary, even going as so far as to help her cheat in the debates by giving her the questions ahead of time. And the dumb cunt still lost. No one wanted her anyway, Bernie was the popular choice.

       No one cares for facts because they get in the way of the forced narrative pushed by the MSM. I'd happily board the Russian train if actual evidence materializes, something actually tangible. A few thousand in facebook ads, is simply ridiculous when the campaigns spent literally billions of dollars. But that seems to be the latest drama the MSM are hyperventilating about to explain the greatest establishment loss in history.

       C'mon.  You are a liberal.  I'm a liberal.  Can we raise the bar for ourselves a bit?  We are digesting as much crap as the right wing.  Let's go on a fucking diet.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Russians attempted to hack elections systems in 21 states in the run-up to last year’s presidential election, officials said Friday,” began the USA Today story, similar to how most other outlets presented this extraordinary claim."
       </p>
       <p>
        So what was wrong with this story? Just one small thing: it was false. The story began to fall apart yesterday when Associated Press reported that Wisconsin – one of the states included in the original report that, for obvious reasons, caused the most excitement – did not, in fact, have its election systems targeted by Russian hackers"
       </p>
       <p>
        The spokesman for Homeland Security then tried to walk back that reversal, insisting that there was still evidence that some computer networks had been targeted, but could not say that they had anything to do with elections or voting. And, as AP noted: “Wisconsin’s chief elections administrator, Michael Haas, had repeatedly said that Homeland Security assured the state it had not been targeted.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Then the story collapsed completely last night. The Secretary of State for another one of the named states, California, issued a scathing statement repudiating the claimed report"

       Exactly. The Russia story is transparently bullshit. Does Trump have negative stuff in his past? No doubt about that. Has he ever done deals with Russia and/or Russian mob? Ehhhh who knows, but I'll go with probably. That's what's so brilliant about the whole narrative - it seems very believable to tie him to Russia. This is also an old tactic the Clintons have employed - accuse your enemies of the things you've done before they can point the finger at you. There's a mountain of evidence linking HRC as SoC to oddities with Russia (and just about everyone else vis a vis the Clinton Foundation). Also, the DNC isn't just responsible for the Trump presidency due to their incompetence. They strategically colluded with media to push him as a "pied piper" candidate, thinking he or Cruz would be the easier opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would we ever accept a narrative the MSM wants to cram down our throats? It almost always proves to be duplicitous in the end - it's what they do - they are the propaganda arm of our gov't. So what is the Russia story really about? I think it's about covering up real election rigging in the primaries. I'd go further and say the election rigging that riled up Bernie supporter Seth Rich and caused him to gather dirt on the DNC's bullshit. But hey - what do I know - it's all just throwing shit against a wall. We'll probably never know the truth of it.

       It feels like
       <em>

       and that this subreddit doesn't want to talk about it, which is unusual.  It also feels like many of the explanations are laced with right-wing sympathy.  To an outsider, it seems like they want to suppress discussion of it, and I get that it's been talked to death but we don't know the truth still.

       Ok. Even if it isn't a hoax (which it is ) made by a MSM as a talking point against Trump, think about it logically .
      </p>
      <p>
       How much and how wide is the scope of the Russia's reach into US politics ? Add into account the financial power that Russia actually has and it's impact on worlds politics. I dare to say it's closer to none than to significant. Ofcourse they've had a horse in this race, being that the Clintons are proven Russia haters, and were easily to put more sanctions on it. So, from purely financial stance, thay had to input some of their influence into the race. But the reach and the impact of it was not a tipping point. It simply couldn't be. In the words of the CNN reporter , it's a big 'nothingburger'. It's just convenint as is, 'cause it strikes two targets at the same time - Trump and Russia. But to anyone with a hint of logical reasoning, it`s laughable. And it's embarasing to both Hillary and MSM. It's borderline cartoonish.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand - there SURE is much legitimacy in US meddling in any and every freakin' election that's been conducted throughout the world, from 2nd WW until now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was there any Saudi influence on elections ? Or Israeli ? Maybe Mexican , too ? How about Chinese ?

       "influenced the election" - Unless this means tampering with voting machines,  preventing people from voting, wiping out actual cast votes, fabricating votes, etc., then it's just propaganda and shady campaigning.   As far as I know, Russia didn't make anyone vote for Trump, and didn't prevent anyone from voting for Hillary.

       "Secretly influencing the election" is just foolish on its face. It's obvious bullshit, the media is acting in totally uncharacteristic ways (after soft-pedaling all the establishment bullshit for decades-- of both parties). Mueller has been fixing up establishment messes his whole career... It couldn't be more obvious what is going on.

       They aren't saying "Putin determined the outcome" that's not the claim.  The claim is that Russia made attempts to interfere with or influence the election , not that russia definitely decided the election.

      <p>
       In every interview I've heard someone says "we don't know how much they influenced the election just that they definitely tried to interfere."  Nobody is saying "Putin magically determined the outcome" that's a stupid and unfair simplification of the issue.

       Many many people do say exactly that, it doesn't matter that it's not officially said on that record. And again, everyone's "trying to interfere". It's known. There is zero evidence of anything out of the ordinary. It's clearly a political witch hunt by entrenched power against an outsider.

       That doesn't matter because that's not the claim.  The claim is that Russia interfered with our shit, and rather than be interested in it the people on this sub don't seem to want to talk about it.  Imo you're letting your bias stop you from scrutinizing the situation fairly

       I'm a lefty, just in case you think some of us have a political motive for our lack of interest in the Russia narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       First,
       <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/09/28/yet-another-major-russia-story-falls-apart-is-skepticism-permissible-yet/">
        many of the sources for claims are spurious, or the cited sources are vague and unclear
       </a>
       .  There really has been a lot of fake news about this story.    Some of it has validity, and of course Trumps financial ties are of great interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the Russia narrative has obscured every other type of analysis or news reporting.  Russia is the reason for all bad things these days.   So when reviewing this shitshow of an election and the state of our country, talking only about Russia shuts down all other forms of analysis.  So, it's a firewall.  Don't look at any other issue.  Don't look at political corruption.   Just let's only talk about Russia.  And by the way, if you disagree with anything an establishment democratic politician says, you are a Russian Operative.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that probably bothers me the most.  This "if you don't buy into the Russian narrative, that means you are a Russian operative".  Joe McCarthy must be feeling so validated right now.  We have brought back our own version of a House UnAmerican Activities Committee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia isn't the only foreign power with an interest in our governance, and those other foreign powers also exert undue influence.  For example, Israel.  Or Saudi Arabia.  Why don't we talk about them?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why do you care so much?  The country is literally falling apart for a hundred different reasons, but here you are writing about fucking Russia.

       We do talk about them.  Difference between them and Russia right now is we have pretty definitive proof that the Russian government maliciously influenced our election.  Yes, fake stories have come out about this, but a few fakes isn't enough to discredit the allegations entirely.

       Those countries haven't done anything comparable to what Russia did.  How do you expect me to compare them?  What type of proof are you looking for?  There's plenty of instances of Israel and SA misleading America or lying about shit, covering stuff up, or making bad international decisions.

       Because I think laying down and accepting that our elections are prey to foreign influence would be a blow to our country and our ability to control our lives.  If a foreign government exudes some control over our government you can expect them to take advantage of us.  And, Russia is a shithole,:they rule through force, they're famous did silencing opposition.

Things feel like they're coming coming together rather than falling apart.  It's not the same in every part of the world, but, even some of the shithole countries show signs of progress.

       That's the thing people are trying to figure out - how effective were they?  We know they did it, but we don't know how significant it was

       Its very effective. Not sure how much it changed the election, Im very liberal and I was never going to vote for Hillary. But just looking at the reaction to the Las Vegas shooter, everything is a conspiracy, and this has reached the mainstream. Its not just the people on this sub.

       As we see on the top comment, whataboutism. It's a cognitive dissonance by Trump fans who say that this country has been bought and paid for by foreign influence but the "Russian narrative is complete BS" in the same breath. Look at those who use partisan rhetoric rather than just admit it's a huge problem overall. Israel, Saudi Arabia, EU/NATO members etc all hold influence

       That's the thing that's bothering me about this place.  You'd expect skeptics to be skeptical, but the partisan bias is real.

       That's because it's not true - DT Jr. never worked with the Russian government, the guy above you is straight up lying or just too stupid to realize he's wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       That lawyer he met with did not work with the Russian government, she was literally just a lawyer from Russia that wanted to sell some info that DT Jr. never even took.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason why the media has dropped this angle and DT Jr. and his lawyers were so confident as to release the emails.

       It feels like
       <em>
        something is amiss
       </em>
       and that this subreddit doesn't want to talk about it, which is unusual.  It also feels like many of the explanations are laced with right-wing sympathy.  To an outsider, it seems like they want to suppress discussion of it, and I get that it's been talked to death but we don't know the truth still.

       The most absurd part is that you, and everyone else, can just read the email chain. You certainly don't have to take my word for it.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The documents “would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father,” read the email, written by a trusted intermediary, who added, “This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump.”
       </p>
       <p>
        He [Jr] replied within minutes: “If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Four days later, after a flurry of emails, the intermediary wrote back, proposing a meeting in New York on Thursday with a “Russian government attorney.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Donald Trump Jr. agreed, adding that he would most likely bring along “Paul Manafort (campaign boss)” and “my brother-in-law,” Jared Kushner, now one of the president’s closest White House advisers.
       </p>
       <p>
        On June 9, the Russian lawyer was sitting in the younger Mr. Trump’s office on the 25th floor of Trump Tower, just one level below the office of the future president.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       After these emails came out, we learned that Jr lied about the number of people that attended. Turns out, it was 8 people. Here's a link with more info on that group:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2017/7/18/15990798/trump-jr-russia-meeting-attendees">

        </a>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       People here will say Vox and NYT are fake, but they link to direct sources. No one here will debate the actual content of the emails or the group he met with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, think about how much Trump huffed about Russian sanctions.

       Many many people do say exactly that, it doesn't matter that it's not officially said on that record. And again, everyone's "trying to interfere". It's known. There is zero evidence of anything out of the ordinary. It's clearly a political witch hunt by entrenched power against an outsider.

       Yo, I'm glad you're getting something positive from the presidency.  I don't think I have a single good thing to say about what he's done as president , so, I'd be interested to hear what you like about him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do people joke so much about blind loyalty to Donald?  Like, it's not just encouraged, it's almost expected from his supporters.  All these "anti-establishment" conservatives go crazy when you criticize the establishment now that Trump
       <em>
        is
       </em>
