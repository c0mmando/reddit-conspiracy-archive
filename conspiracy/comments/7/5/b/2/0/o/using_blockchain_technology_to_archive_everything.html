       I had an idea last night, and I hope someone who knows a bit more about coding and blockchain technology will see this and help the idea grow in one way or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       To give a quick run-down, blockchain technology is the term for a system of decentralized book-keeping. Individual people set up "nodes" on their computers, each of which contains the entire ledger, or blockchain, and each updates in real time, or each time the node is specifically activated and updated.
      </p>
      <p>
       This creates the opportunity for decentralized networks, since there is no way to hack, alter, or remove the blockchain unless it was done on all of the participating nodes simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what allows (some) cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to remian largely decentralized and secure. You couldn't hack into bitcoin directly, since any illegal change made to one node would simply cut that node off from the rest of the network. Everyone would see that there was a discrepancy, and so the network would just move on without that node, unchanged. EVEN IF, somehow, the whole network was attacked, everyone participating could collectively agree to start again right where they left off before the attack. All of the previous information would still be stored somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it isn't just currencies that can be supported by blockchains.
      </p>
      <p>
       On each "block" of the blockchain (think of it like pages in a ledger), information is recorded. That information, as I said above, is permanently saved on the computer of everyone running a node for that blockchain. Even if the computer goes offline, everything that happened before will be saved, and once it goes back online, it can sync with the other nodes in order to be updated with any new information that was stored.
      </p>
      <p>
       THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED. Videos are being deleted. Articles and posts are being taken down. The truth is being scrubbed from the internet and from our history books. Blockchain technology can prevent that.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we set up a blockchain, not for a cryptocurrency, but for recording information, then whatever we put on it could potentially be there FOREVER, and no single person or organization could remove it. Even if they cut everyone in the world off from the internet entirely, the information would still be saved on the computers of every node user. Entire articles could be written on each block. Videos could be encoded in such a way that they could be uploaded at a later time with the right video players. We could save information permanently, not on some website owned by some organization or person, but on a ledger owned by
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what we need to protect ourselves from the scrubbing of history. Please, if you like this idea, either let me know your thoughts here, PM me your thoughts, or just get out there and start making this yourself (I'm not as fluent in any particular coding language as I'd like to be, despite knowing a lot of the basic concepts involved).
      </p>
      <p>
       And please, I know that many of you have your own conspiracy theories about Bitcoin and NSA-created hashing algorithms and whatnot. That's not what this post is about, and blockchain technology by itself is separate from all of that. We wouldn't need to use any of the NSA's tools to pull this off if we did it right. So if you are going to criticize this idea, please make sure you know a good amount about blockchains before you do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know the best place to start something like this, but I know all of you will recognize how important it could be. Let's take the information, and thus the power, out of their hands and put it into the hands of, well,
       <strong>
        everyone!

       yup.  it's a way of getting a "permanent record".  people who control the registries of information control information.  this tech makes it so that there are no single registries.  it's a game changer.

       I'm no expert on STEEM. How much control does Steemit Inc. have over the blockchain? How much of the information put on the website/social media platform is actually recorded on the blockchain permanently?

       It doesn't seem quite as secure from tampering as what I'm proposing, but I might be completely wrong. Learning more about it now.

       There are a few timestamping services that use Bitcoin, but they don't store data.  They can only prove that some information existed at a certain time.  There are also a couple of blockchains designed around decentralized data storage, like Storj.

       Looking into storj, it seems mostly directed towards private data storage, not public, though I might be missing something. It also looks like you have to pay to use it? Again, this is just based on my quick checking just now, I'm not too familiar with it.

       As far as I know, what you're proposing won't work. If the actual data (such as a video) was included in the blockchain, then all the "nodes" would need enough space to store that video.  That would be no problem with only a couple, but I doubt many people would be willing to donate gigs+ of storage to run a node like that.  Also, if someone wanted to shut down or mess with the ability to store things in the future, they could just store many terabytes of info into the blockchain and essentially cause most/all nodes to quit participating. A bitcoin transaction takes very little space, but a video would take much more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you come across a solution for this?

       I have considered the space issue. There are a number of things to think about here and I'm open to suggestions, but my thoughts so far are:
      </p>
      <p>
       The key would be incentive. As it is right now, the Bitcoin blockchain takes up a lot of space and continues to grow. But thousands of people still run Bitcoin nodes. There is no incentive for doing this at all, they do it because they care about the network. Many people use old computers that they don't use for anything else, or set up a raspberry pi with enough memory added to handle it, which are good solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the bigger, broader solution would be to create an incentive. Maybe the desire to help the world save its at-risk info would be enough for a lot of passionate people, but for the rest, perhaps a currency run on the same blockchain (but not the main purpose of it) would create enough incentive. Instead of mining "Datacoins" or "Truthcoins" or whatever you wanted to call them, the currency would be issued at regular intervals to node users.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could even be done at a rate which decreases as the number of nodes increase, so that (1) once enough nodes existed and the network was secure, the coins would be unnecessary anyways, and (2) as the network grows, the coins would gradually become more scarce, potentially increasing their market value in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no guarantee that the coins would be valued by the market at all in the first place. But there wasn't for bitcoin either.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as someone attacking the network by spamming it with huge amounts of useless data, perhaps a system of "pruning" could solve that. Maybe a block wouldn't be considered 100% confirmed until after a certain number of new blocks were formed. This would give the network some time to check each previous block and decide whether the information was legitimate or purposeful spam. How that decision process would work still needs to be spelled out, but it is plausible.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm not mistaken, Bitcoin has something similar, where it takes 6 additional blocks before a block is really considered "official".
