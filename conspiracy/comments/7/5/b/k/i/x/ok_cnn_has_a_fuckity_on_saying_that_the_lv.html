    <div class="md"><p>That is part of it. They also min/max casino rewards programs and progressives. I am not a gambler at all, but I have lived in LV all my life and have known several very successful pro gamblers. I know it sounds ridiculous, but just like in regular video games, min/maxing takes people to a level above what we plebes can understand, or have the discipline to accomplish.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In MMOs, it is getting the best configuration possible in order to maximize your stat based abilities. In gambling, it would be studying the payout patters and player rewards systems to find a way to get a small edge over the house. It is why Paddock was playing his wife&#39;s card the night of the shooting. It was more advantageous to play her car based on whatever calculus he was using to beat the house. It is one of the fishiest things to me, why was he playing his wife&#39;s card? This implies he cared about the future. Because, players like this are not worried about what they win <em>tonight</em>. They have a system where over a period of time, their technique will yield more money than they put in. </p>

<p>These guys are smart AF, they call them Advantage Players. I work for the other side on this in gambler behavior analysis. As soon as we come up with a better way to fleece the masses, they whip out their calculators and figure out how to make it pay them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Min/maxing is a term that implies the maximum amount of resources is applied towards the minimum amount of effort to accomplish a particular goal. </p>

<p>You might hear the term in MMRPG circles where the character will be configured to push specific stats useful for a fight at the expense of other stats, e.g. the tank maxes their fire resistance against a boss that only does fire damage, but it makes him weak to some other damage. </p>

<p>Or it could be that dude with the buff upper body with chicken legs.</p>

<p>In the context of gambling, it&#39;s loosely being able to recognize when the odds are in your favor and betting big. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s like extreme couponing.  They find the money-making opportunities by stacking promotions and loyalty program perks.  With a relatively simple strategy you can get the house edge down to about half a percent, if you play without errors.</p>

<p>What he meant by min/maxing is figuring out the best play in borderline hands to remove an additional sliver off the house edge.  Let&#39;s say in video poker you have 3/5 cards to make a royal flush, 4/5 cards to make an open straight, and a high pair.  Which cards do you replace to give the best expected value?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, do your homework.</p>

<p>There is a difference between playing a programmed machine and a dealer vs other players.  It is almost not even the same game.</p>

<p>Smart people play specific machines that have different rules.  Plus, it is one on one (not saying he was a counter but people do know what they&#39;ve seen and therefore what is still in the deck.</p>

<p>Dude was smart.  He gambled for years but there is no indication he was a loser.  </p>

<p>He played the comp system.  He probably struck a few big payouts, but he was methodic.</p>

<p>He basically played FOR the comps.  Even if he breaks even or comes up a little short, he still had limos, rooms, and &quot;thousands and thousands dollars of sushi), cruises, etc.</p>

<p>He was a retired dude working a side gig that paid for multiple vacations a year, and hadn&#39;t gone broke doing so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are a troll or you are just oblivious to what is being stated. By taking non traditional paths such as throwing out low pairs you can manipulate the overall payout cycle to increase the frequency of the large payouts...royal flush. This is all math based, there are only 52(54) cards and by following this scheme and playing for the big payout on machines with progressive payouts you can over the long haul have a slight advantage. So why doesn&#39;t Ivy play VP? Because he plays people, professional poker players are about out playing the weaker opponents. A guy like the shooter, severe introvert, would be horrible at that. However his ability to do the math and play focused for hours on end means he can use a small mathematical advantage to win money and live off comps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay buddy, chill for a second. There are a whole ton of professional video poker players. Poker and video poker are not the same thing.</p>

<p>Video poker has to follow certain poker-type rules, but you are still playing against the house and the house has the advantage.</p>

<p>BUT because of the poker rules... IF you play with perfect strategy, the house edge is super low, almost 50/50.</p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t play with perfect strategy though and that is how  the casino makes money. </p>

<p>Now, how being a professional video poker player works... The goal is to put as much money into the machine while coming out even. Yes, professional video poker players goal is to work the comp system, since it is set up to reward players for amount of money played. </p>

<p>So if you can sit at a machine for days at a time and pump say a million dollars through the machine. You can end up even or down a few hundred dollars, but with 1000&#39;s of dollars worth of rewards points on your players card.</p>

<p>Also profession video poker players will try to maintain perfect strategy, breaking even, while waiting for a lucky royal flush, which  if they are playing max-odds, will net them 1000&#39;s of dollars in real cash. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have lived in las vegas all my life, 40 years. I also work in a related industry, where we track behavior patterns of gamblers in order to maximize the house advantage. I can&#39;t really give more info than that without doxxing myself, but I study gambling behavior for a living. There are people that bring spreadsheets to the casino to min/max their advantage. They are called Advantage Players, and this is exactly what Paddock was.</p>

<p>I have also known several successful pro gamblers. I do not gamble, I could not give you their methodology, honestly gambling doesn&#39;t interest me at all. But they exist, and they are extremely difficult to work around because as soon as we come out with a new way to get players to spend more, they figure out how to take advantage of it. </p>

Paddock had money, and just like everything else, you need money to make money. I have one friend that makes deal with bartenders around town, who track all the machines. They call him when the progressive is maxed out and certain machines have not hit for a long time. He will take half the amount of the progressive, and play the likely machine until it hits. But he will put 10k in a machine, and then they split the difference of the winnings and investment. I can&#39;t afford anything like that.</p>
