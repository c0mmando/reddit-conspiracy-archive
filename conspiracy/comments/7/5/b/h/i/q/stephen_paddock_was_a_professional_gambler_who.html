        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Anyone who has an interest in gambling knows that there are no professional casino gamblers.  Every game in the casino is stacked against you and while you may have spurts of wins here and there, the longer you play, the more you will lose.  This is a fact.  There is only ONE game where you can be a professional, and that is poker.  This is because in a game of poker, no other player has an odds advantage over you, so it comes down to skill.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t understand how people are eating this up without questioning.  Especially in video poker (and all electronic games), the odds of winning are microscopically controlled so that the longer you play, the more money they will win from you.  Again, yes, you can hit a jackpot once in a blue moon.  But making a living off of gambling at casinos is completely impossible.</p>

<p>I would argue that you could easily make a case for roulette or black jack. Both are games that require strategy. </p>

<p>I was in Vegas the weekend of the shooting. I paid for school playing poker at underground games and casinos. I left early Sunday morning because the tourney I was supposed to play in took a 30 percent cut of the pool, which was crazy to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah...arms dealer with that few guns and all in his name? Not likely. Laundering money via video poker? No, the casino gives you a W2G form for winnings over $1200 on those machines. If you cycle more than $10,000 in 24 hour period that is also reported.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you understand that if you cycle through $10,000 in a 24 hr period it is logged and turned in? Do you understand that winnings over certain dollar amounts are reported to the IRS? Do you understand that if you walk into a casino and try to buy $10,000 in chips your info will be taken? If you try to cash in a winning of $10,000 your info is taken? In this case..every single dollar he spent or won was tracked by his players card. Laundering money through a casino was cracked down on long ago. No casino is going to risk their business to help you launder your money. They keep track of their dealings and turn in the proper data to the IRS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hint: You don’t use chips to play video poker.</p>

<p>Hint 2: You are not required to use a players card.</p>

<p>It’s about obfuscation.  </p>

<p>If you don’t think that people launder money in casinos then you are crazy.</p>

<p>Of course the IRS is tightening restrictions at all times, but he would know all the restrictions.</p>

<p>The casinos cooperate to the absolute bare minimum as they always want to protect their customers.</p>

<p>BTW, not arguing one way or another about whether Stephen Paddock was actually laundering money, but it’s definitely possible.</p>

<p>Also, it is entirely possible to be a winning Video Poker player.  You have to play basically perfectly, and hunt around for +EV Jackpots to build up.  Comps would be a significant part of your win rate. </p>

<p>I have no idea of the specific stats, but I’m sure 90% + of all video poker players are net losers.</p>

<p>However, If he was laundering money he wouldn’t need to be a winning player.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me just shut all your &quot;hints and points down&quot; in order to get comps you must have a what?? PLAYERS CARD. I never said you use chips for video poker. Video poker is a MACHINE. Machines track money in, winnings, losses and money out. Casinos play by the rules or get their gaming license pulled. You can&#39;t put money into a machine and then cash out and claim it as winnings. If the amount you win is over $1200 it is reported. In order to get your winnings you have to go to the cashier. Why don&#39;t you understand this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are 100% correct and I think people who don&#39;t go to casinos regularly do not know how comps work.  It&#39;s not how much you win, it&#39;s how much you play with.  And for every game, table or electronic, you always use your players card first so the casino can keep track of you.  </p>

<p>Now, in slots and video poker, you don&#39;t have to insert your card in first to play, but believe me, every section has a pit boss who&#39;s keeping track of your every move.  If you&#39;re inserting $100k into machines, and you didn&#39;t insert a card, believe me, they&#39;ll be right beside you in 30 seconds flat, keeping track of all you&#39;re doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep and when u cash out and get that paper ticket...a HUMAN has to give you the cash and you better believe they are going to know if it is YOUR money or THEIR money you are walking away with and you can also bank on the fact that the IRS will be notified. People seem to be stuck back in the day when it was only the mobs playground. Not anymore. The federal gov wants their part and they have rules and regulations in place to make sure they get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so let me get this straight. u think that because there are these set of rules and laws in place , they MUST be followed at all times and everyone who doesnt gets caught?  Do u have any clue how much the IRS misses every year? pretty sure its billions....Do u know how many people do bad things and dont get caught? like 90%..Casinos dont launder money or deal with mobsters or any of that jazz? its all hollywood or sumthing?

    <div class="md"><p>So what about the money going in? Yes, large winnings are reported, that&#39;s fantastic, we have that number, 5 mil.</p>

<p>Now regardless of what you win, you aren&#39;t reporting what you start with, and even if you do, throwing down a thousand dollars cash, there is no way to know where that came from, only that it is in this person&#39;s possession. That could be $1k from selling a weapon, giving a hand job, or mowing a lawn. It&#39;s essentially an honor system, while there are laws attempting to snuff out the criminal activity; criminals, by definition, are not going to follow those laws.</p>

<p>If you do accounting on the side and are <em>this</em> familiar with money laundering, wouldn&#39;t a professional accountant be an expert at obsuficating the origin of illegal proceeds?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you understand how money laundering works. The goal is to be able to prove a legitimate source of where that money came from.  If you put in 1 million in to a machine, and just make that money back you still don&#39;t have an answer for the IRS when they ask you where you got the original 1 million. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what you are saying is that the casino reports a person recycling money. So if you walk in with a million and win a million it will be reported as such and raise suspicion? </p>

<p>Where as a one time hit of a jack pot with 5 bucks would be dramatically less suspicious, but not what pollock is suspected of doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, let me explain this to you one last time. You walk in with a million and win a million is what you are saying right? When you cash out your identifying info will be taken. They will log and report that you won a million but only one million is winnings. They will also log and report that you spent a million. Two million will be reported and only one of that will be reported as income it is up to u to explain where that other million came from if you are asked to by the IRS. I&#39;m not sure why this is hard for you to understand. Money laundering is the exact reason that these procedures are in place. In Paddocks case he played video poker and also used a players card.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose that is possible but you would have to make sure that you didn&#39;t associate with that person when cameras could see you. They actually do look out for that. And if one of them won over a dollar amount they would have to give their info. Idk. It has been stated by a few casinos that he was always alone when playing and would play for 24 hrs straight at times on the video poker. I don&#39;t think we will ever know why he did what he did but I would like for his finances to be fleshed out. The victims deserve every single penny in his accounts and all of his assets need to be liquidated and spread out. It is bullshit those people have high doc bills now because this loon did what he did. It would be nice for Mandalay (mgm) to offer money too but I&#39;m not sure they will because it can be seen as a buy off or admission of guilt. Also, you can bet the families will try to sue the hotel. If they take any money from the hotel that negates a lawsuit. The whole thing is messed up. This is what I think and it is only my thoughts: This guy has antisocial personality disorder. Untreated or mistreated. He plotted this. He acted alone. And I say this because LE and the FBI seem to be scrambling. They seem to have no clue what the hell they are doing or talking about. If it were a false flag the story would have been set to go like it was with Sandy Hook and 9/11. This tho... I don&#39;t think so. This was in the highest tourist area in the states. That is super bad for business and hurts the feds bottom line. Feds make a lot of money from casinos. I always try to take a theory and work it from start to finish and try to see if from all parties involved as to what they had to gain. I enjoy conversing with you... You have been civil and open and we need more of that here. Feel free to direct message me if you want to keep bouncing ideas or you can do it here. What is your take on Sandy Hook and 9/11 BTW?</p>

<p>He has won 14 and played in how many?

<p>Is that what you&#39;re saying?  </p>

<p>You seem to have a hard time understanding that YES all people lose at certain hands when someone else has a better hand.  But all winners have a better grasp at what poker is.  A game of gauging risk vs reward.  </p>

<p>By the way, I didn&#39;t want to make a big fuss of it earlier, but what Phil is saying? He&#39;s talking about when it come down to one-on-one or in a last few left in a tournament.  Yes, when it comes to 2 people in poker, it&#39;s no longer odds.  BUt to get there?  You need to be awesome.</p>

<p>No matter how good you are, no matter how well you play, no matter how mathematically ahead you try to keep yourself when your chips go in, it always, <em>always</em> comes down to the cards. <em>No one</em> is ahead of their opponents 100% of the time.

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. So let me ask you one question.  Do you win more often? Or do you lose more often?  If poker was a game of chance, then you should win 50 and lose 50... no?  Sure in a single hand you could be holding a full house while the other guy has a straight flush.  And you would lose that hand.  But if you play 1000 hands, how often would that happen?  Why do you think that ONE hand where the underdog beats the giant means that poker is a game of chance?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you serious?  Really?  Like I said, you can have a full house and someone, who has a straight flush, can beat you.  But, put a pro poker player against an amateur and the pro will in 9 times out of 10.  </p>

<p>Why is that so hard for you to understand?  Just like an underdog team can beat the best team in the NBA/NFL, it doesn&#39;t mean that the underdog team is better, it just means that they won this one time.  </p>

<p>But you want to know why best players don&#39;t win 100% of the time in poker? Because poker players are human. They don&#39;t see the other guy&#39;s hand. They only see what they have and make the best judgement based on it. And some people are so good at that, that they win a majority of the time. And that&#39;s why poker isn&#39;t a game of chance.</p>

<p>If he was truly playing so much video poker, he had a sick obsession and was dumping mass amounts into it, with little return. I read it reported as much in at least one report, which noted that the appeasement of the good treatment and perks from the casino offer the kind of fulfillment that keeps compulsive gamblers just satisfied enough to keep coming back. That seems the more likely scenario, then he just snapped when he realized how stupid and blind he&#39;d been. </p>

<p>But for any one still clinging to false flag theories, that&#39;s simply not enough. If the FBI, the media and the globalist elite are all in cahoots, this seems like a perfectly executed ad campaign designed to attract the gore hungry, clueless gambling crowd to Vegas in droves, thinking high rollers even bother with video poker.

    <div class="md"><p>And I will say you are wrong.  Video poker games are designed to payout 9x.x% of bets over time.  The longer you play, and only if you play the same amount every time, the more these odds will average out and you will end up paying the house their advantage.  To make a living off of video poker is ludicrous as the house always have an odds advantage over you.  Now getting comped for significant value while losing only 0.5% could be a winning strategy, but still, you ain&#39;t making a living off it as the MSM is implying.</p>

<p>As for laundering money, I highly doubt that is true for significant amounts as the machines will track how much you put in as well as how much you win.  If you stick 1 million in to the machine, it doesn&#39;t matter how much win, the IRS will want to know where you got that original 1 million to gamble with.</p>

<p>There have been people doing this for a long time -----</p>

<p>Even though you&#39;re a long run favorite you can still lose a lot of money in the short run. The casino has a basically infinite bankroll, and if you sit down at a video poker machine with only a small bankroll it is likely that at some point you&#39;ll have enough bad hands in a row that you will go broke.</p>

<p>To prevent this you need to make sure you bring plenty of money to the casino to account for short term downswings, and to play tens of thousands of hands to even things out. The more hands you play, the closer you&#39;ll get to the 100.1725% return (aka your profit).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Where do I begin.... You do realize that those sites are paid for by casinos who want to bring in customers, right?  Those sites and &quot;be a pro gambler&quot; books are designed to think that casinos are a place where you can win consistently.  </p>

<p>Ok.  So let&#39;s take your example of 100.1725%, where you supposedly have an advantage.  I&#39;ve looked at your link to the site and I believe you are referring to this game:</p>

<p>DEUCES WILD</p>

<p>Two cards are considered in this version of the game. While a royal flush comprised of one or more wild cards pays 125 credits, a natural royal flush is far more valuable with a 4000-coin payout. Using a simple strategy on the full-pay version of this game yields an expected return of 100.71%, which means the player actually has an advantage over the house. </p>

<p>Ok, so this is the ONE game in the entire casino where the house DOESN&#39;T have a take. i.e. advantage.   So many people think, hell, it&#39;s possible to win playing video poker over the long run.  But notice the &quot;natural royal flush is far more valuable with a 4000 coin payout&quot; statement there.  This is key.  This calculation only works because it pays a huge amount for a natural Royal Flush.</p>

<p>So how often will you be dealt a natural royal flush?  Exactly 1 in 649,740.   So let&#39;s say you are able to play 4 games a minute (15 seconds per hand)  And let&#39;s say you play 6 hours a day.  It would take you 451 days of playing 6 hours a day, everyday for 365 days a year to hit that royal flush.  (mind you, you could get lucky and hit it on the first day, but that&#39;s hardly reliable enough to make a living off of it)</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s look at how much it takes for you to get the max payout in most video poker games.  In most games, the max payout only activates when you have inserted 5 coins.  So, if you&#39;re playing at a $25 machine, this means $125 a pop (which is what Stephen Paddock is claimed to have played on).  And in some cases, it takes more than the min bet to activate highest payouts, but let&#39;s leave that alone for another time.</p>

<p>So what are the dollar amounts involved?  To play and win at this 100.1725% return game, you need $81,217,500.00 to guarantee that you will win 0.1725% of the amount you have betted (now mind you, guarantee. People get lucky all the time).  This comes out to $140,100.  Yup.  So for having a bankroll of $81 million, AND playing for 451 days straight, you get a return of $140k.  </p>

<p>NO ONE ON EARTH WHO HAS $81 MILLION IS STUPID ENOUGH TO PLAY THIS GAME.  Well, except pro athletes and rappers.  But that&#39;s beside the point.  If Paddock was a fuc*ing genius and had enough brains to become rich as hell with real estate and buy 23 assault rifles and and draw trajectory of bullets, he sure as hell doesn&#39;t fit the profile of what MSM is giving us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh...for all that the FBI could take them straight from the supplier. The amount of guns he had was way too small to be an arms deal. Def way too small for the FBI to be in on it. If the FBI was just going to put guns in peoples names to cover then they could use anyone&#39;s name. I honestly don&#39;t see this being an arms deal gone bad. If it had been why not just kill Paddock and make it look like a suicide? Why on earth kill all of those innocent people and draw attention to yourself from all over the world? Think the ideas you have all the way through.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It wasn&#39;t $10k.  He would lose $100k to $1 million and say it was no big deal.  Unless you&#39;re Trump or Silverstein, losing $1 million at a casino is a big deal to everyone. </p></li>
<li><p>He has enough money to support #1, but came from no money, broken family, father was bank robber.</p></li>
<li><p>Not one evidence of his real estate holdings have been released.</p></li>
<li><p>No one even knows the real estate company&#39;s name which he supposedly made his millions in.</p></li>
<li><p>We know that Paddock was a regular at all the casinos, and a huge spender.  Hell, even Steve Wynn knew of him.  But no one in the real estate business has even heard of him?  </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I think plenty of blackjack players would disagree with you. With counting cards, and suitable conditions(1-2 decks, decent penetration, and correct limits) blackjack can be played with a slight edge. </p>

<p>Adding comps and luxuries from the casinos, you can play at a profit over the long haul. Can most people? No. Are games limited? Yes. </p>

<p>Was the guy probably using the highest edge method with minimal work to launder money? Probably yea, but you lose credibility when you make blanket statements like its impossible to have an edge on the casino except for in poker. Because even some decent poker players lose to rake in the long run. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. So let me ask you one question.  Do you win more often? Or do you lose more often?  If poker was a game of chance, then you should win 50 and lose 50... no?  Sure in a single hand you could be holding a full house while the other guy has a straight flush.  And you would lose that hand.  But if you play 1000 hands, how often would that happen?  Why do you think that ONE hand where the underdog beats the giant means that poker is a game of chance?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose that is possible but you would have to make sure that you didn&#39;t associate with that person when cameras could see you. They actually do look out for that. And if one of them won over a dollar amount they would have to give their info. Idk. It has been stated by a few casinos that he was always alone when playing and would play for 24 hrs straight at times on the video poker. I don&#39;t think we will ever know why he did what he did but I would like for his finances to be fleshed out. The victims deserve every single penny in his accounts and all of his assets need to be liquidated and spread out. It is bullshit those people have high doc bills now because this loon did what he did. It would be nice for Mandalay (mgm) to offer money too but I&#39;m not sure they will because it can be seen as a buy off or admission of guilt. Also, you can bet the families will try to sue the hotel. If they take any money from the hotel that negates a lawsuit. The whole thing is messed up. This is what I think and it is only my thoughts: This guy has antisocial personality disorder. Untreated or mistreated. He plotted this. He acted alone. And I say this because LE and the FBI seem to be scrambling. They seem to have no clue what the hell they are doing or talking about. If it were a false flag the story would have been set to go like it was with Sandy Hook and 9/11. This tho... I don&#39;t think so. This was in the highest tourist area in the states. That is super bad for business and hurts the feds bottom line. Feds make a lot of money from casinos. I always try to take a theory and work it from start to finish and try to see if from all parties involved as to what they had to gain. I enjoy conversing with you... You have been civil and open and we need more of that here. Feel free to direct message me if you want to keep bouncing ideas or you can do it here. What is your take on Sandy Hook and 9/11 BTW?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>pro video poker myth is a red herring </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If he was truly playing so much video poker, he had a sick obsession and was dumping mass amounts into it, with little return. I read it reported as much in at least one report, which noted that the appeasement of the good treatment and perks from the casino offer the kind of fulfillment that keeps compulsive gamblers just satisfied enough to keep coming back. That seems the more likely scenario, then he just snapped when he realized how stupid and blind he&#39;d been. </p>

<p>But for any one still clinging to false flag theories, that&#39;s simply not enough. If the FBI, the media and the globalist elite are all in cahoots, this seems like a perfectly executed ad campaign designed to attract the gore hungry, clueless gambling crowd to Vegas in droves, thinking high rollers even bother with video poker. Don&#39;t believe the hype, I always say. The odds are always against you.</p>
