       Why wouldn't the friend raising $40k on
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/puFvj">
        gofundme
       </a>
       for him say he was "WORKING FOR MANDALAY BAY SECURITY" when he got shot?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because he wasn't. He's a licensed security working for Contemporary Services Corporation that does exclusively EVENT security.  They are the yellow shirt guards at the concert. They are not employed by the hotel EXCEPT for conventions and conferences, which was not going on at the hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
       This explains why Campos didn't have a hotel radio.
      </p>
      <p>
       It explains why he lied about his story at first that he was there after the shooting to take out Paddock.
      </p>
      <p>
       An event security guard, on a random patrol, should not be up inside the hotel while his company is running security for the concert across the street.

         Many have doubted that Larry Jesus Campos worked for CSC and that he is the same Jesus Campos. He's in the Nevada Private Investigator database and the gofundme confirms he works for CSC. You have to go through the names of the contributors and their comments to make sense of that, which I did. The comments of contributors confirm that Jesus is the same person as Larry and that he does in fact work for CSC.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why would the hotel distance themselves from this person if he is a "hero" and he was working for them? He was not. The mere fact that the hotel has never once said he was employed by or contracted by them leaves them room to deny completely that he had any right to be there. When the lawsuits start flying the hotel will run from this guy.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>

         Hotel statement refutes Campos two timelines. "“We know that shots were being fired at the festival lot at the same time as, or within 40 seconds after, the time Jesus Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio,” MGM said in the statement, released by a public relations firm. “Metro officers were together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio.”"

        . Until there's proof this is not Jesus Campos we're talking about who's been idendified as the security guard confirmed making a "random patrol" in a hotel he's not employed, it is him.

       I honestly don't think this is accurate in this situation. Some outlets, maybe, but a lot of them are reporting information before police release it (for good and bad), and almost all of them are skeptical.

       Tuckers show ended with the assumption the Campos interview was going to air. Reason is the entire ending of tuckers show was a perfect lead in to the interview. He flat out said things are just too weird and too much mystery and was on this rare occasion open to alternate storylines. Once that ended my hype for the interview was getting good then bam the commercial announcing for first time anywhere that the exclusive interview was coming next. One big blue ball is blue and size of earth and the other size of Neptune.

Um, me and uh, Jesus... we never saw the door open, so we thought he was shooting from the peephole in the door. We were just telling police that, and then, my supervisor was there, he handed me his master keys, and I ran down and shut off all the guest elevators, and stopped guests on the uh, basement floor. Just let em know 'we have an incident upstairs, you know, stay down here.' And then I made my way back up to the 32nd floor to give him his keys so he could give them to the police, so they could use them.

       Not sure how I missed that before, I must've blocked that out while listening because it makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, did the supervisor arrive with the police, before the police, after the police? Why didn't the supervisor shut the elevators off himself?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm guessing the maintenance keys are analog/metal keys, different from the electronic master room key, but security guards wouldn't also have one of those analog keys (I mean what if there's a power outage?)
      </p>
      <p>
       And I think the part that's hardest for me to comprehend with this new testimony is that he says he was with the police, directing them to the room... yet Undersheriff McMahill said on his radio interview Tuesday that they didn't find out about the maintenance worker until they finally got around to interviewing him a few days ago (because there were so many others they had to interview first). How was he not a priority interviewee? That might make sense if he'd never interacted with the police during the incident, but he should have been mentioned in the first responding officers' police reports, and therefore interviewed immediately. It just doesn't make sense that he was unknown to the police for a week after the incident, after hailing Jesus Campos a hero for being present, offering up his master key, evacuating guests, etc., if there was a second employee there doing the exact same thing. I'm not buying it.

       That story leads me to believe Campos and the maintenance guy retreated to the other hallway and waited for hotel security.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't get, (and we havent really heard Hotel security dispatch yet so until that comes out we can only speculate) hotel security seems to be on the 32nd floor during the shots being fired portion of the incident.  Why didn't they react?  They're armed.

       Door alarm was originally reported as another guest's room door.  Now they say it was the fire door to the stairwell.   Perhaps, simple miscommunication?

       Used to work in a hotel, 2 actually, and our guest room doors didn't have alarms. That struck me as VERY odd. I'm not even sure what kind of alarm it would be. The door being open too long? (Maybe to prevent people from accidentally leaving their door slightly open when they thought it clicked shut). But that would mean guest door alarms would go off frequently when people are transferring luggage in and out, or stepping outside briefly to take a phone call, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       My first instinct was that it was some sort of maintenance or service door, possibly fire escape door, that would have an alarm that goes off. All of our doors to off-limits areas for guests were protected by having us swipe our employee ID cards to get in. I don't think they were alarmed - they were locked so even if someone tried to get in who wasn't a worker, there were no alarms that would go off..

       Every industry has best practices, running a hotel isn't some crazy adventure unique from anything else. That doesn't mean 100% of all buildings owned by 100% of all companies in that sector operate exactly the same way, you're being intentionally thick.

       And "working at a hotel" doesnt mean you're privy to all security-related information like AC software which hotels in vegas have to a degree unrivaled by ANY other hotel destinstions.

       How is it not relevant?  The fact that hotel doors would have alarms is something that we all probably thought was strange, but maybe assumed it was some type of silent internal alarm.  But now we have someone who used to work in hotels confirming their experience matches our common sense, which is that hotel doors don't have alarms.

       You are contributing nothing to the discussion.  You also lack a grasp of the English language.  You claimed the stated information is not a "relevant anecdote."  It is indeed an anecdote, and its also relevant.  If you don't have anything to contribute then you're in the wrong place.

       I have to say I was skeptical you'd actually respond, being that nobody knows of hotels with door alarms.  But you've given us valuable information to work with.  I apologize for doubting you.  Now we can all abandon the question of why a security guard was checking on a door alarm that doesn't exist, thanks to the vital information of some asshole on the internet that the best hotels have door alarms.

       Wow, someone that worked at a hotel? Talk about insider information!

      <p>
       How about the fact that Vegas hotels have levels of access control that would make some banks shudder. And that "working at a hotel" doesnt get you ANYWHERE NEAR access control software unless you are acyually working physical security for the complex. You got shitty input that happened to align with your beliefs and stuck to it. Try to think a little.

       The type of alarm that would be triggered by a door being open is what the Access Control industry calls a Door Held Open alarm. This would require a door contact on the door and is generally set to 30 seconds. There are usually settings to extend this "Held Open" timer to be as long as you wanted it to be. So as an example if the door is opened from the inside (giving a Request to Exit) it could be set for 30 seconds. Where presenting your card (getting Access Granted) would trigger the time to be more like 1-2 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       This type of configuration requires a Door Contact and a Request To Exit device (potentially in the door handle, these can also be motion, think about the door opening at grocery store). I do not believe hotel rooms have this hardware (although high roller suits might?).

       Interesting. Good to know. I'm 99.9% sure our rooms did not have those - they would have explained this to us in training, so we would know what a room door alarm sounds like, and so that we would know what to tell security/maintenance when we called them to report the issue. We had something like a couple thousand rooms, (I don't remember the exact number), including suites that run several thousand $$ a night. Maybe Vegas hotels are different? Who knows.

       Generally it is not a sounder that you would hear, like an emergency exit alarm. Instead would be reported to the Access Control software where they could then dispatch someone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having a sounder for each door that could be held open where there are thousands of rooms would be both costly and very annoying to the customers.

       Aha! Gotcha. Regardless I'm pretty sure we didn't have those. Good info though, for sure. Would be good to find out for sure whether or not MB had those on their rooms...

       It would be highly unusual/likely for hotel rooms to have audible door alarm that the customers would hear if a door was propped open. What reviews are you referencing? Doing any search for Mandalay Bay is just vegas shooting related information.

       you'd have this sort of thing on fire doors and secured rooms (cleaning closets, linen storage, laundry chute rooms) not on a personal room.

       A lot of time, access systems are set so that door alarms only show up at the momitoring station,rather than setting off a full blown alarm.

       most hotel doors are going to have those closer arms to avoid the unclosed door scenario.
      </p>

       zero reason or chance a room would have a door alarm, in fact expense pretty much rules that out entirely.

       This is not entirely true. There are a lot of locksets out there that have this type of hardware built in. There generally would not be a sounder near the doors, aside from emergency exits.

       Here is an example where the lockset is $60-70

       Plus the police unit that entered the room said they removed the barricade device with a crowbar. First question  was it supposedly an emergency door? It would have alerted control when he went out it, then perhaps installed his barricade device, took the stairs down or up a floor then took the elevator back to his floor to continue his preparations. Control could had dispatched maintenence and security to check the alarm then this would explain why he fired on security, afraid they would discover the door had been tampered with and alert police before he could begin. Also, why a door secured shut would send a open door alarm to control. Not sure why they would say it was a smoke detector though.

       Right?! That bothers me so much. Like okay maybe he was already on a nearby floor and they dispatched him to 32 from there. But that implies he has a radio. So then why not use that radio to contact them as soon as he was shot?!

       Was mall security supervisor one decade. An officer doesn't leave the job site without permission. Ever. That's an infraction, and can get you a write-up &amp; maybe suspension or termination. When a guard is licensed and trained, the limits of their authority gets drilled into their heads: don't go off property, don't pursue off property; our insurance will not cover you, for one thing; get in trouble off site, buddy, and you're on your own. So there's a whole box of WTF in Mr. Campos apparently wandering the hall of Mandalay aimlessly. Someone needs to explain exactly what the hell he was doing.

       I would posit, there may be multiple people named Jesus Campos. Possibly even together in Vegas on the same night. The CSC guard lived in Fontana. No way he's running back and forth to Vegas 4-5 times a week for work. And On Scene Security, the team allegedly protecting Campos' house, is a Nevada company likely not licensed to have a guard in California. If he was in CA, he'd have to have a local company supporting him.

       The maintenance man was the one dispatched to the fire alarm door as would be the normal situation, generally a guest uses it by mistake rather than walking to the elevator or wants to get some exercise not realizing the stairwell is emergency exit only.
      </p>
      <p>
       The maintenance man came under fire as he got off the elevator.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shooting stopped and Campos peaked out from behind an alcove telling the maintenance man to take cover and that "someone was shooting".
      </p>
      <p>
       Campos killed Paddock and shot himself in the leg as a cover, then he saw on the video monitor the maintenance man was coming off the elevator fucking up his clean escape because he was still in the room, so he opened fire, missing him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now knowing the maintenance man was still alive and radioing for help, Campos peaks out from an alcove and tells him to "take cover" according to the maintenance guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another interesting thing is the reports of multiple witnesses that event security had closed off multiple entry/exit points that were open the previous days of the concert. Concert goers remarked how the places they entered with their passes before were now closed by chain link fence and they had to walk around the venue to enter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Possibly multiple members of the security team are radicalized, most of them are immigrants or come from immigrant families and may feel a certain type of way about this country, especially white, largely conservative country music fans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock may have been in on it, he had multiple burner phones to coordinate the attack or give to his accomplices. He was used as the guy who could deliver the weapons and explosives, the room, not raise any red flags etc, with them knowing all along he was going to be the fall guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guns and explosives in the car were for the other security team members, but they never planned to participate in the attack other than locking certain gates making it harder for people to escape, this wouldn't incriminate them at all. First of all why would anyone suspect security when a crazed gunman is shooting from a hotel suite? Secondly it's totally reasonable to close gates and claim that too many people were coming in and out the last couple of days and it was too hard to keep track of who had legit passes.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR Multiple members of the security force are part of a terror plot, Paddock was brought in as a lonely bitter old man who could get them what they needed and take the fall OR perhaps Paddock was just trying to sell them the guns for a big profit not knowing of the attack, either way he was setup.

       Yep and it also makes campos look more and more of a random anomaly. now most people got to ask themselves (before the FBI claims he was there just randomly in that hallway at that exact same time) did this CSC Event security, who was working the 91 Harvest Festival really just happen to randomly be at the right place at the right time in that hallway on that exact floor as this mass casualty event was unfolding, all the while he was suppose to be at the festival working?

       You can use google. Find me a source that says he isn't a mandalay bay security guard.

      <p>
       Or maybe they just hand out room passes and hotel radios to random strangers...

       And maybe the other mandalay employee present only recognized him as an emplyee he knew because the deep state paid him under the table....right?

       So you don't have to cite sources for your claims, but when I ask for a source for them that means I am now asserting the opposite assumption, for which I have to cite my sources for? Am I getting this right? I have to search google to find information that proves you wrong because you can't cite a single piece of evidence for your claims?

       Do you think the entities capable of carrying out an attack like this and then pinning it on someone else would be incapable of paying a hotel worker to lie about it? You were just capable of assuming, for the sake of argument, that Campos is compromised and complicit in the murder of 60 people, but the idea of the people behind that paying another worker to corroborate the story is apparently beyond what you can believe...

       TIL that citing that the Nevada Board of Private Investigators is not an employee database for a hotel in Las Vegas is reaching. It is also reaching to ask

       Bro this is part of the issue. You first say he was not in the database (insinuating that’s fact) and follow that with “I just heard he wasn’t in there”. This is why terrible misinformation spreads. I don’t mean to target you as a person, but it’s just pulling this community back as a whole when people keep throwing around the same ideas without evidence

       Not what I was saying, the initial story was that he wasnt in the database, then after pol was talking about it, larry jesus campos was mysteriously added in. But the paramaters being used the first time wouldnt make larry jesus campos show up as it turns out.

       I wanna play devil's advocate and point out that just because he was a contracted security guard for AN EVENT doesn't necessarily mean he was contracted for Route 91. Vegas is a busy city with lots of conferences all the time. Each hotel has it's own huge conference center. He may have been contracted for something inside Mandelay Bay. Do you know for SURE nothing was going on at the hotel that day? I'm having trouble finding any info on schedules for events that have already passed, so I can't say for sure, but just throwing it out.

       look at this thread as a perfect example of why the posters on this sub largely fail to correctly speculate on anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have droves of upvoted comments saying vegas hotel suites do not have alarms and that having them is ridiculous. Anyone who has worked in InfoSec or in any software-managed physical security system knows that buildings like that are absolutely fucking wired up to give every bit of information possible.

       alarms arent limited to loud, blaring noises when tbings are opened. It can be as simple as pushing a notification to access control software

       Yes, that was confirmed yesterday, listed under "Larry Jesus Campos" in the security guard registration, he's listed working for CSC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unconfirmed speculation is he's the one who escorted out the lady who warned everybody they were going to be killed &amp; investigated. Some disagree with that theory and have said CSC also does events inside Mandalay so he may have been in Mandalay anyway.

       What if he was just a piece of shit criminal with a security vest trying to use it to go steal shit? Poetic justice if he gets shot by a bigger criminal. Again no evidence but in my mind this is the only logical explanation for him being there unless he is involved.

       The reviews for the hotel also stated that that was rampant, that guests were regularly subject to shady shit like. Possible he was there to pilfer. Maybe he was shot because he tried to sneak into Paddocks room to pilfer?

       Wrong. I do look at MSM, but only as one type of source of many-- and note, they were not reporting accurately on the details of Campos and don't have a monopoly on reporting, research and investigation. So people also look at a variety of other sources &amp; theories.  This is a forum where alternate theories are discussed based on available evidence. Often theories are discussed as possibilities even if unproven.

       So new theory could be that he got wind of the plot and is actually a hero and went to try to stop whatever was going on on the 32nd floor, and then didn't know what to say without implicating himself and/or letting on to the bad guys that he found them out or turned against them.

       No there's zero source. But it didn't come from MSM so according to this sub, you have to believe it. Trust everyone but MSM they say, which I guess means blindly believing all the bullshiters too - as long as they don't work for MSM

       I bet his excuse for the delay in making a statement will  be weak. The delay is all about having his story fabricated and beat into him until be can recite it in his sleep. Hannity will lob preselected softball questions and TPTB will attempt to sew the new narrative up.

       I know. Can't believe it. I gave the armed security at his house the benefit of the doubt, like oddly fox was paying for it so no one could get the scoop before him. But he ghosted them. It's really perplexing...

       That he was on random patrol is already accepted of the narrative. I want source on him working for CSC. The official report is that he worked for the Mandalay.

       All I know is that it was linked from newsweek. I suppose people could check to see if they have an employee by that name, but I would imagine if this was fake CSC would have already gotten on it and asked it to be taken down (since I would assume they read the articles being published about him).

       Quite a bit has came out in the last day. It seems they tried to add him into the MB database directly by the CEO which is very strange. Another user found a connection between the Gofundme and a security guard at Mandalay Bay ..

       I just looked. Very well done. You are onto something though i don't think its the same person it could be a brother etc. Connecting them both to Security at MB is huge and i would follow that lead if i were you.

       Same argument I keep hearing over and over again for everything that happens. There are about a billion explanations for why the person who wrote the description for the fundraiser might have used the phrase "random patrol", but the only one who knows for sure is them. If you really want answers, you're asking questions in the wrong place.

       It sounds exactly like what security would call it. When I was working for one of the casinos, if someone asked what I was doing I'd text back "Just random patrols. Nothing exciting."

       Throwing this guy out there a week later after he's had time to practice, nice job FBI. I'm going to be listening for deadpan delivery, repetition of "key points", and alot of ball licking by Hannity telling ol Jesus "he's a hero". Why no TV interview yet? Campos is probably a bad actor, so that explains his first appearance won't be televised.

       they said Paddock bolted some kind of bar on the door way to the fire escape. He probably left it open too long, or left it ajar (like that said) and the alarm was going off.

       It is, and this sub is wrong. Larry Jesus Campos of Fontana, CA was not working hotel security for Mandalay Bay. It would not happen. They need local people that they can depend on. One of the requirements is to have a Nevada drivers license or obtain one within 90 days.

       Here is what could have happened. Remember that rumor that a woman was going around saying, "you are all going to die."? so that woman was the prostitute that was with Paddock. She either tells Campos or Campos over hears her saying this warning. In both scenarios the woman makes him swear on his life not to reveal who she is for the information. He agrees and then makes is way up to the 32nd floor.

       This. Sifted through comments and
       <em>
        surprised this is not higher up
       </em>
       . IF he was in fact an employee of that company (i saw reports of that on /pol/ days ago but never sure what's real) and assigned to the concert THEN the report by "that lady screaming that everyone is going to die is escorted out by security" gives Campos a reason to be up there and knowing the location.

       NO .. Stop helping form a ridiculous narrative. We are taking speculation and the proven lies they have given us and trying to make it fit what we "think we know" We can't make ryme or reason of it because the entire story was fabrication from the beggining . Ask the Important questions..

       So let me get this straight ? This "security guard" who we apparently now going to assume was actually working the event across the street.. "Overrhears a random prostitute" that ends up being the biggest whistle blower of all time mind you and takes it upon himself to walk across the street by himself.. Mosey on up to the 32nd floor just to be shot by "paddock" thats the logical reasoning you come up with really?

       Ok here goes. I don’t have any solid evidence or sources to back this up, but there are a few things being conjectured here that I will refute. I live in Vegas, and for some time have done some contracted non-security work so here goes:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         If Campos was working the concert venue, then he had no business at the hotel. These security guys who work these events are mostly there for crowd control, maybe to enforce some disputes with policies from the event honchos etc. , not there for any investigative function whatsoever. They don’t make much bank. Most are either power junkies who get off in a little authority, or someone who is a wannabe law enforcement officer, or filling in to make extra money to support family. They usually don’t get full time hours. The work is sporadic. So the notion that he left to follow up on the crazy we-are-all-gonna-die lady is not true. He would not have been asked to do that. If he took that upon himself to do he would most likely be putting his job on the line.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Similarly, if he was working AT (not FOR) the MB to do security for the net app convention coming on Monday. He would be there to mostly keep people moving in the right direction, and more to keep attendees out of areas they aren’t supposed to be in. That’s their main function for a convention event. Mostly a supplement to hotel security, who have a broader responsibility.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Regarding that he was actually working for the MB. There is usually a non recruitment clause or understanding between the hotels and personnel contracting firms. A whole big process you have to go through if you want to leave a contracting firm. Not sure if this is an unwritten understanding, but it’s something you get indoctrinated into if you work many of these events.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       All this to say that his presence on the 32nd floor is totally unwarranted based on what I know.
      </p>

       cSC website lists many services offered beyond event security - including guests services.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I brought the ‘license’ thing into this house and made sure that on all threads I introduced the topic (4 maybe 5) I went back to clarify my initial mistake: I searched the licensed guard data, but failed to see the registered guard data. There are two levels of guard registry. Another user found that detail and started a thread (that got archived for doxxing) on the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I apologize for the confusion my mistake caused and would ask that if you read a post miss-stating the facts, clarify it. And FFS don’t post the inaccuracy as a fact. Please and thanks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d like to clarify that:
The entry subject to the thread started by Elesium was always in the records, it was not added after the existence of said records was questioned.
      </p>
      <p>
       CSC offers more than just event security so its no stretch that they may have been contracted by MB resort.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has not been verified whether the entry for Larry Jesus represents Jesus Campos referenced by LEO and MSM
      </p>
      <p>
       It is spooky AF that the media appears largely OK with nothing more than mentioning a name of a key figure vs. their typical overzealous effort to get a story or interview. I swore I heard an advert this AM on FOX saying Hannity was going to interview the security guard tonight at 9, but can’t find anything on FOX or Hannity media to confirm.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are on to something, but lets do our best to fact check and confirm sources and work together on that. To that regard, h/t to user Elesium for finding my error

       Thx, appreciate the nod.

      <p>
       For reference - I worked in operations for this type of firm previously or I would never have thrown my hat into these conversations. I can't vouch for CSC or what their version of guest services entails, but I know from experience that hotel security (roaming halls, checking doors, yelling at little kids running around screaming etc) is certainly within the realm of possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       But - at the end of the day I'm just speculating, so I'm gonna drop it at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS - Hannity is indeed advertising that he's talking to the security guard tonight at 9. I have my dvr set......

       It is a very big stretch. Look up gaming control regulations for casino security. If he was in MB, as alleged, with keys, as alleged, he was working for Mandalay Bay. He was not contracted, because every security guard that has access to a gaming space or back of house area must be licensed by the gaming control board, and they don't license contractors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find a gaming registration for him, not a PILB license, and then your argument holds a bit more weight.

       Good call out of the state codification of gaming, but hospitality is not the same as gaming is not the same as security. Having access to guest facilities does not mean you have brass keys or keys to the castle - it means you have access to hospitality operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Definitely want to hat/tip for challenging me - because it pushed me to dig further - found several articles that pointed out MB is the first casino in Nevada that has Unionized security - they organized and joined SPFPA last December. If, and at this point its a big if - Mr. Campos was on direct payroll, he likely was part of that union. Maybe that's why he's mum on details.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically - watched the full hour of the Hannity program on Fox last night because they advertised that the host was going to interview Campos - but the entire show covered Weinstein mess - not a peep about the hero security guard. Grrr....
      </p>
      <p>
       From Nevada Code:
NRS 648.013  “Private patrol officer” defined.  “Private patrol officer” means a person engaged in the business of employing and providing for other persons watchmen, guards, patrol officers, uniformed officers to control traffic, bodyguards or other persons for the purpose of protecting persons or property, including armored transport, to prevent the theft, loss or concealment of property of any kind or to investigate the theft, loss or concealment of property the private patrol officer has been hired to protect.
 NRS 648.0155  “Security consultant” defined.  “Security consultant” means a person licensed as a private patrol officer or private investigator who engages in the business of furnishing advice on the proper methods and equipment for providing security and protection for persons and property.

       Suspicious if true, he could have lied because he was SUPPOSED to be working event security and snuck up into the hotel to meet with a woman or something.

       I used to do those yellow shirt security events, they'd get volunteers from my battalion in the Marines, and the money we earned went towards our ball and other events. There wasn't very good accountability, I would generally disappear as soon as possible whenever I had an opportunity to not get caught.

       Ok this thread seems to be starting to do more harm than good.. Can we please stick to FACTS and ask the pertinent questions.. I keep seeing people making ridiulous excuses as to why he would have been on the 32nd floor and we can't come up with an answer .. Why is that ?? He wasn't supposed to be up there that is why! Regardless of whatever ridiculous "he was playing the hero", "he was seeing a girl" or other ignorant logic you try to use to reason why someone would just "happen to be there" does not make it any more plausible. This is how so much misinformation spreads and why noone takes us seriously.

       I agree, seems weird that he was even up there. If he truly was CSC and staffing an upcoming event at the hotel, why be 32 floors up responding to a door alarm? If he was hotel security, what door alarm was going off and why? These are the questions we need to be asking.

       For me calling the first person shot a hero would only be true if the stairwell was full of blood because he flew down to alert others. His timeline (the current one) is troubling and opens up liability concerns for whomever he works for.

       why would Mandalay security let you in to the building?
why are you leaving your post to go to an unrelated building?

       Every hotel I have ever been to has a telephone at the elevators.  If he weren't directly involved and was an innocent bystander, he would have been able to notify the hotel and they would have known immediately where all of this was taking place.  Also, why would you stay on that floor if you were able to make your way all of the way to the elevators, you would get in them and leave the danger.

       They said he had a master key card that he lent to the police to evacuate guests on the floor. He had that master key that whole time, and so if, for whatever reason, he couldn't make it to the elevators, be could've easily slipped into any of the guest rooms and used the phone in there.

       It was never smoke. The sheriff refuted that rumor (which was born out of a witness interview on CNN) in one of the very first briefings.

      <p>
       Correct, but before this the story was that Paddock's door was ajar and Campos just happened to stumble upon it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        then it was a blocked door that set off an alarm.

      <p>
       This was never the story either, at least not an official one.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       In fairness, if you rewatch the press briefings, the various open door/door alarm stories can easily be explained by minor misunderstandings of a vague testimony. And I say this as someone who was so suspicious of the changing security guard stories that I began compiling a list of direct quotes from all the police briefings related to the evolving first responder and security guard stories (which I'll post here soon). What they actually said related to open doors and alarms isn't all that different... The major differences came from how we interpreted each version and the scenarios we conjured in our minds as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's indisputably shady about it though is 1.) how the security guard story is always the part of the briefing that the sheriff seems least confident in discussing, 2.) that the security guard's story doesn't match the police scanner audio, 3.) that the police scanner audio makes it sound like the police were surprised to discover a wounded security guard already on the 32nd floor, and 4.) this mysterious new maintenance worker who was apparently present for the whole thing but the police only just heard about now.

       Is there any link between Campos and the shooter? It could be one of those things where the security guard was trying to set himself up as the hero who saves the day so he gets job security.

       Two things. If you search Liliana Rodriguez Mandalay Bay, the first hit is the gofundme in which in the description it says she worked at Mandalay Bay (Obviously the description no longer says that). 2, I find it highly odd that it says "on random patrol".

       Who the fuck is saying he wasn't employed by MGM, who owns Mandalay? I am an employee for an MGM casino, am on their workday site and can see any other employee for any of their casinos. I looked up Jesus campos over a week ago when his name was first mentioned and he was in the workday system, and he still is to this day. Also I worked with Stephen Schuck who was the second person on the 32nd floor at a separate restaurant over a year ago, and he has vouched for Jesus Campos. These two men are not in on it and exist as actual employees just trying to earn a living. Anyone telling you all that he doesn't exist in the MGM system as an employee is giving you purposeful misinformation.

       Seriously we are in need of people like you to help debunk info that is not true as much as we need people to dig for the facts not being told to us.  Does he also work for CSC in the db? Because the only Jesus Campos on record with NV security guard public records works for CSC.

       Can you also tell us why he wouldn't be getting workmans comp and a big fat bonus from MGM / Mandalay?  Why would he have to rely on a gofundme campaign? Who is the person who's raising the money?

       Everyone is ignoring the fact they haven't let anyone speak to Jesus Campos and then all of a sudden a week later they just insert another character into the story to try to tie up lose ends?!?! As soon as i saw this i wondered how they would get another smiling face on T.V. que the newly introduced "Supervisor" .. This is ridiculous.. Its all make believe and even we are eating it up like they knew we would while they prep for War with Iran.. Smh NOW they will prolly release the terrorism connection and claim they were somehow connected to Iran..

       Does anyone else remember that witness girl who reported a Hispanic woman saying “they’re all around you, you’re all going to die tonight”, about 45 minutes before the shooting started... and then she said this Hispanic woman was escorted out “by security”. I wonder if Campos, who was supposedly working as event security, was the one who escorted her out... wouldn’t that be considered “random patrol”?

       Interesting. Good to know. I'm 99.9% sure our rooms did not have those - they would have explained this to us in training, so we would know what a room door alarm sounds like, and so that we would know what to tell security/maintenance when we called them to report the issue. We had something like a couple thousand rooms, (I don't remember the exact number), including suites that run several thousand $$ a night. Maybe Vegas hotels are different? Who knows.

       You sound like a moron thinking vegas hotel suites dont have internal access control driven alarming/alerting systems. Just thought you might want to know. alarms arent limited to things that go "beep beep" on location when opened.

       you'd have this sort of thing on fire doors and secured rooms (cleaning closets, linen storage, laundry chute rooms) not on a personal room.

       if you did you would be getting alarms every 10 seconds in a place that big.

       This! Most door alarms I've seen are the push bar type or triggered by the metal plate above not making contact when closing.

       There are a lot of conflicting details out there, including as given out by the police and MSM and even from witnesses.

       Wrong. I do look at MSM, but only as one type of source of many-- and note, they were not reporting accurately on the details of Campos and don't have a monopoly on reporting, research and investigation. So people also look at a variety of other sources &amp; theories.  This is a forum where alternate theories are discussed based on available evidence. Often theories are discussed as possibilities even if unproven.

       It is, and this sub is wrong. Larry Jesus Campos of Fontana, CA was not working hotel security for Mandalay Bay. It would not happen. They need local people that they can depend on. One of the requirements is to have a Nevada drivers license or obtain one within 90 days.

       something else to keep in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of time, access systems are set so that door alarms only show up at the momitoring station,rather than setting off a full blown alarm.

       This is not entirely true. There are a lot of locksets out there that have this type of hardware built in. There generally would not be a sounder near the doors, aside from emergency exits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an example where the lockset is $60-70
