<p>Not that it is conspiracy related, but Trump seems like he is going to be making big moves soon in regards to both Health Care and Tax reform.</p>

<p>He took a shot at the media about whether they should have there license revoked, but again I think this is just another distraction like the NFL bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention the Tillerson calling Trump a &quot;fucking moron&quot; was corroborated by 3 people who were in the room at the time. His administration is on the verge of implosion as people in his own White House are going to the press and whispering that they are starting to think Trump is not mentally fit for the office. </p>

<p>Trump is also openly wondering, in public, and doubling down, that he wants to find a way to shut down news networks like NBC. The first thing an authoritarian tries to do is control and silence the press. In essence Trump does not want a 1st amendment anymore. </p>

<p>This place is getting spammed with McGowan and Wienstien because the T_Ders want to discuss any and everything BUT the impending implosion of the Trump administration.</p>

<p>The mods are allowing this place to get blatantly spammed with duplicate bullshit, letting the spam stand. The are doing a shameful job maintaining this sub right now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s because the Weinstein issue has politics in the narrative.  It’s an issue that allows one side to attack the other side, by putting a partisan spin on an issue.  Same thing happened on other side when Roger Ailes and Bill O’Reilly had their issues. </p>

<p>Since their doesn’t appear to be political motives to the Vegas shooter, people have lost interest because it prevents them from attacking their perceived political enemies.     </p>

<p>It pretty much highlights that most people don’t care about the underlying problems or potential conspiracy, but only interested in events to help them advance their political agendas.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are making the Weinstein issue have politics in the narrative which distracts from  the severity of the issue.<br/>
None of the initial takes should include the names Trump or Clinton, but that is what is being pushed right now and it&#39;s infuriating.
Even bigger than the twitter block is that NBC sat on the story for months and didn&#39;t run it, then they lied about why they didn&#39;t run it. </p>

<p>We have a major media outlet conspiring to protect a wealthy predator possibly for years and that itself is newsworthy and conspiracy sub worthy, but they are muddying it up with their partisan b.s.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>because it&#39;s a legitimate conspiracy that the news orgs have been ignoring this story for so long. 
NBC killed the story because they conspire with the predators. 
The mainstream media was never going to report the truth on the Awan brothers or the Vegas incident and now they are now being forced to report on a major injustice that they&#39;ve all known about and possibly had a hand in. 
It is perfectly legitimate that the weinstein story is topping this sub especially considering how everyone lost their minds when pizzagate started gaining traction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except most of those posts try to insinuate that he diddled kids by saying things like &quot;molesting women&quot;. Most of the people I&#39;ve seen post it are from t_d, and they&#39;re posting it because of his political affiliation. The guy may be a rapist, but it shouldn&#39;t appeal to pizzagate people, except that someone else in Hollywood is a rapist.</p>

<p>I agree with OP, there&#39;s plenty of other relevant stuff that&#39;s likely getting drowned out by constant reposts of the same stuff getting upvoted to hell. And the 4chan misinformation machine has been hard at work as well, getting tons of posts here.</p>

<p>I saw a post last night about the audio of the coworker calling in the shooting, and fully expected to see it on the front page.. maybe it is, but I&#39;ve been scrolling through tons of posts that look like they belong in r/sexscandles instead of r/conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not really finding anything interesting making it to the front page regarding the shooter, which is the one I&#39;m primarily interested in, but I&#39;m hardly keeping anything alive by commenting on it. Since it seems that there&#39;s even more posts regarding the shit today than there was yesterday, may as well comment where applicable.</p>

<p>The liberty act is in fact very important, but besides the fact that it exists and we should do something about it.. besides spamming the sub for visibility, I don&#39;t know what anyone would post about it. And the awan case, I haven&#39;t seen anything that wasn&#39;t from 4chan, anything that&#39;s actually official..</p>

<p>But then again, front page taken over by tweets related to one kind of sex scandal or another. I&#39;m simply not seeing anything you mentioned reaching how far I&#39;ve scrolled.</p>

<p>Upvoting these posts are what actually keep people from seeing the things you or I are interested in.. tell people to stop upvoting spam, rather than blame me or whoever else for commenting on them.</p>

<p>Still, the Cuba thing is confusing with a news report claiming &quot;mass hysteria&quot; only to be immediately undermined with the audio recording released today. Something is fishy in Cuba, and I wish the sub was paying more attention to that as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get what you are trying to get across, and I&#39;ve discussed it in person with others. But if anything I think the terror attacks damaged actually the Tories. </p>

<p>They tried to play all big and tough on security, and we had two attacks in the span of a single election campaign. Suddenly things are no longer safe despite the Tories assuring us that we were. Jeremy Corbyn&#39;s response to the attacks actually showed he had that &#39;&#39;Prime Ministerial&#39;&#39; flair opposed to Theresa May&#39;s robotic charm. And at least around my parts people were shitting on her for the response to the terror attacks i.e. calling in the army, especially given that she was the former home secretary and that a shortage of armed police officers is largely the result of her budget cuts the police. </p>

<p>Then she got through by the skin of her teeth and the DUP coalition and Grenfell happened. Why the Tories have not cannibalised her yet is beyond me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, there is the fact that the POTUS is a Russian agent. </p>

<p>He just missed the deadline to enact Russian sanctions that were passed by an overwhelming majority in Congress. Has yet to take any action on election hacking.

<p>The US government has been infiltrated at the highest levels by Russian mobsters, yet all <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> wants to talk about is how Weinstein groped some actresses.

<p>LOL what election hacking? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Voter purges, targeted social media manipulation, trading sanctions relief for &quot;dirt&quot; on HRC, etc. It would take days to write out all the stuff that has been uncovered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you even kept up with the official investigation into the &quot;Russian collusion&quot;? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. I read up on it every single day. It&#39;s the most insane political saga of my lifetime, and so I feel it&#39;s my duty to know the facts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They haven&#39;t found shit, nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The amount of shit they have found is staggering. Session lied about meeting with Russians, then admitted it. Then he lied about meeting with Russians a 2nd time, then admitted it. Then he lied about meeting with Russians a 3rd time before admitting to it. Trump Jr. lied about the meeting with Natalia
Veselnitskaya and got busted. Trump got busted <em>telling</em> him to lie and what lies to tell about it. </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s campaign manager Manafort has been busted on multiple accounts of literally acting as a Russian agent. His National Security Adviser Flynn has been busted lying about Russia and working for Russian interests while in the WH. His foreign policy adviser Carter Page has been outed for working for Russian interests. Kushner hid so many meetings with Russians (that later came to light) on his security clearance forms that the director of the National Background Investigations Bureau said he has never in his life seen such a level of omissions. </p>

<p>Trump said he and his colleagues have no business interests in Russia. But the Trump Tower Moscow project has been ongoing the entire time. Trump has refused to enact the Russian sanctions that Congress passed in a landslide and Trump himself signed into law. He let Russian State media into the WH with loads of recording equipment and other electronics while banning the American media. </p>

<p>One of his very FIRST acts as president was to get on the phone with Putin, in private, with no transcripts. While that&#39;s not a crime, it sure does point to where his allegiances lie. </p>

<p>These are just a few things that have been found. It would take days to type it all out. And that doesn&#39;t even count the obstruction of justice that goes on top of it all. </p>

<p>The only way to think there is nothing to the Russian allegations is to bury your head in the sand. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They are down right now to trying to blame Facebook for some potential Russians taking out 100 grand total in ads that weren&#39;t even for or against Trump or Hillary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You haven&#39;t even seen the ads, as facebook hasn&#39;t released them. In fact, facebook deleted a lot of the info about them. And it&#39;s not just facebook - it&#39;s twitter and reddit and other social media platforms - even instagram now. And social media ads are just one part of the election meddling. Voter rolls were hacked and liberal voters were purged - enough to swing the election even without any of the other methods. Then, there&#39;s all the fake news that weren&#39;t ads but were fake user accounts. </p>

<p>There is a mountain of evidence that Trump colluded with Putin and his associates to steal the election in return for favorable treatment. And that&#39;s just what has become public knowledge. Mueller&#39;s team has been extremely tight lipped about the other evidence they have, including what came from a no-knock raid on Manafort (those only happen when there is credible evidence that a crime is <strong>in progress</strong> and there is a real threat that evidence will be destroyed). </p>

<p>Keep your head in the sand, though. Fortunately, it doesn&#39;t matter one bit if you believe reality or not - Mueller and the FBI aren&#39;t going to ask you permission to indict these morons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Activity at Buckley Air Force Base has been way up again the last 2 months. Lots of alerts,helicopters,and something I only saw before Iraq they are training/flying in formation. The school across my street is being used for dry run bombing runs day and night. The night activity has been way more than usual.  </p>

<p>I live a few miles away and have for ten years. Long time neighbors have even commented on this without me bringing it up. Something is up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think North Korea. I do know that NATO pilots were there for mountian training a while back. There have also been a number of C-130s flying in and out. Plus a few months back Air Force One circled my house 8 times at a very low level doing touch and go&#39;s at the base. The reason given was it was practice for high altitude landings. I have lived in Colorado for 43 years and have never seen that.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans are a collection of energy centres, our society has directed our perceptions over the last few hundred years to deny all but the physical aspect of ourselves. Society is ruled by a secretive cabal who engineer social values to attack and block those energy centres making us all physically and mentality ill. They have usurped scientific institutions to discredit the electromagnetic nature of our cosmos and have erased our ancient history so we are unaware that we are these beings of energy with unlimited creative potential. They are also using geoengineering practices to make our planet less habitable to life and have hidden the truth about cataclysmic cycles that are part of our solar system.</p>

<p>Everything else is just circus. </p>
