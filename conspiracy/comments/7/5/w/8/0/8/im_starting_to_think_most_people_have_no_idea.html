       As a long time Ron Paul supporter I find these hard to believe.

      <p>
       When he ran is 2012 he would speak to stadiums of 10-20K college students all over the nation. He spoke in detail of the federal reserve and why we need to audit/end it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the idea that we are trillions of dollars in debt to a multinational banking cartel who runs every government on earth is too much for most people to handle, so they sub-consciously reject it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's all the fluoride in the tap water and aluminum in the air blocking their penial gland, making them docile and compliant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe they are just NPC's programmed to never be able to grasp any concept more complicated than eat, fuck or die. (hologram theory)

       <br/>
       Too many people for sustainable habitation of earth?
       <br/>
       Too many people to try to get an urgent message to when you can only address 10,000 at a time?

       I believe the mind control also comes through their cell phones , video games, social media. Somehow these people get so emotionally attached to their beliefs that mentioning the fed is not government challenges them and their cognitive dissonance is literally painful. I especially notice it with professionals such as doctors and lawyers, they are so smart on one hand yet lack basic common sense and literally believe any cockamamie story the official institutions tell them. It's pathetic. So much for higher education. What a joke.

       Last year in my advanced accounting class, we went over how the US still uses the gold standard to back the currency. After class I went up to my professor and told her the gold standard was abanadoned in the 70s. She gave me a curious look and didn't understand.

       By the way this was also an accounting class (advanced accounting).

       I understand now as I spent a day at KPMGs head office in SYD for uni. All they did was talk about first class working conditions (not terms) and how forward thinking they are and blah blah blah.

       They do have a nice office though taking the top 7 or 8 floors of a 40 story building over looking the Darling Harbour. However, When I spoke to their "leaders" they were creeps and you could the women that worked for them had sold their souls. It reminded me of this scene

       Yea, I had friends and family work at all of the 4 except Deloitte. If you can stomach potential 80 hr work weeks without any additional compensation of appreciation for it, go for it. Big 4 experience is very highly valued...but I think it's highway robbery that those companies take advantage of that intangible experience instead of paying people on the ground level what they are worth.

Anyways, it really did happen.
Other than that, my university wasn't that bad. It's a major recruiting school. Not saying that makes it better than others, but they did well to build up the business school in such a short amount of time. There were quite some good professors there.

       You are correct the president I believe nominates the 7 member board of governors and from there nominates the chair. The board of governors is elected from sitting governors, number of which is I don’t know.

       Its a limited choice yes, but it’s still a choice within a system that congress has the power to override. Is it really all that much different than secretaries of the departments being nominated within the unelected beuracracy of that department ?

       I guess you are right. The difference between the secretaries and the FR director appointments go through the same beuracratic shannanigans. The only difference I see is that The President and appoint Mickey Mouse to be Tressury secretary pending Senate approval while in FR Mickey Mouse would have had to be part of the Board to be nominated

       The whole point in it being like that is so that the Fed is not controlled by any single branch of governement, creating an economic regulatory body that is independent from political agendas and allows for a stable economy outside of the politics of the rest of our government while still being subject to limited oversight from the Federal Governement. Would you really want the President crafting interest rates and fucking with the banking industry? It's actually recipe for disaster.

       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a federal agency. The Board of Governors regulates banks. It has about 2,000 employees, led by 7 governors who are nominated by the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Federal Reserve system also includes 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, each of which is a separate corporation, partly under private control by the member banks in the district.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost all of the profits of the Federal Reserve system go to the federal government.

       She's more right than you are. No one owns the fed, publicly or privately, but at the end of the day it's authority to exist sits with the United States government. It's treated as an independent entity in order to not politicize the economy, but it is fundamentally tied to the government. To say otherwise is to be flat out wrong. Do some non-conspiracy research into how a central bank works and you will realize that they are not some kind of boogeyman and that the anti-fed narrative is actually only there to serve the banks who are chafed by their controls and regulations.

       Correct! The Gov't cant tell the Fed what to do, but the Fed does report to Congress twice a year. Also Congress/President appoints who is in it, even if they have no idea who they are voting for. Also, any surplus made by the Fed goes to the Tsy as well.

       The Fed expressly cannot loan to the government. Older CBs were able to do this and it had terrible implications so they don't allow it. The government sells the FED treasury bonds but that is totally different, that's technically an investment not a loan and has an interest basically equal to inflation (only slightly higher because of time value of money)
      </p>
      <p>
       The loaning the FED does is at the discount window to banks, with collateral, who are solvent but are too illiquid to borrow on the overnight market.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a ton of misconceptions of the fed mostly from people's lack of understanding that printing cash and creating money are completely unrelated and that the Feds interact almost complete with only banks, the only interaction with gov is purchasing T bills that it can use to regulate money supply by influencing the reserves banks hold vs the reserves they loan out (banks are the ones who ACTUALLY create money)

       The president DOES appoint the Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. I'm not sure who pays their salaraies, but the 12 banks that make up the Federal Reserve System are privately owned. the Board of Governors supervises and regulates the operations of the Federal Reserve Banks. But I don't know to what extent.

       Yeah and the only reason the board of governors is taxpayer funded is to make sure their decisions are best for he public and not for the Feds profits. Also because they do a lot of oversight on banks that the gov made them do after Great Recession

       that the law specifies who owns the Federal Reserve Banks.

       I'm sure after reading that you went and looked for evidence that the Rothschilds owned the Federal Reserve and found ... nothing. Because it's a hoax.

       Not sure why dude is shilling for the Rothschild family. He probably thinks everything is a hoax because he goes to factcheck.org. 
Can't dismiss the fact that they are definitely involved in banking corruption schemes.

       The Rothschilds were the richest banking family of the nineteen century. Some of the stories about them are true and some are false. You have to actually examine each claim separately. Just because you hear  "Rothschild" and "bank" in the same sentence does not automatically mean the sentence is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th pictures you give are about David and Louis Rothschild. I had never heard about them before tonight, but I researched them and, guess what, they're not from the European banking family. They are from a Cleveland, Ohio furniture family, maker of bar and restaurant fixtures. David Rothschild was sent to prison in New York and died there.
      </p>
      <p>
       For some questions about Rothschilds or banking, it's hard to tell what the truth is. The question about who owns the Federal Reserve is not a difficult question, though. It's written into the law.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who claim that it's really the Rothschilds are never able to present any real evidence.

       It's decidedly not owned by the federal government, but chairmen are "appointed" by the government, and the government regulates it. Even if it were a government organization, that really wouldn't mean shit. It's not like the government itself isn't owned.

       The only issue with this post is that the Fed expressly cannot loan to the government. Older CBs were able to do this and it had terrible implications so they don't allow it. The government sells the FED treasury bonds but that is totally different, that's technically an investment not a loan and has an interest basically equal to inflation (only slightly higher because of time value of money)
      </p>
      <p>
       The loaning the FED does is at the discount window to banks, with collateral, who are solvent but are too illiquid to borrow on the overnight market.

       They don't believe you becuase you are  more or less wrong and I'll informed. The Fed is a quasi-governemental entity that is under governmental oversight but operates and makes decisions independently.  No one owns it, it does not have shareholders, or make profits, it is essentially the an e onomic regulatory entity and the bank for banks, who have to settle up with it every day to keep things on the level. Seriously get your info from reliable sources, shit even Wikipedia, instead of conspiracy videos and you will realize how fucking boring the Federal Reserve actually is. They are too cozy with the banks they are supposed to be keeping in check but otherwise it's not what you think it is.
