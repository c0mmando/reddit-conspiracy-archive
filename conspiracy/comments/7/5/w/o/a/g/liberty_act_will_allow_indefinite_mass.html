    <div class="md"><p>And all that stuff you mention relies on a functioning US infrastructure to remain operational. Beyond that, the military needs stable suppy routes, parts manufactured, technical experts to troubleshoot the problems with this advanced tech, and a functioning chain of command. Even if 80% of the chain of command remained intact, all sorts of miscues and mistakes would ensue.</p>

<p>They would be facing an enemy that vastly outnumbers them, one that is better armed than any enemy they&#39;ve faced in history (just watch illegal arms come pouring over the Mexican border on top of what the citizens have already), an enemy with no face- guerilla warfare on steroids, and all while there supply lines were in total chaos. Such an event in the US would cause chaos in the world markets, collapse the US dollar, trigger regional wars where US presence no longer existed, would result in significant destruction of infrastructure, great increases in the spread of disease, sanitation issues, power outages, and a complete destruction of the US on the world stage (at least for a time).</p>

<p>The US citizenry would only have to hold out for a short period of time before they won.</p>

<p>Regardless, there absolutely must be another way. There must be a peaceful way to change things. Calamity from this tyranny will need to motivate the People, but the People will absolutely need to avoid such a war at all cost. A voting revolution, a complete upheival of political correctedness, mass sweeping peaceful protests even in the face of police brutality.. something that peacefully changes the game. If that war happens, the entire world will suffer worse than it has since WW2, and the US will have suffer more than it has since the Civil War. That war is a nightmare if it ever happens... </p>

<p>Obviously &quot;written&quot; is a slight bit of hyperbole as its more accurate to say that such laws had been being pushed for quite some time, and 9/11 seemed to be a situation that allowed them to quickly and easily push through a lot of laws they had been kind of hanging onto for a long time anyway, written up in a litany of ways in previous bills.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s really more the idea that the core ideas and legal propositions within the PATRIOT Act had been written down in various ways and times before and the PATRIOT Act became a sort of amalgamation of former anti-terrorism bills that had failed to pass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Redpilling people really is the best way forward. Any violence or civil-war debauchery will run straight into their hands.</p>

<p>They are experts at violence, you cannot beat them at their own game. You cannot expect to fight a war with them - you would only be fighting a war with other people that are still brainwashed! That is what they want, for the people to go to war and kill each-other while they wait in the background.</p>

<p>Think of it like a virus - humanity needs to literally evolve above this. Even if every member of the elite were wiped out, the very mentality, the very level of consciousness they came from would literally spawn a new range of psychopaths hell-bent on gaining power and wealth, whilst trying to rule the masses.</p>

<p>We need to evolve, not destroy or kill anyone (which is what some people think, not you that I&#39;m replying to, but I&#39;ve seen posts like that, posts that call for things akin to a civil war), that won&#39;t solve anything.</p>

<p>Spread awareness, compassion, love. Take care of yourself on all levels - physical, emotional, mental, spiritual. Help those close to you. Let go of fear.</p>

<p>We need to learn that things can be resolved through compassion, through working together, respect, cooperation. If we drop hate, anger, fear, despair....the darkness will be lifted and the new/old world order, the contrived system of insanity and greed will be no more.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It kills me that this keeps happening.  Here&#39;s what I think the problem is and how we should solve it.  It&#39;s the boiled frog thing.  I don&#39;t have to explain that to you guys.  PATRIOT act, CISPA, NDAA, Liberty Act, ect.. Freedoms have been whittled away at such a strikingly efficient rate for so long that people who were born <strong>after</strong> the patriot act will soon be voting with no understanding of the liberty some of us enjoyed in our youth.  When we talk about the freedoms we are <em>going</em> to lose, the normies aren&#39;t interested because it&#39;s the same tired shit they&#39;ve heard all their life from foil heads like us.  Yet we keep droning on about these up and coming government oversteps with a tone that we&#39;ld be deluding ourselves not to admit sounds like dry, alarmist bullshit.  It always is about the new up and coming overstep with us, and then that new thing soon becomes passe&#39; next time congress comes to session.  Our problem is that we keep drawing lines in the sand, and those lines keep getting crossed. We don&#39;t do enough about the freedoms we&#39;ve already lost.  The solution is that we need to be complaining about those bills that have already been passed and demand they are repealed.  We need to paint a <strong>clear</strong> picture for the next few generations of how hard we&#39;ve already been fucked, and then not shut up about it.  The Liberty act is a crock of shit, but we should be spitting just as much venom at all those other injustices we&#39;ve suffered over the last couple decades. If we had spent the past 15 years fighting the patriot act as hard as we fight the <em>new</em> threats to american freedom, we&#39;ld have been rid of this shit 10 years ago.</p>
