         The lack of absolute fucking carnage. Spare me one video that could be a cadaver. It's gore porn. Machine guns at that rate would have left a trail of smoke, blood, bodies and guts that would still be smoldering. The blood and guts would have caused a stampede unlike anything close to what we saw. People standing around in a war zone? Give me a break.

         The brother, Eric Paddock. Clearly acting. No question. So if he is an actor, then the idea of his brother being involved is simply part of the play. The idea of being set up as a patsy is a false narrative. It was a hoax.

       if you give it a bit of time all death records get recorded.  on their
website,  which is public, not one death will be recorded
from this incident.
just like sandy hook.  not one death certificate recorded.   the mayor is being sued cuz he was in on it.

       I dont know a whole lot about guns. Ive shot hunting rifles but nothing else.

       But my common sense tells me that with the fire rate that a bumpstock adds to a rifle, we literally should have seen people shredded.

       If you take one in the stomach, at the kind of fire rate you're going to take a few more with it surely?

       Ah man I wish I could find it but on CNN the other night one of the crisis actors said he came across a girl who had been hit in the abdomen, so he picked her up and threw her over his shoulder... and they said they threw another guy in a
       <em>
        wheelbarrow.
       </em>
       There's even a picture of the
       <em>
        wheelbarrow
       </em>
       in the aim4truth article I linked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another guy who is supposed to be the usual "Iraq vet hero" of the event says he knew that the trucks used by concert officials should have the keys still in them, so the
       <em>
        first one
       </em>
       he tried just happened to have the keys in the ignition and he was able to drive 30 people to the hospital by stealing a truck.

       I have an AR15, and have shot and AR15 with a bump stock, it is not a fully automatic weapon, you still have to pull the trigger multiple times. The bump stock allows you to shoot at in creased rate but still does not turn it in to a fully automatic weapon like you hear in the audio from the shootings

       Analysis of photos from the scene show the usual standing around and goofiness you see in drill situations. This is the best and most thorough breakdown I've read about this event so far:

       People are getting carried away with multiple shooters and all that when it's being promoted by the very crisis actors who are being broadcast on MSM networks:

      <p>
       They are frantic to make people believe at the very least that people were shot when there's no reason to even think that anything was shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had what must have been 10 people tell me they know someone who died, yet no one can even show me a picture of bullet damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       One commenter even told me he had
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74w7fk/multiple_people_in_the_crowd_saying_the_gunshots/do1o63a/?context=3">

       who died.

       Going on what i saw on a screen from a few thousand miles away, it looked like some injuries happened.  But im aware that i may well be watching a production.

       But as i said in my post above, not 1 injury that i would attribute to rapid rate fire.

       I'm all about questioning what we're told about situations like this but I think you have to be borderline retarded to think nobody actually died. Do you think the hospital didn't actually treat anybody or that trump visited crisis actors? It probably didn't happen the way we've been told but it really did happen...

       Evidence we require it and there is no fucking evidence that this happened  as it was shown.   it is complete bullshit and you would have to be a feeble minded imbecile that really enjoys horror movies as it never shows any actual wounds.

       give it time for more footage and evidence to come out before you start just assuming that this is some massive hoax. It seems like it would be easier to create a real situation like this and have it actually happen than it would to be to fake it.

       I'm pretty sure most people realize that he is full of shit, in fact, there's a subreddit for it.
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrumpCriticizesTrump/">
        /TrumpCriticizesTrump
       </a>
       This makes him a liar, not an actor. But I mean I guess it's more likely that trump is acting, the victims and their families were acting, the hospital staff that saw them all there were paid off or acting and so on. I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that a crisis actor has never been used but considering how many people were involved in this, I would say that it's unlikely.

       ok let me put it this way, it wasn't a hoax. There are lots of videos of it, lots of witnesses of it, police responded to it, the f.b.i. responded to it. You're claiming that there is this massive conspiracy in order to push some agenda, I assume, when it would have been vastly easier to maybe just set this guy up with some weapons and let him loose or just push the agenda once another mass shooting happened. It doesn't make any sense to fake this at all, none.

       anyway, I'm done replying. I can't convince someone who can't even humor the idea that there might be another explanation out there.

       I didnt see any drum magazines in the pics.  Regular 30 round mags.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this guy shot for 10 min as reported.   And shot 6k rounds as reported , tgat means he would have had to reload 200 times.  In 10 minutes.  Plus squeeze off 6k rounds.   My finger gets tired after 60 rounds with a stock .40s&amp;w handgun.
      </p>

       Even with 100 round drum mags, which i do not believe are a thing, but hypothetically, he would still need to reload 60 times to shoot 6k rounds

       Can you have them post pictures of the entry and if there was an exit wound. also if it was still in them, did the doctors collect the bullet? Bullets sound like evidence to me. If the round matches a AR15 round i'll buy it.

       One thing you wrote touches on a topic that interests me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you an actor? Are you a director? What is your experience with acting? I mean, are you experienced in the theatrical arts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to the popularity of movies and TV, many Americans watch a lot of acting. But acting is very different than real life.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we think is real is often what we think best emulates what we see on the screen. But the truth is that what we see on the screen is "acting," and in real life people's raw emotions and reactions come off as "bad acting."
      </p>
      <p>
       So I am very skeptical of the entire "crisis actor" rhetoric. It's interesting when one crisis has a witness that looks close, maybe even identical to another witness, named differently, of another crisis. That to me could indicate that there are "crisis actors." But then you have a couple of problems. First, there are people that look very similar to each other. Second, wouldn't these low-paid "crisis actors" have an incentive to do AMAs on Reddit and otherwise let the cat out of the bag.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about someone doing a request for an AMA on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       -- crisis actor, with verification (pic from an actual crisis). Open it up to actual witnesses from a crisis.

       I agree with you, sloppy sniper. I looked a bit at your comment history. I think we have a lot in common. I was not woken up by Sandy Hook, as you were, but it was early on in my journey and was the point where I discovered that hoaxed events were a thing. Like you, it shook me up. But it turns out it's just the tip of the iceberg. And no I'm not just talking about Boston and Paris and London and Brussels and San Bernardino etc etc. There is so much about the world around us that is hoaxed and managed and has been for centuries. If you're interested to learn more, first [read this paper.]
