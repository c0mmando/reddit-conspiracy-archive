       The other day I posted asking about the fuel tanks and how they seem to indicate that whoever shot was an amateur that acted alone.  Here is the text of that post:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "During the attack, a second window was busted open to allow shots to be fired at nearby airplane fuel tanks.
        <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/the-strip/las-vegas-strip-shooter-targeted-aviation-fuel-tanks-source-says/">
         https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/the-strip/las-vegas-strip-shooter-targeted-aviation-fuel-tanks-source-says/
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        These, of course, did not explode...but it is reasonable to think that an average man of that age would believe they might have. After all, countless movies and television shows during Paddock's lifetime would have conditioned him to believe that the tanks should explode when shot. The only alternative explanation I can think of is that this is an extremely sophisticated misdirection, but I doubt this because everything else about shooting the tanks makes Paddock look LESS like a solo amateur. A second window implies more than one shooter and the longer shot implies more expertise. The overall effect to the average voter is to weaken the mainstream narrative, rather than strengthening it."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Despite being in serious conflict with every conspiracy theory I have seen about this shooting, the post did not attract much attention.  However, a few rebuttals were presented as an explanation for the shooter's behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        1) The fuel tanks were not the target, they were hit accidentally as the shooter missed a different target.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The shooter busted out two windows.  One overlooking the venue where all victims were shot and another overlooking a parking area with the fuel tanks in the distance.  Photo evidence shows that the window overlooking the parking lot and fuel tanks was busted out first.  The most popular conspiracy timeline I have seen (
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/juaMQSU.jpg">
        https://i.imgur.com/juaMQSU.jpg
       </a>
       ) indicates sniper-like shots being fired out of this window prior to the shooter firing on the concert venue.  It was NOT busted out during the attack as the parking lot became more saturated with targets.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the shooter was not attempting to shoot the fuel tanks, what was the target?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        2) The shooter was aiming at people that had escaped the venue and were in the parking lot.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the shooter was using the window to aim at people in the parking lot, these shots would qualify as being unusually far off the mark.  When shooting down into a parking lot only a few hundred feet away, there has to be a significant malfunction to angle up so far that you hit a target two thousand feet away...especially more than once.  On top of that, he was using a tripod, severely reducing the chance of this sort of malfunction.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        3) The shooter was attempting to hit his van full of explosives, thereby igniting the fuel tanks.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The van was not parked anywhere near the fuel tanks.  It is possible that the shooter had part of the plan fall through and that the van was
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       to be there...but why did he still take the shot without it?  Was there a different van that looked similar?
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, if this was pre-planned by multiple people, especially a sophisticated organization, surely the shooter would have been aware that it was pointless to shoot the fuel tanks themselves should the van fall through...especially if these careful shots risked exposing his position before there was a chance to fire on the concert venue.  Regardless, so far we haven't heard anything about a van near the tanks being shot at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       All evidence I am aware of indicates that the shooter sniped at the fuel tanks a few times before giving up and moving on to the crowd at the concert venue.  These, to me at least, are clearly the actions of an amateur working alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theorists: what is your explanation for this?  Am I missing something?

       But the Mythbusters episode showed that only incidiary ammo fired at an extremely high rate of fire (ie a minigun) would ignition the fuel. Normal tracers didn't do anything.

       1) only 2 bullets apparently hit the tanks
      </p>
      <p>
       2) you can't blow up aircraft fuel with a gun, it requires to be mixed with a huge amount of oxygen.  its basically kerosene and even if you light it will a match it will only burn on top like oil
      </p>
      <p>
       All this leads much more towards the "it was a couple of stray bullets/ricochet" theory.

       If it wasn't the fuel tanks, what was he aiming at that required any sort of calculation?  With psuedo-automatic fire and a massive crowd, there would be no need for careful aim.

       yeah it seems strange to worry about those calculations when using a bump stock which basically causes the weapons to be super inaccurate and wild shooting.

       Who knows, there has a been a mysterious lack of information and photos from the event given there should be no 'legal case' to protect since the shooter is dead and allegedly a lone wolf.  There would be zero reason to protect evidence if that was really the case but for some reason they won't give anything out.

       If I was working a case of this scale, I would withhold information even if I was strongly convinced the shooter worked alone.  Keeping some details secret is very useful...it's a lot easier to find accomplices if they are saying things only an accomplice would know.

       I imagine that is standard procedure for murder/theft/any serious crime.

       The most thorough timeline I've seen had it at seven shots from the first window before he turned on the crowd.  2 out of 7 is a very believable accuracy for an amateur shooting at a target that size from 2000 feet away.

       I like the picture on your header. Finally someone took time to make a timeline and use data from all footage. Only problem now is the security guard who got shot, it’s been released now he got fired upon before Paddock fired into the crowd.

       I've always thought an accomplice was supposed to park the van next to the tanks, for him to snipe and detonate. The road goes right up to the fuel tanks, and it wouldn't be difficult to bust down the fence or the gate and park it right on the left side of the tank, in full sniping view of level 32:

       Paddock was caught off-guard by the guard. Fired a few rounds at the tanks to see if he could do it himself, then gave up and shot the crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       IFFFFF......there was an accomplice who was due to drive the van and park up beside the tanks, they may not have been ready due to Paddock being discovered ahead of schedule by the guard. Just a thought.

       The walls on those full tanks would be exceptionally thick, there would be no way .223 or 5.56 rounds would go through those, especially from that distance he was shooting from, hell, he’d prob have a hard time with a .50 cal from that range

       Exactly... Which was the point of my comment. He wasn't supposed to be shooting the tanks, he was supposed to shoot the van parked next to the tanks. Especially considering tannerite can be set off by shooting it.

       He wouldn't need a second window. The fuel tanks are clearly in view of both windows. This is all speculation, his van wasn't there, there aren't an abundant amount of dead people in the parking lot. Why are you just accepting that the fuel tank was shot, from a "knowledgeable source". They have no source and that article was false speculation, that's why there haven't been any follow ups. It's not real.
