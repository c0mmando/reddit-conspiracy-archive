    <div class="md"><p>They are intenionally making you chase your tail with all this disinfo because it was a hoax. The female cabbie video sealed it for me. That&#39;s scripted, you were meant to see that. Dan Bilzerian being a key figure in this? Go fuck yourself. The lunatic brother? Acting. Mike Cronk and his buddy who got shot in the chest three times but is doing OK? Ha! Fuck off with this PSYOP. The widower advocating for the 2A on Hannity the next day instead of tending to the headless corspe of his beautiful bride? Surrreee. More emotionless acting like every other hoax. IT IS TOO HARD TO KILL REAL PEOPLE. Lawsuits and subpoenas mean discovery and the real threat of getting found out. But never forget Smith-Mundt. It is legal to propagandize the public. The breadcrumb video of the couple of bleeding victims? You were supposed to see that. Actors or dummies. The constant conjecture over multiple shooters? You were meant to be focused on that. It was all fake. If you watch all the key pieces of evidence and interviews it will make sense. Like Boston and Sandy Hook, no one died.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My account is over a year old. I’m a Las Vegas resident. I definately think there is more to it than we are being told, but it isn’t a hoax. My boss’s sister was killed. THAT is very real and way to close to home for me. </p>

<p>It seems that all the “hoaxers” are way too confrontational. More than it makes sense to be.</p>

<p>Read my comment history. You will see that I comment on all kinds of things. I’m here because I want answers and ideas. But to claim a hoax, and just my opinion, is ridiculous!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have any comment on Sandy Hook or Boston, but I don&#39;t think it is too far fetched that people died in Vegas. As one of the accounts you called out for being a month old account said, it was most likely a false flag attack if anything.</p>

<p>And I also agree with him/her that people like you that will turn people off from maybe opening their eyes and/or admitting that shady shit goes on because they don&#39;t want to be associated with &#39;nut jobs&#39; so chill out dude.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not totally discounting you, (though I think it was a setup, not a hoax). That being said, even as you dismiss a ton of evidence you suggest we need to &quot;watch all t the key evidence&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in the &quot;arms deal gone bad (possibly expected by some higher ups)&quot; camp, given all the available information, and weighing it personally against my own biases.</p>

<p>Which evidence is &quot;key&quot; in proving it&#39;s an out and out PSYOPs-driven hoax? Not being facetious here. If you think there IS key evidence, I&#39;m willing to give it a look.</p>

<p>All I&#39;ve seen so far on that front is the same kind of speculative info we see after every event.</p>
