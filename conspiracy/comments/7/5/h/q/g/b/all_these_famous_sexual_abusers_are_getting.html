       I feel it's both.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's all look at something posted back in 2015 by a guy in a position to know:
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The Plan
      </p>
      <p>
       "The New Rome will fall just as the Old Rome fell.  So that the beings who created Rome could wash their hands of their creation, and start fresh.  Just as we did after The Atlantian Age."
      </p>
      <p>
       The above is considered a gift in the mind of it's author.  That I am writing here is not unknown. Most readers may have no idea, but "they" all know exactly who your author is. Back to the point. The above quote did not come from me. It came from the being who was meant to be my mentor.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it eludes to is the New Rome, which is to those who know, the "Cabal Capital Country". The heart of the "illuminati cults". Amaraka.
      </p>
      <p>
       A great deal of dirty illuminati secrets are being exposed at a rapid pace. Several "leaks" have been created and orchestrated to ensure almost all people, from the mainstream folks to the alternative info folks, know just how dark and evil this group is.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've all been told and shown proof of your enslavement. You've also been given all the truth about your own power to change it.  But the game is rigged no matter which side you choose to play it from. The only solution is not to play. But I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that the world is starting to see the devil, they will bring him to light and destroy him and his hell around him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enter the saviours. This has to be another country or government or secret ET allies, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Give the world a "White Hat" group, led by benevolent ET's, brought to the public in the form of a new group of political allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       BRICS.  "White Hats Groups". &lt;insert ET name of the month here&gt;.
      </p>
      <p>
       They will give you what you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once it's too late you'll remember..
      </p>
      <p>
       "Oh yeah, this is what THEY wanted too!!??!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Take the money away, replace it with a new system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take religion away, replace it with a new system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take all the Illuminati away, replace it with secret system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take your needs away, replace them with technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take your governments away, replace them with a new government system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take away the Old World Order, replace it with a New World Order.
      </p>
      <p>
       And here's the clincher..
      </p>
      <p>
       Take away your natural spiritual evolutionary process, replace it with a cybernetic transhuman artificial process.
      </p>
      <p>
       More of the finer details to come of course.

       Let's all look at something posted back in 2015 by a guy in a position to know:

       <strong>
        The Plan
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       "The New Rome will fall just as the Old Rome fell.  So that the beings who created Rome could wash their hands of their creation, and start fresh.  Just as we did after The Atlantian Age."
      </p>
      <p>
       The above is considered a gift in the mind of it's author.  That I am writing here is not unknown. Most readers may have no idea, but "they" all know exactly who your author is. Back to the point. The above quote did not come from me. It came from the being who was meant to be my mentor.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it eludes to is the New Rome, which is to those who know, the "Cabal Capital Country". The heart of the "illuminati cults". Amaraka.
      </p>
      <p>
       A great deal of dirty illuminati secrets are being exposed at a rapid pace. Several "leaks" have been created and orchestrated to ensure almost all people, from the mainstream folks to the alternative info folks, know just how dark and evil this group is.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've all been told and shown proof of your enslavement. You've also been given all the truth about your own power to change it.  But the game is rigged no matter which side you choose to play it from. The only solution is not to play. But I digress.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that the world is starting to see the devil, they will bring him to light and destroy him and his hell around him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enter the saviors. This has to be another country or government or secret ET allies, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Give the world a "White Hat" group, led by benevolent ET's, brought to the public in the form of a new group of political allies.

       BRICS.  "White Hats Groups". &lt;insert ET name of the month here&gt;.

       I actually think there has been enough information out there for long enough now that is enough layers down for enough people to be able to see the fake replacement establishment and reject it. When people realise the extent of evil that has been going on, the extent to which they've been lied to, it is much more likely that people will, in my opinion, reject transhumanism and seek to make communities smaller, power less centralised, technology less networked and easy to manipulate, and people will also feel a spiritual calling towards goodness that counteracts the extreme evil they've seen really does exist. I just can't see the crimes of the cabal being exposed and then people being happy to replace them with any kind of centralised world government or a society based on artificial intelligence. People will be so mistrustful, people will look to those who had been telling the truth all this time and they'll see all these theories and the warnings and, in my opinion, the natural inclination of people will be to live smaller and surround themselves in tight knit communities that know one another well.

       Bingo. This is what I'm hoping for. A more communal based society, taking what we learned the past 70 years, and fixing it. Not regressing in advancement, but correcting the ways we have been mislead. Returning to self sufficiency and working together wirh nature. Supporting one another as a tribe and working together. Ebracing the good and rooting out the bad. Re-establishing right and wrong.

       I think it is a New Age. What is making the difference? The internet. Victims are no longer being silenced by the institutions of power who have been protecting the pedophiles from the public for thousands of years. Now the victims are organizing to fight back with the thing the pedophiles fear most: public exposure.

       I think you're right, but the 2 possibilities noted here would be the likely extremes.  As usual, the real answer is somewhere in between.  For example, these people weren't necessarily targeted by their other pedo-friends but they fucked up somehow and got themselves exposed, and their friends aren't going to help them out of their own mess and risk exposing themselves.

       It has become a recent meme of which has been adopted by the cultural zeitgeist and more perverts will be routed as the meme grows stronger.  But, like any meme, it is mostly just a fad; we'll see more revelations, but only as long as it takes to propagate though the mind of the common man.  It will die once its appeal is lost.

       All of our evil social structures are going to fall apart. It will be replaced by parts of the world that will become enlightened (no financial system, no debt slavery, free energy, etc.). The other parts of the world will be run by the cabal in a way you see in future dystopian movies. One timeline collapses and becomes another. That's what 2012 is really about. This will happen over 10-20 years and has been gradually speeding up since 2012 and especially since the August eclipse. It's supposed to REALLY get crazy 2019-2020.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where you will end up after depends on how developed your soul is and if you're ready to ascend spiritually or if you still want a materialistic existence. Nothing wrong with either, just where your soul is at. Most of the population will ascend to 5D Tara in our next reincarnation or two.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is being exposed both by "white hat" factions of the government, military, intelligence, etc. But much of it is also happening naturally due to the cosmic energies being released on earth. In-fighting, evil vs evil, etc.

       I've heard this kind of thing in alt. info/revisionist/"conspiracy" info spheres and from the few others so inclined I talk to irl who have mentioned the idea of imminent forthcoming chaos and shifts in the coming years, most recently supposedly 2016, 17 and 18.

       They are different and you can feel the pace and charge of the events is slowly building.

       They're also in the majority so a lot of this stuff is only finally making larger impacts and inroads into mainstream narrative building and consciousness/awareness now "in the current year".
      </p>
      <p>
       I think therefore these "look out for (insert year)" fateful forecasts are increasing too with as someone above said these predicted apocalyptic dates simply being important markers of certain synchronised things beginning not

       Like 1999/2000, 2012, the previous Sept. 26 astro alignment portents, the harvest moon, solar eclipse this year and everything else......like the Nazca lines centering on Angkor Wat as their anti point on the globe, the astro-theo. megalithic sites all over the world and the culture/s that preceded them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has been going on on a timescale of movements and strategies far longer and possibly far more expansive than perhaps most of us will ever be able to appreciate.

       Keep in mind that many of the events he describes are PROBABLE on the timeline we are currently on. This can always change, so it can be better or it can be worse. Also, this book was written in 2015 so the timeline may have changed.

       Or we are seeing an actual, albeit slight, shift in the culture in Hollywood. Ever since Roger Ailes we have seen a growing trend of people less scared to come forward. O’Reilly, Farci, Knowles, Trump to name a few who have recently been outed as scumbags. Are there still major problems in Hollywood, oh god yes, but the last 12 months have begun to snowball where people are not taking it anymore (as much).

       I think things like pizzagate have helped - I imagine if you're embroiled in that culture it could feel like there's no way out or that no one in the world cares, like you're trapped or you're the only one who's afraid and wants it to stop - and then something like pizzagate happens on the internet, and you go read about it and knwoing what you know abotu the inner workings of things, you know it's a legitimate problem, and you see that there are hundreds of thousands of people talking about it, outraged about it, people who aren't personally affected by it but who desperately want to expose it, protect people like you from it and get justice for people like you. That must have been pretty empowering for a lot of people I imagine.

       I don’t think pizzagate has helped at all. Literally no victims have come forward because of pizzagate, so I don’t see how it could set an example for people to speak up, unless of course they see the word pizza in an email. 
I think believers of pizzagate are constantly searching for anything that validates their theory in any way. As evidenced by people claiming Weinstein validates pizzagate when one is a child trafficking pedo ring run out of a pizza place and the other is a scumbag producer trying to grope and intimidate grown women.
