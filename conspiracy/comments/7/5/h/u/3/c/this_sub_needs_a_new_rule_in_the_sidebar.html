I see far too many posts that belong in r/politics or r/news or some other sub besides r/conspiracy. I also see too many posts that have a complete lack of context and or are complete shitposts.     </p>

<p>The definitions of conspiracy and conspiracy theory are as follows....       </p>

<p>conspiracy
n.  An agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful, or subversive act.
n.  A group of conspirators.
n.  Law An agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime or accomplish a legal purpose through illegal action.        </p>

<p>conspiracy theory
n.  A theory seeking to explain a disputed case or matter as a plot by a secret group or alliance rather than an individual or isolated act.       </p>

<p>This sub has 17 mods, but I continue to see shitpost after shitpost and posts that simply DO NOT BELONG HERE. I don&#39;t know about the rest of you, but for me, It&#39;s really frustrating to see this sub so far off course.       </p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying is that r/conspiracy posts should have something to do with conspiracy and or conspiracy theory. If people want to discuss the politics involved in a conspiracy, that is more than fine for the comments section.

<p>There&#39;s a downvote button, use it.  I&#39;ve been arguing against moderation for years, this is one of that last subs that operates closely to r/reddit.com and I don&#39;t want more rules.  It&#39;s how they are able to censor stories in all major subs.</p>

<p>To a certain degree, yes.  There are very few, if any, examples of rules being implemented on a sub that didn&#39;t have a negative impact.  I wouldn&#39;t have a problem if they didn&#39;t can r/reddit.com, but now this is one of the few subs that doesn&#39;t censor topics based off of specific guidelines/rules.  You can block users who you think are spamming, you can hide posts, you can downvote them, but I don&#39;t want censorship from the mods in this sub in any form.         </p>

<p>Because I don&#39;t like censorship and have seen the rules over and over again used for that exact purpose.  I&#39;ve watched well-intentioned rules get out of hand over the years to the point you have mods in r/politics saying you can&#39;t discuss civil liberties in a politics sub...  Literally, they said civil liberties aren&#39;t considered politics.  </p>

<p>Also, the fact you said I shouldn&#39;t be allowed to post articles as data points is fucking nuts to me.  I&#39;ve been here since the beginning, doing the same shit, and now you&#39;re coming and telling me my posts should be removed.  Do you know how fucked up that sounds to me, because you can&#39;t handle some spam here or there.  </p>

<p>Why do you need me to spell out a conspiracy for you?  If you can&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on, then ask, otherwise you are more than capable of downvoting or hiding any post.

<p>Why should it have a clear connection to a specific conspiracy?  If a museam got robbed, we don&#39;t know who did it, but clearly there was a conspiracy by who ever did it.  You don&#39;t think that information should be discussed, even if there isn&#39;t a clear conspiracy?</p>

<p>Honestly, I would rather read that post than one more post that has absolutely nothing to do with a conspiracy or conspiracy theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the OP. But if someone is going to post something which appears strictly political (or any other subject) on a conspiracy sub, then they should provide some commentary behind the conspiracy connection and justification for posting it.</p>

<p>Another pet peeve of mine here is about low effort, no context shitposts (which usually get spammed). You think itâ€™s important enough to post, then it should be important enough to provide your thoughts around. </p>

<p>You want to clean up this sub, force people to give their thoughts about the post. The lazy fucking spammers will go away.</p>

<p>Why do you need me to spell out a conspiracy for you?  If you can&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on, then ask, otherwise you are more than capable of downvoting or hiding any post.  The fact you don&#39;t think people should be allowed to discuss topics or data that can be related to various conspiracies is kind of shocking, and yes authoritarian.    </p>
