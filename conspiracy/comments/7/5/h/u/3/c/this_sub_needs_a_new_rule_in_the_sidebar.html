       This rule should be that posts have to be about a conspiracy or a conspiracy theory. I see far too many posts that belong in r/politics or r/news or some other sub besides r/conspiracy. I also see too many posts that have a complete lack of context and or are complete shitposts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definitions of conspiracy and conspiracy theory are as follows....
      </p>
      <p>
       conspiracy
n.  An agreement to perform together an illegal, wrongful, or subversive act.
n.  A group of conspirators.
n.  Law An agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime or accomplish a legal purpose through illegal action.
      </p>
      <p>
       conspiracy theory
n.  A theory seeking to explain a disputed case or matter as a plot by a secret group or alliance rather than an individual or isolated act.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub has 17 mods, but I continue to see shitpost after shitpost and posts that simply DO NOT BELONG HERE. I don't know about the rest of you, but for me, It's really frustrating to see this sub so far off course.

       All I'm saying is that r/conspiracy posts should have something to do with conspiracy and or conspiracy theory. If people want to discuss the politics involved in a conspiracy, that is more than fine for the comments section. But the post...the REASON for coming here and startign a discussion should be focused on conspiracy...not politics...not news...not anything EXCEPT conspiracy....

       There's a downvote button, use it.  I've been arguing against moderation for years, this is one of that last subs that operates closely to r/reddit.com and I don't want more rules.  It's how they are able to censor stories in all major subs.

       I do use it, and i also report posts, but without there being a rule in the sidebar, I cant simply reference "rule x" in the reporting process. I get that mods get behind on their scrubbing, but shit has gotten out of hand, and is only going to get worst with the influx of news subscribers.

       I think adding a simple rule pointing out that posts should be about conspiracies and or conspiracy theories would greatly help in the process.

       I don't think so at all.  I post articles about various topics, that initially don't seem like a conspiracy, but it's a data point IMO.  That data can be used for various peoples research for various conspiracies.
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/72bphs/us_military_kills_17_isis_militants_in_libya/dnh9eou/">
        For instance
       </a>
       , it's a rule that has the potential to be abused.  I don't want heavy handed moderation,

       Datapoints are an important part of a conspiracy theory, but should not be the primary topic of a post on this sub. If you cant be bothered to directly link said data to a conspiracy or conspiracy theory in the post, then it does not belong as a post in r/conspiracy....

       To a certain degree, yes.  There are very few, if any, examples of rules being implemented on a sub that didn't have a negative impact.  I wouldn't have a problem if they didn't can r/reddit.com, but now this is one of the few subs that doesn't censor topics based off of specific guidelines/rules.  You can block users who you think are spamming, you can hide posts, you can downvote them, but I don't want censorship from the mods in this sub in any form.

       Because I don't like censorship and have seen the rules over and over again used for that exact purpose.  I've watched well-intentioned rules get out of hand over the years to the point you have mods in r/politics saying you can't discuss civil liberties in a politics sub...  Literally, they said civil liberties aren't considered politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the fact you said I shouldn't be allowed to post articles as data points is fucking nuts to me.  I've been here since the beginning, doing the same shit, and now you're coming and telling me my posts should be removed.  Do you know how fucked up that sounds to me, because you can't handle some spam here or there.

       Why do you need me to spell out a conspiracy for you?  If you can't understand what's going on, then ask, otherwise you are more than capable of downvoting or hiding any post.  The fact you don't think people should be allowed to discuss topics or data that can be related to various conspiracies is kind of shocking, and yes authoritarian.

       Why should it have a clear connection to a specific conspiracy?  If a museam got robbed, we don't know who did it, but clearly there was a conspiracy by who ever did it.  You don't think that information should be discussed, even if there isn't a clear conspiracy?

       You type a definition of conspiracy but fail to mention that the conspiracies that cause us the most harm, are political in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if not directly political, like glysophate and the opiate crisis, are caused, created and or abetted by political acts.

       I agree with the OP. But if someone is going to post something which appears strictly political (or any other subject) on a conspiracy sub, then they should provide some commentary behind the conspiracy connection and justification for posting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another pet peeve of mine here is about low effort, no context shitposts (which usually get spammed). You think itâ€™s important enough to post, then it should be important enough to provide your thoughts around.
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to clean up this sub, force people to give their thoughts about the post. The lazy fucking spammers will go away.

       And you should be the penultimate arbiter on what does or does not constitute a conspiracy?

       Dude...conspiracy and conspiracy theory have well established definitions...the simple fact is that there are a LOT of posts here that have nothing to do with either...

       Again.... its like going to r/pizza and making posts about meatloaf....go to r/meatloaf if you want to post and or read about meatloaf...I'm here at r/pizza to post and or read about pizza...as everyone else should be.

       All you've brought up are sweeping, ambiguous generalizations.  So what are some concrete examples.

       Yes. But its a rule that is commonly ignored by the mods and a secondary point to my post. Hence, "i ALSO see..."

        If you think your data is relevant to a particular conspiracy or conspiracy theory, point that information out in your post...that's all we're asking...for you to make the post relevant to the name of this subreddit...as opposed to just spamming data that may or may not be relevant to the purpose of the sub.

      <p>
       Why do you need me to spell out a conspiracy for you?  If you can't understand what's going on, then ask, otherwise you are more than capable of downvoting or hiding any post.  The fact you don't think people should be allowed to discuss topics or data that can be related to various conspiracies is kind of shocking, and yes authoritarian.
