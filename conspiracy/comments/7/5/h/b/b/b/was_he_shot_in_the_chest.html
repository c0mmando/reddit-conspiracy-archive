       Regarding the Last Vegas shooter.... My husband hadn't seen the death photo before. When I showed him last night, he said from his perspective the blood on Paddock's face looked like what he would cough up from a gunshot wound somewhere else. I hadn't mentioned the fact there are questions about a possible shot to the chest (he didn't see the full picture with the gun or his shirt-- just the face).
      </p>
      <p>
       My husband isn't a medical professional so I don't know how much credibility this posting gives to this theory. But, wouldn't there be more brain matter? Why in the world would he kill himself with a shot to the heart? Meaning.... did either the police or someone else kill Paddock?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: And, could this explain why NBC reported he may have "accidentally" killed himself while packing up his guns?

       He most likely shot himself through the mouth.  This hit the brainstem, and doesn't cause a lot of brain matter flying everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       It does look like he took a round centre mass, but that was most likely a result of SWAT once the breached.

       Would he still bleed from the chest shot if he was already dead?  I'd think with no pulse and gravity, there'd be little blood from the chest wound.

       There's still a level of pressure inside the body.  Fluids will take the path of least resistance, ie a hole on the chest.

       He would have shot himself in the mouth to kill himself if he was smart.  His heart would have kept beating for a bit causing it to pump out of his mouth. Blood from the lungs tends to be pinkish from so much oxygen and if it came from his stomach it would be chunky.  I don't think he was shot in the chest.

       Only thing I am sure of is the fbi will twist the story to meet their agenda and protect elites and their minions. We will probably never know what really happened.

       But the blood was super pink, there was a pinkish layer/pooling on top of darker blood. That's one of the most interesting things about the photos.

       Thank you for this information. I'll pass it along to him. Then again, I recommended this sub because he's having a lot of trouble finding many others that care about this anymore. No one is talking about it or asking these questions. Are people really so ignorant that they're satisfied with the explanation we've been given..... which is NOTHING!?

       I could not see a chest wound.  I can see blood on his chest that lines up with where his mouth would of hit if his head flopped down.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the health ranger is correct and I have no reason to doubt him and there was a second shooter than Paddock was a patsy willing or not and we are dealing with the same old gladio ff terror.

       From the picture it looks like he shot himself through the mouth and the gun landed on his chest. Then, the gun was moved/kicked away when police/swat arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, which position did he shoot himself in? Was he standing, sitting, or laying down?
       <br/>
       You can see from one of the leaked photos that there is a gun under him. He may have been standing up with it or it was already on the ground and he landed on top of it. Then, how does the gun land on his chest? Same for sitting; why would he be sitting on a gun and how does the gun land on his chest? So, I wonder if he was fully/nearly lying down when he shot himself.

       So, you're saying basically he "ate" the bullet? Killing himself by immediately shooting out his airway? Haven't studied too many suicides before.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the position, I told him the gun was found pretty far from the body and we both immediately concluded the same.... police kicking it away.  Actually, I'm kind of surprised they didn't cuff him as I thought that was procedure even if a suspect "appeared" dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the bipod gun (my husband is frustrated by the media constantly calling it a tripod)....that stumped us. The only reasonable way this could happen is if he was literally laying down when he shot himself, right?
      </p>
      <p>

       So, you're saying basically he "ate" the bullet? Killing himself by immediately shooting out his airway? Haven't studied too many suicides before.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as the position, I told him the gun was found pretty far from the body and we both immediately concluded the same.... police kicking it away.  Actually, I'm kind of surprised they didn't cuff him as I thought that was procedure even if a suspect "appeared" dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the bipod gun (my husband is frustrated by the media constantly calling it a tripod)....that stumped us. The only reasonable way this could happen is if he was literally laying down when he shot himself, right?

       I'm guessing he was shot through the roof of us his mouth in a lying down position based on what we are given. Did he do it? I don't know, because theres only a 16 minute difference between when the security guard found him and the shooting was concluded.

       There are a several inconsistencies with the gun-kicked-off-his-chest version of events.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The trail of blood shows a trajectory that includes at several changes of direction that don't make any kind of sense for a flying gun.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Blood coagulates. The whole point of coagulation is to stop blood dripping from wounds. Around the head we can see where fresh, flowing,
         <em>
          liquid
         </em>
         , blood has soaked into the carpet before coagulating. The blood trail is just as soaked-in to the carpet, and shirt, as the head blood is. There are no coagulated gobs anywhere along that trail. There are also far, far, too many drops in the trail for the blood to have been anything other than liquid at the time it dripped. It's simply not possible for there to be that amount of free-flowing blood at the time police arrived on the scene to kick the gun off his chest.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are no angular drops in the single blood trail, they are all round, nor is there any kind of splash. If the handgun was sitting in a puddle of blood, on his chest, deep enough to leave a blood trail like that, then there should also be some indication of splash near it's point of origin. There is no such splash. Blood flung off a flying gun goes everywhere and lands at an angle. The blood trail is a neat single line of circular drops. The drips aren't horizontal, they're vertical.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The volume of flowing blood in a single trail of circular drops, from the chest to the gun, seems much more suggestive of an injured accomplice dropping the revolver, at the time of death, than a police boot kicking it almost an hour later.

       Thanks for this in depth analysis. You seem to be our resident "Dexter" on this topic (no offense!).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, sorry, just to piece together what you're saying is.... you think it's likely (or possible) there was another person in the room with Paddock and (maybe) a struggle ensued? Resulting in a dead Paddock and an injured accomplice?

       I think that blood trail was left by an accomplice standing over him, after delivering the fatal shot, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       That isn't coagulated blood flying off an airborne gun, that trail is the result of fresh blood dripping vertically and probably from the revolver before it was dropped. If you have another look at the picture you'll note that it cuts off part of the gun. We have no way of knowing whether that trail of blood ends at the revolver or continues out the door.

       I agree with what you are saying. I am struggling to figure out how enough blood ended up on his chest to actually drip from the gun when it was moved. I'm starting to wonder if he was shot somewhere else first, before he suicided. It's hard to make sense of this.

       Laying down would make sense. He probably didn't want to hurt himself when he fell so laying down is the only logical conclusion. /s.

       This whole thing is strange. As long as people don't give up on their own personal and non LE investigations we may never know exactly what happened but we can absolutely put together a more feasible narrative than the one being fed to us. The whole thing reeks of coverup.

       Nothing really makes sense when I try to use the narrative we are fed. I try to stick to it as much as a possible, but it does not work for me. The guy has cameras set up on a food cart, but still gets caught drilling. He got caught about 2 hours before the show was going to end and he still wasn't ready. I can't find any evidence in all of the videos posted that he was shooting from either window. He didn't even need to knock out the window in room 134, because of the way the room wrapped around. The timeline can change whenever, so we can't even fully believe the narrative we are fed. We know little to nothing about anything leading up to the shooting. We start at a blank 6 minute window with the security guard and end at a suicided shooter with no motive. Nobody is buying it.

      <p>
       If he was laying down when he was shot, it's possible he may have been drugged. I can't think of an easier way to kill someone and make it look like a suicide. No struggle. It could also explain the gun positions. If he was drugged then shot prior to the 10 min spree the killer could've been frantically knocking stuff around. Not really noticing guns landing in ways that don't totally make sense.
