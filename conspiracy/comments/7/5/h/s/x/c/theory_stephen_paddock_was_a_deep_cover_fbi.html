        <h3 class="title">Theory: Stephen Paddock was a deep cover FBI agent/asset.</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">61</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/psy_raven.html">psy_raven</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This whole Vegas shooting is bothering me.  Too many loopholes in the narrative.  Complete blackout of any data relating to security videos or Paddock&#39;s personal life.  Too many vague details about how it was carried out.   Thus, I can not help but believe the following may be the truth.  </p>

<p><strong><em>This is just a theory.  I make no claims that I have ANY inside information or am involved in anyway to the shooting</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stephen Paddock was an FBI agent or an asset deep undercover, posing as an arms dealer.  The plan was to get Paddock to supply guns to ISIS linked terrorists.  They can then track the terrorists back to their cell and make arrests.  The extravagant lifestyle that Paddock lived as gambler and high roller was the cover provided by the FBI who also funded his activities and even provided the guns.  This is why he didn&#39;t care if he lost $100k or $1 million.  It was all FBI money.  This is why there are no records that Paddock ever made money in the real estate market.  This is why we can&#39;t trace any buildings he owns.   This deception was necessary to make the bad guys believe that Paddock was indeed a genuine arms dealer.   This is why we know virtually nothing about the man; it was/is a cover.</p></li>
<li><p>On October 1, 2017, Paddock made contact with 2 terrorists and agreed to sell them 23 (or more) guns, all outfitted with bump stocks for auto fire.  The deal was going to go down in his room on 32nd floor.  Stephen was waiting for the terrorists to arrive but all things went to hell.  First, the two terrorists were spotted by the security guard, Jesus Campos, who found them suspicious.  When confronted by the security guard, the two shot Campos and ran into Paddock&#39;s room.  This is why the story of Campos first knocking on the door was later changed to being shot somewhere near the staircase or emergency elevator.  This is also why NO ONE has been allowed to speak to Campos.  Campos would identify his shooter as not being Paddock.  </p></li>
<li><p>When the terrorists ran into Paddock room, things really spun out of control.  First, do you recall the eye witnesses on the ground saying there were unmarked vans in the area?  These were the FBI surveillance team monitoring the arms deal.  As soon as shot were heard (shoot of Campos that is), radio silence was broken and the terrorists somehow learned that it was an FBI setup.  Do you remember people saying that SWAT teams were on site almost immediately?  Well, they were already there in case the arms deal were to go sour.  Do you remember how quickly FBI arrived on the scene and took over?  BECAUSE THEY WERE ALREADY THERE!</p></li>
<li><p>As soon as the terrorists learned that they were being set up, they killed Paddock.  Now.... they were left with 2 choices.  They knew damn well that they couldn&#39;t carry all the guns out of the hotel, especially with Campos being shot and probably raising alarm all throughout the hotel.  So they could either run, OR since they had the guns already, they could cause some destruction and terror by firing on the crowds at the concert.  Shooting seems a good idea to them because it would create unbelievable confusion and chaos in the whole area which would allow them to escape undetected.  So they shoot out the windows and start firing.  Now, and this is crucial, when you listen to the bursts of fire from the recordings of the crowd, you notice that there are very long pauses between bursts.  Why is this?  Why would Paddock take so long to change or reload guns when he is experienced enough to own dozens of guns?  When he prepared for DAYS about this shooting?  It is because Paddock is not the one shooting.  It is because these terrorists have no idea how to use the guns properly.  They have no idea where the extra mags are.  They are unfamiliar with changing cartridges.  This explains perfectly why the pauses between the bursts were minutes instead of seconds as would be expected if Paddock was shooting.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, the FBI is in a panic mode.  Imagine if it got out that a failed FBI sting operation was responsible for the deaths of 58 innocent people.  What would happen?  Then entire organization would be torn down.  Heads would roll left and right.  The fallout would be astronomical.  So they do the ONLY thing they can do.  1) Immediately take Campos into custody to stop him from giving interviews about what he saw.  2) Set up the room to look like Paddock killed himself. Take a picture and anonymously &quot;leak&quot; it so that people can see that it was indeed Paddock in the room.  3) Plant evidence like trajectory diagrams to further their narrative.  Notice that the trajectory sheet was not even mentioned until a few days later?  </p></li>
<li><p>I firmly believe that the two terrorists were apprehended.  They were immediately put into cars and driven to a dark site.  They will never be heard from again.  Ever.  Because if they are discovered, then the world would know that the FBI was responsible for this tragedy.  Did you see the various videos of armed teams sweeping various hotels in the area after the event?  I did.  This was the sweep for the 2 terrorists.  Incidentally, the reason I think it was 2 terrorists instead of 1 is because of the windows.  2 sides were knocked out.  If you&#39;re a guy wanting to kill as many people as possible, you&#39;re not going to take the time to knock out 2 windows.  You&#39;re also not going to shoot at fuel tanks when there are 22,000 people right below you.  Only terrorists who want to blow shit up do these things.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Again, this is just a theory.  But with the cryptic message posted by Julian Assange, I am starting to believe that this is what happened.  If you see flaws in my theory, please let me know.  Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not? Security everywhere. Cameras everywhere.</p>

<p>And for Paddock, he&#39;s known throughout as a high roller so can get a suite comped, which he did, and not raise suspicion with lots of people coming and going to his room.</p>

<p>Also, he can get bags taken up without questions asked for a few $100 chips.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok I read your link.  Thank you for that.  Very interesting but it didn&#39;t seem to go in to details because it was released so early after the event.  I tried to link little unexplained details with my theory as much as possible.   For instance, the long pauses between the bursts of fire.  The only thing that can explain this is that the shooters had no idea which magazines fit which guns, how to reload, where the extra ammo was, etc...  If paddock was indeed shooting, I would guess 20 seconds at most between bursts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my dispute.  Paddock worked for himself.  He was only involved in the FBI in that they used him essentially like a CI.  He is Barry Seal.  He has a skill that puts him in the underworld, and the FBI looks the other way while he launders millions.  This allows him cover to do nefarious things.</p>

<p>Problem for them was, Paddock didn&#39;t really have an allegiance to us (or anyone).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was trying to come up with an explanation for that but none were very satisfactory so I left it out.  The best I could come up with was that the room was paid for by Paddock for his guests (i.e. the terrorists)  So, Paddock stores the guns in his room.  After they make the trade, the terrorists would move the guns to their room, and Paddock can check out, leaving the terrorists to move the guns out of the hotel over the next few days so as to not attract attention.  Of course, because Paddock was comped by the casino all the time, getting an extra room was nothing to him.  So as a courtesy, he provided a room for the terrorists.</p>

They also say he had AKs yet none on the videos have a 7.62 sound, all 5.56/.223. We all know the 2 scary rifles are the AK and AR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Paddock just happened to get a hotel room across the way from where a concert would be happening(and not on the opposite side of the hotel) and the &quot;gun deal&quot; went down at the exact time that the concert was taking place, providing the perfect target at the perfect time, just like the previous attacks on concerts by Isis.</p>

<li><p>Timing.  As I told you in my theory, the terrorists didn&#39;t time the deal to kill the concert goers.  It was a crime of opportunity.  They had the guns.  They had the ammo.  They needed to escape after killing Paddock.  What better way to escape than cause chaos?  Kill two birds with one stone.

<p>59 on the 5th
