        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I found this interesting:</p>

<p>Soros buys $42 mil worth of PUTs against MGM on 8-14: <a href="https://whalewisdom.com/filer/soros-fund-management-llc#/tabholdings_tab_link">https://whalewisdom.com/filer/soros-fund-management-llc#/tabholdings_tab_link</a></p>

<p>James Murren sells off (rumored to be near 80% but I wont speculate without facts) a significant amount of stock before everything happens. Further, the MGM initiated a stock repurchase program, which would increase the price of MGM&#39;s stock. So why would James sell?</p>

<p>The piece of information I found, when digging into all of this was... Are Soros and James connected in anyway? Well, not much points to YES, unless we do what we do best here at <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>... connect the dots. I understand this might be a large jump to connect them but hear me out.</p>

<p>James Murren worked at a Wall Street Firm: Cyrus J Lawrence. He was elected a member of the firm&#39;s Board of Directors, becoming the youngest member ever of the company&#39;s board. During his career on Wall Street he brought about a pivotal recapitalization of MGM Grand, Inc. in 1996... AND MOST IMPORTANTLY: ..served as a Managing Director and the Director of U.S. equity research for Deutsche Bank&quot; - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Murren">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Murren</a></p>

<p>The connection I&#39;m making is... <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutsche-bank-soros/soros-had-deutsche-bank-short-bet-at-time-of-brexit-fallout-idUSKCN0ZE20O">https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutsche-bank-soros/soros-had-deutsche-bank-short-bet-at-time-of-brexit-fallout-idUSKCN0ZE20O</a> - Soros isn&#39;t unfamiliar with the Deutsche Bank.</p>

<p>Not to mention James is married to a powerful woman in Merrill Lynch.</p>

<p>I didnt have much time to type that up so I apologize for lack of detail etc. Just wanted to float the idea out there and see what people could dig up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, if someone wants to dig into the details and try to find out when the options would have expired, whether they were insuring some existing securities in the normal course of operations of a multibillion dollar portfolio, if the repurchase itself was the trigger for short (why do they need to boost earnings if everything is going smoothly) etc - otherwise the soros-appeal, wizard of left oz is not very compelling this time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. Fucked either way. He&#39;s been known to invest &quot;when the time was right&quot; - note during the Obama administration and the US investment into Offshore Oil Drilling in Brazil. Weeks before the US invested 2 bil in Brazilian oil, Soros invested $300 mil into the same company.</p>

<p>But coincidences happen all the time here guys. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey, were going to push for gun control&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>I agree <a href="/u/mybluejeans">/u/mybluejeans</a> - it was not illegal in any fashion. But the practices he employed to achieve such legal success were far from &quot;perfectly legal&quot; - <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-george-soros-shorted-the-pound-etching-his-name-into-financial-history-forever-2010-6">http://www.businessinsider.com/how-george-soros-shorted-the-pound-etching-his-name-into-financial-history-forever-2010-6</a></p>

<p>I mean, this guy hasnt just done it to the pound or Brexit, he&#39;s done it to Thailand and more. He&#39;s not just making a lucky bet.</p>

<p>Also, to say that it &quot;would be pretty stupid if it was some malicious profit attempt&quot;, I think, is fairly ignorant. Malicious profit grabs happen all the time. Say it wasn&#39;t for profit, say it was to further the idea of gun control but they just happened to make a penny off of it in the long run. I think anything is possible and yes, these big wigs usually cross their T&#39;s and dot their I&#39;s but they also seem to rely on us not paying attention. </p>

<p>All just food for thought. I want to foster a community. I want us to build each other up and supply relevant information to support or rebuke other info provided. I&#39;m open ears for any theories with supplemental information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>informative response, particularly about Thailand. The point was that the scenario suggested would likely be illegal, which I doubt his legal minds would allow him to put his name on.  </p>
