       In fact, I've been seen numerous times discussing 9/11 with y'all, but that's neither here nor there.   From the start of this Las Vegas thing I knew something was fucky.
      </p>
      <p>
       A little background on me.   I'm a 38 year old Iraq war veteran.   I was there for the invasion in 03, and was part of the lead element for most of the push to Baghdad.  I got to visit such lovely places as An Najaf, Karbala, Baghdad, Abu Ghraib and Fallujah.  So yes...I have a wee bit of experience when it comes to incoming gunfire and what it sounds like.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been around firearms my whole life.  My old man was 20 years infantry and retired in 95, so I consult with him on things as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I generally don't believe in conspiracy theories.   I leave that to my brother.  No believe in Occam's Razor, where the simplest answer is often the right one.  I don't listen to the media, but rather draw my own conclusions based on evidence available an my own extensive experience with the government and life in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I've found myself deeply questioning the official story of what happened in Vegas.   Too much shit don't add up.   Too many glaring inconsistencies, especially to folk experienced with firearms of both the semi and fully automatic variety (it bears mentioning I was my platoon's M-249 SAW gunner).
      </p>
      <p>
       So here I am...siding with who I once fought against.   But, as the saying goes, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.   So on this, we'll work together, exchange information and try to get to the bottom of this mass clusterfuck.

       Yeah I joined in 07... Family was mostly military so I followed the tradition. Knew I could go downrange but you really don't think about it til it happens. And once the rounds start flying any idealogical concerns go out the window and you're there with your best friends trying to not get killed. That's all it is.

       Exactly.   I was in the delayed entry program when 9/11 happened.   I ended up shipping out in November of 01.   Same thing though...when the metal meets the meat, politics and personal belief don't matter much.   At that point it's simply about survival.

       To a large extent you are correct. Are there really no answers, though? During my time in 'conspiracy' I have learned a lot about human behaviour and 'crowd psychology'. For instance, I found out about Gustave le Bon (who is the father of crowd psychology) and read his book 'The Crowd'. Fascinating insights into how humans work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is
       <a href="https://imgur.com/8gQsUF4">
        one example
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       "A crowd scarcely distinguishes between the subjective and the objective. It accepts as real the images evoked in its mind, though they most often have only a very distant relation with the observed fact." -Gustave le Bon
      </p>
      <p>
       I now feel like I have some
       <strong>
        answers

       Any thoughts on the sound of the gunfire, as in how many were shooting at once? I'm not experienced with anything asides from my sks and Mosin. I think it was most likely just echos caused by the buildings but as I said before, I'm not that knowledgeable.

       He's playing coy and I really hate it. We shouldn't be left in suspense like this. It kind of reminds me of the classic "that's a nice ____ you have, it'd be a shame if something happened to it" it's purposefully vague in order to put fear in someone's heart. I can't even imagine what he was alluding to other than NK. Someone on my IG was freaking out about martial law and some people had to talk him down off the ledge lol

       You're absolutely right. I posted this video, after realizing that what we're listening for is what it sounds like to be

       Putting your tin foil hat on, let's say 9/11 was an inside job, do you believe it would be the same faction that orchestrated this massacre as well? 9/11= Patriot Act     Las Vegas = Gun control (Trying, Jimmy Kimmel you rat)

       Nope.   But like I said, I'm not gonna get into that conversation here.   It detracts from the point of this post.   I'm here trying to gather more information about the Vegas massacre.   We'll debate 9/11 another time.

       I'm just saying in the grand scheme of things, a lot of people think its the same faction that orchestrated these events. So yes it is related, maybe not his question, but the conspiracy is.

        /u/Army0fMe

       is being respectful and defining appropriate boundaries in this thread. I am with you that 9/11 is as fishy as they come, but I agree with Army0fMe that getting into a debate about 9/11 in this thread is off-topic and detracts from the issue at hand.

      <p>
       My personal feeling is that engaging with ad hominem comments with people that are new to this conspiracy world casts us in a similar light as the MSM and I try to be very cautious about attacking the messenger. I'm sure I've been guilty of it too but I'd like to add some perspective and ask people to consider focusing on substantial debate and inquiry.

       Same, I didn't ask the 9/11 question. I was stating that if these are both conspiracies, then maybe it's the same group pulling the strings for both.

       Fair enough.   I try to keep an open mind about things and use the available evidence to draw my own conclusions.   Alas, often enough times all the evidence isn't readily available, so one must dig.

       That said, I believe our government to be a group of incompetent idiots who would be incapable of managing a Turkish whorehouse, much less a massive operation like 9/11 and being able to cover it up.

       I dont find his post condescending at all. He was stating he doesnt fall into the category of a conspiracy theorist and offten tried to debunk them. Which imo i believe we need people like him to make up reconsider some things so like as someone else stated it isnt a circle jerk.

       That's not the warriors fault.   That's the fault of the brass who's several thousand miles away from the battlefield, has no idea how combat works, and is in an air conditioned office and gets to go home and bang his wife at the end of the day.  Those of us with actual boots on the ground are just pawns in a large and very expensive game of chess.

       Not at the moment, but there may come a time when you'll be glad there's a bunch of cranky, decrepit combat veterans around who are more than willing to lace their boots back up, pick up a rifle and defend your rights for you.

       It is a lot happier for the ignorant until their patterns are disrupted. For the ones that can't ignore; it's a hellish nightmare. That's why there's so many people caught up with watching their pro ball fondlers, keeping up with the world's top liers aka celebrities, stuffing their gullets with poisons and forget-it-all juice, watching one of the many versions of the associated press fight each other, playing squag mig ultra or super jumper person on their q-boxes,  and thinking they've made a difference in the world by earning themselves enough money to repeat.

       Richard Dolan is probably the best researcher for this. He is a historian that will only discuss facts and documented evidence. He has several lectures on the Deep State and the money trail that leads to it. Definitely worth your time I think, if you are interested!

       How come all of the saw guys posting here can't decide between m240 and m249? Wouldn't that fact boost the official bump stock ar10 / ar15 story? Why would someone setting him up being two different lmgs?

       I honestly didn't hear anything that remotely matched the rate of fire of a SAW (800rpm).   Everything I heard made me think 7.62....AK, 240 (unlikely considering the inconsistent rate of fire).  All the videos I've seen thus far sounds like around 600rpm, and the actual sound of the gunshot seems too low pitched to be 5.56/.223.  The smaller rounds have s more pronounced "crack" as opposed to the larger 7.63 being more boomy, if that makes sense.

       Given that most, if not all of the mics we hear in the videos are cell phones or GoPros, it's a safe bet that mics are pretty standard and low quality.   Also, it's not just the sound, it's also the rate of fire.   Generally weapons firing 5.56 have a higher rate of fire than their larger caliber brethren.  A fancy mic isn't going to change the cyclic fire rate.

      <p>
       If it was a automatic 5.56 you would be correct. A bump stock equipped 5.56 doesnt have a set rate of fire. Go watch any number of videos they all have different rates of fire based on how quickly the shoot rocks the weapon.

       I have, and I think this is just anither incidence of people processing a tragedy by attempting to attribute greater meaning to it...same with Sandy Hook. Frankly there is nothing inconsistent, or even surprising at this point, about a lone nut killing tons of people. Given the methods and weapons he employed, the outcome was predictable. There are tons of eyewitness videos, all consistent with the official story; no multiple shooters are required, and nobody has a motive to cover anything up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that all these shootings are attempts to help gun control legislation is hogwash, because
       <strong>
        these shootings never lead to gun legislation
       </strong>
       . Most of us who want sanity in our laws have basically surrendered to the reality that it just isn't going to happen. We live in a country with a lot of people, some of whom own a lot of guns and some of whom are mentally sick, and it turns out those two groups have a little overlap. Don't be shocked by any of this.

       Why confiscate guns when you can prescrbe mind altering drugs and opiates to their children and make them work 80hrs a week just to survive...
      </p>

       I think this is about more funding for the 3 letter agencies and more restrictions on freedom (e.g. no-fly lists, no-drive lists, monitoring everything you say and do, where you go and what you know)

       You think that requires the government to stage these mass killings?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it: whatever the political aftermath, is there really anything that odd, in a country as full of guns as ours and with so many people, that a handful of people are going to go off the deep end and use those guns to commit mass slaughter? It should come as no surprise at this point. It happens regularly.

       No, but it sure does make it quicker for them. So many examples in the past of dodgy govt actions that it would almost be strange if the govt wasn't involved.

       I mean, yeah, it's strange, but not as strange as "shadowy gov't operatives murder dozens of people in hopes of indirectly causing vague outcome". I mean if they want more tax dollars or whatever, usually Congress is able to pull that off without committing mass murder.

       I was listening to the scanner while it was happening.  As with any chaotic scenario with thousands of people, scared shirtless, running for their lives,  and officers not experienced in urban combat or being on the receiving end of automatic gunfire, there's going to be a lot of confusion and a lot of false reports.   Unfortunately, in that situation, officers can't afford to ignore anything potentially dangerous, so their senses are on full alert and what was actually a door slamming or trash can falling over could easily be construed as gunfire to the overwhelmed mind.

       I'm hesitant to say since many rifles have a similar cyclic rate.  Hell, an AR-10 has a cyclic rate of around 700rpm.   But the first thing that came mind when I first saw the videos was an AK.

       Saw a video Of a AR going 800rpm, these rounds were at 600rpm, consistent with a M240.

       Shill positions AFAIK usually take a good amount of time and consideration/critique of the mainstream narrative so as yet I personally don't see how your opinion as this is all mulled over, debated and compared is anything remotely shillish?

       According to the official list, he had several AR-15s, a couple of AR-10s (pretty much the same as an AR-15, but fires a much bigger 7.62x51mm round) and an AK-47 which fires a 7.62x39mm round.

       That is the best evidence I've seen for the AR vs M240 discussion.  I don't believe Paddock was strong enough to man a M240.   That is why we have long pauses between bursts.  He was worn out.

       If anyone could do a ELI5 breakdown on the mechanics and gas feature of an AR-15 I'd be much obliged coming from in comparison to the US relatively gun free NZ. Also in the "Ultimate AR-15 Meltdown" vid just casually asking, as again coming from a pretty low key gun owner nation, how many people are this well set up in the US as in able to simply bang thru 1000's of rounds and destroy an admittedly sponsored gun but still and the clips and drum mags and his general set up indicates this is quite the hobby/past time for some a' y'all folks over there!
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be happy with a scatter gun, long rifle and a side arm but alas we cain't do sheeeit fire arms wise over here. I understand many people simply collect them as they are a form of currency and hold their value well as well as the obvious use if TSHTF.

       I've looked over this - seems there is a gun called Ultimax 100. Uses the same ammunition as an AR-15 but with the fire rate that is consistent in the videos (10/sec).  That is interesting.  I felt an M240 would have done way more damage.

       From watching the Russian guy put a few belts thru an M240 above I cannot believe it was an M240 used either. It would have been devastating and there would have been observable wide spread damage to structures/toilet blocks/other buildings etc..., holes in the ground, cars, people with missing limbs and huge exit wounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would imagine at least one or two videos would have far more footage of projectiles/real time impact evidence if an M240 was used also?

       I agree.  The rpm is the only thing I've seen that connects to M240 so far.  Would like to know more about the shooters technique.  I heard he didn't change clips but moved from one gun to the next instead of reloading time.  However that doesn't support the long pauses between shots.  I'm also curious about ballistics with the gun/victims.  We know they were legally purchased but were any scratched for illegal resale? So many questions and a lot of crap to sift through.

       Indeed. I'd really like to hear more ex-military and or experienced firearms users/technicians chime in re. ballistics, accuracy, shooting style, the pauses during the barrage and the incongruent lighter cracks/reports at the beginning and through out at different times suggesting sniper/s?

       Couple of questions I have:
1) in the videos towards the end of all the gun fire you here 2 pistol gun shots within 30 seconds of each other.  I am assuming one was him killing himself.   But wouldn't the gun shot be muffled if he put the gun to his head? 
2) who or what was he shooting at with the 1st pistol shot?
      </p>
      <p>
       The best video for the gunshots come from the bus station video in front of the Mandalay Bay (3:40). After those 2 gunshots you don't hear any more.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last question: have you seen any video of gun shots hitting anything? I heard sounds but no visible debris from gun shots.  I also haven't seen any bullet holes outside the fuel tanks.  Have you?

       The gas feedback system in the AR rifle system is actually pretty simple.  There's a small hole in the barrel.   Attached to that hole is a tube that runs back along the gun and into the upper receiver.   A small amount of the gas used to push the bullet out of the barrel is redirected back down the gas tube to push the bolt carrier group back and cycle the weapon.   Does that make sense?

       So the gas causes the rounds to cycle?

       What else about the AR platform makes it so popular in the US? Are they hardy like AKs in terms of reliability under rough usage?

       We have them over here too and I think they're quite popular for their ability to be modded but only in semi. obviously.

       Yup.   A lil bit of gas is recycled to push the bolt back to eject the spent casing and pluck a new round from the magazine.

       ARs are popular because you can pretty much do anything with em.   They're the Chevy small block of the gun world.   Leave it stock and it'll do whatever you need it to.  Or you can spend thousands of dollars on upgrades to make it more accurate, easier to shoot, more stable, even fire larger rounds.   It's a very versatile weapon system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got one due to the fact I'm very familiar and proficient with the platform from my time in the military.   I don't have a lot of bells and whistles on mine, simply because I don't need them.   I'm comfortable with the bare bones weapon and can shoot very well with it.

       That's been my theory.   Cartels or MS13.   I ruled out ISIS due to them breaking contact to escape.   ISIS wouldn't do that...they'd rather fight to the end and take as many out as possible before they go.

       Firing full auto from a standing position is exhausting.   The gun beats the shit out of your shoulder, all the while trying to climb and twist your body in the direction of the poor shoulder you choose to bludgeon with the butt of the gun.   So you've gotta control muzzle rise as well as twisting forces on your body.   With a small round like the .223/5.56mm it may seem easy enough since the AR doesn't have bad recoil at all, but during rapid fire everything is multiplied, and it becomes more difficult the more rounds you send down range.

       I am not as experienced as the OP. I am an Army Vet however and It seems rather obvious to most that have fired automatic weapons that: 1. Seems like more than one shooter when you see the synchronized videos, and 2: I have a hard time believing a 64 year old guy with little or no training got that many rounds on target over that period of time, from that distance.

       Question: It didn't sound like an AR15 to me? and it has been mentioned the bursts were 100 round canisters... were there dual drum canisters found in the room? The pics i saw showed a standard mag chambered? I was thinking M240 but...wtf do I know.

       That's more than 200 right there, at only two hospitals, and not including victims who were taken straight to the morgue. I'd guess the gunshot victim count will be ~250.

       Thanks for the post, man. "Occam's Razor" has always struck me as being a heavily misused term. People often use it to really just mean "the least informed answer" is always right, or the dumbest, or the most popular. It's ridiculous. Sometimes things are complicated.

       Yeah. I get it a lot when I try to talk about DMT with people, a subject I'm very intimately familiar, and I hear that my 200 or so experiences and ten years of research aren't relevant because "Occam's Razor."

       Very interesting reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes it takes something to happen that you have expertise in to question what is being presented as 'nothing but the truth' and with a completely straight face.  Who knows, maybe journos and TV heads are highly ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your attitude and reactions (which you admit, previous and apart only to this incident) are really puzzling to some of us who have considered something else regarding various 'theories'.  Even after theories are acknowledged and have become common knowledge, it seems ppl can't wrap their mind around the fact of that such insidious manipulation can be happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope more ppl like you, with military training, connections and integrity will begin to realize what is really happening with the trillions of $ and lives being casually burned by the nebulous tptb.

       Welcome bro. I believe most people on here are really good people that want to make the public aware of all the fuckery going on. Cause let's be serious? Who else is trying? We're all trying trying to get truth out and wake people up so they can make better decisions on future events like policies, campaigns and societal issues.

       when you say "fucky", would you be comfortable elaborating on what you feel has been off with the information we are receiveing? I'm just curious as to what your feeling is most obscure. so many directions to keep track from that for someone like me who is experienced with this kinda thing, it really leaves you reeling to wrap your head around it.

       Too many questions, not enough answers.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        why all the guns?   Two would've been sufficient for this type of operation.   Everything else just complicates things further.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       -why have explosives if you're not going to use em?
      </p>
      <p>
       -how the hell is an out-of-shape retiree gonna have the physical stamina to fire that many rounds?   Believe it or not, firing automatic weapons for any amount of time with any sort of accuracy is difficult and rather painful.
      </p>
      <p>
       -why did he just off himself when police approached?   Clearly he came ready for a war.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         he fired for around 10 minutes, his hotel room wasn't breached for nearly an hour after he stopped shooting....what was going on in that room during that time?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         why is the FBI so heavily invested in a case that clearly falls under local law enforcement jurisdiction?  If this guy had no ties to anyone else, then it's a lone gunman and belongs to the LVPD.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       -how does a person fall
       <em>
        underneath
       </em>
       a gun on a bipod after shooting himself in the nugget?   Typically headshots result in an instant collapse and just kinda crumple to the floor, but this guy was laying perfectly supine, almost as if moved there, and a rifle sat down over his foot as an afterthought.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        where is the fucking video?   I understand this is an ongoing investigation, but considering the scale of things, how about some footage of him in the hotel hallway setting up the nanny cam in the room service cart?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       For that matter....
      </p>
      <p>
       -how long is a high rated hotel on the Las Vegas strip gonna leave a room service cart in the hallway?   Those are typically policed up pretty damn quick, last I knew.   My wife worked housekeeping in a small casino hotel here in Southwest Michigan, and they monitored CCTV and were told when a room service cart was left for longer than 5 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       -why was there so much confusion around how many guns were found?   Seems like a pretty straightforward thing...count the guns, make a note of the amount, and go about your business.  That number shouldn't have fluctuated so damn much.
      </p>
      <p>
       -thousands of rounds fired....four dozen shell casings.  I've fired automatic weapons on the range.   On one memorable occasion I cooked through over 4,000 rounds with my M249 SAW.   The mess was considerable.
      </p>
      <p>
       And lastly
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        if he did enough research to have a dope sheet (ranges, bullet drop, compensation rates, etc), why wasn't he aware of shooting in short bursts to maintain accuracy?   Machine gunners are taught 3-5 second bursts by literally saying "squeeze and release" out loud while performing those tasks.   It's a method to maintain accuracy while still pouring hot death down range.   Had this guy practiced that method, the kill count would've been a lot higher.   Instead, he just went gonzo on the bang switch and relied on accuracy by volume.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       These are just a few things that irk me.

       If you apply Occam's razor to 9/11, you actually have to conclude it was an inside job. Anyway if you spend your time trolling this sub you can just GTFO. Your military experience makes you less credible, not more. You can take your knowledge of firearms and shove it where the sun don't shine.

       Makes sense.   But I don't agree with it being a 240 simple due to the amount of devastation a 240 will lay down, even at that range.   If someone was using a 240, the body count would've been astronomical and the injuries would've been gruesome.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are numerous other weapons that have a cyclic rate of fire around 600rpm.   The AK-47 jumps quickly to mind.   In fact, in most of the videos I saw (and many of my veteran friends agreed) distinctly sounded like AK47 fire.   And god knows I've been on the receiving end of AK fire enough to be familiar with the sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not familiar with any 5.56/.223 weapons that fire at less than 800rpm, but I'm not a weapons expert.   I have heard of multiple people being treated for .223 bullet wounds, and haven't heard anything about any different calibers, which definitely interests me.

       If anyone could do a ELI5 breakdown on the mechanics and gas feature of an AR-15 I'd be much obliged coming from in comparison to the US relatively gun free NZ. Also in the "Ultimate AR-15 Meltdown" vid just casually asking, as again coming from a pretty low key gun owner nation, how many people are this well set up in the US as in able to simply bang thru 1000's of rounds and destroy an admittedly sponsored gun but still and the clips and drum mags and his general set up indicates this is quite the hobby/past time for some a' y'all folks over there!

       I'd be happy with a scatter gun, long rifle and a side arm but alas we cain't do sheeeit fire arms wise over here. I understand many people simply collect them as they are a form of currency and hold their value well as well as the obvious use if TSHTF.

       Makes sense.   But I don't agree with it being a 240 simple due to the amount of devastation a 240 will lay down, even at that range.   If someone was using a 240, the body count would've been astronomical and the injuries would've been gruesome.

       There are numerous other weapons that have a cyclic rate of fire around 600rpm.   The AK-47 jumps quickly to mind.   In fact, in most of the videos I saw (and many of my veteran friends agreed) distinctly sounded like AK47 fire.   And god knows I've been on the receiving end of AK fire enough to be familiar with the sound.

       I'm not familiar with any 5.56/.223 weapons that fire at less than 800rpm, but I'm not a weapons expert.   I have heard of multiple people being treated for .223 bullet wounds, and haven't heard anything about any different calibers, which definitely interests me.

       Yup.   A lil bit of gas is recycled to push the bolt back to eject the spent casing and pluck a new round from the magazine.

       ARs are popular because you can pretty much do anything with em.   They're the Chevy small block of the gun world.   Leave it stock and it'll do whatever you need it to.  Or you can spend thousands of dollars on upgrades to make it more accurate, easier to shoot, more stable, even fire larger rounds.   It's a very versatile weapon system.

       I got one due to the fact I'm very familiar and proficient with the platform from my time in the military.   I don't have a lot of bells and whistles on mine, simply because I don't need them.   I'm comfortable with the bare bones weapon and can shoot very well with it.
