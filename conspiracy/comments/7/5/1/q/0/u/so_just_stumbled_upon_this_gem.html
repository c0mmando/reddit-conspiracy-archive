       All I can say is,
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        firstly we got told that there was nothing there
       </li>
       <li>
        secondly we got told that there was a piece of paper there but it 'wasn't' a suicide note.
       </li>
       <li>
        thirdly we then get told that its a bunch of numbers to calibrate said guns to fire upon crowd correctly...
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       then this article just got posted.. not too long ago..

      <p>
       Quote from article ''In Paddock's room, officials found a piece of paper containing a number of phone numbers but they reiterated no suicide note was found.''
      </p>
      <p>
       So which is it? are they trying to float around trying to find one specific story that 'fits' comfortably with the majority or am I missing something here?

       Those rounds can travel up to a mile (or better) the distance from what he was wanting to hit is hardly relevant. He wasn't aiming or more people would be dead. He didn't need to aim because it was a dense crowd If people. All he had to do was knock out a window. Aim in the general direction and sweep his weapon. Upon reload he'd just start in a slightly different spot... maybe a foot or so from where he started before. This isn't rocket science. The rounds will travel until something stops them or they lose velocity and drop. He literally had to do nothing more than point and shoot.

       You could not hand a bump-stock equipped  AR-15 to someone that's never fired a weapon, place them in the 32nd floor of a building and expect them to shoot into a crowd of 20,000 from nearly a 1/4 mile away.

       The fbi and CIA were both independently tracking the hijackers and bin laden before the attack. Their lack of communication allowed the attack to occur, but it didn't take long afterwards for the two organizations to share their Intel and draw conclusions.

       There were a lot more things found than just a passport, but that always gets overlooked as it doesn't support the planted passport theory first perpetrated in ferenheight 9/11, the most successful fauxumentary in history, in that it made people believe it was legit.

       I'm assuming you have some sort of evidence to back this claim up, right? Conspiracy theories are about following evidence that contradicts an official story to present an alternative theory, not outright making shit up.

       It's not 'conspiracy theorists' it's all the witnesses and victims who are saying that the authorities and the media are lying. I guess that because they're questioning the official narrative that just means they're conspiracy theorists and should be instantly dismissed according to you.

       Sure.  The rebuttals are stretched, and disconnected from reality, but sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever tried to fire entire magazines from "bumpstocks", while sticking to calculations?  Hint:  After the first round, calculations fly...  out the window.  And after the first reload, getting back to "calculated" shooting is unnecessary and time consuming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with a machine gun (more likely), the same principles apply.  After the first couple rounds, you're walking it in, not aiming individual rounds.

       he had sights, scopes, whatever you want to call them. that suggests he was expecting to be aiming at things and prepared for it. scopes + details on distances and trajectories. those things match up.
      </p>
      <p>
       he almost certainly didnt expect people to just stand around in the open. he was expecting people to run for cover and to have to target them. when they just stayed put that is when his MO changed, he thought fuck it, i can just spray them randomly because im bound to hit plenty of them.

       That doesn't match reality, as I expected.  He started off with potshots, went into belt or drum auto spraying, fumbled around with a jam for a minute or so, then got back to spraying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Starting off with potshots indicates that this wasn't about mass casualties, as much as mass hysteria.  Any idiot who'd bothered to do "calculations" wouldn't start with pot shots.  You just open up, and let the rate of fire do all the work.

      <p>
       What you called my "absolute conclusions" aren't absolute at all.  It's reasonable speculation, based on audio/video evidence, assuming the one-shooter scenario.  If it was one guy, it was an idiot, who fired off several warning shots before he really opened up.  He also had only one primary weapon, based on the ridiculous delays in firing.  If he was using all of those prop bumpstocks, he would've just swapped out right away, for a jam.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was multiple shooters "handing off", then the entire note discussion is completely irrelevant.

       Optics did the math for you. Most have predetermined lines. Put line of distance you want on body, pull trigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Common military ones are even easier. The line is the length of a persons shoulder at a specific distance. Put the line that best matches your targets shoulders and pull.

       If it's like a trijicon, a ACOG for example, yes lol. In this example the "4" line is about the width of a shoulder at 400 meters. That's for I believe.. 20 inch barrel with 62 gr ammo. The difference isnt too different for other rounds though. Things like barrel twists are also factors.

        ok heres mine...
he had sights, scopes, whatever you want to call them. that suggests he was expecting to be aiming at things and prepared for it. scopes + details on distances and trajectories. those things match up.
he almost certainly didnt expect people to just stand around in the open. he was expecting people to run for cover and to have to target them. when they just stayed put that is when his MO changed, he thought fuck it, i can just spray them randomly because im bound to hit plenty of them.

       Seems to me there was something he HAD to hit hence the scope. Tannerite/thermite "painted" fuel tanks? For the crowd... jaysus that's not rocket science. In a tightly packed crowd aim down and wave the gun back and forth while firing. Reload aim down in slightly different direction rinse and repeat. He didn't need to aim or sight anything. He couldn't miss. If he had one particular person or a small group of people sure... he'd have to be more focused in his aim. But all he really had to do was point and shoot. Thankfully he WASNT aiming expertly or more people would be dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that he used a range card with a bump stock... pretty sure most people familiar with that would LOL no.

       i am as sure as i can be that he never expected people to just stand there. i would expect he expected everyone to run, scatter, try to find cover. its fair to assume he expected to have to aim at targets. when they didnt, that is when he realised he could just go full auto the whole time and didnt need to aim.

       Why is it laughable? Why do you subscribe to the idea that the people should accept secrecy from authorities when their lives are at stake? Most people don't buy that this was one person and that multiple shooters or others were involved, people who are on the loose. In which case, the public should be given absolute transparency, so that people can come forward if they know something and the evidence ehlps them put two and two together, and so the public are aware and vigilant. It's insane to me that after everything that's been lied about, and all the times they've fucked up, people still just hand over complete trust to the authorities to such an extent that they 'laugh' at those demanding information and answers, as though we don't live in a democracy at all, and should all 'know our place.' Fuck that!

       Yeah, bump stock equipped rifles are notoriously inaccurate because the barrel is essentially moving back and forth with the recoil. The only thing that calculating range would be good for is the very first shot after each burst. It makes no sense.

       At that elevation (roughly 320+ feet in the air) and those distances (roughly 400-500 yards depending on where the weapon was pointed) and the barrel rise of blasting that many rounds through a "bumpstock" I'd have to say that a good amount of rounds should have been fired above the horizon. It's nearly impossible to shoot a bumpstop equiped weapon accurately at even 30 yards, much less 10+x that distance.

       Well if the reports are true shots were fired at airport tanks that would explain needing to zero in and do some math. Why are people only thinking about the crowd shooting as if that's the only thing that did happen or was supposed to happen?

       That article is reaching at phone numbers when the police said it was distances. I can't find another article talking about phone numbers. I think the dailymail made an error. Making stuff up is actually common in "news", but people eat it up like everything is fact.

       "I could see on it he had written the distance, the elevation he was on, the drop of what his bullet was gonna be for the crowd," Newton said. "So he had that written down and figured out so he would know where to shoot to hit his targets from there."

       Do you see the narrative they're building? They're carving him out to be both a 9/11 Conspiracy Theorist and an ISIS Supporter. They will then amplify this narrative so that it subconsciously pervades the general public's consciousness and they equate both as being mutually exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       This way, if MegaAnon is right, and Trump dumps the 9/11 intel stuff regarding its true motives, it makes anyone who believes it equivalent to ISIS...they literally poison the cognitive wells to prime the mind.

       Not only the conspiracy theorist, also the quiet, peaceful and loner personality that seems to match "other mass shooters personality" accordingly to MSM. This poison you talk about is plain stereotyping of certain "qualities" that are "undesirable" and pushed through media as tacitly "undesirable", so poisoning of culture.

       I wonder if one day you'll be forced to own Facebook so your "social relationships" can be checked to predict your "potential to get into a killing sprees", or required to get a job.

       My guess is if they're bringing 9/11 into it they're terrified that Trump is going to release the truth. If you can find the video of Trump being interviewed on 9/11 (if you haven't already seen it) you may be surprised at how likely a scenario your comment is.

       You started the guessing game.  And your guesses don't even match the video evidence, or the rationale of a person "calculating" for maximum effectiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you called my "absolute conclusions" aren't absolute at all.  It's reasonable speculation, based on audio/video evidence, assuming the one-shooter scenario.  If it was one guy, it was an idiot, who fired off several warning shots before he really opened up.  He also had only one primary weapon, based on the ridiculous delays in firing.  If he was using all of those prop bumpstocks, he would've just swapped out right away, for a jam.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was multiple shooters "handing off", then the entire note discussion is completely irrelevant.

       Exactly. None of the factors that call for the use of those types of calculations were present.

       There wouldn't be a need for a range card, all his range card would be is a damn cone showing where he can effectively hit. Which would be pointless.

       And they said he had no military background... is a range card something a newbie would use, if he weren't aware it were pointless?

       How does that push the gun control agenda? To me it just makes it look like guns are hard to use without the proper training.

       Well if the reports are true shots were fired at airport tanks that would explain needing to zero in and do some math. Why are people only thinking about the crowd shooting as if that's the only thing that did happen or was supposed to happen?

       Seems to me there was something he HAD to hit hence the scope. Tannerite/thermite "painted" fuel tanks? For the crowd... jaysus that's not rocket science. In a tightly packed crowd aim down and wave the gun back and forth while firing. Reload aim down in slightly different direction rinse and repeat. He didn't need to aim or sight anything. He couldn't miss. If he had one particular person or a small group of people sure... he'd have to be more focused in his aim. But all he really had to do was point and shoot. Thankfully he WASNT aiming expertly or more people would be dead.

       The idea that he used a range card with a bump stock... pretty sure most people familiar with that would LOL no.
