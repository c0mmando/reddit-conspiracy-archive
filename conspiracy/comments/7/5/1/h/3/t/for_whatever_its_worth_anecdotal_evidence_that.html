He&#39;s a busy guy and doesn&#39;t bother with Reddit, searching through alternative media sources, or researching things beyond what he needs to. Even if he wasn&#39;t so busy, he isn&#39;t the type to believe in conspiracy theories, and generally accepts what he&#39;s told.</p>

<p>Within about 10 seconds of LV coming up in conversation, he started saying that he believed there were multiple shooters, and that nothing that&#39;s being reported makes sense.</p>

<p>Just thought you all might want to know. The facade is cracking more and more and people are starting to glimpse the ugly face behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That certainly gives me hope. I&#39;m also military and I immediately heard two seperate weapons going when the first videos were coming out. Then they started reporting on just the one shooter, saying he had a perfect nest set up, plenty of ammo, cameras to see them coming. He clearly thought this out then just caps himself right away instead of going out in a hail of gunfire? Then shit comes out about people seeing a woman 45 minutes before telling them they&#39;re all going to die. And I&#39;ve yet to hear another fucking thibg about that. </p>

<p>So here&#39;s my theory: this was either a foreign attack to kick the hornet&#39;s nest while shit is chaotic here, most likely Russia. Or it&#39;s a false flag by us for any number of reasons, including increasing the division between the people and targeting their right to defend against tyranny by placing us in these difficult conundrums about firearm laws. I think it was a small team, maybe two or three. And that when it was to exfill they shot paddock and left him as a patsy to pin the whole thing on and to keep the heat off while they melted away </p>

<p>It’s funny you asked this question because this seems to be the line where if you think there was either no one or much less people killed or injured that’s taking it to far so I think these two questions are venturing a little outside the realm of possibility (Like Sandy Hook - people won’t even entertain the idea no one got killed)</p>

<p>I certainly think it’s possible &amp; I think this event is leading more people there but these questions still I think is sort of a bridge too far for most people.</p>

IMO the no motive whether it being political social or what ever, is what I can’t get my mind around. The reason I am having a hard time believing this is the commitment that the shooter had in this event. That is a lot of work to do for something that has no cause, just random?

<p>Nope. I used to, until I took the time to look into the evidence for myself.

I do not think it means anything, there&#39;s no hidden message or cryptic anything. It&#39;s funny and light hearted. I see it as an ice breaker, a first step towards making it more socially okay to question things. People, (we all have the mom story) who never were conspiracy theorists are now looking into things. They will see others mention things like 9/11, Waco, etc and start to do their own research, and eventually may become more main stream. Could be the new fad soon. Just my opinion, it&#39;s something I&#39;m observing. </p>

<p>Why not? 6,000,000 was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80GgRWuXcO8">too easy</a>, so <em>four orders of magnitude fewer</em> is a <strong>walk in the park</strong>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>wonder how many people subconsciously realize the official 9/11 story is hooey and that&#39;s adding to peoples&#39; reluctance to buy what the govt is selling.  and not just 9/11.  few really buy the govt&#39;s various stories on the Russia nonsense.  the various Syria machinations and claims don&#39;t make much sense, either.</p>

<p>even if there were few inconsistencies in the Vegas narrative, why <strong>should</strong> we trust the govt line?  personally, i used to think the Fast-and-Furious scandal was more smoke than fire?  the govt provides less and less reason to accept govt statements at face value.  what if Vegas was a Fast-and-Furious gone wrong?  and that&#39;s just one of hundreds, maybe thousands, of reasons my experience tells me not to trust the govt.  multiply that out by several hundred million and skepticism starts to become mainstream.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What do you think of this?:</p>

<p>From ZeroHedge.com:
*Also, think about the geometrics of this:
1.) WINDOWS: The windows in his room were floor to ceiling. To fire down one would practically need to be standing at the edge of the window. Have you ever been to the edge of 32 stories? I have and it&#39;s fucking scary even with climbing equipment - let alone standing on the edge of 32 stories while shooting a rifle with a bump stock while the wind AND CURTAINS are blowing around you.
2.) RANGE OF MOTION: To use the bump stock fire you need range of motion to capture the kinetic energy of the recoil. Using a tripod or even a bipod would not allow that to happen. I suppose he could have taken a prone position and put the bipod on the edge but how the fuck do you burn through 1,000 rounds like that?
3.) BIPOD: Using a bipod would not have allowed him to get the same angle he needed to shoot down. Using a tripod? What, did he bolt it to the floor and run it like a door gunner from a helicopter gun ship? That&#39;s the closest comparable platform to consider.
4.) TIME: Even on full auto, one shooter couldn&#39;t do it. Once in the army my squad was tasked to burn off some surplus ammo (about 10K rounds) as it was the end of the Fiscal Year.
For about 12 hours we (8 guys) fired pretty much non stop on full auto with M-16s. We had to make sure not to burn out the barrels and let the rifles rest from time to time. No fucking way ONE SHOOTER is going to burn through 2,000 rounds in 10 minutes even on full auto. We would be lucky to get through 20 (30 round) mags an hour. It took us so long to burn off those 10,000 rounds we had to use parachute flares to light the range.
Fucking insanity to believe the MSM spin on this. There had to be more than one shooter to hit kill 50+ people from 500+ meters. And where did this asshole go for target practice? What ranges did he frequent? No one is going to pick up an AR platform and become &#39;super killer&#39; without a little practice and know how. *</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw an article starting that conservative guy Mark Steyn is mulling the idea that Paddock did it with the sole purpose of pushing the gun control narrative. Like, he bought all these guns, modded them with stuff he could legally get, cleared background checks, didn&#39;t have any crazy ideals to pin it on, but just that he could do it, and that was why he did it.</p>

<p>In other words, he went through all this, killed masses just to make a point about current gun laws not being enough.</p>

<p>Worst yet, some reports are saying now that there may never be a known motive for the Vegas shooting. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this a few times from the more conspiracy minded folks and I have to wonder - how often do these kinds of attacks have clear, rational motivations? They never do. To be famous, to take revenge on unnamed &quot;charlatans&quot;, to be a super hero, to kick off the race war, because they didn&#39;t like Mondays, they&#39;re not rational motives because the person committing them isn&#39;t a rational person.</p>
