<p>Surely the elite knows what the meaning or purpose is? What do you think the elite knows?</p>

<p>Edit. Why is everything I&#39;ve been posting in the last couple days downvoted? Honestly, has this board changed or something? This sub was really good before. Should I just leave or something?</p>

You can dig into the depths of many rabbit holes, but most of the time they will lead you to more. So perhaps that is the meaning of life, to search for its meaning. Maybe we are creating life&#39;s purpose as are own. Each experience a representation of life. </p>

<p>Life&#39;s meaning could be all an illusion and this is just a game and TPTB already understand this. That is why they don&#39;t give a shit about controlling the game. I don&#39;t really know. </p>

<p>The elite know nothing. They are just the worst people who have climbed and climbed long enough so they can be at the top and pull the strings because THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT.

    <div class="md"><p>Big bounce, with A Hint of multiverse theory... Your just part of a big loop.. explains synronicity, and dejavu.. meaning that the meaning is to just let life unfold, yet there are parallel universes unfolding simultaneously to elaborate on the perception of freewill... Sooo you can change your fate or the fate of others but regardless, everything that will happen.. has happened.. and &quot;could&quot; happen already happend... (kinda like an A.I ancestor program that has ran it&#39;s course)... This all being said, with absolute knowledge and understanding (it goes waaaaaaaayyyyy deeper than what I just said that&#39;s just an overview) you can really have some fun..
The knowledge is all there you just gotta dive down the right rabbit hole to find it all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t get it here&#39;s a walkthrough.. watch futarama season seven episode seven.. all three seasons of Rick and Morty.. the matrix (first one) that black mirrors show.. what the bleep do we know.. ghost in the shell (animate series) and then your ready for Zietgeist trilogy.. the nwo biblical doc..both kymantika movies.. after this read some Helena blavtsky.. study theosophy, untill it truly leads you to the mystery religions.. from there start reading or listening to audio tapes by Manley p hall.. and alan watts.. some Carl Jung fits in well (his late stuff).. after you have a real understanding look into Terrance meckenna... Try various psychedelics untill you are ready to smoke DMT while tripping on mescaline or lsd.... With all this knowledge you have obtained and the trip you are about to go on.. you have just discovered that hidden esoteric knowledge and are enlightened... You will be greeted on the other side by sentian beings..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know I&#39;m a little late to answer, but you may be interested in what the government has called &quot;the Absolute.&quot;</p>

<p>There are declassified CIA documents about conciousness that claim to have proven that there is a singular universal conciousness (the Absolute) and that when we die we return to it. We will cease to exist as individuals and instead become more of a memory in the Absolute&#39;s mind.</p>

<p>You are made up of all of the same common ingredients that the universe is made of. Therefore you are not only a part of the universe, you ARE the universe. In you it is looking up at itself and asking the very same question you have asked in this post: Why am I here?</p>

<p>All life is literally just the universe experiencing itself.</p>

<p>So, my guess would be that the meaning of life is to bring something of value back to the Absolute when you die. Don&#39;t bring evil experiences, or hateful memories. Don&#39;t bring boredome and laziness. Bring a novel you wrote. Bring a unique understanding of a study or craft. Bring what it feels like to help people and be selfless.</p>

<p>If you could relive any memory wouldn&#39;t you choose a good one? If you are going to become a memory in the universal conciousness wouldn&#39;t you choose to be a good one?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. Straight from cia.gov. You should definitely read the entire thing, but I recommend starting with <strong>27-Conciousness in Perspective</strong> on page 19 to wet your appetite.</p>
