       I promise I'm going somewhere with this, but I'm on mobile. I'm going to try to summerize, but I'll expand more when I'm on my computer later.

       Do you remember hearing about Stanley Kubrick helping fake the moon landings? "Proved" to be "false." But there have been numerous fake events and False Flags since then. Did they get better at this? Were they using people with attention to detail like producers and directors differently? How much has this really been happening?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which leads me to my next point. With Harvey Weinstein pulling a Polanski and being burried under his own mountain of shit, and other Hollywood Executive more than likely trying to cover their tracks, is that why Vegas went so sideways? It stands to reason that the alphabet soup that is our agencies (FBI, CIA, etc.) Have a good eye and attention to detail. It also stands to reason that Hollywood has a way to make it look believable. I guess what I'm asking is; is it possible that the "False Flag" that was Las Vegas, was executed so poorly because of a lack of Hollywood help? Also, to support the rift between Hollywood and the government, how many have spoken out in support of the government in the last 12 months?

       The threat is real, my man. If they threatened everything you loved, everyone you care about, would you just leak it online? Especially when you've been brainwashed by basic training (Military) or drugs (Hollywood).

       You said is it possible that Vegas went so poorly because they didnt have Hollywood's help. What do you mean by that? Hollywood makes movies...not real crime scenes. If you aren't saying it is fake...them what role would Hollywood play?

       Hollywood would be able to place certain people in certain points and make it look believable to the rest of us who weren't there. There's reports of multiple shooters backed by evidence, yet the investigators are still unsure. They're flying solo. A movie prodcer would come up with a plausible scenario. The director can make it happen similar to the "rumors" about Kubrick helping fake the moon landing. I'm not saying Las Vegas was fake. I'm saying the information and narrative thats being pushed is fake. That's why it's so hard to follow, and that's why it's ever changing. They don't have someone with the mind tho do that helping.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is proven, I know that. I'm not dense. It was a thought that I had concerning all the recent headlines that have been popping up with concerning Las Vegas and Weinstein.

       You can't exactly fake a narrative to fit a mold when there were thousands of people there to witness and now millions through YouTube and camera footage. The Hollywood crap didn't with Weinstein didn't hit until after shooting. And let's be real for a second...if they needed someone from Hollywood as you say...then u can bet yr ass they would have it. You don't tell the FBI no. That isn't an option. Not to be rude or mean but it doesn't make any sense. You can't stage things after they happen..it is too late then with all the witnesses around. You use actors and directors to create a show/movie not a real life mass shooting where people died.

       What I'm saying is that if it is a writer or director they need...they could get that from someone else that isn't tied to this Hollywood bs. There are plenty all over. I don't think the two are connected. But being creative doesn't hurt I guess. So, you should keep being you ;)

       Sorry for the second post.. Forgot something. There have been no victims at any other places that said they had a shooter there. There is no evidence there was a shooter there. All u have is videos of people running...no gun shots or anything. That is called mass hysteria. They heard about MB and freaked out. Happens.

       There was a team with full autos sweeping the Tropicana. There was a helicopter waiting in a lot behind the Harley dealership over a mile away.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also video evidence with overlapping gun fire. Not just an echo, two distinct guns firing at the same time.

       Tropicana was right by the venue so it makes sense they would look there to make sure it was secure. Keep in mind...they didn't know how many shooters either at first. That video doesn't prove there was a second shooter at all. All that proves is that Tropicana was checked.

       Have you seen "Wag The Dog" with DeNiro and Hoffman? If not, stop what you are doing and watch it right now.

       What I like about this theory is that it's outlandish but not entirely unbelievable, unlike most of the garbage that shows up in this sub. I'm not saying I believe it, and I don't have the time or energy to run with it myself. But this is meaty as hell and, if I had to make a prediction, has the chance to become a cornerstone conspiracy, much like the Kubrick stuff. lol. Good stuff, man.
