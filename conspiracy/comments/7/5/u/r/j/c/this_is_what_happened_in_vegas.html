       Paddock was a DOD contractor who was being used by the FBI to carry out one of their infamous sting setups. You know what I'm talking about, those stings where they find some lonely person on the internet who's upset about the way things are and then supply all the radicalization, planning, and weapons to their target needed to carry out an attack. Paddock was someone that they used to supply their target with the weapons they need to carry out the attack that the FBI came up with. What happened though with this one was that the target got wise something was up and took out paddock in the hotel room during the setup, then proceeded to actually carry out an attack right then and there. The setup was suppose to go down several months prior but the suspect got cold feet and bailed(that was the Lollapalooza event Paddock had scheduled a room overlooking several months prior. After several months of communication they had convinced the suspect to agree to another meeting to get the weapons, what they didn't realize was that this person was onto them and had decided right then and there that that night was gonna be the night.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why those cameras were setup in the hallway and in the room, they were there to document the event for the inevitable court case that this sting was suppose to eventually lead to. Instead what they recorded was the suspect drilling Paddock and then seizing control of the weapons and ammo and going to town on the patrons down below. Those original shots involving the "security guard" were actually the true suspect firing onto the agents that were in the adjoining room that rushed to the other room after hearing the shot and seeing it happen on their security cameras. Then the actual suspect, who had absolutely nothing to lose at this point, shot out the window and the rest is now history.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was the suspects first time ever trying to fire a bumpstock, and basically his first time firing a real weapon in his entire life, and is why you hear him having troubles with getting the the hang of the bumpstock at first, and is why there were so many moderately long gaps in between firing, he was having issues with the rifle and didn't even know basic immediate action drills to clear feed problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual shooter left all the weapons in the room and bugged the fuck out in the ensuing chaos. That's why you see those videos of those quick reaction forces flagging entire lobbies and acting like there was still a serious threat of the shooter ready to jump out and start firing again at a moment's notice.
A clean up crew headed over to Paddock's and cleared any evidence linking him to the FBI, or to being a DoD contractor at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI is directly responsible for the single worst shooting in American history. They radicalized the target, they helped him with the planning, and they even supplied the rifles and the ammo for him to carry out. This is what the coverup is all about.

       Paddock was probably an innocent bystander who was tied up, his room taken over, the plot carried out, then a bullet put into his head. Easy escape down the stairway next to the suite long before the cops arrived.

       Are you saying the guns weren't his? If not, still doesn't explain why he had so many guns and rounds in the room. Unless he was selling them illegally, and whoever was trying to purchase them decided to do the shooting. In which case, he wasn't exactly an innocent bystander.

       That was probably the deal. He was out to make money. He could have been approached with an offer to buy guns and he thought he could sell what he had and make some money and easily replace them. But it was all a set up. Or he really did the whole thing. Who knows with as little information as there is????

       Could be. And you're right, there's so little information at this point and the story by the authorities keeps changing so much it's hard to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       The one thing that really stuck out to me was one of the first press conferences by the sheriff where he said something to the effect of "we know this was a lone wolf." It immediately popped out at me because lone wolf has a specific meaning, and it's not just that there was one shooter, but that the shooter had no collaborators who weren't at the scene either. There's just no way he or the FBI could have known this with certainty at that point, unless they were already following Paddock, or they knew something else happened and that was the cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other possibility is that he just misspoke, meaning to say "lone shooter" rather than "lone wolf." I'd have to go back and find that clip again.

       How does one make a profit from buying guns at retail prices and then selling them second hand?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even "black market" prices on semi auto weapons are much cheaper than retail.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm super confused as to how this gun sale gone wrong narrative makes any sense.  Unless paddock was just super generous and liked losing money or just wanted to feel cool by calling himself an arms dealer.

       It doesn't make any sense at all, it's a crap theory with any sort of intelligent thought given. 
The guy was 64, into real estate, multi millionaire and a succesful gambler going by IRS records, he didnt need to make a couple thousand bucks on an arms deal for a few rifles - that fact people push this theory like he's supplying some a few civilian grade rifles  and somehow making millions of dollars from it is quite frankly ridiculous.

       This is actually the most plausible alternate theory I've read so far. Accounts for the video cameras, apparent lack of motive for Paddock, the excessive number of guns, and the changing story about when Campos was shot. Certainly would seem to fit FBI's MO as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some counterarguments though, just to see if there are any holes:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         If there was a clean up crew, why leave the cameras? Surely they would have known they were there because they put them there, so why leave them if it could be incriminating.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If it was FBI in the adjoining room, why did they let him continue firing on the crowd? Did they actually want it to go live? It seems they would have been able to stop it sooner if they were there.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do you have any specific reasoning to suspect DoD? Why not FBI informant, maybe doing this as part of a deal to get off some unrelated charges?

       Most of it is plausible, but I always come back to this whole thong being easier if they actually have Paddock in on the deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it is an FBI gun buy, do they really want all the clips loaded?  Why does he have a car full of tannerite?  How did the shooter possibly get away after 12 kore minutes of shooting,  when the FBI team would have certainly had eyes on the door?

       I think if the original scenario is true, that it was a gun bust, or even a mass shooting sting gone wrong, that they would have apprehended the real shooter and pinned the blame on Paddock. The absolute last thing FBI would want is for it to be found out that they were responsible for the shooting.

       He was working directly for the FBI, but the FBI likes to have a little buffer room incase something like this happens, which is why they use contractors. Contractors are pre-vetted and considered somewhat reliable, they also hold a security clearance most of the time and can be trusted to keep their mouths shut and to behave in a professional manner. They contact someone higher up at the DOJ and DOJ contacts the Department of Defense, because DOD already has plenty of lowlifes like this sitting around waiting to be used for whatever operation they're trying to setup, plus, more buffer.

       Not it isn't. Supposedly, Campos is the guy the FBI was setting up. So, if the were having he believe he was going to carry out an attack...don't u think they would have trained him om how to use the weapons??? Lmfao. He says it was the first time Campos fired a weapon. This is such bullshit and makes zero sense.

       Yes he did. Go back an reread. If your going to have someone believe they are going to do a mass shooting and you want them to actually believe that you aren't the cops and it isn't a set up... You show them how to use the weapons. This makes no sense. Seriously, you think someone isn't going to suspect a set up? Why would the FBI be going around looking for people on the internet to set up? Set ups happen when your trying to take something or someone down. You don't cruise the net to find a person who is unhappy in life and then approach them with this idea out of nowhere. That is serious entrapment. That person was minding their own business. This is stupid. Really stupid and not event the least but logical.

       From OP:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Those original shots involving the "security guard" were actually the true suspect firing onto the agents that were in the adjoining room that rushed to the other room after hearing the shot and seeing it happen on their security cameras.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I didn't take this to mean OP thought Campos was the shooter, but rather that that story was used as a cover for the shots fired within the hotel. But admittedly, it's somewhat vague, so we'd have to let OP clarify.

       Not necessarily, but I can concede that point; I don't think the potential sting target having been trained minimally or not is particular crucial to the scenario.

       That's pretty much exactly what they do. They don't find someone with no predisposition toward committing violence, but they will look for people who are depressed or frustrated, but probably wouldn't have the means or motivation to actually plan and carry out an attack on their own. From the link I cited above:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “We’re not going to wait for the person to mobilize on his own time line,” said Michael B. Steinbach, who leads the F.B.I.’s national security branch. He added that the F.B.I. could not afford to “just sit and wait knowing the individual is actively plotting.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's an interesting article to read if you've never looked into this subject, regardless of whether it has anything to do with Vegas. Some of the stories of these "would-be terrorists" would be laughable if they weren't so sad.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Many people agree:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But defense lawyers, Muslim leaders and civil liberties advocates say that F.B.I. operatives coax suspects into saying and doing things that they might not otherwise do — the essence of entrapment.
       </p>
       <p>
        “They’re manufacturing terrorism cases,” said Michael German, a former undercover agent with the F.B.I. who researches national security law at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. In many of the recent prosecutions, he said, “these people are five steps away from being a danger to the United States.”

       I was making a joke. That's all. Your comment was good. I'm rocking a 2 week old lol I planned to respond better later but I will go ahead. The thing is that no matter who says what...we still just don't know what happened. I happen to think this a bit out there and doesn't connect all the dots. Agree to disagree I suppose. I reread the part about who the shooter was. I guess you could interpret it be Campos or not be him. That wasn't clear. However, I don't see any gunman being able to get away after the shooting stopped.

       Actually this could still work.  The sting could be targeting a group or a cell.  Lets just say 4 people total show up to make the purchase - makes sense since they have to carry all those guns out of the building.  Four guys with two big bags each isn't as weird as one guy with 8 bags, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So one guy gets an itchy finger and offs Paddock right away.  Two of the buyers in the group freak, grab one or two guns each and make a run for it.  The other two decided "well, we were gonna use the guns at some point anyway so lets just do it now and proceed to break the windows and shoot at the concert.  The new time line says that no shots were fired for at least 6 minutes after that initial shot and it lasted for up to 15 minutes total.  That's 21 minutes for the two guys that ran immediately to get to other locations and start shooting as well.

       Yes, cause people who work in shady gun deals certainly want to call attention to themselves by committing a mass shooting. Ffs this is stupid.

       That's kind of the point.  Why do you think groups like ISIS take credit for events like this?  They want to call attention to themselves and their cause by committing mass shootings/bombings/chaos.  So....yeahhhh.  You're exactly right.

       Really? And you state this as if it is fact. No. You state that Campos was the guy they picked and converted for this attack. You then say that Campos had never used a gun before that night so that is why the lapse in shooting. Are you out of your head? They would have made sure Campos was well trained! Even if the shooting was to never happen they would have had to train him to make it seem real. This sub has so many bullshit ideas that it is no worried people laugh at it.

       For that story to work it means paddock didnt use fbi supplied guns and also means they bought live rounds into the room and most likely pre-loaded all the weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a decent theory but a few flaws,  how did he leave the room without guard,maintenance or police seeing etc..

       leaving a mass shooting scenario would be pretty easy considering 22000+ at the concert streaming into all nearby locales (including the Mandalay Bay resort to a small degree I'm sure (speculation)) also people in the hotel rooms coming out of their rooms to discover what's going on, casino patrons ambling about confused (or hunkering down as some sort of goon-squad rambles thru waving rifles screaming hands-up).
      </p>
      <p>
       basically I see it possible like this, actual shooter (AS) is contacted/contacts paddock or another "associate" of paddock who gets them in contact, AS or paddock sets up initial lollapalooza meet, something happens and it doesnt go thru, AS gets suspicious when paddock/associate-of recontacts AS to meet in Las Vegas but, the actual shooter (AS) agrees as long as certain requirements are met by paddock (i.e 23 rifles, bump stocks, 2000+ LIVE/loaded ammo for "practice/instructional/testing" purposes, maybe target practice equipment (tannerite "found" in paddocks car), all this in hotel room ready for wheeled out to the desert somewhere for the demo/practice/instruction by paddock to AS
      </p>
      <p>
       AS shows up to Mandalay Bay notices suspicious looking cart outside room beside paddocks, pulls his/her own handgun and blasts paddock thru the peephole when he knocks, 
"guard" campos (who could have been paddocks "handler/helper") comes out of his room down the hall, gets shot by AS. AS goes into hotel room, unpacks equipment, struggles with some of it hence hesitent fire, gets his "mission" accomplished, throws his gloves on paddocks hands and hits the elevator or stairs or simply walks to another "wing" of the hotel and acts as though he's a startled guest of the resort like everyone else as he casually strolls out the front doors {

       but how the hell should I/YOU know any of this I was in college, or online, or bartending, or fucking while this all went down and until I enter some afterlife/alternate dimension/AI/computer program that allows my/your consciousness to "review" all of existence we shall probably never know every aspect of this crazy LV shooting

       People were not allowed in or out of MB after the shooting. Most other places were on lockdown for a while too if I'm not mistaken but MB def was.

       I can buy the FBI radicalized part, and Paddock not being intended for anything beyond gun supply, but everything else doesn't make much sense to me.  As any of the gun users point out, you don't just pick up a weapon and figure it out first time.  There are numerous factors that would throw you off greatly.  The noise without hearing protection, the smoke, the effort to shoot that looking, etc

       This is more realistic than the BS that they keep feeding us.
      </p>
      <p>
       More so considering that the FBI does this shit all the time. Just a couple months ago they set up a mentally challenged man to go blow up a building in Oklahoma City. His parents said he would have never been capable of doing any of it without the FBI holding his hand every step of the way, just to swoop in at the last second saving the day.
