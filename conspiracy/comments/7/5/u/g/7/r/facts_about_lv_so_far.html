        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><strong>Weeks/Months before:</strong></p>

<p>LVMPD gets 35 new officers</p>

<p>CEO of MGM Resorts sells 80-85% of his stock in MGM</p>

<p>Soros buys $42M put-option on MGM Resorts*</p>

<p>Paddock makes $5M in one year as a &#39;professional gambler&#39;*</p>

<p>Paddock purchases 33 of his 47 firearms in the last 12 months*</p>

<p>Paddock&#39;s girlfriend/roommate (Marilou Danley) flies to Asia on September 21. Danley claims Paddock booked the trip without her knowledge and &quot;sent&quot; her there to visit family in the Philippines.*</p>

<p>Paddock wires $100,000 to Danley in the Philippines*</p>

<p><strong>Leading up to Event:</strong></p>

<p>Paddock has 32-134 comped to him and after 3 days decides to add the suite 32-135 with his own cash [it is still unclear as to which room he was comped and stayed in first, as pointed out the room service bill was for 32-135]</p>

<p>Paddock never seen with anyone on any surveillance</p>

<p>Paddock has access to the service elevators, which are confirmed to have cameras on them</p>

<p>Room service lists 2 guests with 2 Pepsi&#39;s and a mineral water ordered <del>(if you&#39;re drinking mineral water it could be to replace soda, but that&#39;s speculation)</del></p>

<p>Valet attendant greets Paddock on multiple occasions; claims never had to carry anything out of the ordinary for him. That article has been scrubbed from Hawaiian ABC affiliate <del>and the valet attendant is missing and has deleted all social networks</del> &quot;valet isn’t missing, just overwhelmed by situation and went on vacation to California. The news station removed his interview because he asked them to&quot;*</p>

<p>Report of &#39;you&#39;re all going to die&#39; crazy lady with male friend at event 30-45 min prior to shooting</p>

<p>Paddock&#39;s pass was used to leave the parking deck. 15 minutes later while his car was out, his key card was used to enter the room*</p>

<p><strong>Just before Event:</strong></p>

<p>Multiple reports of fireworks moments prior to shooting</p>

<p>Campos is sent to investigate an open door alarm (probably a guest door) unrelated to the shooter.</p>

<p>Campos comes up the stairwell by Paddock&#39;s door but finds the stairwell door can&#39;t be opened (Paddock has sealed it). Campos may have heard drilling at this time.</p>

<p>Campos calls in to engineering to fix the door.</p>

<p>Campos goes down stairs, up elevator and investigates the open door alarm as planned.</p>

<p>After the investigation (outcome not known) Campos proceeds to investigate drilling.</p>

<p>Campos gets fired at in hallway on approach to the suite. We do not know if this was sustained gunfire. He is hit in the thigh.</p>

<p>It is reported that Campos called for help via radio and house phone but there is no evidence of this yet.</p>

<p>Building engineer Stephen Schuck arrives on floor via elevator without any knowledge of gunfire. Shots fired down hall as he is 1/3 of the way there.</p>

<p>Campos, taking cover in door alcove in hall, tells Schuck to take cover, saving his life.</p>

<p>A sustained barrage of gunfire ensues.</p>

<p>Schuck radios in report.</p>

<p>Campos and Schuck escape hallway during a lull in fire.</p>

<p>Engineering manager arrives. Gives keys to Schuck. He goes down stairs to turn off elevators. Returns and gives keys back. It is not known if this occurs before or after the main event.</p>

<p>~200 rounds are fired from Paddock&#39;s suite into the hallway</p>

<p>Campos is still present on the 32nd floor when SWAT arrives *(most of this section added thanks to <a href="/u/2ndSaturdaysWarrior">/u/2ndSaturdaysWarrior</a> and the info checks out as facts)</p>

<p><strong>The Event:</strong></p>

<p>Paddock, acting alone, fires semi-automatic rounds from 134. He then fires rapid fire rounds from the same window, despite the under-sheriff saying otherwise. Reason being is there is photographic and video evidence that shows the suite window was still in tact at least up until the 3rd automatic-type volley </p>

<p>Paddock then uses multiple weapons, and multiple types of cartridges (confirmed by the under-sheriff) and fires over 1000 rounds into the crowd at R91, while at some point breaking out the suite window, hurricane glass, with a hammer. </p>

<p>He also switches between rooms often (taxi driver video explained as him switching rooms for audio discrepancies) and before he calls it a night, locks the adjoining door, walks around back into the suite, and kills himself firing a (.357?) revolver twice over about 15-20 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>After the Attack:</strong></p>

<p>Zebra 20 (SWAT) is on location for about 40 minutes prior to executing the first breach on the suite, finding Paddock dead, executing their second breach to 32-134, and moving furniture around (as witnessed by the man staying in 31-134 via New York Times interview)</p>

<p>EMS reports taking fire near the Tropicana casino (After Paddock is dead)</p>

<p>Shots reported at Bellagio</p>

<p>Shots reported at NYNY/Excalibur</p>

<p>Shots reported at Aria</p>

<p>Shots reported at Caesars</p>

<p>Random helicopter is filmed in the Harley Davidson parking lot behind Mandalay Bay. Assault rifle is on the ground and a masked man enters a vehicle*</p>

<p>Armed mercenaries (Metro?*) escort person and/or items outside of the Tropicana while their point man clearly aims his muzzle at casino guests</p>

<p>Jesus Campos does not speak to media. He does not get bullet removed from leg. He has armed guards at his residence from a company that has had their business license expire in January</p>

<p>One of Paddock&#39;s homes in Reno is broken into, but nothing is reported missing*</p>

<p>Authorities found tannerite in Paddock&#39;s car, which was parked in hotel garage, as well as gas mask(s) and bulletproof vests in the suite*</p>

<p>At least two cell phone chargers were found in his room (police later say they matched all to his devices)*</p>

<p>Marilou Danley is placed on no-fly list on October 11*</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because abhorrence doesn&#39;t mean illogical. Evil can be evil and still make rational sense, even if the motives behind the event aren&#39;t fully understood. There should exist a rational, evidence-based accounting of what happened before, during and after the shooting even if we never gain a glimpse into the shooter&#39;s mind. The information we&#39;re being fed doesn&#39;t make sense and everyone I&#39;ve talked to is noticing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite part is that the window to the suite was in tact after the shooting. This fucks everything up because that&#39;s where Paddock was found. The official narrative:
Paddock shoots through the suite door at the security guard.
Runs into adjacent room 134 and opens fire on the crowd.
Since the door to 134 was breached from the suite, we can assume it was locked. So Paddock locks that door before he leaves room 134, walks around the food cart, back into the suite, and shoots himself in the head.</p>

<p>Huge red flag that the suite window was not broken after the shooting. That&#39;s where Paddock was. Also there isn&#39;t a thousand brass ejects scattered all over the suite room in the leaked photos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find interesting that the brief pauses would be from the changes in helicopter distance and altitude. The room was most likely staged to hide a greater agenda. Aka false flag. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/6xfrxoGvWRU">https://youtu.be/6xfrxoGvWRU</a></p>

<p>And for the &#39;blackwater&#39; gearing up I&#39;m not sure whether it was before or during the shooting. Because the first 3 shots or several were accompanied by the helicopter between Mandalay and the other building.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure when this was shot 
<a href="https://youtu.be/gNK3e9r3-9Y">https://youtu.be/gNK3e9r3-9Y</a></p>

<p>But that does not matter this is conspiracy subreddit.. the 6 minute time line, paddock, could all be a ploy to cover up the helicopters. Pretty sure it was 7.62mm with muzzle break or some technology. Whenever the helicopter approaches the firing would start but no one would record up at the helicopter especially the crowd that took 1000 shots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for considering it really. Trust me I didn&#39;t believe anything else after I heard this theory. Now no one wants to believe it I feel like I&#39;m the only one.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s helicopters it&#39;s definitely staged/ false flag op (event which pushes hidden agenda). Did it end at Paddock? Nope. Him and the 6 minute time line prior to the shooting is all a setup so the main perpetrators and purpose are hidden.</p>

<p>This theory accounts for shots being heard at Bellagio
Accounts for people saying shots were on top of Mandalay
Accounts for 2 shooters because there were 2 private military helicopters and 1 news crew. The helicopter fades in coincidentally during each shooting burst.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Campos is sent to investigate a open door alarm(probably a guest door) unrelated to the shooter.</p>

<p>Campos comes up the stairwell by Paddock&#39;s door but finds the stairwell door can&#39;t be opened(Paddock as sealed it). Campos may have heard drilling at this time.</p>

<p>Campos calls in to engineering to fix the door.</p>

<p>Campos goes down stairs, up elevator and investigates the open door alarm as planned.</p>

<p>After the investigation(outcome not known) Campos proceeds to investigate drilling.</p>

<p>Campos gets fired at in hallway on approach to the suite. We do not know if this was sustained gunfire. He is hit in thigh.</p>

<p>It is reported that Campos called for help via radio and house phone but there is no evidence of this yet.</p>

<p>Building engineer Stephen Schuck arrives on floor via elevator without any knowledge of gunfire. Shots fired down hall as he is 1/3 of the way there.</p>

<p>Campos, taking cover in door alcove in hall, tells Schuck to take cover, saving his life.</p>

<p>A sustained barrage of gunfire ensues.</p>

<p>Schuck radios in report.</p>

<p>Campos and Schuck escape hallway during a lull in fire.</p>

<p>Engineering manager arrives. Gives keys to Schuck. He goes down stairs to turn off elevators. Returns and gives keys back. It is not known if this occurs before or after the main event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you need to listen to that interview again, he says Jesus popped his head out and said to take cover, he says he took cover, then he says &quot;I could see he was shot in the leg&quot;. How would he know he was shot in the leg when he just said he popped his head out?</p>

<p>Secondly, he makes a big point to say how silent it is, but Jesus was already shot, so clearly these weren&#39;t the first shots as they report. We still have absolutely no clue what is true in regards to the security guard.</p>

<p>Remember, we were originally told that the person staying in the room below paddock called about shots being fired, and that that was the reason the guard was there.. and it turns out that isn&#39;t true, or at least there&#39;s been no mention of it since the press conference last Wednesday.</p>

<p>But besides him being called because the door won&#39;t open, this doesn&#39;t confirm any of the stuff that was posted (that you added) higher up in this comment thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vid presents a valid method of analyzing the number and location of shooters, nut is missing critical data to draw accurate conclusions. It assumes all shots being acoustically analyzed are Remington-manufactured 5.53 rounds. We know, however, that the alleged shooter also had, at the least, .308 caliber rifles. Lacking an inventory of spent brass we simply can&#39;t say all rounds fired were Remington 5.53 of the same grain and powder load. Acquire THAT data and then re-do the forensic acoustic analysis.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called different things in different areas, but all those cops you see at MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL, games, construction sites, etc., are not actually on duty but they&#39;re paid security. They still cops, and they&#39;re still expected to do cop things in their entirety, it&#39;s just that those things are not generally up to the taxpayer to cover the cost of, so cops sign up for these gigs where they make some kind of overtime pay on their days off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  Are you metro?  I heard graduates had to do a six month stint on the tourist corridor, either downtown or on the strip. I think they even get to submit their preference.  I thought they had to do six months at four (?) of the area commands before putting in for a permant duty station. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know that about the security.  So are they then paid by a third party, or are they paid through the city?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not metro, but dealt with them regularly when I worked for a casino. If they had rookies on the strip, it was likely during weeknights, not on big festival/holiday events or weekends, which is when I usually interacted with them. I can&#39;t speak for sure to the four area commands things, but it&#39;s not something I heard. And even then, bike patrol is a specialized division in those AC&#39;s so it still wouldn&#39;t be a rookie. </p>

<p>Any police that are at an event are paid by the department, the dept gets the money either from a contract with the venue/event organizers (once-a-year things like EDC or Route 91) or standing agreement for things like the T-Mobile arena where they have events most nights and need police. They can&#39;t take patrol officers off patrol for these, so the venue pays extra for overtime officers to show up.</p>

<p>The Sheriff confirmed it this week: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lombardo said Paddock spent those first three days in a separate room, and the hotel provided that room free of charge for unknown reasons. Paddock spent the remaining days in the corner suite where he staged his attack, and he paid for the suite himself.</p>

<p>“We’ve learned that there’s a difference of comp days versus personal pay days,” Lombardo said. “We were going off the personal pay days.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From your linked article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paddock, a video poker player, checked in to Mandalay Bay on Sept. 25 — three days earlier than initially reported. Lombardo said Paddock spent those first three days in a separate room, and the hotel provided that room free of charge for unknown reasons. Paddock spent the remaining days in the corner suite where he staged his attack, and he paid for the suite himself. “We’ve learned that there’s a difference of comp days versus personal pay days,” Lombardo said. “We were going off the personal pay days.” While investigators continue to comb through Paddock’s corner suite, <strong>nothing significant was collected from the first room</strong>, the sheriff said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the &quot;first room&quot; were 134 then it could not conceivably be the case that &quot;nothing significant was collected&quot; from 134. That is where the bulk of the shots were fired from. That leads me to believe his comped room was elsewhere in the hotel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so for the tracer ammo, may or may not be worth including, but he was in the market for tracer bullets in the weeks leading up to the event, but did not use tracer bullets during the attack. </p>

<p>Background:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Paddock tried to buy tracer ammunition at a gun show in the Phoenix area in recent weeks, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation tells CNN.</p>

<p>Paddock bought other ammunition at the show, but he couldn&#39;t obtain the tracer ammunition -- bullets with a pyrotechnic charge that, when the round is fired, leaves an illuminated trace of its path -- because the vendor didn&#39;t have any to sell, the official said.</p>

<p>Paddock did not use tracer bullets when he fired into the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest Festival from his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, hundreds of yards away.</p>

<p><a href="http://archive.is/rNOna">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But then someone replied to a thread I posted about this saying that Fox and CNN both reported that Paddock did own tracer bullets. I don&#39;t have sources for that though. </p>

<p>Either way, he was in the market for them in the weeks leading up, but regardless of whether he was able to obtain them or not, he didn&#39;t use them in the attack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you think the tracer ammo was for the aviation tank he was trying to blow up?? I&#39;ve read it&#39;s very hard to get that kind of fuel to explode and almost impossible with a normal bullet. </p>

<p>The only time I&#39;ve ever shot &quot;tracer&quot; type ammunition I think it was called &quot;dragons breath&quot;. We were just target shooting for fun/practice. Thought everything was good. An hour after we left my friend&#39;s place where we&#39;d been shooting he called to tell us his entire back field was on fire. Luckily he was the last to shoot them and I&#39;d hosed my area down so I knew it wasn&#39;t me but it made me realize how well they burned for awhile. </p>

<p>We stood in the field for a good 30 minutes clearing/unloading our guns and talking after our last rounds and didn&#39;t see anything. </p>

<p>I wonder if that&#39;s why Paddock wanted the tracers?? For the afterburner effect? Or would he want them so he could better see where they were landing in the crowd? I guess it could be both. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dragons breath and tracers aren&#39;t the same. Dragons breath for shotguns and tracers for rifles. Idk what the tanks are made of and it foesnt really matter cuz nothing happened because of it. If the bullets would spark off the metal tanks, you wouldn&#39;t need tracers. If it&#39;s too hard, tracers won&#39;t penetrate. Normally tracers are used in autos to track your spray. But in his situation, tracers seem unneeded, as there was a huge area. Spray in the vicinity and they could all be lethal. I just didn&#39;t want anyone getting the wrong impression by your post. </p>

<p>Maybe I got what gun the ammo we were shooting from wrong because it&#39;s been a few years but that doesn&#39;t change much. Tracers still have more flammability than nontracers. Look at youtube. There&#39;s tons of &quot;tracer round starts fire&quot; videos. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s unlikely. Shooting into a crowd was an impersonal attack that is somewhat imaginable for someone of his character -- that is, someone described by friends as giving and caring. He would have gone out of his way to avoid personal, up-close confrontations. Given that the guard hadn&#39;t knocked on his door or anything, he wouldn&#39;t have. And barring that analysis, if he WERE going to shoot the guard, he would have to have finished the job.</p>

<p>Far more likely is that Campos was shot in the leg, or shot himself in the leg, to take suspicion off of his complicity in the crime. Not saying Campos was a shooter, but I believe he was a part of a Let It Happen On Purpose crew who was assigned to guard Paddock during the incident.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was my biggest hang-up the whole time. Talked about in one of my posts. </p>

<p>Paddock was so organized, planned, methodical. He had some desire for fulfillment when he opened fire on the crowd, which reports say was satisfied, leading him to commit suicide. Ok, i can take that.</p>

<p>However, why shoot a security guard if you&#39;re gonna kill yourself anyway? Hell, what made him even think it was security guard, it&#39;s reasonable he believed it could be a cop, then if so, why kill a cop if you&#39;re not interested in killing anymore?</p>

<p>Maybe he was interrupted too early and didn&#39;t want to kill him, so he fleshed him. Ok, that&#39;s how the story goes, but c&#39;mon, you just murdered over 100 people but you take it cautious on the only guy who has the potential to murder you?</p>

<p>Further, 200 rounds fired in the hallway. To me, this means he either really really wanted that guard dead, or it was overkill allowing the guard to &#39;wait&#39; for backup SWAT. IF he really wanted that guard dead, why not the cops later on?</p>

<p>Paddock committed suicide, he didn&#39;t want to have suicide by cop. Okay, so why risk shooting the guard and having him prematurely have a chance to come return fire? If so, why not immediately commit suicide after you shoot the guard.</p>

<p>IMO, the way he orchestrated his entire plan embodies his organized and planned crime. The outlier&#39;s are: he shot the guard, he committed suicide, he didn&#39;t want to suicide by cops. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Paddock, a video poker player, checked in to Mandalay Bay on Sept. 25 — three days earlier than initially reported.
Lombardo said Paddock spent those first three days in a separate room, and the hotel provided that room free of charge for unknown reasons. Paddock spent the remaining days in the corner suite where he staged his attack, and he paid for the suite himself.
“We’ve learned that there’s a difference of comp days versus personal pay days,” Lombardo said. “We were going off the personal pay days.”
While investigators continue to comb through Paddock’s corner suite, nothing significant was collected from the first room, the sheriff said.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just thinking out loud here. There is confusion on what room was comped and the receipt seemingly pointing to the paid room yes? What if he knew who had the paid room before he took over? Could he have been visiting that room with whomever and called up and ordered, said put it on my bill, but send it to this room instead? </p>

<p>Did that make sense? lol I know what I mean in my head. Perhaps the person that had the paid room prior to him may have left something there for him or they just went over firing positions or the set up or any number of things. Got hungry in the middle of it and ordered food. The food itself went to that room, hence that room number so the bell boy knew where to take it, but the actual bill was for the comped room</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the thinking on this. It’s occurred to me that if we work it backward, the question arises: how did paddock end up in that particular suite/room? </p>

<p>We know it was comped. I live in Vegas and understand the room comping system, but not exactly how it works. I assume that at some point the person being comped requests the accommodation. Does he have the ability to request a certain room? Or certain location of rooms ie. anything on that corner of the building in a range of floors? </p>

<p>To me it would be interesting to find out just how that particular room was acquired. And who did the data entry for that part of the hotel records. It might go a long way toward establishing motive or who exactly arranged for this location. </p>

<p>I hope someone sees where my thinking on this is headed</p>

<ul>
<li><p>EMS reports taking fire near the Tropicana casino (After Paddock is dead)</p></li>
<li><p>Random helicopter is filmed in the Harley Davidson parking lot behind Mandalay Bay. Assault rifle is on the ground and a masked man enters a vehicle*</p></li>
<li><p>Armed mercenaries (Metro?*) escort person and/or items outside of the Tropicana while their point man clearly aims his muzzle at casino guests</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting.  Are you metro?  I heard graduates had to do a six month stint on the tourist corridor, either downtown or on the strip. I think they even get to submit their preference.  I thought they had to do six months at four (?) of the area commands before putting in for a permant duty station. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know that about the security.  So are they then paid by a third party, or are they paid through the city?  </p>
