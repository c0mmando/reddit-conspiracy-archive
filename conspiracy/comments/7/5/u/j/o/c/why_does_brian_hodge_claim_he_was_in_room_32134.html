<p>If I didn&#39;t write my hotel room number down &amp; put it in my wallet I&#39;d never have any idea what room I was staying in. I have no special connection to a rando hotel room that looks exactly like 1000 other rooms. </p>

<p>You may be correct, but I don&#39;t see any reason to think that <em>surely</em> a hotel guest isn&#39;t mistaken about his room number. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, wow, this is the first time I&#39;ve been accused of being in the FBI! I&#39;m kind of giddy about it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s arrogance, you know. The reason you think anyone who doesn&#39;t think you&#39;re 100% right about everything you say was sent to mislead or discredit you is that you are arrogant. You think you can&#39;t be wrong, and you think powerful people care what you think. </p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna block you now, because I find reddit more enjoyable when I don&#39;t have to interact with negative people &amp; with paranoid people. I know my bosses at the FBI will not like that, because I&#39;m supposed to be keeping tabs on the smartest of the smart, but Ilm gonna tell em, hey, he figured me out! We are dealing with the most intelligent target in this agency&#39;s history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you write it down and carry it in your wallet. So, if you are using your experience to help explain Hodge, and trying to say that he can&#39;t remember hotel room numbers, wouldn&#39;t you also assume he would do the same? Surely you don&#39;t think he wanders around aimlessly until someone helps him, right?</p>
