       I think part of it is he is just getting old, and possibly senile. He wrote those books when he was younger, he made all that money in the past, today he seems like a bumbling idiot half the time. Its like some days he is OK but others he threatens nuclear war and says some really stupid stuff. My guess is like Regan he is starting to develop Alzheimer's, which I think his father had as well. I have family who are a but older than trump and you can tell that they are have lost it, which is really sad.

       I whole heartedly agree with the right to criticize him but maybe we want to be entertained. To escape the world with an hour of Kimmel of stupid stuff or a few hours listening to our favorite music.

       Its an issue b/c its engulfed it. And its taken a more serious tone.

      <p>
       Making fun of something barely out of the norm is reaching and poor comedy. It seems contrived and out of an agenda.
      </p>

       Sure the big ones are enjoyable. Make fun of cable tv or cars or whatever occasionally.

       Oh it's an agenda all right, and failed one that they simply can't believe that they couldn't dictate and enjoy the success and perks that would have come their way if they had.

       It's because he's the super low hanging fruit, easy to make fun of, most of the country like Trump joke, and because he won't fucking shut up.
      </p>

       Literally all he has to do to not get made fun of so much is to not tweet or say something controversial every like 3 days. That's it.

       I'm not a fan of him either. But I do not understand how the fuck people can watch these shows every night. I would say Colbert spends at least 90% of the time talking about Trump.

       And yet Trump keeps giving them enough material every day... I agree with you that this is a systematic agenda but to be honest, Trump is not helping himself with his strange behavior. Act like a lunatic and people will start calling you one. Just my two cents

That's what soured the entire late night field for me: not so much the non-stop mean-spirited lampoon and increasingly cringy jokes about Trump (guy creates great satire material with his every action after all) but their astonishing praise and gushing exaltation for all memberd of the Clinton Cabal, Obama and even whitewhasing past administrations' war criminals.

       drone strikes have gone up because that is what is going to happen. drone strikes are relatively new in warfare and as our technology gets better we are going to bomb more shit blindly with drones. the president has little control over literally anything war related or anything related to anything. the president is as far as im concerned a scapegoat. a face to pin the blame on for the things the government does. nothing more than a name from a hat. something to make the people feel like hes their man and he can do something different than that other guy.

       "The president has little control over literally anything war related"
Your saying the commander in chief, the guy in charge of the entire military has no control of anything war  related?! Wow
For starters, let's recall when he explicitly stated he'd have the innocent family members and children of terrorists purposely murdered. If you're unlucky enough to be a cousin or father of someone who, let's say,  joined the Islamic state- too bad, your going to get freedom-slaughtered.

       your saying the military has to do whatever the president says? the arms of the government are their own government. they have grown bigger and more powerful than the constitution and the people. the puppet in charge of the government is nothing more than a puppet to blame things on.

       Remember when Obama said he would pull out of Iraq and Afghanistan and close Guantanamo? It was right around the time he got the Nobel Peace Prize.

      <p>
       But instead of doing that, he expanded the wars to Libya, Syria, Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia. I'm sure I missed a few.

       You can't dig yourself in that deep when it comes to this type of shit. Yes all presidents are puppets, but that does not absolve them of crimes. Also, the president had very much a say in warfare. He signs off approval on most shit.

       I disagree.  I think comedy can be a great vehicle for truth and awareness.  Lenny Bruce, George Carlin... hell, even Joe Rogan's stand up.  And those are just the big names off the top of my head.  There's been LOTS of less known comedians that are "woke".

       Posts like this make me sad. Don't get so lost with the darkness of the world that you lose your humanity in the process. Life is a gift and your perception is your reality. We were meant to experience happiness and love with one another. Cynicism is death for the soul. Instead focus on transforming yourself and others around you with positivity. We can't forget to find joy in the little things.

       Trump is a criminal, misogynist, racist fool. I'm pretty sure he's literate though. Not that Obama is necessarily better, but Trump really is those things. I don't think you should be mad that people know Trump is those things, you should just be mad that so few know that Obama is also those things.

       This is the way I always propose a conspiracy.  Maybe because I don't claim to know anything for sure, so I'm not devoted to any theories.  I just like to ask questions and discuss/debate opinions.

       You're not alone. I do the exact same thing. Although i find myself watching/listening to less and less music and shows. I just dedicate my time to reading, hobbies, house work, and finally slowed on the drinking to focus more on healthy habits. I can't really relate to many people anymore. Most of the time they just repeat talking points from msm or some drivel from their favorite bread and circus act.

       The same reason I used to: latent unhappiness (stemming from lack of hope and purpose).

      <p>
       Hypothetically, if you found out that whatever force is at the top of this system (be it a bunch of humans, a god, or some other force) was neither good nor evil, would you reassess your lifestyle?

      <p>
       In other words, what if this world is what we make of it as individuals? As in, what if nobody is coming to kill us, but nobody is coming to help us either?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were to learn this is the case, could you see yourself setting some goals and working towards them?
      </p>
      <p>
       That is what I did. I used to binge every weekend. Now I barely touch the stuff, too busy improving myself, working towards a goal (PM me if you like), and getting some surprising gainz.

       Damn friend, might I suggest a low-key dinner party or something?  Social contact is important.  In my opinion (which I'm prepared for others here to disagree with), MORE important than "truth" or conspiracies.

       My default is work, home, couch.  But that throws me into a lethargy that isn't fun so I force myself out, or to invite others over, at least once a month.  Because that's what life is

       I have to keep two different frames of mind. One where I follow and know current events so I can at least converse with the average person and then one with all the stuff I actually think about and know. When talking to friends at parties I have to do a surface level investigation to see what they knew before I saw anything. They usually know the msnbcbs/fox brainwashing. I sit alone often.

       I was showing you that they did indeed have windows. A "gas chamber" needs to be airtight in order to be effective. Those rooms were not airtight and they had windows and normal doors. Which implies those rooms were for delousing, not gassing people.

       Most people do believe in gas chambers, we just think the numbers of people actually gassed were grossly over estimated. 6000 Jews a day were estimated to have been gassed at Auschwitz. They had limited supplies of ovens and three ovens estimated to cremate 340 bodies in 24 hours. That means an average of 113 bodies per oven per hour. You would need 53 ovens running 24 hours a day to get rid of 6000 victims daily at Auschwitz alone. Now you have to also factor in the time it takes to remove hundreds of bodies from the gas chamber, in which had to be adequately ventilated between each session before the bodies could be recovered. I think it's more likely that a couple hundred thousand were gassed and not over a million at Auschwitz. Not that it makes it any better but that's the doubt I have personally about the holocaust.

       I've noticed this reality set in deeper as I plunge further into various rabbit holes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll say the hardest thing is sometimes hearing someone you respect/love repeat propaganda from a suspect source even after you've tried to sit down &amp; seriously sum up all of humanity (essentially) &amp; all the conspiracies that go into it, as all tie into one another in some fucked up way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: my gf works with this really cool girl who's studying political studies but somehow is totally unable to even fathom the possibility that anyone but Trump or a republican is a puppet/"bad" person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now my gf is slowly starting to just accept whatever this friend says about a brief review of a WaPo article instead of, at least, my late nights of searching for what I'm not being told.
      </p>
      <p>
       Smoke weed responsibly, consume alcohol even more responsibly, battle the FUCK out of your ego before anything else &amp; as always keep it trippy.

       Yea that's the hardest - being spoken down to pedantically while they repeat whatever it is they've been told by the magician in their TV, as if I haven't seen the mainstream narrative and don't know where to find good information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bring up inconsistencies with their point of view? 'well now your just getting into that conspiracy stuff...' is usually the response, no matter how much evidence is brought up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've come to realize that a lot of people will only accept things once it's right in front of their face and cannot be hidden anymore. Don't wanna rock the boat.

       I'm actually pretty good at parties. Believe it or not the "free-thinking", "conspiratorial" types are usually the most wild.

       Me too.  But I'm not trying to shove "truth" down anyone's throat.  And perhaps because I'm a "normie" in every other part of my life, when I bust out with some conspiracy truths it always shocks and intrigues people.  And we either have a good laugh at my expense (which I'm perfectly fine with) or we sit down and dig deeper.  Fun either way.

       It's also bogus. The majority of people don't believe the official story on 9/11. Most people are "conspiracy theorists" today, but you'd never know it if you think the corporate media is doing a good job of informing the public. I can only imagine op is trying to discourage people from speaking honestly among their peers. "Don't be honest or your friends will not like you!" says op. Fuck that shit. Just to spite op, I'm going to go out of my way to talk about all the conspiracy theories I can think of next time I'm with a bunch of friends.

       Yeah, because the corporate media won't ever tell you about it. Look up public opinion polls on the subject, it's not hard to find a bunch of resources supporting my claim, you just won't ever hear about it from any corporate news company. Because those corporations serve the state, they're effectively state media.

       Yes, I agree. Fortunately there are sites like meetup.com which make it a little easier, although even then you have to be willing to meet a lot of oddballs and misfits to find people worth talking to. Good on you for making the effort. As you say, it is not so easy once you leave school/uni to make new friends.

       Parties with like minded individuals are kinda boring, though.  Give me some bible-banging conservatives for me to break bread with as blowing people's minds is my kind of fun.  That said, it's all in the approach, I suppose.  And my approach is entertaining first, truth bombs second.

       Bottom line: Trump will be held up as a god on a pedestal and his detractors will fall away like leaves in the wind, nothing but praise from Hollywood. How? He orders direct confrontation with Russia in Syria and keeps marches into Iran. Kurds get their own territory, Turkey gets decimated, NATO collapses. And all it's gonna cost you is a few nuked cities. There is a monster being born.

       Nonsense.  Conspiracy theory is closely related to humor.  They both have to do with being able to look at things from a different perspective.  Humor actually hinges upon getting someone to see that something doesn't work the way they thought it did.  In fact, it works the exact opposite from how they thought it did.
      </p>
      <p>
       So viewing the world from the a conspiracy theory viewpoint it actuall hilarious.  It's like getting a joke.

       Truth is paradoxal in the way that; the truth is for the one who seek it, and will set you free. But if you try to enforce it on someone who does not seek it, the truth will bite you back as ignorance by the ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       My thought about it is; you can only lead by example. Stop trying to change the world by mass, try to change it in the scale that you can effect, bit by bit.  To high goals will only make yourself question yourself and your own importance. Find some kind of balance between preaching and acting, when you only preach about the truth, conditioned people will stop listening. But if you act like the way you want others to act, people will soon notice and learn. To want to learn the truth is a state of mind, and if you want others to want to know the truth, you have to condition them in a way. Or rather de-condition them.

       That's because Nibiru has literally no objective evidence going for it. It's literally made up. You should talk about it as interesting speculation (like discussion of a seance) because at best the only reason to believe it is if you unequivocally believe all channelling is real
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       always completely truthful.

       I can convince literally anyone to take "Chem Trails" seriously (or at least make them stop arguing and admit "that's weird"), because I've researched it at length and can show evidence to support my case.
      </p>
      <p>
       With Nibiru you have "some guy said so because he says he talked to aliens," that's it. It disgusts me that people take this shit seriously without at least finding some damn evidence to support the case.

       The problem is when you are a downer trying to drown people in "truth".  Nobody likes that, nor are many receptive to it.  Spreading "truth" is like America spreading Democracy - it only sounds like a good thing to US.  Also, there's this epidemic of conspiracists claiming to "know" everything.  Nobody likes that either because who wants to be wrong?  Further, most conspiracies are that way because there simply isn't enough info to know
       <strong>
        for sure
       </strong>
       - so it's best to approach it that way (in my opinion).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm all about some bigfoot and UFO's.  My friends think I'm nuts.  Whatever.  I like to jokingly mention conspiracies at every opportunity, but I do it in a lighthearted way.  Those interested will ask more and we can get real and talk deeper.  I've opened up quite a few people taking it from that angle.  But perhaps it's because I honestly don't give a shit if anyone else is woke or not - it's just my personal goal, I'm not trying to convince anyone of anything.

       "The president has little control over literally anything war related"
Your saying the commander in chief, the guy in charge of the entire military has no control of anything war  related?! Wow
For starters, let's recall when he explicitly stated he'd have the innocent family members and children of terrorists purposely murdered. If you're unlucky enough to be a cousin or father of someone who, let's say,  joined the Islamic state- too bad, your going to get freedom-slaughtered.

       You can't dig yourself in that deep when it comes to this type of shit. Yes all presidents are puppets, but that does not absolve them of crimes. Also, the president had very much a say in warfare. He signs off approval on most shit.
