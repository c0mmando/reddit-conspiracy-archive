        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">466</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-11 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/getnit01.html">getnit01</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This will be the next step, they are trying to stop all and any more leads coming from the investigation. There are a couple more places that needs washed or obscured, one is the floor and room that paddock shot out of and the other will be the datacenter where all the film is kept, these 2 spots will likely or probably have a fire or some kind of accident that will destroy even more evidence. You can be sure of it.</p>

<p>EDIT: After a little more thought (not withstanding something else to destroy more evidence at Mandalay Bay), could the FBI and MGM just claim Plausible Deniability. Simple Easy. Ala September 11th type quotes.</p>

<p>Basically this. &quot;There were no warning signs that I&#39;m aware of that would indicate this type of operation in this city&quot;?</p>

<p>EDIT 2: More perspective on Plausible Deniability! From another user:</p>

<p>Question: &quot;If the FBI took over the investigation then why is the Vegas sheriff still leading the press conferences?&quot;</p>

<p>Answer: &quot;it is being done to sway attention away from looking at the Deep State goons who are &quot;investigating&quot; (covering up) the massacre. If any part of their official narrative is found to be contradictory to reality, and they have to change their story, guess who the FBI will make hold that press conference? The sheriff and local police.</p>

<p>Why, you may ask?</p>

<p>Because it doesn&#39;t matter that LVMPD and the sheriff have no say in the investigation. When the average fake news viewers see the sheriff leading the press conference, it will make them believe that any &quot;incorrect&quot; information that was previously broadcasted as part of the official narrative was the sheriff&#39;s bumbling instead of deliberate lying by the Deep State. This draws attention away from the FBI and gives them &#39;plausible deniability&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p>This is getting more surreal everyday that passes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I was going to say, any evidence they needed was likely gathered in the first few days.. I think it&#39;s too easy to think of cringe dramas on TV, where two weeks later, the cop is like &quot;let&#39;s go back and see if we find anything new!&quot;</p>

<p>And I&#39;m willing to bet the house got broken into by a fan or theorist.. I mean, this has the attention of more of the public than anything like it in a long time. Plenty of people that idolize murderers or wanna see for themselves I&#39;m sure.</p>

On the third or 4th time they were there, a detective that had beef with Avery planted it on his bedside table .Part of the documentary is about the theory the local police framed him for the murder .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>this was actually my thoughts on the break-in myself, although I do think LV is fishy... just not the break-in.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. And there&#39;s definitely something fishy. Investigations, or I should say criminal Justice is all about a very tight process for collecting information, everything is done in teams to minimize mistakes and overlooking things.. and vetting the information to make sure it&#39;s accurate and thorough is pretty important in any major case.</p>

<p>So when possibly the biggest case ever happens, and they release information about the guard first one way, then another day the next press conference (originally it was reported that he was responding to a call made from the person under the shooter, then became a door alarm on Wednesday).. THEN the timeline from Wednesday changes from the police arrived at guards floor 11 minutes after it was initially reported, to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/worker-warned-hotel-before-las-vegas-shooter-opened-fire-on-crowd/">there was another coworker that found the guard as he was still shooting, and radioed it into the hotel 6 minutes before the mass shooting</a></p>

<p>The only thing that has <strong>hugely</strong> changed in the official story is in regards to the guard. It&#39;s not even a conspiracy theory at this point, how the fuck does what we are told change so fucking much in what <em>should be</em> the most thoroughly vetted investigation ever?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That hotel&#39;s security cameras weren&#39;t working? Good point, I can&#39;t find it in the MSM articles (haven&#39;t re-watched earlier press conferences) although I do recall this being mentioned a few times. 
This gives me hope that there IS footage from the hotel, and the collective noise made a random statement into a &quot;fact&quot;. I</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going with murderbillia. Odds are to sell vs their own collection. Begin I tend to think murderbillia is such a tiny market space the odds of person being into that and breaking it rather rare. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s not kids doing something stupid being it&#39;s a retirement area and most have rules you can&#39;t live there if under say 55 or so. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also not an active crime scene so lack security being it&#39;s already been processed. Retirement community so people to sleep early in most cases. At the least they are not coming and going after say 11pm or so. It&#39;s a known location with picture on national news and a huge world wide known case. So you roll in with a camera for your &quot;documentation&quot; of the items authenticity and there go. <em>cha-ching</em></p>

<p>Still really stupid to go anywhere near a federal case of this nature. I mean the feds are still looking at all angles and if they catch a random person in the house of a mass shooter it&#39;s example making time.  Never mind the burglary charges they would rip into the person&#39;s life just to make sure there is no connection. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>CEO of MGM Resorts, James Murren, oversees  Mandalay Bay.. He is also in fact on the board for <em>National infrastructure advisory council</em> which is responsible for driving security policies in major public and private sectors, aka casinos, sports games concerts etc.. It&#39;s a slippery slope but it has to start somewhere.. Airports.. Then rapiscans (real name) at ball games.. The public buildings. Then everywhere.. Everyone always thinks in 80 year fragments..   But they are in it for the very very long game... </p>
