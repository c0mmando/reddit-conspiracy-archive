        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Maybe we should be a little cautious? </p>

<p>Has anyone thought about the possibility TPTB are using this tragic incident as a way to undermine and discredit the &quot;conspiracy community&quot;? I guess I am skeptical of the idea of a false flag here because there is no back story. Newtown, Boston, San Bernadino, Oklahoma City, 9/11 etc all had readily available back stories immediately after the incidents. It would seem with this guy being a loner they could create whatever back story they wanted to fit any narrative but they didn&#39;t. Why? 
  It concerns me as the popularity of the sub is growing and more people are questioning TPTB. Imagine what happens if TPTB release footage and evidence proving it was a lone shooter single actor (Haddock) who just went off the deep end. A lot of momentum is lost in the information war and many people who were starting to open up to the idea that this stuff happens will go back to their couches and laugh with Jimmy on late night about us wackos. </p>

<p>Sometimes crazy is just crazy and there is no agenda. It&#39;s so hard to fathom a person could do this but if we do not keep open mind to that possibility we may be the greatest cause to our demise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>2 things i got to say about this.  </p>

<p>For one, in the past i read about speculation on the delay of motives and backstory, in cases of false flags, they browse the internet for a theory as well. Monitor the most populair narritives and maybe also steer the direction of online conspiracy. Something to think about i guess ? I never got any confirmation on that, but somehow always believed it.</p>

<p>Second, ever since 9/11, i started watching, everything. And with every new conspiracy, you see a little push against ridiuling conspiracy theorists. I totally expect that though. They can&#39;t help but virtue signal at every possible opportunity.
This new round ,with google and youtube censorship of deemed &quot;untruthful&#39; content by TPTB is something to be worried about though.</p>

<p>You should check the whole thing again sir.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The censoring of online content has been a slow trickle. They will use ANY excuse to facilitate it. If all this conjecture is wrong you have just reinforced TPTB&#39;s untruthful content argument and their signaling would be virtuous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well we&#39;re obviously supposed to think he was really just a loon. </p>

<p>They also want to push the narrative that &quot;anyone&quot; can just snap one day and commit wanton slaughter for fun.</p>

<p>They also want to push the narrative that &quot;anyone&quot; can grab a high-powered rifle and become the Terminator, instantly skilled and strong enough to kill a bunch of people with ease.</p>

<p>But if they had used some homeless guy with a criminal history, for example, he would have had no way of obtaining all these weapons.</p>

<p>So for this particular event, they chose the rich white guy. We&#39;ll see what the next one is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The community will sometimes discredit itself by going off on serious tangents and trying to find things where there&#39;s nothing to be found. A rush to judgement of some higher tier conspiracy this early in an investigation is not only naive, it encourages others to view the community as crazy. I&#39;ve seen people on this sub categorically say there were multiple shooters when it&#39;s completely anecdotal and could be a multitude of reasons for why people might have thought that at the time amidst the confusion on police scanners.  Couple this with the reputation Reddit have for being detectives, it doesn&#39;t bode well.</p>
