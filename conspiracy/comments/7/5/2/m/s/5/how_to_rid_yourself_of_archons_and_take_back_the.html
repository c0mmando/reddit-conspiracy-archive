        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Archons are entities that feed on negative thoughts and emotions.  They are working in concert with the powers that be to operate a human energy mining/farm system that manipulates the human being to emanate negative thoughts and emotions.  These negative thoughts and emotions have electrical and magnetic properties respectively.  There are many theories as to how the system works specifically, but they are inconsequential to the solution.</p>

<p>The first step to clearing your human field of archons is to realize that you are not your thoughts and emotions.  Your brain is the interface where thoughts appear and your body is the conduit for where these thoughts become emotion.  Has anyone ever told you you are not good enough?  Have you ever had the thought, “there’s something wrong with me?”   Think back to when you were a child and your parents told you you did something wrong.  This thought entered your brain and because you were not aware enough to reject it, your body turned it into an emotion.  This emotion could manifest as embarrassment, resentment, confusion, unworthiness, etc.  This starts a chain reaction of negative feelings and thoughts that many of us carry throughout our life.  This is Archon food.  </p>

<p>The solution to starving the Archons is quite simple.  When someone presents you with a thought along the lines of “you’re not good enough” simply thank them and move on.  That’s the end of the interaction.  You don’t need to form a rebuttal.  Simply live in the awareness that you are good enough.  In fact, you are perfect, otherwise you would not exist.</p>

<p>Likewise, when a thought of unworthiness appears in your mind’s eye, simply notice it.  We experience all kinds of thoughts like “I’m depressed” or “I don’t have enough money” or “I hate my job”.  These thoughts are not who we are.  They are simply electrical charges created to solicit an emotional response in your body.  Don’t latch onto them.  Simply watch them come and go in your presence.  The more you practice the better you get.  Essentially you are being baited to feed the Archons by hooking onto the thoughts that are being presented to you.</p>

<p>You also have the ability to help others rid themselves of Archons.  This too is quite simple in theory but difficult in practice.  Simply refuse to see anyone as anything other than perfect.  Refuse to talk bad or negatively about anyone.  By gossiping about others we are willingly generating more food for the Archons to feed on.   You are also releasing negative thoughts that have the potential to affect you and the other person in ways that are not fully recognized.   Similar to when your parents told you you weren’t good enough, you are projecting thoughts of less than perfect onto another human.   Understand that your perception of a person being less than perfect is just a result of having a limited perspective.  We are all perfect.  It’s as simple as that.  </p>

<p>You have heard the phrase “Love your neighbor as yourself.”  Here is another way to put it.  “Love yourself and love your neighbor.”  Loving yourself is knowing that you are a unique expression of the Divine.  Loving your neighbor is knowing that that Divine expression permeates all things, even Archons and the powers that be.  When we refuse to see others as anything other than perfect, the Archons have nothing to eat and TPTB have no one to serve.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit kid ... put down the Salvia, and let go of some of that mysticism. Your conclusions are interesting, and I support your desire to be positive and bring more positive energy into the world, but using weird mystical terms like Archons aren&#39;t helping you to understand how to world works. Rather, they are distancing you from objective reality by enforcing some fairytale view of invisible forces that govern the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>NOOOO, muh loosh!</p>

<p>But really, even if you don&#39;t believe 100% David Icke&#39;s reptilian stuff, the loosh (energy) harvesting type stuff resonates pretty well with a lot of other worldviews. Particularly Buddhist karma/reincarnation kind of stuff.</p>

<p>This is anecdotal but ever since I started trying to observe my own thoughts (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">CBT</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy">ACT</a> where applicable) and started practicing daily meditation, I&#39;ve found life a whole lot less stressful. Less daily worrying about trivial shit, and future challenges appear like less of a mountain. In social scenarios I no longer bother (this implies choice - that&#39;s really what you get with meditation practice, choice of thought) to wonder what people are thinking when they look at me.</p>

<p>There&#39;s really no excuse to put off learning meditation. People claim they&#39;re too busy but it&#39;s the most portable skill you can practice. It might be easier with certain amenities, but it&#39;s not impossible even in the most distracting of environments.</p>

<p>Hell, there&#39;s even an <a href="https://app.stopbreathethink.org/">app for it</a> these days, so you can get that dopamine reward system working for you.</p>

<p>If you prefer a book on zen, even if it is a blatant oxymoron, I recommend Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha by Daniel Ingram <a href="http://integrateddaniel.info/book/">here</a>. He does enough of a good job in the intro that I don&#39;t feel the need to warn you that going down this road change your life for better or worse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t buy into the gnostic vision of the &quot;bad God.&quot; It&#39;s just another trick. All these &quot;secret&quot; teachings of &quot;Jesus&quot; are is bunk comprised from the works of Simon Magus. Father of both gnosticism, and the term simony. It&#39;s just another spin move by Babylon playing for the usurpation of Christs kingdom. </p>

<p>The gnostics worship the snake/shining one who tempted Adam and Eve in the garden. They believe that the wisdom gained from the serpentine/reptiliean figure brought us out of the darkness and into the &quot;light&quot; or illumination. What they neglect to tell you, is that this is most certainly devil worship. These ancient &quot;gods&quot; or &quot;archons&quot; while yes they had divine properties, weren&#39;t gods at all. Nor did they create us. These fallen Angels, more accurately the evil spirits left to torment us from their deceased offspring, the nephilim, are the same driving forces behind the secret societies working towards the centralization of everything, in preparation to hand it over to their &quot;god.&quot; Also known as abbaddon, Baal, Beelzebub, Lucifer. </p>

<p>Read the tales of the apkullu in the Sumerian tablets and the book of the watchers in 1 Enoch. Same story, higher God was enraged with his fallen insubordinate &quot;gods&quot; for their spreading of wickedness (the supposed knowledge) in the hearts of men. Not to actually benefit us of course, but to Lord it over us, their slaves. Sounds familiar? Kind of like the elites plan for ruling this planet a little bit? These Angels were locked up in both stories, but the spirits of their children, being partly human, are kept in the earthly plane. </p>

<p>There most certainly are &quot;evil spirits&quot; that feed on negativity, I&#39;ll agree with that. And while some of your statements are useful, or at least as useful as almost any meditation technique, the practice of rendering yourself emotionless is not beneficial to you at all</p>
