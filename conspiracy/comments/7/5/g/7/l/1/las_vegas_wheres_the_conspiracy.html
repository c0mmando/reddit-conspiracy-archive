        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is what likely happened:</p>

<ol>
<li>Paddock was setting up his room for the shooting (placing cameras, drilling holes for his guns or wires for his cameras) when he triggers a door alarm (or this could have just been a coincidence)</li>
<li>Security guard Campos is dispatched to check out the alarm</li>
<li>While checking the alarm in a nearby room he hears drilling or other unusual noises coming from Paddocks&#39; room</li>
<li>He tries to investigate to see what it is</li>
<li>Paddock becomes startled and unloads a nearby gun at the door</li>
<li>Campos is shot but not fatally</li>
<li>If Campos still had his radio with him (maybe it fell in front of Paddock&#39;s door and he didn&#39;t want to retrieve it) he radios in for help; he hangs out in the hallway telling nearby people to stay away, evacuate, and call for help</li>
<li>Paddock, now being interrupted decides he has to act before the police show up; he shoots for 10 minutes with the guns he had prepared (or were easily accessible to him)</li>
<li>Paddock keeps shooting until his guns jam, or he runs out of ammo or starts mixing up his ammo and guns and decides it&#39;s taking him too long to reload, or he hears people approaching in the halls</li>
<li>Paddock decides to kill himself fearing if he waits longer he could be stunned with a flash bang grenade and captured alive</li>
<li>Campos and the police who have arrived decide not to break down the door because the shooting has stopped so instead they evacuate the floor before they break down the door and start a shootout</li>
<li>They wait for the SWAT (or other police?) with explosives</li>
<li>They break down the door and discover that Paddock is already dead</li>
</ol>

<p>I don&#39;t see where the conspiracy is? The reports of multiple shooters, shots from different directions, changing narratives is all stuff that gets reported after every shootings. There&#39;s always chaos after events like these and lots of witnesses who are sure of what they saw are wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>theres a few things that really dont add up. why 23 guns? that alone suggests theres more to the story. the timeline of security guard and police response, it turns out the initial story wasnt correct, so suspicion there has been justified. reports of incidents at other casinos no where near mandalay bay that cant be immediately dismissed as public hysteria caused by what was happening at the concert. the first gun used is very likely not one of the guns he is reported as having. it doesnt match the fire rate of a rifle with bumpfire, it matches a SAW and sounds exactly the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of guns so he could do the maximum damage in the least amount of time. If all those guns were fully loaded and ready he would&#39;ve killed many more people but because Campos startled him he started his attack before he had all his guns ready which is why he took 30 seconds between volleys to reload.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i dont buy it. 6 guns? 10 guns? maybe, but 23 is just ridiculous imo. if youve got all those guns laid out ready then you have to move to get one and re position yourself. it would be quicker to just reload.</p>

<p>i do think you have a relevant point about campos disturbing his preparations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not knee-deep into these theories, but what I find weird, is that a lot of video footage is being deleted right in front of me. Videos of people being carried into the hospitals, which reportedly showed no injuries, weird handling and it looked generally very suspicious, got deleted within an hour. Also a video which reportedly showed a gunman INSIDE the crowd, of which now only a screenshot remains. It&#39;s just very weird that videos are getting selectively removed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure we don&#39;t know everything. If that&#39;s indicative of a conspiracy, I don&#39;t know, but I really, really think it&#39;s time that the government (?) is open to the public. We have a right to know everything and to have our questions answered honestly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy theorists would delete it because it&#39;s not showing what they claimed it shows. At a glance the claim is believable, but if you pay close attention it is obvious it doesn&#39;t show the security guard shooting at people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would place the intended shooting to happen at a later point in time.  </p>

<p>Jason Aldean was already the last artist on stage. I highly doubt the rest of the plan involved something elaborate like going back down to the parking and get more ammo/Tannerite<sup>tm</sup>.  </p>

<p>Unless he was aiming for something coming after the event? Was anything big planned for Oct 2nd/3rd?  </p>

<p>BTW, door alarm surprises a lot of people. We have a new security system at one of our entrance doors (office building) that starts ringing after XY seconds of open door. Still most people don&#39;t know about it.<br/>
I don&#39;t see the point in having it installed in a hotel, but what do I know about hotel security... *shrugs* Maybe set it to 15min in case the guest leaves and forgets to close it?</p>
