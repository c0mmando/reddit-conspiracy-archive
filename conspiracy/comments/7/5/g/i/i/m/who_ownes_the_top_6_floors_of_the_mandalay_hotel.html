<p>There is no evidence of the shooter(s) carrying up so many guns because....</p>

<p><strong>The guns weren&#39;t carried up 32 floors. They were carried down 6 floors.</strong></p>

<p>Hence the lack of video evedence. Hence the panicked coverup.</p>

<li>No, no they don&#39;t. Pentagon. Maine airport. Columbine. et al. It takes years, and most are never released. It&#39;s evidence, and evidence is not released to the public in the immediate aftermath unless there is a compelling reason, e.g. if there&#39;s a suspect on the loose. </li>
<li>Actually, yes, two of them. Well, wait--I&#39;ve not actually seen them myself. I saw people here arguing about whether it&#39;s fishy that the only photos we have of Campos are two provided by a local reporter. I think they&#39;re out there. But it doesn&#39;t matter, because this has fuck-all to do with whether there are videos of Paddock entering the hotel. </li>
<li>You not seeing something does not mean it doesn&#39;t exist.  You are not a detective working the case. The FBI and LVPD do not answer to you.</li>

<p>Dude, you are making an absolutely ridiculous argument. No one involved with the investigation has ever said that there aren&#39;t any videos. Ever. Not even once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those were leaked and was pretty easy to do since tons of law enforcement had access to that wide open room, so snapping a few discreet pics wouldn&#39;t be difficult. </p>

<p>Taking pics in a small security shack which presumably only a few high-ranking detectives had access to? Much harder. </p>

<p>And as I have already explained countless times, law enforcement does not cater to providing &quot;proof&quot; to conspiracy theorists. Their job is to investigate crimes and prosecute offenders. They don&#39;t typcally release video evidence unless there&#39;s an imminent search for a suspect ID (not needed since hes dead), through a freedom of information request (only if the case is closed) and through evidence in court (obviously doesn&#39;t apply because dude is dead). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI held a press conference with their pictures claiming they were suspect 1 and suspect 2 and pretending they didn&#39;t even know their names.</p>

<p>First, your telling me the FBI needs help finding the name of 2 American citizens when they have a picture of them?</p>

<p>Secondly, it came out 2 days later that they actually were in contact with the brothers for 2+ years prior to the event and had surveillance on them at one point. FBI ended up admitting to this.</p>

<p>So the FBI flat out deceived the public during that press conference and it was all theatre. They pretended they didn&#39;t know them or even their names. The question is why? The answer to that question unfortunately can not be answered with a viable benevolent reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was talking out loud, not addressing you directly.</p>

<p>They released those pictures for some reason other than needing the publics help. If it was for legitimately needing the publics help then there was no reason to pretend they didn&#39;t know the names or who they were. They knew them personally so there was no real need to have the public involved either. That entire press conference was a sham.</p>

<p>So they will release images/video evidence to help whatever hidden agenda they got and they will hide them for the same reason. There is no legitimate reason to withhold video evidence of paddock even being in the hotel, especially since the public, not just conspiracy theorists, are asking for it.</p>

<p>That is the point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if they do release footage it will be said to be fact. I don&#39;t know what ur expecting to see. If you release any footage before a trial it compromises it for the jury pool. Should they ever find he had help they need that hence one reason it isn&#39;t released. It has only been a week. Your not going to see him carry a gun in the open. Your not gonna see much is my guess. Maybe if there were cameras in the hallways you could have but there aren&#39;t. If they had released tapes the night of or the next day everyone would have said they were faked and were made before hand for the narrative. No matter when they release them or don&#39;t...it isn&#39;t going to quiet the people who are stuck on making things fit their ideas. I&#39;m done here with you. Have a good night.</p>

<p>I hadn&#39;t considered the security guard being an FBI agent rather than an undercover cop or authentic security. If this is the case, perhaps this explains why &quot;security&quot; never radios what had happened to him nor his whereabouts for a length of time after he&#39;s shot: he was never security to begin with and quite possibly was forced to shoot himself in the leg before police officers arrive and had to make considerations so as to not implicate the FBI&#39;s involvement. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a ballistics report noting that the same bullet that had wounded this security guard is that of Patrick&#39;s ammunition.  </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t read anywhere yet that the security guard <em>radios</em> officers as to his whereabouts, but that he <em>tells</em> officers, at which point, officers are on the 31st floor. </p>

<p>I see two possibilities with this theory.

<p>Paddock is approached by girlfriend to sell some of his guns (she didn&#39;t notice 30+ firearms when they lived together?) to radical elements in Phillipines. This could make some sense if you look at the possible connections to CA state senator Yee, who was busted for running guns to the Phillipines. </p>

<p>In a parking lot at the airport, people are taking luggage out of vehicle A to put in B all the time, and while security is lax enough to allow something like a gun deal to happen, it still exists enough where no one would try funny business. There are a few people around, but not enough to snoop compared to the amount of cars left there for a week.</p>

<p>Hotels are incredibly crowded, so they don&#39;t add more security, add more eyes that could catch the deal going on, and you have to lug all that equipment from your car to a room and back. Plus escape is slower should something go wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been my individual theory. I know there&#39;s tons of them. But I&#39;m basing this off a number of things. Keeping in mind my individual background. Combat in Iraq during the surge in baghdad. Army Cid (including training at fletc on terrorism investigations)</p>

<li><p>I don&#39;t think these guns were what was used. I think it was a belt fed weapon. It sound&#39;s like bursts that are over 60 rounds, the size of the magazines visible. </p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;ve covered up and smeared Saudi royal family involvement in 911.</p></li>
<li><p>We try to hide Saudi involvement in funding radical Islam</p></li>
<li><p>If the Saudis were found to be the perpetrators america simply wouldn&#39;t stomach it and would demand retribution in the tune of blood. Royal blood at the hands of our combat arms.</p></li>
<li><p>The cover up is poorly planned and extremely evident. It&#39;s obvious something happened that isn&#39;t being released in a truthful manner.</p></li>
<li><p>What was the motive? Literally every other investigation with this muchas oress, all around the world, has the motive released within about 24 hours.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Personally I think the cia was selling guns to Saudi prince funded terrorists. Said terrorists went off script. Everyone is scrambling now</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I seriously think paddock was dead before all the shooting happened. A person analyzed the photo of his body. Rigor mortis has already taken place which takes 4+ hours. And it can last &quot;from eight to twelve hours after which time the body is completely stiff&quot;. There is such a lack of blood at the crime scene as well. Suicide by either shooting at the head or torso would leave liters of blood. So many stuff dont add up in the crime scene photos which points to a cover up. If people find out the saudis did this it will def hit hard on them. Also idk if everyone knows already but the saudi airforce in august booked the whole entire hotel and idk how long they stayed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Investigators arent going to wait 4+ hours to analyze a crime scene. They get as much evidence as they can from it as soon as possible. The coroner&#39;s office of the las vegas pd is only 13 mins away from mandalay. So the claim it took hours for them to finally start taking pics makes no sense. They would be called immediately to a scene like this. They do it as soon as possible so nothing is contaminated etc. Waiting for a body to show signs of rigor mortis then take pics is totally not the style of police in an event like this. I bet they have already analyzed the body and determined the time of death but nothin like that will be disclosed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coroner offices work in teams . A team will be dedicated to certain task at the scene in regards to analyzing the body. One person will take photos another may take temp etc. Paddock would have to be dead for 2hrs + before they finally got a coroner to the scene and started analyzing the body. Honestly who knows when rigor mortis took place. Because as i mentioned before these physical signs can stay for 12+ hours . All we know is that the body is in the stage of rigor mortis we dont have a time table so our guesses may be off but we know the body was there for quite some time. 4+ hrs the least. Here is the time table based off the news. Shooting lasted 9 mins then it stopped then swat for who knows what took almsot an hour to go to the room the body was in. When they got there they say the body was there already. So 9mins + 53mins? Just say an hour the suppose body is dead. Coroner will be called immediately. Say that it took 35 mins to arrive since coroner is 13 mins away thus making him arrive under an hour. Lets say it took him 10 mins to set up still under an hour. For rigor mortis to have kicked in on the body paddock would have to be dead before the shooting took place. We are just keeping in mind the early stages of death</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t know if those pics were done by the medical examiner. Also, they said they didn&#39;t go in immediately after shooting stopped. They didn&#39;t breach that room until 72 mins after shooting stopped. They had to secure the scene, call for the medical examiner, await his arrival. Depending on the distance who knows..but there was also a lot of traffic on the strip and he would have to make his was to the 32nd floor. Could have been well over 2 hrs. And like I said..we don&#39;t know what time that pic was taken or by who. We don&#39;t know how long they left his body there before they removed him. I would imagine a while because they would have tl collect the evidence around him before moving him and disturbing evidence. You can only make assumptions based on the photo. There are arguments for both ways. I don&#39;t see a wound in chest I only see blood. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The wound isnt in the chest area but the lower torso. Like a gut shot. You can see a hole right there. But when i was examining his head it seems like a bullet entered above the eye on the left and exited at the lower part of the back of his head where the main pool of blood is coming from. In one of the las vegas shooting videos there are two hand gun shots after all the shooting. Shots arent from police. Based off physical evidence i concluded there was a gut shot then a headshot. I honeslty dont know what to say about all this any more. As i said everything doesnt add up from the crime scene, one of the main gripes in the crime scene is that gun perfectly laid across his leg(someone definitely placed that there) the security guard, to swat delaying to take action etc. The media coverage is awful and the narrative they going with everyone knows its total bs what they are saying. 72 mins to breach they were saying 52 53. Well dang changed again? We dont know a lot of things but the things we do know and have been made to the public we know is totally off. </p>

<p>Hell there was a video on youtube where in the 1970s? An official committed suicide with a revolver live on television. Similar to the revolver in paddocks crime scene. Blood was squirting out his nose etc. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Man. I saw that video <em>once</em> 15 or 16 years ago  and I can still watch it perfectly in my mind. It&#39;s so horrible. I think his name was Bud(d?) Dwyer? I&#39;m kinda scared to Google it but I think that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>Sometimes I don&#39;t think about it or it doesn&#39;t randomly pop up in my head for a good year or so, but inevitably I run across someone mentioning it and it just plays in my mind again.</p>

<p>Like you mentioned though, the part that really bothers me and the reason I think I can remember it so perfectly even though I really, really wish I didn&#39;t, was the &quot;waterfall&quot; of blood from the nose.</p>

<p>So. Much. Blood. Eesh.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was a brutal video. It took me by surprise i exited out as soon as i saw omg the shit the very first time i came across it. Talk about getting on the weird side of youtube. But for some reason i had to watch the whole thing. Also the camera man just like didnt pan away or just run like fuck. People that were by him just stood there. On top of that the camera man just kept zooming in on his face. FUDGE ME. After that it just put in my head that committing suicide is never worth it and that our lives are fragile. But lets try to forget them details of that. But this is why i said the amount of blood in paddock&#39;s &quot;suicide&quot; doesnt add up. Sorry for mentioning that but try to scratch it out. I would seriously advise no one go searching for that video it is truly brutal. If you dont got the stomach or mind to look at stuff like that please dont. Just dont. </p>

There is a plethora of pics that will show you what it looks like. Im by no means an expert in this field. A coroner will be able to tell you in more detail about it and based of the pics.

We all know paddock didnt commit suicide based of the evidence in the photos. If he did in fact commit suicide that gun wouldnt be perfectly laid across his body.

His body is laying flat...gravity has the blood pool...not gush from a wound after circulation stopped. Looks to me like he was standing or sitting when he did it. His head fell forward and blood got on his shirt then his body fell back. Possible the gun was laying there and his foot went under it. But I don&#39;t know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not true:</p>

<p>When Discount Firearms, a large weapons store in Las Vegas, learned about the deadly shooting, it contacted authorities and told them that Paddock had bought a Daniel Defense rifle from them. That gun was found in the hotel room with a bump stock added to it, the source said.</p>

<p>In Paddock’s hometown of Mesquite, general manager Christopher Sullivan of Guns &amp; Guitars said in a statement to The Associated Press that Paddock showed no signs of being unfit to buy guns when he purchased several from the store.</p>

<p>At New Frontier Armory in Las Vegas, owner David Famiglietti told Newsweek that Paddock bought a shotgun and rifle there last spring for $3,500. He said his employee and Paddock talked about how the customer wanted to use them for a tactical gun competition.</p>

<p>All purchased in Clark County, and that&#39;s after a two minute google search </p>

<p>It&#39;s not rocket science. Guns go in luggage, luggage goes in the room. Hotels don&#39;t examine the contents of your bags or make you walk through metal detectors, and they don&#39;t give a damn how many suitcases you bring with you. They have luggage dollies for specifically that reason.</p>

<p>Besides, has anyone actually <em>asked</em> this question at any of the press conferences? If not, then the police have no reason to explain it, because it&#39;s not exactly a mystery to anyone apart from the astoundingly ignorant.</p>

<p>Want to know why?</p>

<p>Why, the fuck, would you lower them down above? Fuck, EVEN IF THOSE PEOPLE WERE THE ONES WHO GAVE THEM TO HIM IT WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE TO LOWER THEM DOWN.</p>

<p><strong>It is 10000% easier to just put them in large cases and bring them in like fuck tons of other people have done in the past for trade shows</strong></p>

<p>I am not trying to debate the connection between whoever owns the floors above or whether they were involved or the connections are weird etc... that is a different issue. </p>

<p>I am simply saying it is pointless to claim that that makes any sense at this point at all, when the guns clearly were brought in the front door, because up until this point..no one had ever brought a shit ton of guns into a Vegas hotel to mow people down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched a few of the raw footage videos last night, dramatic stuff. The one with the taxi driver lady riding around around was fascinating analysing the different psychologies of people on the outskirts of these shootings with people just standing around while bullets fly 32 stories overhead. Then in Act 2 when a few confused survivors get into the cab and the mood totally changes to super intense.</p>

<p>I could totally imagine a cabal of Illuminists standing behind a glazed-over MKULTRA&#39;d Paddock  then taking turns spraying into the country music going crowd before making a hasty exit back to the upper floors to drink and perhaps do a ritual or two. The whole thing felt sickeningly symbolic in the area the shooting happened, some video footage even shows flashes and shot-like sounds coming from the capstone of the Luxor illuminated pyramid, maybe there was a Rothschild up there having some fun too. </p>

When a door is left unlocked it sets off an alarm in dispatch. Dispatch then sends and officer to pull the door shut.

Stairwells in hotels that high are for emergencies... You open them an alarm is triggered. I have stayed at Mandalay but didn&#39;t pay attention. If u were concerned with ur ID maybe u shouldn&#39;t have spoken. Esp if your telling shit ur not supposed to lol. If u think this sub isn&#39;t monitored how about u look up how many times reddit sub&#39;s have made the news. Room doors may have a system but for fire codes they have to have an emergency exit...one that alerts when open or tampered with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah i’m going to go with Ocam’s Razor on this one. You pull up the bellboy runs out. The bellboy rolls out the cart. Say he has 10 suitcases with him. each about 75 pounds. puts 5 on the cart. Alright boy wheel it up there if you want a good tip and make it snappy. i have more bags hurry up boy.” it’s not unusual to travel to vegas with many heavy suitcases. then he flips the kid a couple hundred bucks. Kid doesn’t care what’s in the bags all he’s thinking about is getting a good tip. Maybe he goes back to the cara couple times later and brings his ammunition in on stroller bags two at a time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I don&#39;t understand why everyone is focused on the bags.  I stay at hotels constantly.  I could sneak 10 bags into any of them, whether it&#39;s vegas or NYC.  There is so much going on most of the employees are too busy helping other guests to even pay attention to you.  Even if they do notice you, chances are they will not remember your face, so when you come back down an hour later and bring up two more bags they aren&#39;t going to notice.  Out of everything in this case I do not understand the focus on the bags.  It&#39;s literally the easiest thing to do.  They aren&#39;t actively looking for &quot;guy with too many bags&quot;.  Maybe they are after the fact, but until this happened it was business as usual at the hotel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saudis own 47.5% and Bill Gates owns 47.5%. From what I gather the idea behind having the FS there is a luxury hotel on the strip that is separate from the crowds and hustle of casinos. They don&#39;t have gaming on any of those floors. It is quiet. However, they do get to use all of MB amenities and they do have some of the best ones on the strip. So, basically a small hotel on the strip. Which you can&#39;t really build one of those lol so what better way than to have it inside of a large resort. Seems like a genius idea to me. The own shares of the FS brand...so all FS are linked to Bill Gates and Saudis. It isn&#39;t really that odd to me that Saudis own that. Four Seasons are all over the world.</p>

In effect, he broke through the ¨game¨ by breaking the windows of the hotel suite and shooting from within the screen (broken window) out onto the yet innocently unaware other ¨players¨ standing by the thousands below (and thus representing the abysmal ignorance of the wider human masses), whose exposed ignorant relations to the concealed structures of murderous capitalist power are reproduced/simulated in particularized incarnate, yet ironically allegorical, form through the terroristic acts of the aforesaid Stephen Paddock, mathematical prodigy and pattern-recognizer extraordinaire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seeing some of the posts on this subreddit makes me sick. Either people are in here just trolling and making a game out of the death of 58 people, or a bunch of people suffering from varying degrees of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_personality_disorder">paranoid personality disorder</a> have found an echo chamber where they can all unleash their worst sides.</p>

<p>There is a high degree of cognitive dissonance behind this. In the case of a terror attack, we usually understand and process it fairly easily, because we can say <em>&quot;oh, they are not like us! They are brainwashed, they have an agenda, they are extremist&quot;</em> ect. But when a typical white American 60-year old with no political or religious affiliation, living the good life and making millions a year, goes and does this it breaks with all of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology">schemas</a>). If this guy just did it randomly, how the hell can we ever be safe from anyone? It makes it extremely hard to process, and I guess that is why we all are flocking to the internet in an attempt to &quot;solve&quot; this, because we all really want to understand the <em>why</em> and want to have something (like a mental illness) to blame.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t see one theory on this forum that isn&#39;t either easily debunked because of it&#39;s illogical or implausible circumstantial evidence, or just tries to fill the void of not-yet-released information from the <strong>ongoing</strong> investigation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Helicopters don&#39;t use airports necessarily.  They can go from Heliport to another FAA certified landing area.  Many high-end hotels have them for guests to use, ESPECIALLY that close to airports.  That&#39;s why they have them.  Someone should check about flights leaving around that time.  Or the helicopter was doing the shooting.    </p>

<p>And the Saudis don&#39;t want the guns.  The guns were part of a Deep State sting operation, selling to ISIS, that went wrong.  The Saudis are supporting ISIS in Syria, that has already been acknowledged.</p>

<p>What was the motivation? If there was an agenda it sure seems like a lot of death for no outcome. A good question is what would the government get out of it. What would any government get out of it? For that matter what would the illuminati get out of it?</p>

<p>I say nothing will come of this. No laws, no gun control, no taxes. The only thing that will come is blowhard politicking by the left/progressives.</p>

<p>If Sandy Hook taught America one thing it is this. Nothing will take guns out of the hands of Americans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No idea.  I do not know the layout of those hotels.  I have never stayed there.  I am assuming there is a private elevator that the Saudi Royal Family uses so that they are not exposed to the masses.  Steve Wynn mentioned a service elevator, and I am not sure where it is located or if it goes to the Four Seasons.  </p>

<p>Either way, it is all on videotape how he allegedly got the equipment up there.  They have released nothing by now.  They have not even released a video of him checking into the hotel.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing about this that isn&#39;t weird is him taking the luggage up. Its easy...or was before this. I have seen it with my own eyes before. People do bring a lot of luggage sometimes. It isn&#39;t odd. Let&#39;s say he was worried about being seen with tho...there are so many different points of entry there that he could take two or three in one and so forth. This isn&#39;t big enough for Saudi involvement. They did just release that his autopsy shows no brain tumor. And..it seems like the police are throwing shade at Mandalay</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Using the service elevators isn&#39;t that unheard of really. I have used them when I had a lot of stuff for a presentation I was doing at the airport the next day. Wynn is throwing shade at his competition. I personally don&#39;t find the aspect of the Four Seasons relevant at all. Normal people rent those rooms. Saudis aren&#39;t stupid. They aren&#39;t going to have a mass shooting that they are a part of happen at a hotel they hold shares of. That would be incredibly stupid and for what reason? There are more plot holes in the Saudi aspect than there are the narrative. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here.  You can see it right at the beginning.  I just find it hard to believe that someone who is allegedly mentally ill and on a self-destructive streak would pass up that target, not to mention all the other targets you see as the cameraman pans.  Also, it is very strange that the shooter(s) did not fire at the Luxor.  My point is that the target was very, very specific.  </p>

Maybe ask him to leave but being that he was a regular with zero criminal history they wouldn&#39;t have given a shit.

<p>You comment about not knowing how vegas hotels work but claim he went through all the work of getting Saudis to transport guns up to a hotel for him COMPLETELY ignoring the fact there is bellboys and luggage carts to take them up there yourself..  Honestly... think about it Mr know it all about Vegas</p>

<p>Because it&#39;s a god damn hotel and CASINO. Have you ever been in the surveillance room of one of these places? I have. You get buzzed into an near empty waiting area, sign in, get buzzed into another room with 1 screen just to view just what&#39;s relevant to you.</p>

<p>Casino / Hotel footage, ESPECIALLY at MGM properties, isn&#39;t the type of shit that just gets leaked.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t even mentioning how nothing you said is even evidence for anything. It&#39;s just a bunch of &quot;connections&quot; and some grand bullshit statement. This most laughable thing I&#39;ve seen on this sub in a long time, and that&#39;s saying  A LOT.</p>

<p>Why would he send the guns to the Four Seasons if he can&#39;t access that hotel via Mandalay Elevators? That would look way more fishy than bringing them up himself. You can open carry in Vegas...even assault rifles. But likely they were in bags and done. Luggage cart and relax.</p>

<p>First, your telling me the FBI needs help finding the name of 2 American citizens when they have a picture of them?</p>

<p>Secondly, it came out 2 days later that they actually were in contact with the brothers for 2+ years prior to the event and had surveillance on them at one point. FBI ended up admitting to this.</p>

<p>So the FBI flat out deceived the public during that press conference and it was all theatre. They pretended they didn&#39;t know them or even their names. The question is why? The answer to that question unfortunately can not be answered with a viable benevolent reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if they do release footage it will be said to be fact. I don&#39;t know what ur expecting to see. If you release any footage before a trial it compromises it for the jury pool. Should they ever find he had help they need that hence one reason it isn&#39;t released. It has only been a week. Your not going to see him carry a gun in the open. Your not gonna see much is my guess. Maybe if there were cameras in the hallways you could have but there aren&#39;t. If they had released tapes the night of or the next day everyone would have said they were faked and were made before hand for the narrative. No matter when they release them or don&#39;t...it isn&#39;t going to quiet the people who are stuck on making things fit their ideas. I&#39;m done here with you. Have a good night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t say he didn&#39;t commit suicide neither can you because you weren&#39;t there. What I can do is look at things and see if their a reasonable fit before I start coming up with crazy ideas that don&#39;t fit either. I&#39;m not sure why you think he would he bleed more. His body is laying flat...gravity has the blood pool...not gush from a wound after circulation stopped. Looks to me like he was standing or sitting when he did it. His head fell forward and blood got on his shirt then his body fell back. Possible the gun was laying there and his foot went under it. But I don&#39;t know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing about this that isn&#39;t weird is him taking the luggage up. Its easy...or was before this. I have seen it with my own eyes before. People do bring a lot of luggage sometimes. It isn&#39;t odd. Let&#39;s say he was worried about being seen with tho...there are so many different points of entry there that he could take two or three in one and so forth. This isn&#39;t big enough for Saudi involvement. They did just release that his autopsy shows no brain tumor. And..it seems like the police are throwing shade at Mandalay</p>
