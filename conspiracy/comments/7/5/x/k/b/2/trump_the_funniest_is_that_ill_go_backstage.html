The other is a POS billionaire (still question that mile stone) known for shady deals, fucking people over, and being a reality tv host.  We got what TPTB offered and it was shit imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not that astonishing. The Clinton campaign used their influence with the MSM to present Trump as the only GOP candidate with a serious chance of winning. The DNC wanted Trump as their opposition, as they thought it would make for an easy win for Clinton. Then, once the campaign were fully underway, they release the pussy grab tape etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the fact that media focused, by far, the plurality of its attention on a story harmful to the DNC proves the DNC doesn&#39;t control the media.

<p>I&#39;m talking about the factual reality of how the media behaved
than playing six degrees of Kevin Bacon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There have been many studies about how the media performed, and I think most candidates have legitimate grievances about how they were treated.</p>

<p>Editorially, the media were kind to Clinton.  They covered the investigation because they had to.  She shouldn&#39;t have emailed outside the system, and she hurt her campaign by making that dumb decision.  </p>

<p>Trump&#39;s family should also be held accountable.  Fairs fair.</p>

<p>why the fuck would anyone try to make the Harvey Weinstein story about Hillary Clinton</p>

<p>Because that&#39;s how it goes in politics. She made some bad friends with big dollars.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Sure, the editorial pages generally endorsed her.  But the news pages gave her the most &quot;scandal&quot; framed coverage of any candidate.  That&#39;s what the stats show.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They covered the investigation because they had to. She shouldn&#39;t have emailed outside the system, and she hurt her campaign by making that dumb decision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t just &quot;cover&quot; the investigation, they made it the <em>single most covered story of the campaign</em>.  Her private server got more coverage than <strong>every policy issue combined</strong>.  Think about that.  Yes, it was a story that had to be covered, but do you honestly think Clinton&#39;s email server was a more important issue than the American healthcare system?  Climate change?  Environmental protection?  The tax system?  Unemployment policies?  Medicare and Social Security? Abortion? Crime?  American foreign policy?  Do you think it was a more important issue than <em>all of those things put together</em>?  If so, how do you explain the fact the media has put only fleeting interest into the use of private servers by members of the Trump administration, or his handling of classified information -- literally the same exact issue.    </p>

<p>Once again, it was the <strong>MOST COVERED STORY OF 2016</strong>.  </p>

<p>Compare what people remember the media saying about <a href="http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/58248cb5691e88d0118b5d60-960/trump%20word%20cloud%20getty.png">Trump</a> and <a href="http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/58248cb5691e8849528b5849-960/clinton%20word%20cloud%20getty.png">Clinton</a>. Can you really sit hear today, reflecting back, and believe that was not only a sound choice of news priority, but one chosen <em>because the DNC controls the media</em>?  Does that make any sense?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not comparable. Harvey Weinstein was accused by girls over 18(though barely that). It seems he always made sure they were legal age. Meanwhile Trump was accused by women that were under 18 at the time of the incident. I hate how people try to compare Pedo sex assault, and normal sex assault. The vileness factor goes up tenfold for me when done on kids not of age.</p>
