       Rand is even flawed imo, there just wasn't, as usual, any good canidates.  Then the general election was a joke, both canidates were in their 70's, one who didn't campaign, was tripping &amp; collapsing all over the place and a war monger.  The other is a POS billionaire (still question that mile stone) known for shady deals, fucking people over, and being a reality tv host.  We got what TPTB offered and it was shit imo.

       He hasn't, that's the entire thing. He has had a shitton of money, which makes women far out of his league attracted to him. Nothing out of the ordinary rich guy shit.

       Its not that astonishing. The Clinton campaign used their influence with the MSM to present Trump as the only GOP candidate with a serious chance of winning. The DNC wanted Trump as their opposition, as they thought it would make for an easy win for Clinton. Then, once the campaign were fully underway, they release the pussy grab tape etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want someone to blame for Trump being President, look in Podesta's direction.

       It was broken BY WIKILEAKS. NO ONE ELSE. Jesus christ. Then /pol/, t_d and a few other communities started breaking down the emails. Those communities broke the stories from the individual emails.

       You're conflating different stories, which a lot of people do because they all involved emails.

       The emails that Russia hacked from the DNC, DCCC and John Podesta were first released on Wikileaks.

       Those weren't the Clinton email story. The Clinton email story was her private server and the possibility that classified emails were transmitted through insecure channels.  That story was broken by

       I know that pissed her off.  Can you imagine if they hadn't covered it?  She was under a federal investigation.  Having a nominee under investigation is a story.  Any news organization would have to cover that.

       How about holding her accountable for her dumbass move with respect to her emails?  If only she hadn't wanted to avoid FOIA requests, and had corresponded using the state department's infrastructure, she probably would be president right now.

       Not really.  You seemed to be arguing that because she wasn't able to persuade the media to black out news items related to her email investigation,  that this therefore means that she  had no influence over the media.

       Yes, the fact that media focused, by far, the plurality of its attention on a story harmful to the DNC proves the DNC doesn't control the media.  That's far more persuasive evidence than playing six degrees of Kevin Bacon and just assuming without any evidence that equals influence on editorial control.

       Sure, the editorial pages generally endorsed her.  But the news pages gave her the most "scandal" framed coverage of any candidate.  That's what the stats show.

       They didn't just "cover" the investigation, they made it the
       <em>
        single most covered story of the campaign

        every policy issue combined

       .  Think about that.  Yes, it was a story that had to be covered, but do you honestly think Clinton's email server was a more important issue than the American healthcare system?  Climate change?  Environmental protection?  The tax system?  Unemployment policies?  Medicare and Social Security? Abortion? Crime?  American foreign policy?  Do you think it was a more important issue than
       <em>
        all of those things put together
       </em>
       ?  If so, how do you explain the fact the media has put only fleeting interest into the use of private servers by members of the Trump administration, or his handling of classified information -- literally the same exact issue.
      </p>

       Once again, it was the

        MOST COVERED STORY OF 2016

       It's not comparable. Harvey Weinstein was accused by girls over 18(though barely that). It seems he always made sure they were legal age. Meanwhile Trump was accused by women that were under 18 at the time of the incident. I hate how people try to compare Pedo sex assault, and normal sex assault. The vileness factor goes up tenfold for me when done on kids not of age.

       Ah yeah if the accusations aren't from known public figures credibility goes way down. Some of those girls were measly unknown miss teen pagent contestants that no one would know thier name otherwise.

       Funny how he's on camera talking about the same creepy stuff the other accused do, on microphone talking about his sexual harassment, multiple accusations over ten years of his misdeeds in Hollywood. Yet his accusers are false and you seem very adamant in your position.

       Ehhh I was in T_D during the O'Reilly shit and every comment thread had many top comments saying how it's good O'Reilly was leaving (documentary called Outfoxed helped with that).

       It helped that Carlson was going to now get more recognition. Same with the comment threads around 9/11. His base is pretty woke to say the least, after all they know about the Clinton Corruption, which is at the centre of many conspiracies.
