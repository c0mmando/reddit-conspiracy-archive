<p>It all started in Egypt (maybe even before) when the Catluminati discovered the ancient secrets of reality (catality) after the cat, Mr. Flufferpants communed in a deep state of meditation with the being known as Supreme Fuzzbottomus Prime and used these ancient secrets to rise to power and create a system of cat-trol. Now our kids are being in-cat-trinated with all forms of these propagandists tricks to raise the perfectly confused (catfused) servant race. It&#39;s all there, man! Stay woke.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fake news is definitely abundant.  The best way to discredit a conspiracy theory is to spread false rumors making the conspiracy seem worse than it actually is, or skew several facts, then plant a kernel of truth in the mainstream media which discredits everyone that believes a conspiracy is in play. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t agree more with your point that knowing 30% of the truth is better than 90% lies.  If the absolute truth is a puzzle there is no way in hell to put it together with none of the correct pieces. </p>

<p>One final point I would have to add is that there are bad people on r/conspiracy.  There are bad people on r/cats.  I think if you maintain a healthy skepticism about everything you read you can learn a lot from this sub. There are also a lot of very good people on r/conspiracy and they are why I continue to read the subreddit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hardest man to teach, is one who thinks he already knows.</p>

<p>I disagree.  I think that people who never see this subreddit(Now that it is so bad... wasn&#39;t always like this), are worse off than those who never look at all.</p>

<p>It took me years to realize.  Of all the people in this population, CONSPIRACY THEORISTS are BY FAR the most heavily targeted with propaganda.</p>

<p>For instance, if somebody sees the &quot;God Ray&quot; 9/11 theory, and actually believes it... it&#39;ll be harder to teach them the truth, than a person who knows nothing at all about 9/11.</p>

<p>I realized a few years ago, that it&#39;s impossible to control the information you see on the internet.  We all have PERSONALLY TAILORED internet experiences.  They know what links you click.  What words/sounds draw your eye.  They arrange the links in certain ways, to make you more likely to click some than others.</p>

<p>If you think you&#39;re &quot;choosing your own path&quot;, and &quot;choosing your own information&quot;, while using Reddit, Facebook, Google, Youtube, etc... you&#39;re SORELY mistaken.  And if you don&#39;t realize that your information that you consume is being hand picked for you... that is more dangerous than if you knew nothing at all.</p>

<p>Conspiracy Theorists are the easiest to target with propaganda.  Most people aren&#39;t even willing to read about serious topics anymore... but we are.  And most people aren&#39;t willing to believe the unbelievable... but that&#39;s what we do.</p>

<p>They use the fact that we&#39;re very suggestible, and SO DESPERATELY want to find information, that we practically lap it up, without noticing it&#39;s propaganda.</p>

<p>But T_D upvote brigades constantly. You can tell because the same posts on the top of T_D are on top here, but most all of the actual comments call them out for being bullshit. That tells me that fake users are coming here just to upvote propaganda. </p>

<p>There&#39;s a study somewhere about how the T_D posts are all upvoted by thousands in the first couple of minutes - it&#39;s a completely unorganic vote distribution, showing that it isn&#39;t real. I&#39;ll try to find it. I&#39;m sure the same would apply here but I don&#39;t think anyone has actually crunched the numbers. </p>

I think the real truth is somewhere between what we are being told, and totally wild conspiracies.. some people have pointed out plausible explanations that aren&#39;t wildly different from what we&#39;re told, but better explain motive or reasons for certain actions.</p>
