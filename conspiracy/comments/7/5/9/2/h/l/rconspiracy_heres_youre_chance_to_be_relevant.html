<p>This is Rm 32134 and Brian Hodge&#39;s claim that he was staying in that room where shots were fired from. </p>

<p>If Hodge had that room, then Paddock would have had to have found a way in, which is a story in and of itself, even within the official narrative. </p>

<p>This raises several questions that are still crucial that <strong>no one in the mainstream OR alternative media is asking</strong></p>

<p>But it&#39;s getting buried under the same YouTube videos posted 100 times already. <strong>We need this stickied to the front page</strong></p>

<p>We all need to be tweeting it and emailing it to every reporter investigating the shooting. This is the only place discussing this crucial bombshell.  This is our chance to actually be relevant.  </p>

<p>Email the MODS. Tell them we need a sticky at the top about rm 32134</p>

<p>I posted this in a different thread about Hodge too. I think it&#39;s an important detail that is being overlooked. Since he is the closest guy we have to Paddock at the time of the shooting. Would be good to get actual confirmation of his room number though, especially if he has changed the story as others have claimed</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know, but it all really sounds like a red herring to me, without absolute inside information we won&#39;t know shit.  What we do know is that we are enslaved by the owners of the federal reserve, they are likely very linked to this, the complicit media, the government, their perpetual wars and so on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s come to my attention that the inside door locks automatically anytime it&#39;s shut. So that solves at least the mystery of why both were locked from the inside when the SWAT team arrived.  Just need to investigate Brian Hodge&#39;s claim now</p>

<p>this is also interesting to look at. If Brian&#39;s claim is true, then this suggests that Paddock gained access to Brian&#39;s room and used it to set up cameras before the shooting even happened? That picture pretty much confirms that Paddock used both 32134 and 32135. It is most likely that Brian has lied about it. But it also suggests that Paddock had to switch rooms via hallway or other entrances during the shooting. Idk, weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sent the following email to </p>

<p><a href="mailto:newsdesk@smh.com.au">newsdesk@smh.com.au</a></p>

<p>In your article dated October 2nd
<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/hardcore-las-vegas-shooter-in-room-next-door-says-australian-man-brian-hodge-20171002-gysy9v">http://www.smh.com.au/world/hardcore-las-vegas-shooter-in-room-next-door-says-australian-man-brian-hodge-20171002-gysy9v</a>
you quoted a man named Brian Hodge as claiming that he was staying in room 134 on the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay. However that room was used by the shooter to break out the window and fire shots from. Why has there been no follow-up on this incredible statement? Do you stand by your initial reporting or will you be retracting that story?</p>

<p>Perhaps everyone interested can write them their own unique email</p>
