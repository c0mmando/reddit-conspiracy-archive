        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is my simple theory.  </p>

<p>I am elite and want to remain in power. </p>

<p>Citizens are growing aware that there is a secret entity running the show (me). </p>

<p>I need a way to make it seem as though I was defeated to the American people but remain in the shadows.  </p>

<p>Set up a Cospiracy Theory show. (infowars)</p>

<p>Plug the idea that the shadow govt is fighting another secret org. and the govt itself to remain in control.</p>

<p>Give the illusion, through mass shootings and other stages events that TPTB are losing thier grip. (i.e. make it obvious to the normal american, who doesnt follow CTs, that something is going on.)</p>

<p>Continue to push the idea of different factions all fighting for power.</p>

<p>Give the illusion that TPTB have been defeated and the american citizens have won thier country back.</p>

<p>wait for citizens to drop thier guard and re install myself within whatever new framework has been created.</p>

<p>This is just a basic outline of potential trick used by TPTB.  Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Adding onto this but reaching a bit further:  What if the ulitmate end goal has to do with aliens? </p>

<p>What if humans really did make an agreement with aliens that they could harvest us after our population hit a predetermined  umber.  We are nearing the number and TPTB are building underground bases, taking away guns from civilians and setting us up to be harvested.  Ince we are either killed for sustinance or taken to a slave colony TPTB can come out of hiding and create the world as they see fit.  The georgia guidestones say to maintain the population under a specific number to maintain harmony with earth, this suggests that something will happen to most of civilization.  did they make the guidestones knowig what would happen?</p>

<p>This was the origional reply.  This question insinuates that I as the o.p. am a silly person that watches too much tv.  I dont watch x-files so your username means nothing.  I am not upset, simply making those who are unaware how small seemingly harmless replies actually tie into the indictrination of dismissing critical thinking and thinkers.  You didnt mean it, i get that, i too didnt mean anything beyond sharing a manipulation built into our communication.  So you can calm yourself down lmfao</p>

If they know they are slipping and losing control will they start a world war to reduce the population to a point where they can then redistribute &quot;history&quot; and teach the young misleading and fake history so as to indoctrinate them and start the process over? idk</p>
