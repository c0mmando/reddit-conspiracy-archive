      <p>
       Here is my simple theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am elite and want to remain in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Citizens are growing aware that there is a secret entity running the show (me).
      </p>
      <p>
       I need a way to make it seem as though I was defeated to the American people but remain in the shadows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Set up a Cospiracy Theory show. (infowars)
      </p>
      <p>
       Plug the idea that the shadow govt is fighting another secret org. and the govt itself to remain in control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Give the illusion, through mass shootings and other stages events that TPTB are losing thier grip. (i.e. make it obvious to the normal american, who doesnt follow CTs, that something is going on.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Continue to push the idea of different factions all fighting for power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Give the illusion that TPTB have been defeated and the american citizens have won thier country back.
      </p>
      <p>
       wait for citizens to drop thier guard and re install myself within whatever new framework has been created.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is just a basic outline of potential trick used by TPTB.  Any thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Adding onto this but reaching a bit further:  What if the ulitmate end goal has to do with aliens?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if humans really did make an agreement with aliens that they could harvest us after our population hit a predetermined  umber.  We are nearing the number and TPTB are building underground bases, taking away guns from civilians and setting us up to be harvested.  Ince we are either killed for sustinance or taken to a slave colony TPTB can come out of hiding and create the world as they see fit.  The georgia guidestones say to maintain the population under a specific number to maintain harmony with earth, this suggests that something will happen to most of civilization.  did they make the guidestones knowig what would happen?

       first off this is redditt none of us have "cedibility". Why arent aliens a thing anymore? There have been a lot of people saying aliens are false, etc.  this makes me think they are indeed involved

       This was the origional reply.  This question insinuates that I as the o.p. am a silly person that watches too much tv.  I dont watch x-files so your username means nothing.  I am not upset, simply making those who are unaware how small seemingly harmless replies actually tie into the indictrination of dismissing critical thinking and thinkers.  You didnt mean it, i get that, i too didnt mean anything beyond sharing a manipulation built into our communication.  So you can calm yourself down lmfao

       No The Colony is a tv show about aliens invading Earth and building these - Colonies- all over the place. The humans in charge are aware and have made deals with the alien "hosts". look it up it's pretty good. it's got the dude from Lost (Sawyer) the dude from House (Jew Doctor) and the stupid wife from the walking dead.

       No hard feelings. I’m new here and honestly didn’t even realize there was so much Jew hatred. I’m focused on this LV thing. So it’s understandable that you’d get that impression from my statement- totally fair on your part.

       I'm not going to give TPTB any cred.  The internet and it's possible anonymity will be the death of them.  Trying to control the flow of information with pre-internet tactics will always lose.

       mainly because blatant censorship is being thrown around.  The world has gotten a taste of this freedom of information.  Taking it away will only anger.  I don't see people who are "woke" reverting back to "non-woke".

       some people actually do go from being woke to asleep.  i had a friend that used to talk to me about this stuff but he got a new job and suddenly he had no interest.  not because he was being duped any longer but because he was just to busy.  also if I were TPTB I would find a new way to do things with the knowledge that people are now aware of my old dealings.  dont underestimate these guys.  with a pool of unlimited money they can accomplish a lot.  not saying we have NO chance but I dont think there is going to be any easy way out of this.

       if we're all happy and wealthy, then sure we won't be looking at TPTB.  But there is so much unhappiness, poverty, and class divide, and the costs to right the ship are clearly too high for TPTB.  They would almost burn it all down and collect on the insurance.

       i dont disagree with this.  The thing im having trouble with is the end goal.  I see people waking up so they must also.  What is the end goal here? Are they going to keep playing the slow long con? they cant do that anymore.  They can try and have been trying to censor the internet but that wont work.  If they know they are slipping and losing control will they start a world war to reduce the population to a point where they can then redistribute "history" and teach the young misleading and fake history so as to indoctrinate them and start the process over? idk

       Yeah.  No idea what their plan is.  And I feel they don't have one.  this current slipping/losing control is mainly due to their horrible decisions and their egos.  I don't expect them to grow a brain overnight, so I'm thinking it will be more of the same until there is an uprising of some sort.

       yeah. they can buy their supporters.  But for my own sanity, I have to believe they can't buy an idea/ideal.  I have to believe there is a possibility for an awakening of the human spirit that far supersedes our current societal structure.  And I believe TPTB are only blocking progress of the species solely for their fickle dollars.

       Sadly i still need said "fickle dollars", but I am excited about bitcoin and following that evolution.
