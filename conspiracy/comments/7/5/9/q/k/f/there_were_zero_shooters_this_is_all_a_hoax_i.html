       Nobody died. Just like sandy hook, just like Boston. (((And many others)))
      </p>
      <p>
       *you knowing of your sister's friend's lawn care guy's girlfriend who died isn't proof or evidence
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit. So as I assumed, there is zero undeniable evidence proving one shooter, two shooters, 25 shooters, zero shooters. So I ask you to consider this narrative :
      </p>
      <p>
       The same people who faked sandy hook and Boston bombing faked this event using their standard operating procedures.  Nobody died in sandy hook. Nobody died in Boston.  Nobody died in Las Vegas.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the most likely scenario given the available evidence and given my knowledge and understanding of previous hoax events.

       Oh I see. Yeah that guy does look really similar to Paddock. I would like to think he wouldn't be cocky/ stupid enough to go hang out in a casino again a week later. But who knows with a new identity and federal protection he might be able to do whatever he wants.

       The scene looked real to me. People doing CPR, bodies laying motionless. People transporting the dead on metal barricades. Genuine panic and tears around the dead and wounded.
      </p>
      <p>
       That seemed real to me. I would actually be less appalled if it were all actors and that people didn't actually die. But I don't think that is the case. There were a few crisis actors on the news after. And I think the story of how it happened Is a story. But people did die, just like 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sandy hook, Boston marathon... that was entirely scripted victims, and no one died, and the wounded were already amputees. And you will notice Bauman , or whatever his name is has a motion picture coming out about his heroism of being a marathon victim. Try not to puke.

       So ur trying to say the entire concert was in on it and people were just falling and lying down, and they were pretending right? Is that what you are really trying to say? Because it just gave you proof people dropped. So are you now assuming they are faking being shot? Nope.

       9/11 was very real. The passenger lists weren't. The official narrative was very very fake.  The first responders getting cancer was very very real.  People inside the buildings that died really really were not given a warning like (((many many others)))) were given.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is reason to fear. It's not automatic machines guns. It's the CIA which is controlled by Zionist dual citizens of Israel.  They only know how to lie.

       That video has been linked in this thread.  It convinces me that the same fakers that did Boston faked this.  With the same fake blood.  The man walking  around filming is very very suspect and his video does not prove a shooting happened

       Lol, this is the problem with conspiracy theorists...They've chased a rabbit so far down the hole that they think things like Boston didn't happen, and now they go on thinking every event like this didn't actually happen either.

       Boston happened.  Fortunately, we only lost 2 Americans that day, but countless others were injured too.  Show me your proof that it didn't happen...

       CIA.  For several reasons.  Not the least of which is to hurt Trumps chances of reelection.  Gun control bill was set to be voted on.  This is a little motivation for congress to get the vote right.  Having a population in fear for their lives is another motivation.  Literally terrorism

       but can't all of that be done far easier than a massive conspiracy to fake the worst mass shooting? Like, this would have to cost an obscene amount of money. It would be significantly easier, and cheaper, to just buy the politicians you want to influence

       Out of all the conspiracies on this topic this is by far be worst one. People got shot bro. I'm sorry no footage caught someone being sniped by a bullet, but people did get shot and die sorry to tell you. There are countless videos of motionless bodies and people dropping from a distance. You can't sit there and pay off an entire concert of people to sit there and lie about things. It's literally an undeniable fact people were shot and killed.

       At 2:38 there is a man that falls consistent with being shot.  Someone just recently linked a close up of that man falling.  It does look fairly legit..I believe that that man was likely in on it as I am yet to be convinced of a real shooting. This is probably the best evidence of a shooting so far though. Thank you for posting.

       You’re welcome. I know it’s hard to believe that real people died with consideration to all of the false flags that have occurred. Unfortunately, it is real. I’ve said it multiple times on here. I’m from Vegas. My kids went to school there. One of my sons friends is one of the deceased and others injured, others witness to the traumatic events that transpired.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe they hire crisis actors specifically for the media narrative. They don’t interview people like my friends that were there and give raw testimony of what occurred, it would destroy their one shooter narrative. It would expose the FBI and CIA involvement.

       I mean you have to be a fucking idiot to actually believe the gunshots were fake, and everyone at the concert was "in on it". Guess what. They weren't. Guess what? You can't convince an entire crowd of people to lie about something this huge. Think logically for like 2 seconds.

       Totally. Also Jason Aldean was a hologram I heard. He wasn’t even the one singing. It was all audio prerecorded before hand by another singer.

       Do you even realize what you just said? You just said the gun fire was real at the time, but no guns were shot during the hoax. Hahahahahahaha. There is literally 10 min of audio of guns going off. So please tell me what the fuck you are even saying other than looking like an even bigger idiot.

       Do you know what an audio recording is? Someone at sometime days or weeks or years before this event reordered the sound of an automatic gun being fired. On the day of the event that audio recording was played. Not very difficult to pull off

       Ok. Gotcha. Sounds good. You are right. I am wrong. They somehow faked the sound of gunshots. Gotcha. Awesome. You are right. I do know what an audio recording is lol. But yes ur right all these videos we have been seeing were premeditated. Gotcha. You are right. You are literally trying to tell me all those videos are fake and someone put a perfect audio representation of a gun firing from distance. Gotcha! Like can you just take a step back  and realize you are insane. Look I'm all for questioning the narrative and I don't think what they are saying is true. But a dude in Las Vegas last weekend unloaded on a crowd buddy. It's really shitty someone or some people did this, but it happened. And I don't even wanna be the guy to tell you I had a friend there because that does nothing for me. But guess what? I had a friend there who was visiting his friend. And guess what? It was real. Once again I'm sorry to tell you the ridiculous things you believe are wrong, but they are. Have a good day.

       Seriously? You can see bullets ricochet off the ground on several videos. 
I don’t know a friends friends cousin that died there. But I do know my sons friend died and several others were there and were injured. 
My mother also happens to work at the trauma hospital, so ya you’re reaching.

       And if I am wrong, I obviously feel horrible for implying that these victims were participating in a giant hoax.  I don't believe anyone died, which means I don't believe the parents of the fake victims when they say their loved one was murdered.  I don't ask questions in order to make the families of possible victims feel worse...Would it though? And why?

       So 22,000 people were in on it? They hired that many actors to produce a fake shooting? Those were some damn good actors, everyone should win an award for the portrayal of fear. And Jason Aldean, he was aware the “shooting” would take place sometime right? If not actors, then they paid them all off to say it was real? Not buying it. Come on man. Using your logic, where’s your proof? We all have seen countless videos on the side of it being real, where is yours that it’s fake?

       Thank you for posting. I had seen this one already, and I still think the man filming is in on it. As are all of the 'wounded' in video, I believe.  The man filming seems more interested in documenting entrance and exit wounds than helping in any real way.  And I am yet to see an actual gunshot wound.

       That does appear to be someone falling to the ground after being shot.   I don't believe that that man was actually shot, but it is evidence I had not seen yet.  So thank you for posting, and please post more if you have them. I do not like videos portraying real death or violence, but I am still not convinced this shoot was real.

       Well we must live at Disneyland then, we are all actually 100% safe. No need to fear if 9/11 and mass shootings and school shootings are faked. Whew!

       Well, he does  make a good point about there being zero videos of anyone being shot or evidence that anyone died.
