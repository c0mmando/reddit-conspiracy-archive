    <div class="md"><p>Vegas resorts are really big and really empty and always under construction.  And most people aren&#39;t going around thinking the worst all the time, to my knowledge I&#39;ve never been in a hotel while guests were using powertools without authorization. If I was walking past some guy drilling by a door on my way to the elevator I&#39;d assume he was supposed to be there. Unless he was preventing me from sleeping or conducting business in my room it wouldn&#39;t even cross my mind to talk to check with management about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in pest control. Whenever I go for service at a hotel or anywhere really, they give everyone that shows up at the security office the third degree. Not me. Even if I&#39;m filling in for a guy, there&#39;s a new security guy, most people just say &quot;oh yea pest control go ahead&quot;. Its unbelievable how easily I can move around buildings with zero issues. I service a nice hotel with very expensive penthouses in my city and they give me a key to any room in the building. Of course I would never do anything but it surprises me in today&#39;s day in age that they just...well...hand it over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This one is straight up correct.  You seriously don&#39;t have a single friend who has every been to vegas who can just confirm for you the fact that barely any hotel has hallway cameras?<br/>
Like, whats the speculation on this on?  No there are no security cameras in Vegas hotel hallways.<br/>
The casino however should obviously have the entirety of his movement documented and if we don&#39;t get it soon, its pretty much proof that we aren&#39;t being given a full story.  </p>

Or have you actually ever seen a camera in a residential section of a hotel, monitoring the hallway.<br/>
Maybe the elevator bank incidentally, but directly on the room doors?  <em>Never</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Security cameras not for evidence but for keeping tabs on things like weapons smuggling and unauthorized building modifications.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been reading some stuff, and apparently many hotels don&#39;t have cameras in their hallways. That just seems weird to me. Or they could just be hiding their hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I once had a college job with building maintenance (i.e. two guys who spent the whole afternoon napping) in one of the big departmental buildings. I used to joke that as long as I was carrying a clipboard and my giant keychain, literally nobody would stop me from doing anything.  I could take a sledgehammer to a wall and as long as I acted confident, nobody would bat an eye.</p>

<p>In other words, if you&#39;re in a hotel and you see someone with a power drill working in the hallway, your first instinct would be to assume the guy&#39;s supposed to be doing it.  Even most of the building staff wouldn&#39;t question it -- if you&#39;re a maid, say, you probably have no idea what projects the facilities maintenance people are doing day to day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what gets me is this old guy supposedly carried in hundreds of pounds of guns, ammo and tools and nobody noticed.  then he sets up all this camera equipment and seals the stairwell.  he supposedly calculates bullet trajectory (why its even needed makes no sense) and everyone keeps saying how well planned out this.... let me break this down.</p>

<p>Pretend im the shooter.  </p>

<p>What details would i want to figure out before going to do this?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>what room is a good vantage point for me to shoot from? (didnt the hotel comp this room? did he choose it or did the hotel?)</p></li>
<li><p>Im planning on escaping so how long could I fire before police show up? (he took his dandy time in between&quot;reloading&quot;)</p></li>
<li><p>Lets calculate that I have roughly 10 min of shooting time and how many rounds i would need at roughly 600 rpm.  tou can do the math as my point isnt how many he shot but how little he shot.  why carry all the extra guns and ammo up if you KNOW there is no way to even get that many rounds off? (this doesnt seem very planned to me)</p></li>
<li><p>let me set up cameras to see into the hall so i can see when police are coming.  (to just shoot himself? the cop said himself he could have held off for hours with the ammo he had)  This man supposedly had an escape route.  the stairwell door was sealed, the elevator isnt an option so how would he have gotten away? i see no ropes for repelling or climbing.  Even if he made it out of the room, then what? walk out the front door? </p></li>
<li><p>how did he get all the weapons in? i see one suitcase that could hold a dismantled gun or two but 20+ guns? wouldnt the suitcase be rediculously heavy and sounds of metal clanking inside? </p></li>
</ol>
