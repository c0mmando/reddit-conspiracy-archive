You are welcome to that position, but stop pretending that you are not taking a position. No person or group is infallible, and a counter-coup against the cabal is still entirely possible. It is still possible that this is currently happening with Trump. You may disagree, as is your right, but we are all still waiting to see how this plays out.</p>

<p>I reject this absolute. There is obviously a large kernel of truth there, but it is unrealistic as it stands. It may have been true for forty years, but that still doesn&#39;t mean it will be true tomorrow. This is what I mean. You claim to know that Trump is not a good person because otherwise he wouldn&#39;t have been allowed to win. That&#39;s not necessarily true. Any person or group on this planet makes mistakes and can be outwitted, no matter how unlikely that may seem.</p>

<p>this literally says they want us to pick a side, and then tells us which sides to pick, of which, are usually good sources for cross-reference news stories for bias and misreporting. Breitbart is reliably very right, Infowars reliably reporting alternative news, FOX reliably reporting right of center mainstream politics. these are valuable sources to gauge the political narrative. Discrediting them without explanation and acting as if they have no value is by far one of the bigger offenses of this post.</p>

<p>In order for power to be used, it must manifest. Power cannot be some &quot;nameless and behind the scenes&quot; group that never sees the light. It must be connected to the powers you see. It&#39;s not hard to draw the connections. Here&#39;s how we do it:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m saying it <strong>is</strong> connected to the powers you see, and it is those powers that are being leveraged. Someone &quot;having&quot; the power does not necessarily indicate who is executing said power. So basically, the machine has the power to do things, but who&#39;s pulling the levers? </p>

<p>If we could follow the money I&#39;m sure it would have happened by now. Black budgets, hidden campaign contributions, payments disguised as charitable donations, shell companies, etc. </p>

<p>Without the money trail we have to instead look at who would benefit. I think it&#39;s a mistake to not look beyond the familiar faces in our governments when answering this question. </p>

<p>The very nature of conspiracy seems to be that &quot;not all is as it seems&quot;. That would seem to imply that there are no absolutes, meaning some authority might be just fine, while other authority isn&#39;t.  The problem with many conspiracy theorists is that for all their talk of &quot;open mind&quot; their minds are often closed in other ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump <em>is</em> a Zionist. It&#39;s going to be revealed soon, no more &quot;4D chess speculation&quot; whenever he does something that seems to go against his pseudo-MAGA narrative (great selling point give credit where it&#39;s due). All of this &quot;He’s going after the deep state, he will lock her up, just wait &amp; see&quot; followed by nonstop wild claims &amp; ridiculous interpretations to tip the scales in his favor even when it&#39;s glaringly obvious (and has been for some time) he&#39;s controlled opposition.</p>

<p>No idea what the alt-right will do when this is revealed, but it&#39;s safe to assume martial law may be invoked.</p>

<p>The feigned media distrust will be his goto 1st &amp; 10 play (pardon the pun). Trump very well knows the media (regardless of political slant) is only there to manipulate the masses. The &quot;mainstream alternative&quot; media is also controlled by the same groups. </p>

<p>Taking this distrust to a whole new level is an obvious strategy created in the Trump camp during the campaign &amp; still being used by him almost daily. It&#39;s a direct psyop. </p>

<p>Indirect psyop is the popular/electoral split, which is surprisingly a win-win for both sides. The left can say they would have won in a fair system, which infuriates those on the right, except they won (but nothing will really change). Then there&#39;s the Russian hacking thing which will be front &amp; center soon enough once again. North Korea is a sideshow act in the world&#39;s greatest vaudeville show.</p>

<p>This sub used to be good back in the day, but now it&#39;s Infowars Jr with no signs of slowing down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only authority humanity is really bound by is natural law gravity, physics, biology etc. It enforces itself and it is true doesn&#39;t matter if I belive in gravity or not if I walk over a cliff I&#39;m going to fall. It was my free will to decide if I wanted to walk over that cliff or not, although if I didn&#39;t know what gravity was and nobody told me what was going to happened I just did not know what was going to happen. If I knew what was going to happen and ignored it then I would just be ignorant of what was true. Everyone has free will and can acquire knowledge and test to see if its true but the limit to our free will is natural law. Unless your Rick from Rick and Morty he uses his knowledge to make reality his bitch.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty biased. It is layman level analysis, like spoon feeding a babbys first red pill which also isn&#39;t good for the baby. It&#39;s completely simplifies things without good reason to the point of mischaracterization. It would give any newcomers to the sub or conspiracies in general, a bad footing in a way to attempt to understand what&#39;s going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>TPTB = The Powers That Be (currently the Trump administration and the deep state controlled by the Clintons, Bushes, and Obamas, CEOs of large industries, super wealthy families).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Implies that Trump is equivalent/comparable to the classic PTB, cites buzzword families and doesn&#39;t reference any of the more deep state lineages that affect US and the world (Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Du Pont, Carlos Slim and more..)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They want us to pick a side and fight each other. Classic divide and conquer tactic.
If you want to survive in this sub, you gotta remember: we serve nobody.
Don&#39;t trust the MSM narrative, including but not limited to: FOX, CNN, Breitbart, Infowars, The Young Turks, MSNBC, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this literally says they want us to pick a side, and then tells us which sides to pick, of which, are usually good sources for cross-referencing news stories for bias and misreporting. Breitbart is reliably very right, Infowars reliably reporting alternative news, FOX reliably reporting right of center mainstream politics. these are valuable sources to gauge the political narrative. Discrediting them without explanation and acting as if they have no value is by far one of the bigger offenses of this post.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, hating Zionists does not mean we hate Jews. And hating Nazis does not mean we blame white people for all of society&#39;s problems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most gentiles do not have views about real Zionism, most Jews do. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not everything is so black and white.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so lets make it simplified for no reason other than to shoehorn fake authority and mislead people into how they should fit into the &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; box.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open your eyes a bit more, and welcome to this rabbit hole.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>just fuck off, your post has no value.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem isn&#39;t government as a concept. The problem is that corporations have overthrown the US government. They literally write the laws. This system has been in place since the early 80s and has led to the complete deregulation of corporate malfeasance; the busting of American unions; &quot;free trade&quot; deals that has destroyed American manufacturing; and the destruction of the environment and the middle class.</p>

<p>The left wing pillars that once held up this society and made it into a great country has been whittled away to toothpicks. For you to think that destroying whats left of these pillars is going to curtail corporate power is delusional. Do you think corporations are just going to dissolve without &quot;big government&quot;? No, they will operate even more brazenly and abolish any regulation placed on them including whats left of safety, environmental and work regulations. We would be reduced to third world slavery conditions where children work for under a dollar a day.</p>

<p>What we need to do is take back OUR government. Not abolish it and let corporations run wild.</p>

That way we can all be rooting for him thinking he’s going to stick it to “the swamp”. The TPTB already have blackmail video of him with underage girls on Epstein’s island.  I think to make it to become one of the nominees for president they have to have vetted you with a brownstone operation(Epstein’s island or wherever they do it now). I do think there could be other factions that could have it out for him for sure though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tptb do not, and have not changed for a very long time. You can say trump is controlled but calling him tptb because his president is not how it works.</p>

<p>I for one do not believe he is, considering majority of his donations came from citizens.</p>

<p>If trump was really controlled by tptb he would of not killed the tpp like he did. If he wasn&#39;t for him  it would be in place by now and thank fuck it isn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His whole cabinet saying that is a bit ridiculous compared his to Obama or bush&#39;s doesn&#39;t come close. Just gonna ignore the part about the tpp?</p>

<p>Plus I&#39;ve said this before to other people, if you don&#39;t have any one who&#39;s been playing the system in your cabinet you&#39;ll never learn what you need to do to fix it. If you were to go in with little Knowledge of how the system works you&#39;d fail completely and most likely just fuck things up Even more trying to fix it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>hose who call themselves no-government men, I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government. Let every man make known what kind of government would command his respect, and that will be one step toward obtaining it. After all, the practical reason why, when the power is once in the hands of the people, a majority are permitted, and for a long period continue, to rule, is not because they are most likely to be in the right, nor because this seems fairest to the minority, but because they are physically the strongest. </p>

<p>But a government in which the majority rule in all cases cannot be based on justice, even as far as men understand it. Can there not be a government in which majorities do not virtually decide right and wrong, but conscience? -- in which majorities decide only those questions to which the rule of expediency is applicable? Must the citizen ever for a moment, or in the least degree, resign his conscience to the legislator? Why has every man a conscience, then? </p>

<p>I think that we should be men first, and subjects afterward. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law, so much as for the right. The only obligation which I have a right to assume is to do at any time what I think right. It is truly enough said that a corporation has no conscience; but a corporation of conscientious men is a corporation with a conscience. Law never made men a whit more just; and, by means of their respect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made the agents of injustice.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t hate all authority and I recognize that having a government is important. I can only imagine the chaos that there would be without government, at least in many places. But I also recognize that in some instances it would have been good if there was no government at all, for example in cambodia when the government killed a sustantial part of the population or in russia when the bolsheviks started killing people. I think it is no good what governments did in Lybia and Iraq. So governments are good in some instances and bad in other instances. But this sub is not about espousing anarchy or statism but about looking if there are conspiracies in anarchy, statism, terrorism, crime and many other things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s say there really are 2 sides. Left = Soros paid faggots with brain dead don&#39;t think zombies. Right = ultra conservative bible thumpers, strict, authoritative. </p>

<p>At this point in time, it is the left that is winning NOW. They are trying to subverting our kids to having no gender. They are the ones who are communists. They are the ones with BLM. They are the ones pushing propaganda though their paid MSMs. They are the ones with ANTIFA. They are the ones with the corporations in their pockets. The are the ones with Hollywood in their pockets. They have all the sports companies in their pockets. They are trying to legalize it so it is lawful to have sex with kids. They are destroying language systems so we can&#39;t communicate with each other. They are enacting false flags so that they can take away your freedoms. So many things the left are doing covertly for greed and power. </p>

<p>Yes, there are 2 sides and both are fighting to win. Yes, it is divide and conquer. But look at what the left is doing to the human race and ask yourself if that right? </p>

<p>Choose Trump, stick with him, make sure he keeps his promise of draining the swamp, the most important promise, and bring the balance back to politics where it is all fair. Then dump him once you&#39;ve used him, like he is using us. This is a no brainer. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty biased. It is layman level analysis, like spoon feeding a babbys first red pill which also isn&#39;t good for the baby. It&#39;s completely simplifies things without good reason to the point of mischaracterization. It would give any newcomers to the sub or conspiracies in general, a bad footing in a way to attempt to understand what&#39;s going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>TPTB = The Powers That Be (currently the Trump administration and the deep state controlled by the Clintons, Bushes, and Obamas, CEOs of large industries, super wealthy families).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Implies that Trump is equivalent/comparable to the classic PTB, cites buzzword families and doesn&#39;t reference any of the more deep state lineages that affect US and the world (Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Du Pont, Carlos Slim and more..)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They want us to pick a side and fight each other. Classic divide and conquer tactic.
If you want to survive in this sub, you gotta remember: we serve nobody.
Don&#39;t trust the MSM narrative, including but not limited to: FOX, CNN, Breitbart, Infowars, The Young Turks, MSNBC, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>this literally says they want us to pick a side, and then tells us which sides to pick, of which, are usually good sources for cross-referencing news stories for bias and misreporting. Breitbart is reliably very right, Infowars reliably reporting alternative news, FOX reliably reporting right of center mainstream politics. these are valuable sources to gauge the political narrative. Discrediting them without explanation and acting as if they have no value is by far one of the bigger offenses of this post.</p>

<p>Also, hating Zionists does not mean we hate Jews. And hating Nazis does not mean we blame white people for all of society&#39;s problems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most gentiles do not have views about real Zionism, most Jews do. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not everything is so black and white.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so lets make it simplified for no reason other than to shoehorn fake authority and mislead people into how they should fit into the &#39;conspiracy theorist&#39; box.&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open your eyes a bit more, and welcome to this rabbit hole.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>just fuck off, your post has no value.</p>
