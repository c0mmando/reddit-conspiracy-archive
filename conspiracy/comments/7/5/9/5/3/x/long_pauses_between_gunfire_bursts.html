If paddock had the 20-something find in his room, why would he waste his time trying to clear a jam (one of the possible reasons for these long pauses)?  We can clearly see stacks of magazines in his room, so him needing to &quot;find a mag&quot; isn&#39;t plausible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had this thought as well. </p>

<p>Herding:
   If the fuel tanks were supposed to blow then everyone would have been running toward them after hearing the gunshots. Had the explosion not killed everyone they would run back toward the shooter(s) to escape the explosion. The exits to Las Vegas Blvd were blocked and this would have trapped everyone in a small area.</p>

<p>Not wanting to kill everyone:
   Maybe the plan was never to kill everyone. The shooter(s) might not have expected everyone to just lie on the ground, but instead to run. With everyone on the ground he/she/they had to keep shooting in order to maintain the narrative, killing many more than originally intended.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe the pauses were supposed to be coordinated with other shooters? So as to not overlap and destroy the one shooter narrative? As for your response- he’s shooting at a crowd of people why would he only want to inflict minimal damage and casualties?  </p>

<p>By taking all of these guns into a room, parking a car on their property with all that explosive... he&#39;s basically giving the middle finger to the hotel.  You&#39;re not negligent?  Here... fight these 500+ lawsuits you&#39;re about to face.  Watch Wynn&#39;s interview on Fox yesterday, he basically calls that hotel incompetent.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then the casino is a victim.  The way he did it...the casino was probably comping him the room while he used it to murder those people.  If that was his goal...to hurt the Mandalay Bay...what he did made more sense.</p>

<p>Shooting up a casino would have been a lot harder to kill as many people too....there&#39;s so many places for people to run and hide...and he would have been engaged by security immediately.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve read he had a camera in the hallway to alert him to authorities closing in and he was also live streaming from the room overseas, if that&#39;s the case then it may be the same reason there are lulls in any nest fire situation. You initiate fire, confirm effectiveness &amp; hits, adjust scope/stance/location if necessary (and reload or switch weapon), check immediate placement for threat level and activity then re-engage (all done within a few seconds for trained persons).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy the official narrative there seems to be a very well planned methodology to the sounds and videos I&#39;ve seen, and in my humble opinion there&#39;s no chance an average civilian could pull this off even with a mounted M249 (which is what the first 100+ shots sounds like to me) without training or a hell of a lot of practice, it seems to be very well planned out and orchestrated. Personally I&#39;m more interested in where the live stream was going, where the footage before during and after the event from the casino/hotel is and why in the leaked photo of his corpse his leg is under a rifle on bipod that would depict him sitting legs outstretched at wrong shot angle with rifle over leg before shooting himself in the mouth.</p>

<p>Ultimately I think half of the confusion will be because &quot;authorities&quot; are purposefully suppressing info and maybe even force directing details while they chase an associate or partner lead, problem is even once they realise they&#39;ve misinformed people for no benefit towards the case they wont correct the record. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had not read/heard/seen that he was livestreaming! I do remember the initial reports saying that he had cameras set up in the room and in the hallway and after one of the first few press conferences the sheriff said the camera&#39;s weren&#39;t recording or weren&#39;t powered on (I can&#39;t remember exactly) and I found that really fishy. 
The leaked photo details also didn&#39;t make sense. The bipod under his leg made no sense at all, neither did the revolver so far away from his head along with a trail of blood. I&#39;m not a forensics expert but that looked terribly staged. 
I saw a clip of the 60 mins interview last night and the cop mentioned seeing the note and noticing the calculations- it took the authorities how many days to release that information to the general public? They wouldn&#39;t say <em>what</em> was on the note other than what it wasn&#39;t. </p>
