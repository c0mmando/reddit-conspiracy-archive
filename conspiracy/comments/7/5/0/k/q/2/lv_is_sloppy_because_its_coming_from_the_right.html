       pre-edit: When I say Trump, I mean the Right. It's just easier to explain using Trump's name, because a lot of it has to do with him.
      </p>
      <p>
       real-edit: Same thing goes for Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Donald Trump starts screaming fake news over and over again since the beginning of his campaign. He's constantly trying to subvert reality and trust in the media. He takes every chance he gets to bash Hillary. People are "waking up" to that. Trump feels like he's losing that front, so he sets up LV to make it look shady. In the following weeks, there will be a special investigation into it, which focuses on tying in different members of the Left -- it doesn't matter if there's any truth to it. Just enough to take focus away from Russia. And, in that special investigation -- that is put together in a rather unorthodoxed fashion; Trump has a large amount of control in who runs it) -- it is concluded that Hillary was behind it all along, thus "validating" everything that Trump has said about her.
      </p>
      <p>
       When in reality, Trump set it all up to look sloppy. To look like like an obvious Leftist false flag.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this thought likely won't be popular on this sub, but to me that sounds far more plausible and coherent than all of these theories saying it's a gun grab to turn the entire nation into a socialist state.

       I agree that its more likely than a gun grab, but i also dont find your premise likely. There is no way Trumps team would try that. They know they are out gunned and that they would get caught. They're evil, but they're not insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       More plausibly its not a false flag, but rather a fight we don't understand. We dont get to know what hapoened, but that doesnt mean it was planned.

       I'm trying to play the conspiracy game. I actually don't even really believe what I said. I agree with you more than what I typed out. I'm just reading this sub, looking at all of the people latch onto shit that is easily debunked, or so far down a rabbit hole that their head pops out in China. I kind of wanted to see how mine would fair in a sub dominated by people who believe this is a gun grab to more easily push their more socialist agenda. Maybe I'm not "woke" -- maybe I'm not paranoid either -- but that idea just seems thoroughly ridiculous. They're already rich and more or less above the law. Why would they want to destroy a system that they're already at the top of? (I just realized I'm no longer talking to you at this point,

       )

      <p>
       Other than the gun grab/socialist narrative, I'm not really seeing anything else being presented on this sub.

       I appreciate your open arms.  And I'm not committed to this theory. I don't even believe it (even though I would totally come back and say "I called it" if it happens lol). I came here looking for answers. But this sub needs a reality check. This sub is offering alternative explanations, and it seems to favor the most intricate, speculative ones there are. I offered an alternative to the alternative. The people here are so easy to believe in this huge overwhelming, secretive "deep state"  idea that challenges the beliefs of everything that they know, but I offer a simple explanation with a very recognizable motive and I'm literally immediately downvoted. And then they act like there's a deep state, but somehow one of the (once) richest men in the world could not be a part of the deep state because he's only been president for 9 months. Nevermind that his has been connected to very powerful people since birth. Nevermind how he accumulated so much wealth to begin with.

       secretive "deep state" idea that challenges the beliefs of everything that I know. fixed that for you :)

      <p>
       Many of the regular users here have been studying the deep state for decades. Trump is just a jackass who made it in because most adult Americans know how dangerous the Clintons are. The Clintons have control of our media and I have a theory that they propped up Trump in the beginning because she thought she could beat him easily and it backfired in her face.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is fine to hate Trump just be aware that the left media is just as bad as the right.  Same coin so to speak.  Your mind will not be free as long as you believe the left right paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deep state is very real. learn about the drug running through Mena. or the factor 8 blood scandal.  It's pretty scary stuff.

       So there's a "deep state", yet the most powerful person in the world is determined by "adult Americans" in a voting system that creates a buffer from the popular vote? And the Clinton's are dangerous because pf this deep state, yet this deep state let Trump into office?!?!

       Exactly. You've got nothing. What's going to happen is I watch 2 hours of this video with an open mind, then 20 minutes of another video that completely and thoroughly debunks the one you posted. I really hope you're not one of those people urging others  to "wake up

       No I think you are suffering from cognitive dissonance and that this shooting sparked a small amount of realization in you that something is seriously wrong with this country.  That you are here only to find consonance so that your world view will realign with the brainwashing that has you enslaved.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you took even 5 minutes to understand what I was trying to show you you would realize that most of that doc is documented news footage and clippings of what happened.  I gave you Mena because it is more or less accepted that the cia sold cocaine to pay for contras killing people in the jungle.  I mean Tom Cruise is playing Barry Seal.  The good luck was a nice way of backing away from your ignorance without being rude.  Good Luck

       ......Annnndd that's exaclty why I didn't waste more than 10 seconds on the video. I may have come to this sub looking for possible explanation into the LV shootings, but I'm not fucking stupid. What the fuck does cocaine have to do with anything that I posted? It's almost like you're trying to convince me that conspiracies are a real thing, when i myself offered up my own conspiracy theory.

       You say my mind is closed. I say yours is paranoid. I'm open to new ideas. You (as a sub) want people to "wake up". Here's your chance. Convince me.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the deep state? Who makes "them" up? What proof do you have of it's existence? If the deep state is so powerful, yet, so left leaning, how did Trump, or any Repubican for that matter, get into office? If there truly is a deep state, there are so many more unanswered questions about it than LV. Yet here we are, speculating about the LV sooting, and not even questioning the deep state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "deep state" is like your God.  The only reason it exists is because it does in your thoughts.Yet, you have no tangible porrf to point to. If you do, then prove me wrong. Humiliate me.

       I wish you could read back through our conversation. I can hear hysterics in your comments.  I never said wake up.  I have been doing this for a long time and one thing I have learned is talking to people who act the way you do is a waste of time. You will either "wake up" on your own or you won't.  It happened for me when my child was born. Before that I cringe to think I acted like you are now.

       That really comes off as more plausible than say a cookie cutter gun-grab setup?  I don't think you've thought as far into this beyond the initial idea popping into your mind.  Because if you had, you simply wouldn't believe it possible (that's  a assuming there's no sarcasm or trolling tied in with the OP

       Imagine the length of Trump's tendrils required to recruit the manpower in order to orchestrate the OP scenario in it's entirety.  His social reach within the deep state would have to be soooo far reaching to individuals so DEEP, it's not feasible to assume he's made such critical relationships this soon, nevermind the distaste of the powerful shadowy agencies already have for Trump.  Especially without having first (and many times beyond the first) been caught up in many more major scandals.

       What distaste? The same distaste that the MSM has been feeding you? If we're wanting to talk about deep state, perhaps -- and forget LV for a second -- this has been a ploy from the very beginning. To distance Trump from the powers that be. To make Trump seem to be a sincere actor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you said "this soon". He's been connected since the 80's.  His father was connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh yeah. There's also Russia. Russia may or may not have got him elected, but there's no doubt he has a lot of very powerful ties in Russia. That is, if you want to believe Mueller and the MSM.
      </p>
      <p>
       And speaking of MSM, it's so weird how this sub latches onto "eye witnesses" in the mainstream media, but rejects everything else coming from the MSM. Maybe the MSM are showing you these "eye witnesses" to make the whole job look sloppy?

       While I agree, he's been 'connected' long before his presidency, I don't believe it's on a level that has any depth within the political arena.  Sure he has strings he can pull all throughout the economic and financial subverse, but not all of those strings are useful in the political side of things.  He's relatively young in that world.  That's not to say he doesn't have dealings  or relationships with powerful figures within the political world, but he definitely doesn't have as much as he would need to get away with some of the heavier shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm aware it's likely much of the distaste from entities being portrayed by the MSM is probably fabricated, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  I don't buy that said distaste is all a manufacturered show from the very beginning.  If it was all just a ploy to associate sincerity with Trump, then they wouldnt have worked tirelessly to damage his sincerity while trying to project it.  Take the Russia thing for example.   The MSM has worked day and night since mid 2016 to tarnish any positive notion attached to Trump.  This is no secret of course.  But we're all aware the media is the number 1 tool TPTB deploy to keep the majority of the masses docile and in line.  The use of their best tool for 16 plus months, running it to the point of no return, where now it can be said the majority no longer places trust in it.  That by itself could be argued as refute to the idea that he was an intended plant.  They could have achieved similar results without sacrificing their most powerful weapon.
      </p>
      <p>
       And regarding Russia, thats another point of refute.  What's the use beating this horse, if he is infact the player they backed from the beginning?  I'm not saying it isn't possible, just the evidence thats tangible depicts something different entirely

       Yeah this theory has zero pull.  Trump is an outsider in DC.  Yeah he comes from money and power but in government he doesn't fit in.  I think the Left vs. Right argument isn't the right path to go down with this event.

       But it's just a speculative as everything else here on this sub. There's no proof, either way. I'm admittedly not pushing my own theory. I offered up this theory as sort of a reality check.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many questions about this case. I'm pointing out that a "socialist gun grab" is not the only path. But that seems to be the only angle people are taking on this. Being new to this sub, it seems that so many people are following along established, yet, esoteric paradigms in constructing conspiracy theories. Now you go the "outsider" on your sub saying Trump/The Right paid off a few people to make this look like it's part of some Leftist agenda. You try to make it seem like there is this whole underground deep state entity that's pulling off the biggest conspiracy known to man at a global level, yet it's impossible for a very rich man to pay a few actors and an assassin to set up a media stunt.

       Seeing lots of negative comments here. In my opinion, your theory is the most calculated. It feels like a trump move and if trump is losing (which I can't tell) he may pull this, he does have ties to casinos etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now whether he could pull it off or not is the question.

       Either that or a false flag from the left again which I still believe at this point, but I don't think your theory is too far fetched as others believe.

       If you THINK about it, you can see how this event works in trumps favor. Then you can deduce that if trump could pull this off, he most likely would. That's it, that's as far as the THEORY can go. If you really need evidence why don't you just try thinking outside the box instead of following the mainstream narrative.
I never once said this is what trump did, or if it's even likely. Just that when such an obvious false flag happens to work in trumps favor... It's just a possibility.

       Yeah, thats just about the craziest thing Ive read today, but if it calms you man, you do you. Trump has no pull with the deepstate, whatsoever.. that is evident when you see how hard they try to take him down.

       That's the craziest thing you read today, yet you believe in some spectre deep state entity that controls the world at a global level? I must be totally fucking bonkers to suggest a very rich many to pay a few actors and an assassin to pulls off a scheme that would very directly, and significantly help his agenda?
      </p>
      <p>
       The rational thing to think is that the people who have acquired elite status and power in this nation want to uproot it and undermine it for their own political gain. Despite the fact that they're already at the top and essentially above the law. But yeah, this is totally a gun grab to further the socialist agenda that puts the elite in a position that's less secure than the position they're in now. That makes total sense.

       You have absolutely nothing to give credibility to your insane claim, Yeah, a deep state thats done this for years, VS one man with literally the rest of the worlds eyes on him. Yeah you are bonkers man. I do not believe its a gun grab either, no way would a ploitician manage to get a hold of 100milllion guns. Its just out of the question.
Furthermore, how does this significantly help trump’s agenda?

       Again you are holding others to a standard that you do not hold yourself to so I ask, again, when are you going to start providing actual evidence of your claims?
