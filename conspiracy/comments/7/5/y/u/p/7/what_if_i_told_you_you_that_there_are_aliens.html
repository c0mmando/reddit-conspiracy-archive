<p>Would you say yes? Would you say no?</p>

<p>Ask your friends this question, remember this question for the rest of forever, I have a belief that if enough people/a large enough percentage of people agree, I believe there is something out there ready to help. </p>

<p>Would you be okay if Aliens were to come to earth and show us a proper path, even if it was tough?</p>

Not 2 minutes later a UFO that looked like a huge ball of fire came horizontal across the sky. No tail like a meteor, it was going slow! Then a minute later another one. Everyone in the park say it. One guy commented &quot;if that&#39;s a plane it&#39;s completely on fire&quot;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. The situation I am presenting would be one where they don&#39;t truly show themselves, they speak to each individual personally and tell them how they could help, etc, maybe they help heal people who have medical conditions they can heal, etc. </p>

<p>If they come and are glorified, oh hell nah I agree with you man, but if they try to make sure everyone is aware before showing themselves, then I think it would be different, if this happened the government would likely immediately try to say they are hostile, or that its not aliens and that its Russia/NK.</p>

Unfortunately I find no reviews worth anything....</p>

<p>but, the Aliens are communicating telepathically and the question comes up that the answers we are getting are from a &quot;dead race&quot; who made an algorithm a billion years old...</p>

<p>Anyway, it is brought up that humans have invested 60 million years to get to this &#39;end&#39; so alien intervention fundamentally upsets our destiny...</p>

<p>The USA promotes this idea and the installation at Ulan Bator (China) is bombed, but not without USA building it&#39;s own...</p>
