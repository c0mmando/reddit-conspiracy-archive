<p>I acknowledge that there is a certain political correctness in standing and acknowledging the flag, but it play a vital role in cultural evolution bc, from here, we can either evolve as one America or we can branch off into our identity groups. </p>

<p>The biggest difference is that honoring the flag as a high order cultural mechanism to unite people is a lot more important and significant than making a tiny percentage of mentally ill people feel good.</p>

<p>The flag doesn&#39;t unite people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It unites people that grateful for their culture and their heritage. It unites the people who thank God every day they were born here and who try to live up to their ancestors that came before them and built everything we have today. It represents the long history of struggle and war and bloodshed that made this country what it is.</p>

<p>To people who are ungrateful and unfulfilled, it&#39;s a bitter symbol because so many others have succeeded under that flag where they have failed. To people who are losers and can&#39;t start their own business and become successful themselves, it represents the &quot;oppressive force of capitalism&quot;. To people who are weak, herd animals, it represents a spirit of rugged individualism that terrifies the pussified socialist mindset. So I could understand why you hate our flag and country. I bet you make $20 bucks an hour cleaning toilets or something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All it does is give people a reason to hate others and separate groups into &quot;us&quot; and &quot;not us&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is life. There will ALWAYS be &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;. This is completely unavoidable and part of human nature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s ability to &quot;unite people&quot; is just bullshit used to spread nationalism and control populations through nationalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it successfully controls populations, then you are admitting that it does have practical social utility. </p>

<p>How about gay rights,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think embracing gay culture is one of the worst things that ever happened to America. I used to be super leftist and go to the gay pride parades every year. But as the years went on, I saw it become more and more sexually degenerate. 10 years ago, you did not see kids at those events at all. Two years ago I saw a little boy, shirtless and in jean shorts dancing in the middle of a circle of gay men wearing bondage get up. I was so disgusted I had to leave and will now do everything I can to stop those disgusting parades.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no coincidence that not even 5 years after allowing gay marriage to pass, all this trans-weirdo psychosis is coming to the forefront. I used to laugh at the really Christian dude on my block that said, &quot;When we accept gay marriage, next there will be polygamy, then there will be bestiality, and eventually there will be pedophilia.&quot; This guy couldn&#39;t even comprehend the trans-bullshit at the time. I thought this guy was a raging bigot and I mocked him for using the &quot;Slippery slope&quot; fallacy. 20 years later I realize he&#39;s completely right.</p>

<p>We need to stop the homosexual agenda at all costs otherwise our society will continue to fall apart like it has been. There is an evolutionary reason that gayness is not acceptable across almost every culture in the world accept America and Western Europe. It&#39;s because it erodes the moral fabric of society and creates the &quot;Anything goes&quot; hedonistic moral structure which always collapses. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the common idea of Christianity today as some communist utopia idea where Jesus just wanted everyone to accept everyone and anyone into their house is completely false. The establishment uses Jesus message of love to make it seem as if we should love everyone unconditionally. I didn&#39;t realize how wrong this was until i started reading the normal bible as well as all the early christian texts that were intentionally left out of the Bible.</p>

<p>For instance, Jesus actually beat the shit out of money changing Jews that were exploiting his people. He dragged them out of the temple and kicked their asses to the curb. In the gospel of Thomas Jesus says &quot;blessed is he who knows when the robbers are coming. For he can gather his estate, arm himself and be ready when they come.&quot;</p>

<p>The real Jesus was loving but he was also a warrior. The Bible says &quot;love thy neighbor&quot; it doesn&#39;t say &quot;love everyone regardless of whether or not they pose a threat to your way of life.&quot; That&#39;s what is meant by &quot;leave unto Cesar what is cesars&quot;. Religion and Christianity guide the morals within a group but when the war has to start, Cesar is on charge, not Jesus and this is expressly stated.</p>

<p>I completely agree that the Catholic Church should be disbanned. The fucking Pope is a pederast just like these Hollywood sickos. The entire Catholic denomination gives all of Christianity a terrible name. Sicko Pedo-Priests are STILL being protected.

<p>No shit. But it wasn&#39;t forced down everyone&#39;s throat. It wasn&#39;t made a mandatory thing you had to believe or you&#39;d be marginalized and called a &quot;racist Nazi&quot;. It never got to the point where half the country wanted these trans people (by definition mentally unstable people) in bathrooms with (potentially) young girls. We&#39;ve lost any sort of solid moral foundation and have crossed into an &quot;Anything goes&quot; hedonistic &quot;no one can be wrong&quot; society.

<blockquote>

<p>Any kind of Christianity (or any other religion/ideology) that crosses over from being a moral guide to being an abusive tool of power should be disbanned. That means Catholicism for sure. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s something they disagree with they aren&#39;t saying that nobody should be allowed to kneel ever. Arguing or disagreeing with something isn&#39;t PC, it is stopping people from expressing themselves via social ostracism or outright censorship that&#39;s why the moral outrage of the Christian Right is the most similar thing to leftist SJWs. Otherwise you could just say that being pro life was the right&#39;s version of PC. If the right call for taking a knee to be banned then that&#39;s PC. The term originated during Mao&#39;s cultural revolution in China which is obviously far left. Nobody on the right at the moment is calling for the end of free speech because people can be offended by it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s still not the same though. They are still not saying you don&#39;t have the right to say it. Again, the better example would be the right trying to ban music or art because it corrupts. You seem to think of it as moral positions, political correctness is ultimately censorship. The people you were arguing against weren&#39;t censoring you. If they would&#39;ve said &quot;nobody should ever be able to hear this point of view as it would corrupt people&quot; then that would be the right&#39;s version of PC</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s still not the same. They are saying as a result of you having that opinion that you should find another country to live in. They are still not calling for you to never be able to express that opinion or be outlawed from saying it. It&#39;s quite a clear distinction. To be clear, I would say that on most issues I would lean towards what most would regard as the left and I don&#39;t agree with people saying you should leave for expressing an opinion but they are still different from saying you should be banned from speaking out at all</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Political correctness is just an ideology. It&#39;s a belief system.</p>

<p>Think of it like a coin with 2 sides. People are basically forced to flip the coin and take a side based on their political leanings.</p>

<p>The left takes the side of being &#39;correct&#39; while the right is forced to take the &#39;incorrect&#39; side.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all bullshit. Who determines what is or isn&#39;t correct? It comes down to forcing people to adhere to a set of rules written by people who aren&#39;t out to protect minorities, they just use them as political footballs and ways to build their careers. Most of the people who came up with this stuff weren&#39;t minorities, they were wealthy academics protecting their own self interests.</p>

<p>Seems like this is what both the left and the right want,</p>

<p>When the right wants everyone to stand for the flag, it&#39;s because that&#39;s the moment we acknowledge a principle higher than race or gender. That&#39;s the moment we are all american. </p>

<p>If the Left gets rid of that successfully, than, yes, we will all just divide into racial groups. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that the common idea of Christianity today as some communist utopia idea where Jesus just wanted everyone to accept everyone and anyone into their house is completely false. The establishment uses Jesus message of love to make it seem as if we should love everyone unconditionally. I didn&#39;t realize how wrong this was until i started reading the normal bible as well as all the early christian texts that were intentionally left out of the Bible.</p>

<p>For instance, Jesus actually beat the shit out of money changing Jews that were exploiting his people. He dragged them out of the temple and kicked their asses to the curb. In the gospel of Thomas Jesus says &quot;blessed is he who knows when the robbers are coming. For he can gather his estate, arm himself and be ready when they come.&quot;</p>

<p>The real Jesus was loving but he was also a warrior. The Bible says &quot;love thy neighbor&quot; it doesn&#39;t say &quot;love everyone regardless of whether or not they pose a threat to your way of life.&quot; That&#39;s what is meant by &quot;leave unto Cesar what is cesars&quot;. Religion and Christianity guide the morals within a group but when the war has to start, Cesar is on charge, not Jesus and this is expressly stated.</p>
