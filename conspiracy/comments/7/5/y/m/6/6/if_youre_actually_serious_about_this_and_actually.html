       We are all in this together, whether we are from the farthest fringe or the steepest partisanship. We should have the singular goal of bettering our circumstance for ourselves and the next generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should end this debt cycle and the predatory banking practices that lock humans into indentured servitude. Destroy the police fine loops that only target the destitute. Build a world where humanism is preferred over group fighting. The two party system cannot contain the vast complexities of the human soul, and it's become painfully obvious this year of the disconnect between our government, media, and the actual people on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't let partisanship divide you. Accept that both sides are equally corrupted sides of a very old and powerful coin.
      </p>
      <p>
       Call out all abusers of power whether they champion the blue donkey or red elephant. Don't bash others for going against your chosen delegates, accept that it is time for a new crop of politicians. It is time for us to destabilize their corporate interests by invading them. Discovering their back channels and exposing them, it is the only way our movement could continue to work, which is why they are shifting the message to push for infighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could be the greatest bipartisan effort in the history of our sad country, but it will stagnate if we only choose to argue about what is acceptable from the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the time we work to rid the country of predatory abusers and actually make this land for the fucking people. Let's protect the abused of all statures and colors, let's actually work to build this system where the accused is innocent until proven guilty whenever they are the David against the Goliath of a corporation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every political post may have truth to it, but it's language is propaganda laden to push you towards their group think.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're serious you'll learn to work with your chosen enemy for the sake of the country, not your ideology. Call out the generalizations, hyperbolic vitriolic statements that belittle the act of Investigation, but stay focused because those users cannot go three comments without resorting to calling you a name or attempting to rouse others into questioning your intelligence. Don't fall for the 4chan hyperbolic bait, just call them out on it and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they have large sums of money that could easily be held over someone in destitution and they are within a position of power to abuse that, they should be examined. I no longer question this anymore, it's gotten to the point where we are so divided between us and our ruling class that we are painfully oblivious to the power they actually have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump, Bill Clinton, Weinstein, Epstein, and the ones who helped develop bitcoin (I shouldn't even need to name a name for this one) for the nefarious shit they look at and traffic. Keep investigating them all, because we are going to be unraveling this sweater for a long time. It's a game of attrition not force.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love each and everyone of you, you're at least trying to discover a path through this ideological, cultural, and propaganda heavy hell everyday. Don't give up and do not give in, they shut Bill Cooper down and they will shut down any person who drifts to close to their plans. They can't stop all of us though.

       I second this. We need to rise above the racial and political sandbox they have laid out for us to squabble in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop fighting each other, and start punching up. Go after the untouchables. Learn the names of the members of the Twelve Families. Learn what corporations, religions and world organizations they own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bring their darkness into the light. Make them into memes. Make fun of them, laugh at them, ridicule and deride them, as theyâ€™ve mocked us, through centuries of torture, rape and impoverishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep your heart full and your energy high. Try to find a way to decompress, to laugh and smile as you expose their darkness. Realizing the depths of their crimes can put you in a dark place, and it is meant to. Focus on your passion for justice and the pursuit of the truth, and let it fuel you to never stop digging. Not until every last criminal sociopath is exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for this, OP. We need the reminder to stay focused and not be distracted by Operation Mockingbird.
