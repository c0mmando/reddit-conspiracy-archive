<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>9/11 continues to rank as the most significant historical event for the vast majority of Americans:</p>

<p><a href="http://time.com/4602036/pew-significant-historic-events-americans-lifetimes/">http://time.com/4602036/pew-significant-historic-events-americans-lifetimes/</a></p>

<p>Most of us can remember where we were when 9/11 happened, and its lasting impact is unquestionable.</p>

<p>Since 9/11 there clearly have been other historical events that have had great impact on Americans, many of which, unfortunately, are mass shootings. For me, personally, Sandy Hook left a mark on my psyche, especially since there still remains many unanswered questions.</p>

<p>When I have browsed <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> the past few weeks, nearly every thread has been related to the Vegas shooting in some way. While that is not entirely unusual, it had me thinking. This shooting has had had a deep psychological impact on the nation. 
You may say, of course, it <em>is</em> pretty devastating, but I think this goes even deeper than that. I feel a larger part of these mass shootings are a means for psychological warfare, and I wanted to discuss that in my post.</p>

<p>This post’s intentions are not to debate about the events of the Las Vegas incident. Every other thread on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a place to do that right now. Rather, I wanted to discuss how it’s possible that these shootings serve a larger, psychological purpose and agenda. Whatever you believe about the Vegas shootings, there is no denial that are nation is traumatized at this moment. Whether this is intentionally planned or not is up to you decide.</p>

<p><em>Dwight D. Eisenhower said, “In this war, which was total in every sense of the word, we have seen many great changes in military science. It seems to me that not the least of these was the development of psychological warfare as a specific and effective weapon.</em></p>

<p><em>**Note: I do intertwine my personal experiences throughout this post, but I do that because it helps me connect with what I am writing. It helps me write from a more personalized, less desensitized perspective (which I&#39;ll discuss later!)</em>*</p>

<p><strong>Psychological Warfare and Trauma</strong></p>

<p>What is psychological warfare? First, from Wikipedia:</p>

<p>Psychological warfare (PSYWAR), or the basic aspects of modern psychological operations (PSYOP), have been known by many other names or terms, including MISO, Psy Ops, political warfare, &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot;, and propaganda.[1] The term is used &quot;to denote any action which is practiced mainly by psychological methods with the aim of evoking a planned psychological reaction in other people&quot;.[2] Various techniques are used, and are aimed at influencing a target audience&#39;s value system, belief system, emotions, motives, reasoning, or behavior. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_warfare</a></p>

<p>It is important to note that information warfare can be a type of psychological warfare:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Eburnsm/InfoWarfare.html">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~burnsm/InfoWarfare.html</a></p>

<p>It would be impossible to discuss all aspects of psychological warfare here, but here is a great website about the development of psychological warfare during WWII:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hoover.org/library-archives/collections/propaganda-psychological-warfare">https://www.hoover.org/library-archives/collections/propaganda-psychological-warfare</a></p>

<p>While there may be debate about what encompasses psychological warfare at times, essentially, it is something that evokes a psychological reaction in other people, and often, this psychological reaction is some sort of trauma.</p>

<p>Trauma is simply defined as a deeply distressing or disturbing experience.</p>

<p>While it is no surprise that Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is on the rise, particularly in veterans,(<a href="https://medlineplus.gov/magazine/issues/winter09/articles/winter09pg10-14.html">https://medlineplus.gov/magazine/issues/winter09/articles/winter09pg10-14.html</a>), I ‘d like to argue that we are underestimating the trauma we may experience daily when browsing the internet even (I’m not kidding).</p>

<p>There is this perception that trauma has to be a result of something physical or even a real life experience, but that simply is not the case. Trauma often occurs when:</p>

<p>• The individual was unprepared for the event
• The event occurred out of the blue
• The person felt powerless to prevent the event
• The event involved extreme cruelty</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cascadebh.com/behavioral/trauma/signs-symptoms-effects">http://www.cascadebh.com/behavioral/trauma/signs-symptoms-effects</a></p>

<p>As we step back and look at the Vegas shootings, most of us were unprepared (though some claim to have predicted it). Many of us feel powerless, and there is no doubt that this event involved extreme cruelty.</p>

<p>When we think of trauma, we usually think of individual cases of trauma. For example, I have written extensively about traumatic experiences in my life, and I escaped a physically abusive relationship. While I do not want to speak for all victims of abuse, I wanted to note that the emotional trauma I have been left with seems to be more powerful than the physical abuse I suffered (though I am not really sure I can actually completely separate the emotional and physical abuse). To clarify, I became numb to the beatings I received, but the emotional trauma left deep scars in my psyche, some of which persist to this day. I understand that this is not necessarily a comfortable subject, but I’m willing to answer any questions about my former abuse (from relationships and childhood). It is one reason that I became so interested in understanding the evil of the world in the first placed.</p>

<p>The point I am trying to make is that I think we underestimate our emotions as we are bombarded by information from these events. Many of you may claim that you feel nothing, and it was just another event, but I think that is an indication of another problem altogether.</p>

<p><strong>Desensitization and Coping Mechanisms</strong></p>

<p>I have written much about desensitization in our society, but after this event, it made me realize just how desensitized we really are. </p>

<p>I found it interesting that so many had no problem viewing the shootings online, commenting nonchalantly on youtube or Reddit or whatever. I am not criticizing you if you have done this, I am just intrigued. In the investigation for truth, we must sometimes expose ourselves to evil and horrible things, but I want you to stop and think for a moment. It is pretty crazy that we live in a time where we can literally watch people die live. I mean, there is an entire subreddit devoted to watching people die.</p>

<p>Again, this post is not to criticize any person – I have watched my fair share of gruesome events online. Rather, it seems many of us are desensitized, but this is where the important part comes in. Desensitization is a coping mechanism, and it is not necessarily a healthy one. In some situations, desensitization is a survival mechanism:</p>

<p>“Humans deal with traumatic events in their lives in all sorts of ways. The ways people use to “deal” with these events are called defense mechanisms. In The Day Nina Simone Stopped Singing, the main character, Darina, uses a defense mechanism of desensitization to emotionally survive the war in Lebanon.  Desensitizing oneself means to “extinguish an emotional response to stimuli that formerly induced it” (“desensitize”). Examples of Darina’s numbed emotions are shown many times throughout the novel. It becomes very prominent when she discusses her sex life, childhood punishments, the death of friends and family, and during a of Russian Roulette.”</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.ecu.edu/sites/genderpoliticsculture/blog/2012/04/27/desensitizing-oneself-as-a-defense-mechanism-against-the-cruel-realities-of-war/">https://blog.ecu.edu/sites/genderpoliticsculture/blog/2012/04/27/desensitizing-oneself-as-a-defense-mechanism-against-the-cruel-realities-of-war/</a></p>

<p>However, most of us (Americans) are not experiencing physical war on a daily basis. Further, I am thankful that most cannot necessarily relate to the trauma that I experienced with my ex-boyfriend or childhood.</p>

<p>Still, that is where people miss the point. Perhaps we are not dealing with physical warfare daily, but we are undoubtedly experience psychological and informational warfare on a daily basis. Information warfare is <em>still</em> warfare:</p>

<p>Lt. Col Jon Hermann explains, “That said, if we look to U.S. conflicts (Vietnam, Somalia, etc.) ended by lack of public support, we must acknowledge that losing the information war means losing the war. Intelligence is not warfare- but information warfare is.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2016/12/08/information_warfare_is_warfare_110457.html">https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2016/12/08/information_warfare_is_warfare_110457.html</a></p>

<p>It would be impossible to deny that we are all experiencing some type of informational or psychological warfare on a daily basis, and some experience it more or less than others, especially depending how much we choose to subjugate ourselves to it on a daily basis.</p>

<p>When a mass shooting like this happens though, every person in the nation is impacted by it in some way. Again, for those who claim not to be, I would say that’s just a result of desensitization over time – and while many may pride themselves on the ability to watch people die online and not shed a tear, it is important to note that not all coping mechanisms are ‘good’ for you. </p>

<p>Many of us have lost the ability to empathize, to truly feel for the loss of another human being, and maybe that is purposeful, and just another component of psychological warfare itself. Perhaps that is why we are bombarded with violence and sex in the media, so that ultimately, nothing seems ‘wrong’ and we grow comfortably numb over time.</p>

<p>There are thousands of studies on the impact of violence in video games and other media on children (and people in general). Studies show that exposure to violence in the media may have the following effects:</p>

<p>• Children become less sensitive to the pain and suffering of others.
• Children may be more fearful of the world around them.
• Children may be more likely to behave in aggressive or harmful ways toward others.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apa.org/action/resources/research-in-action/protect.aspx">http://www.apa.org/action/resources/research-in-action/protect.aspx</a></p>

<p>Now think about exposure on a larger scale. The more we are exposed to these traumatizing events such as the Vegas shootings, the more we may become less sensitive to the pain and suffering of others. The more we may be fear of the world around us. I wouldn’t be surprised if it caused some to become more aggressive or harmful, which may encourage “copy-cat’ incidents:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat_crime">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat_crime</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s important to note that I used children because think about the fact that children right now are digesting the events. How will they cope with them over time?</p>

<p>Does this all feel coincidental to you, or do you think there is a larger, more organized plan to psychologically traumatize citizens of this country?</p>

<p><strong>What’s the End Game?</strong></p>

<p>So, let’s just say that there really is a larger, psychological conspiracy behind all of these events. The question is always <em>why?</em> I have some ideas:</p>

<p>*A More Fearful Nation: Psychological trauma causes fear, as noted earlier. Much has been written about this topic, but I feel this article says it best:</p>

<p>&quot;This language of fear has given rise to a politics of fear whose only aim is to distract and divide us. In this way, we have been discouraged from thinking analytically and believing that we have any part to play in solving the problems before us. Instead, we have been conditioned to point the finger at the other person or vote for this politician or support this group, because they are the ones who will fix it. Except that they can’t and won’t fix the problems plaguing our communities.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-w-whitehead/politics-of-fear-america_b_1922963.html">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-w-whitehead/politics-of-fear-america_b_1922963.html</a></p>

<p>When we are fearful, we are not thinking clearly. We may act out of fear instead of reason, and it is easier to point the finger than to have a discussion. Fear is a weapon. </p>

<p>I know with my abuser, fear is what kept me in the abusive relationship in the first place. </p>

<p>Further, fear divides us as a nation, and we all know divide and conquer as a real warfare tactic. </p>

<p>*A Numb Nation: This goes back to desensitization. The more we are desensitized, the less we care. The more these events happen, the less they will impact us. If we are less impacted, we may be less willing to speak up about political decisions being made surrounding these events.</p>

<p>When there is SO much information coming at us, it is hard to decide what is important, and what we should invest our energy on. Our desensitized minds may have carefully choose what to actually care about. We are fatigued by the news.</p>

<p>From “Information Overload, Paradigm Overload”:</p>

<p>“The struggle for comprehension was evident when James Gleick, author of The Information reviewed here, came to talk at the Royal Society of Arts in London in April. Moderator Nico McDonald asked whether the rapidly changing scales, velocities and characteristics of information were creating ‘information overload, paradigm underload’. Without a paradigm to understand the present, how can policy be made for the future?”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/articles/communication-and-culture/information-overload-paradigm-underload-internet-and-political-di">http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/articles/communication-and-culture/information-overload-paradigm-underload-internet-and-political-di</a></p>

<p>With all this information, do we have the ability to make good decisions about political affairs? Do we have time to develop paradigms based on logic, reason, and fact? Do we have the time or ability to even make decisions anymore, or are our opinions buried under endless amounts of words that seem to lose meaning after a while?</p>

<p>*A Safer Nation? This goes back to fear. Will people ultimately choose safety over liberty? Is that already happening? This is a classic argument, so I do not think I will go much further with it.</p>

<p>In Brave New World, people have chosen security over freedom in many ways. One of the prominent themes of the novel is that people have lost their ability to be unhappy. I like this quote:</p>

<p>““God isn&#39;t compatible with machinery and scientific medicine and universal happiness. You must make a choice. Our civilization has chosen machinery and medicine and happiness.” </p>

<p>― Aldous Huxley, Brave New World”</p>

<p>Psychological warfare pushes us to give up our freedoms – even our emotional freedom in a way. Going back to my own experience, I have lost some of my emotional freedom, and for a while, even my physical freedom. For a few years, I had severe anxiety attacks while driving because I was often beaten in my car. (I am in a much better place now – I had to gain back my freedom…from him!)</p>

<p>Are we willingly (or even unwillingly) giving up freedoms due to psychological trauma we do not even know we are experiencing?</p>

<p><strong>The Power of Closure</strong></p>

<p>One thing I never had with my ex was closure, and I’m sure many of you can relate to that. Even if not thinking of a romantic relationship, many of us have had situations in our lives where we never experienced closure. Some of us still struggle with forgiveness or are still in the process of coping with those situations, big or small.</p>

<p>No matter how many posts are made on this forum about the Vegas shootings, there ultimately seems to be little closure. People are divided over the details of the shooting, and we will likely never know the final truth of this event. Time will pass, and the Vegas shootings will still have had a psychological impact on us that remains, but there will never be the closure we need.</p>

<p>Think about the JFK shootings. To this day, there is still no consensus about what really happened. Even 9/11 truth movements still persist, yet the nation remains divided.</p>

<p>This is the ultimate psychological tactic, I think. I always waited and waited for my abusers in life to say sorry (even my own parents!), but they never have and they never will. There is an emptiness there. </p>

<p>As I scroll through conspiracy daily, sometimes I feel that emptiness. It feels like we are all shouting, yet I’m not sure if anybody can really hear us.</p>

<p>I don’t want to end this on an entirely depressing note. I know not all of you are spiritual or believe what I do, but this verse gives me great comfort:</p>

<p>For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open. (Luke 8:17)</p>

<p>I have faith that one day the truth will be revealed.</p>
