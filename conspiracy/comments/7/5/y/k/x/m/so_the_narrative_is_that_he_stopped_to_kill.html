        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If this becomes the official narrative, I think the LVPD needs to seriously re-look at their officers.</p>

<p>If a security guard coming into his room 5-6 minutes before shooting started, and the hotel security team was notified, why did police not take action?</p>

<p>Now - I come from a law enforcement family. My dad is retired FBI, my grandfather is retired local police of 40+ years. I have grown up around officers my entire life and have respect that they put themselves on the line for innocent bystanders. </p>

<p>Why did it take 80 minutes after he shot the security guard for an officer to get to the room? I completely understand having to take a tactical approach, and putting together a game plan, but you are telling me not a single officer was there watching people get mowed down and refused to take it upon himself to save innocent lives? If a security guard spooked him enough to go to town killing 58 people, then he obviously wasn&#39;t mentally stable and any officer with proper training would have been able to take the suspect down, while yes risking his own life - but potentially saving many. </p>

<p>If this is the narrative they are going to push (or not really push since this whole thing has disappeared from the MSM) it really concerns me on where these officers mind is. Are they officers in Vegas because all they deal with are drunks and perverts? They don&#39;t owe anyone putting their live on the line, however they do take an oath to protect and serve at all cost, even if that means taking the initiative to enter a room with a suspect shooting from 32 floors. </p>

<p>And I don&#39;t want to hear any of the LVPD say &quot;well he had cameras set up he would have seen us coming&quot; because that wasn&#39;t found until after the fact. That is unless someone already knew the set up. </p>

<p>Personally this whole thing is a scam to either distract us from other things, a failed FBI surveillance, or a true all out conspiracy  that Paddock didn&#39;t do any of it and is being set up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that&#39;s NOT the timeline they are giving us. </p>

<p>They have always said that LVMPD was at the 32nd floor at 10:17.</p>

<p>You can hear on the radio officers at 10:12 saying they are on the 31st and hear shots from the floor above.</p>

<p>So 20ish minutes, which maybe it should be faster, but the elevators were off and I believe they were checking floors on the way up to the 32nd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Police were not notified until after the shots at the crowd. Which is troubling.</p>

<p>Paddock was an old man. He wasn&#39;t going to hold off police or swat. Shooting at the crowd meant his back was to the door. The status of his cameras was unknown, but checking them while firing non-stop would have been an issue. Paddocks internal clock was at 20 minutes since he shot the guard, that&#39;s about as much time as you could estimate before they were going to knock down the doors. He felt the pressure and killed himself. Campos forcing him to start before he was ready might have been a factor. </p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t going to kill more then 1-2 police officers, he couldn&#39;t shoot at the crowd with police at his door, his rampage was over, he killed himself. He might have had a few more minutes, police were only at the 31st floor. But the idea he was going to hold off police and get into a firefight, no way. He had no training, swat would eat his ass up. And the risk is he gets shot, doesn&#39;t die, gets sent to jail and fucked like a ragdoll for the rest of his life. </p>

<p>As for the wait, the shooting stopped. They were trying to figure out what he was doing, secure the area, get people in place. A helicopter IR would see his body lying prone, losing heat, they probably knew he was dead. They were just worried about explosives/traps maybe. But I&#39;m fairly sure they knew the threat was over, they were just being careful. If Paddock was still shooting, I have no doubt they would have rushed his room. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of this narrative makes sense to me, it seems the most plausible. But I&#39;m still not clear why the security guard arrived at his door, was the security guard working for the hotel or not, and why did the hotel not call the police as soon as shots were fired?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The security guard was checking an open door down the hall from the shooter.  The shooter saw security guard poking around in the hallway with his hallway camera and grew suspicious/nervous and shot at him (down the hallway), either to kill him or at least scare him off so he could start his plan.  </p>

<p>Seems like police arrived on the scene while the shooting was still ongoing, but it stopped soon after, so they were obviously called pretty soon after the hallway shots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The official narrative is that the cops got there in about 15 minutes after the shooting out the window began. Paddock stopped firing, which is why they didn&#39;t storm the room immediately and instead waited and took more precautions. That&#39;s why it was 80 minutes and not the 15 it took for them to arrive at the door.</p>
