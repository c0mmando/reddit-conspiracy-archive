        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was over at a friends house last week for our hour lunch break and his family was home. One of the children was a shy five or six year old boy, as we all ate we started to have conversations about various topics. Eventually we all began talking about the video games we like to play. The shy kid began to open up and talk about the games he liked to play. Then he mentioned Pokemon go and then I told him about the old gameboys and how he could play them with an emulator on his smart phone. </p>

<p>He began to want to search for it and I thought he was typing. He kept asking me to repeat gameboy emulator. I asked him if he had found results on google play. He admitted then that he did not know how to spell or write words yet. He clicked on the mic and spoke &quot;gameboy emulator&quot; and it found it. </p>

<p>He is a modern American first world child. It&#39;s completely reasonable to assume he is young enough and hasn&#39;t learned reading or writing yet. But it goes much deeper than one particular child. It&#39;s a foretelling of a much greater issue that will affect our &quot;connected&quot; world and the future of our children and their children.</p>

<p>An illiterate population is a weak population. Illiteracy disadvantages you in every way: socially, financially, economically. You are more likely to be poorer and increases the rate of incarceration dramatically. </p>

<p>Will the rich families be illiterate? I think not.  Cell phones just might be far more insidious then I have given them credit. I have witnessed one example what the future holds if we lose true education. Multiply one child who has yet to learn to read but still has access and does not understand what he is missing, by a generation of future adults who may never learn or understand writing if voice recognition make it unnecessary.  A population easily guided by the invisible hand of oligarchs in whatever direction. </p>

<p>Our children deserve a better future</p>

<p>Read to your children, read to your grandchildren, read to your brothers and sisters, your nieces and nephews.</p>

<p>I think literacy is slowly dying and I think the oligarchs would be fine with the masses losing literacy and intellect. I think technology will accelerate the loss and destruction of words     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have made myself perfectly clear. I have taken account of the possibility that he doesn&#39;t yet know how to read, this is an extrapolation of the future based on a trend that I have been witnessing. not just with this one child or family I see it in many children and families.</p>

<p>Are you attempting to derail the conversation? </p>

<p>I run a small video game design charter program, and we get to read things like WWZ and Starship Troopers in our program, and I can&#39;t even get the bulk of the kids to read or write about those books. </p>

<p>They come to me like this, so the failure is in the lower grades, sadly. </p>
