        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have compiled detailed Primary Sources about Christopher Columbus&#39; treatment of Taino People. Please read the entire thing before responding, if you are in support of him. Most people who support Columbus Day do not know much about it let alone have heard of the word Taino. </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Columbus - </p>

<p><em>”They traded with us and gave us everything they had, with good will ... they took great delight in pleasing us ... They are very gentle and without knowledge of what is evil; nor do they murder or steal...Your highness may believe that in all the world there can be no better people ... They love their neighbours as themselves, and they have the sweetest talk in the world, and are gentle and always laughing.”</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>&quot;These people are very unskilled in arms; with 50 men they could all be subjected and made to do all that one wished.”</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<h2></h2>

<p>Bartolome De las Casas - </p>

<p><em>&quot;A boat could sail from the Bahamas to Haiti without a compass or chart, guiding itself solely by the Trail of the dead Indians who had been thrown from the ships.&quot;</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>&quot;The Spaniards forced their way into Native settlements, slaughtering everyone they found there, including small children, old men, pregnant women, and even women who had just given birth. They hacked them to pieces, slicing open their bellies with their swords as though they were so many sheep herded into a pen. They even laid wagers on whether they could manage to slice a man in two at a stroke, or cut an individual?s head from his body, or disembowel him with a single blow of their axes. They grabbed suckling infants by the feet and, ripping them from their mothers breasts, dashed them headlong against the rocks.&quot;</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>&quot;All those who could do so took to the hills and mountains in order to escape the clutches of these merciless and inhuman butchers, these mortal enemies of human kind trained hunting dogs to track them down. Wild dogs who would savage a Native to death as soon as look at him, tearing him to shreds and devouring his flesh as though we were a pig.&quot;</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>“They spared no one, erecting especially wide gibbets on which they could string their victims up with their feet just off the ground and then burn them alive.”</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>“Yet another member of the governor?s party galloped about cutting the legs off all the children as they law sprawling on the ground.”</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>“Indeed they invented so many new methods of murder that it would be quite impossible to set them all down on paper.”</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>“Not a single Native of the Island committed a capital offense, as defined in law, against the Spanish while all this time the Natives themselves were being savaged and murdered.&quot;</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>&quot;Both women and men were given only wild grass to eat and other unnutritions foodstuffs. The mothers of young children promptly saw their milk dry up.&quot;</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>&quot;During the three or four months I was there, more than seven thousand children died of hunger, after their parents had been shipped off to the mines.&quot;</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>&quot;A Spaniard who was out hunting deer or rabbits realized that his dogs were hungry and not finding anything they could hunt, took a little boy from his mother, cut his arms and legs into chunks with his knife and distributed them among his dogs.&quot;</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>&quot;He sent fifty men on horseback who proceeded to annihilate the entire population of an area greater than the county of Roussillon, sparing not a single man or woman, old man, or child, and this they did on the flimsiest of pretexts, accusing their victims of not coming quickly enough when they were summoned, or of not having brought enough cargas of maize or of not surrendering sufficient of their kinsmen as slaves either to the governor himself or to one or another of his henchmen. These men were driven by the Devil and not a single Native managed to escape, what with the land being as flat as it was and the Spaniards having horses.&quot;</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>&quot;They cut his head from his shoulders so they would not have to break the chains that held the line of prisoners together and his head would fall to one side of the baggage train and his trunk to the other.&quot;</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>&quot;After a day or two had gone by, several victims surfaced, soaked from head to foot in the blood of their fellows beneath whose bodies they had sheltered and, with tears in their eyes, pleaded for their lives, but the Spaniards showed them no mercy nor any compassion, and no sooner did they crawl out from under the pile of corpses than they were butchered. The Spanish commander gave orders that the leading citizens, who numbered over a hundred and were roped together, were to be tied to stakes set in the ground and burned alive.&quot;</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>&quot;During these eleven years, more than two million souls have perished and, in an area of more than a hundred leagues by a hundred leagues, only two thousand survivors are to be seen, and even this number is shrinking day by day as the survivors succumb to the rigours of a life of slavery.&quot;</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>&quot;Once the Natives saw that their deep humility, generosity and submissiveness did nothing to soften the hearts of these ravening beasts, and that the Spaniards were prepared to hack them to pieces for absolutely no reason whatever, they decided that although they stood no chance of defeating ferocious enemies who were on horseback and were armed to the teeth, they might as well die as men in defense of their homes, avenging themselves on their wicked and hellish enemies, even though they were well aware that, weak as they were, on foot and unarmed, they were doomed to die whatever they did.&quot;</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>&quot;One of his officers was responsible for the indiscriminate slaughter of many locals, hanging some, burning others alive, and throwing yet others to wild dogs, sometimes sawing off their hands and feet, sometimes pulling out their tongues or hacking off their heads. Even though the locals never raised a finger against the Spaniards, the distinguished commander knowingly allowed this spate of atrocities to continue unchecked, directed as it was to terrorizing the local people into doing his bidding and into brining him gifts of Gold or other precious objects.&quot;</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>&quot;A man would be invited to choose from among the fifty or a hundred young girls the one he most fancied and she would then be handed over in exchange for wine or oil or vinegar, or for a side of salt pork.&quot;</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>&quot;One woman, who was indisposed at the time and so not able to make good her escape, determined that the dogs should not tear her to pieces as they has done her neighbors and, taking a rope, and trying her one-year-old child to her leg, hanged herself from a beam. Yet she was not in time to prevent the dogs from ripping the infant to pieces.”</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>&quot;I testify that I saw with my own eyes Spaniards cutting off the hands, noses, and ears of local people, both men and women, simply for the fun of it, and that this happened time and again in various places through the region. On several occasions I also saw them set dogs on the people, many being torn to pieces in this fashion, and they also burned down houses and even whole settlements, too numerous to count.&quot;</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>&quot;They tortured him with the strappado, put burning tallow on his belly, pinned both his legs to poles with iron hoops and his neck with another and then, with two men holding his hands, proceeded to burn the soles of his feet. From time to time, the commander would look in and repeat that they would torture him to death slowly unless he produced more Gold.”</em></p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Columbus had them:</p>

<p>-grilled,</p>

<p>-cut up into pieces like sheep, </p>

<p>-run down by hunting dogs and torn to pieces, </p>

<p>-strung up and burned alive 13 at a time – in memory of Jesus and his 12 Apostles.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>They killed even women and children. Even babies: the Spanish threw babies against rocks and into rivers – and laughed. They cut off pieces of Tainos for entertainment. They cut off their heads for practice. They raped women and girls – and brought back syphilis to Europe. They even raped the wife of a king.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>The Spanish were kinder to their animals. If a Taino killed a Spaniard, the Spanish killed 100 Tainos in return. They killed Tainos by the thousands, even those who brought them food and gifts. They killed half the people of the kingdom of Maguana outright.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>After the killing fields, the Spanish divided the remaining Tainos among themselves to teach them the Christian faith:</p>

<p>-For Taino men that meant working in the mines, often being worked to death. As many as 90% died within in three months. 
-For Taino women that meant working the land, even the heavy work that men used to do.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>There was so little food that babies died for lack of milk. Children died of hunger by the thousands. Men were worked so hard in the mines that few children were born. Columbus demanded a certain amount gold or cotton from each Taino over the age of 13. Those who failed to meet his demands had their hands cut off. All this was shocking behaviour by Western standards of the time. </p>

<p>When there were no longer enough Taino workers left, the Spanish brought in African slaves to take their place.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>It was such a hell on earth that:</p>

<p>-Mothers killed their babies. -Mass suicides were common.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Many fled to the mountains, fighting the Spanish from there. Hatuey, one of the Taino kings of Cuba, told his people to throw their gold into the river: the Christians worshipped gold as their god and would kill them for it.
In 1512 when Hatuey was about to be burned at the stake, a Franciscan brother told him him about the Christian faith to save his soul. When Hatuey found out that most good Christians were going to Heaven, he chose Hell.</p>

<p>—</p>

<h2>Taino Queen Anacoana:</h2>

<p>In 1503 during a meeting of 80 caciques, including Anacaona, the Spanish Governor Nicolás de Ovando ordered the meeting house to be set on fire to burn them alive, similar to what centuries later occurred to Rigoberta Manchu&#39;s family in Guatemala. Cacica Anacaona and her Taíno noblemen were arrested — all accused of conspiracy for resisting occupation and executed.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Prior to her execution, Anacaona was offered clemency if she would give herself as concubine to one of the Spaniards which was common in the era. Standing with her fellow Taínos in solidarity, the Caribbean indigenous female leader (cacica) chose execution over colluding with her Spanish enemy, her refusal cementing her legend. Anacaona remained rebellious and independent until her violent public death.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Because Anacaona refused the sexual offer of the Spanish intruders while others were shot, Anacaona was executed by hanging at 29 years old.</p>

<p>After exploring the Caribbean, Columbus returned to the island of Hispaniola in 1498, known today as the Dominican Republic and Haiti. He had left his brothers Diego and Bartholomew in charge and according to Columbus, conditions had deteriorated in his absence. He decided to increase the terror campaign against the Taino people, ruling with excessive cruelty, causing resentment from the colonists and local indian chiefs alike. Complaints of his brutality reached the Spanish monarchs and in 1500 a Chief Justice was dispatched to bring him and his brothers back to Spain in chains. But Columbus was soon forgiven for his atrocities and granted a fourth and final expedition back to the island of Hispaniola. </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Upon his arrival Columbus conducted an unparalleled campaign of torture and mass murder. By the time he finally left the island in 1504, the Taino had been reduced from eight million down to 100,000, making Columbus the most prolific serial killer in human history. He and his men committed some of the cruelest atrocities against another race ever recorded. Columbus used any pretext as an excuse to kill and torture. Those poor souls who could not pay tribute to him had their hands cut off and were left to bleed to death. </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Columbus was documented by the chronicles of Las Casas, know as Brev’sima relaci-n, to have partaken in mass hangings, roasting people on spits, burnings at the stake, and hacking young children to death as punishment for the most minor of crimes. He and his men massacred the natives, sometimes hundreds at a time for sport, making bets on who could split a man in two, or cut a head off in one blow. By 1542 there were only 200 Taino remaining on the island and soon afterwords they were considered extinct.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>The Standard Rebuttals:</p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>BUT BUT DISEASE DID IT.</em></p>

<p>Answer: Defenders of Columbus argue that a large amount of the victims were killed by disease however they fail to recognize that most of these diseases were caused by poor living conditions in forced labour camps.  Deprived of their crops and fields, many fell prey to dysentery and typhus, were worked to death or were left to starve to death.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p><em>BUT BUT YOU WOULDN’T EXIST.</em></p>

<p>Answer: The Butterfly Effect comes from literally any event occurring, no matter how minute. One could make that same argument about Hitler, Mao, and Stalin never existing. Are their genocide&#39;s macro-events a good thing simply because they resulted in quintillions of micro-events that causing your parents getting together and making love? Of course not. With the Alternate Reality that would exist and infinite number of futures are possible both positive and negative. </p>

<h2></h2>

<p>So yes, what have you learned today?</p>

<p>Columbus was worse then ISIS.</p>

<p>If you support Columbus you are a Globalist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here you are. Your comment war removed from T_D while I was writing an essay. Couldn&#39;t post it and I felt no closure.</p>

<p>Here it is so I can be happy:</p>

<p>Your claim was that Columbus=Hitler and ISIS. False.</p>

<p>Hitler killed his own constituents. ISIS kill people who do not fight them. </p>

<p>You cannot compare people in 1492 to those in 1940 or 2017 with the more developed morality that we have today. </p>

<p>Also, the story is a lot more complex than &quot;Columbus invaded and genocided.&quot; Columbus and his crew killed people who were trying to kill them. Most of the dead (on both sides) were victims of diseases. </p>

<p>He was wildly outnumbered. 90 people were with him for the first voyage.  There were like a thousand Spaniards in 1500 and most of them were delirious/dying from various diseases, and were in a land none of them had ever seen before. What do you think they thought with hundreds of thousands, semi-hostile people around them? I&#39;d shit my pants.</p>

<p>Those hundreds of thousands of people were defeated in their home turf by 1000 outsiders, who had no knowledge of the land.</p>

<p>It&#39;s honestly pathetic and is in no way comparable to the atrocities you talk about.</p>

<p>Hitler and ISIS, absolute evils of their times.</p>

<p>Columbus in 1492? A pretty decent guy for his times. Outnumbered and had to do all he could to survive and for his homeland</p>

<p>But yeah, the simple story to you is that &quot;invaded and committed genocide&quot; so let&#39;s not celebrate his accomplished and, since we are at it, let&#39;s stop celebrating the Ancient Roman society for what they did in Carthage.</p>

<p>Same with me. I can&#39;t respond lol </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s true. Of course Columbus was worse then them because he was successful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hitler killed his own constituents. ISIS kill people who do not fight them.</p>

<p>SO DID COLUMBUS</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You cannot compare people in 1492 to those in 1940 or 2017 with the more developed morality that we have today.</p>

<p>Yes I can compare them. Columbus was seen as immoral in his own time. You obviously did not read my this topic post. Reread then get back to me!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, the story is a lot more complex than &quot;Columbus invaded and genocided.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Correct. I explained it in detail in the opening thread post.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Columbus and his crew killed people who were trying to kill them. </p>

<p>False.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the dead (on both sides) were victims of diseases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>False. Debunked in the opening post. Right at the end.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They weren&#39;t hostile. They gave them gifts and he left his first voyage on good terms. You don&#39;t know history lol. Just read the op!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Those hundreds of thousands of people were defeated in their home turf by 1000 outsiders, who had no knowledge of the land.</p>

<p>Defeated? They were invaded and genocided.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s honestly pathetic and is in no way comparable to the atrocities you talk about.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worse and you have no knowledge of history.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hitler and ISIS, absolute evils of their times.</p>

<p>As was Columbus. He genocided 8 million.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Columbus in 1492? A pretty decent guy for his times. </p>

<p>Are you insane? </p>

<p>Reread my entire OP post then get back to me. That response was just sad.</p>

<p>Many are arguing that attacking Columbus Day is an attack on white people. My argument is that it&#39;s a trick. He&#39;s just an evil dude.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a good judge of people who are making those arguments?? There are tons of articles on my favorite sites. Independent, Conservative, even Liberal that are defending Columbus. Yes it is a good indicator of reality. </p>
