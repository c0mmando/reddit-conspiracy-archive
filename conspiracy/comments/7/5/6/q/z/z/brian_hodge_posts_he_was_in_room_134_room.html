       According to Brian Hodges post on social media:
      </p>
      <p>
       His room is #134
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is the room with the far left broken window.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is he lying?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, his first post on social media was 1047pm, what time zone?
      </p>
      <p>
       If Vegas time than where was he when that post was made, bushes or room?
      </p>
      <p>
       If in room than thereâ€™s a whole can worms to  be opened.

       This is incredibly odd. I'm looking at his page now. But to answer your question. It sounds like he was hiding in the bushes. I'm not sure what time he was hiding there, if the room number that the shooter was actually in had already been released.

       Holy crap... It does say that! "An Australian man with the room next to the gunman's says he's "shaken" by Sunday's attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Brian Hodge wasn't in the room when 64-year-old retired accountant Stephen Paddock opened fire on an outdoor concert across the street, killing 59 people and wounding more than 500. Instead, the 36-year-old was returning to the hotel after dinner, and made it up to the 32nd floor, when shots rang out.
Eventually, Hodge took shelter in the bushes outside the Mandalay Bay hotel.
Paddock had 23 guns in the room where he had been staying since Thursday.
Hodge says it's 'unsettling' to think he had been sleeping next to a room filled with guns and ammunition."

       So did he somehow get up to the 32nd floor, past the secondary elevator security, and see the wounded security guard and just get back on the elevator, go down the other elevator, and run outside to jump in a bush?  When did he see the gunman?
      </p>
      <p>
       If he got there right when "shots rang out," how did he see the security guard or know where the shots were coming from, and why did he not try to hide in his room (I understand the last point - I'd want to be out of there too, but it needs to be addressed).

       No idea.  I got the impression that he was hiding in the bushes DURING the shooting.  I asked for clarification, and got none.  I don't recall where I saw it, though.  It was early last week, so who knows where it is buried.

       He wasnâ€™t escorted out of his room, never made it there. He was returning to the Mandalay from a business dinner when the shooting started and his in the bushes.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the info he shared the night of the incident was coming from news/tweets/posts he was reading while hiding (per his own words on his Facebook posts).

       Also paddock stayed in a 'vista suite'. Quick search on Mandalay bay website gives a virtual tour of the layout from the opposite wing of the hotel than to the side he supposedly shot from. 
In the virtual tour you can see the type of door separating the additional add on rooms that either Hodge stayed in, or paddock owned.  Law enforcement said they breached this door. The door itself has a key lock as well as a handle to go between. It would have had to been locked by paddock after he began shooting from hodge's room to begin with (so it could be breached) making Hodge the liar as how would paddock possess the key to his room? Ergo, Hodge is lying or is complicit in sharing his room.

       He also replies to someone's comment asking if he saw the shooter and he says yes and that the shooter was asian. He also says multiple shooters. He says multiple shooters while still hiding in the bushes. Then he changes his story the next morning very early. He doesn't say he made a mistake he says -It's not true, there was only one shooter and he's not sure where anyone got that from, claiming he never said multiple shooters. When confronted with the screen shot he simple doesn't respond

       Someone told him to change his story. It's odd he didn't delete his comments thought. While presumably hiding in the bushes someone gave him the number of a reported. If he made the call he could of found out the room number and possibly what what believed to be happening on his floor- since i'm sure the reporter was listing to the police scanner. So as soon as it was said the room number he could of found that out. I haven't seen any of his interviews yet, just going off the fb page

       Your assuming a reporter was listening to scanner live.

      <p>
       Thatâ€™s funny cause police scanner info was not being reported by anyone other than maybe random FB posts or Reddit posts.

       Media sites had no info about 32 til much later.

       I would assume that, If I was a reporter, I'd want to be the first to report it. Why not go straight to the source? But I'm not a reporter and I guess things have a way in which they work. But the comments in the thread on his facebook seemed to be not too far behind, maybe an hour or so.

       It looks like he wasn't in his room, he was walking back to his hotel when the shooting started so he hid in some bushes outside of it

       So did he somehow get up to the 32nd floor, past the secondary elevator security, and see the wounded security guard and just get back on the elevator, go down the other elevator, and run outside to jump in a bush?  When did he see the gunman?
