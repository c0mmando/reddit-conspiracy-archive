       In the days following Vegas, I knew this place would be a steady stream of research. I resubbed (left for awhile due to T_D brigading) and was really enjoying everything coming from here showing up on my front page. I don't quite have the time to research and pore over this shit some of you guys do, so I'm really just a casual observer, but I still take it all in. Within the past 2 days or so however, it seems like I haven't seen ANY r/conspiracy posts on my front page. Not one. I've had to come to the subreddit specifically to see any new information. Now idk if the flow of info has just slowed down and posts haven't been getting high enough quick enough, but I fear there may be some suppression from Reddit itself here. Anyone else have this issue?

       You're exactly the top comment with not too many upvotes which is
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       convenient for the suppression theory. You're not fooling me.

       I also want to see how I will be slowly be downvoted, but not too much of course. (*)

       (*) Mostly, adding this little clause avoids the downvoting.

       This is beyond stupid. Everyone knows well enough about t_d cross-posting and brigading (we're "The_Donald 2.0" remember?), but you're attacking this guy because he hadn't specifically noticed or mentioned the same from one specific anti-Trump sub? LMAO.

       Rubbish. It shows that he's aware of one thing we're almost universally famous for (unless maybe you just don't get outside much). It's not hotly disputed nor should it be controversial to point it out, and it certainly doesn't warrant a veiled shill accusation.

       I will never understand people like you.  You fret ovwr this shit but instead of.making quality.posts calling those people out, you attack people that come here.  How about you try to calm the hell down and educate those of us that arent here 24/7? Your just as bad as the shills if your just going to shill on behalf of this sub.  Thats not what were here for, stop attacking people and simple state your argument, YOUR the reason new people leave and we cant retain any real CTs anymore because they dont want to waste time being yelled at or having a pissing contest about who knows more.  so stop being counteractive for this sub and help me and the other nin shills bring back thoughtful discussion. lookin at you u/putin_loves_cats.

       Hardly a day goes by where he doesn't intentionally cause a fight between users, which is why

       Yeah he is the biggest outlier amongst us but still bashes others as if they were a shill and we dont notice lol  Im weary of any assholes not looking for discussion and super nice people trying to sway you and dump info in your lap.  i like to walk the line and never really settle on anything.  people have to keep in mind were trying to put a puzzle together without eyes, any theory goes even if its really out there.  If info and knowledge are surpressed then why is it too much of a reach to think that TPTB figured out how to use energy around us? or that they are willing to murder thousands to remain in power? or that there is a huge pedo ring? Why are aliens helping TPTB too far fetched?
 I dont get how you can draw a line when ll the info you think you know has been carefully spoonfed to you since you were an infant.

       Word, for someone who has been here so long, it seems the only skill he has perfected is division. My few discussions with him usually end in him alluding to how long and extensive his history is here, very little contribution to discussion.... but At the same time , as a longtime user I can see the reasoning behind alot of his posts, best not to commit to much time to flame wars with shills RIGHT?

       I get where you are coming from but I do think OP is not intentionally here to be bias. I mean they are the type of user that commented on r/boobies 4 weeks ago. Probably just some neckbeard that is trying to voice what they noticed as suspicious and wanted to put it out there in case others are noticing something similar.

       The good thing is that most of the Shills, could be prosecuted as Traitors. Many of the fake protesters could be declared as needing to be detained in a mental institution, once their duties have been fulfilled.

      <p>
       It seems that there is a push to declare people who question the truth, as mentally ill, and I hope that people on this sub protect themselves, as I have read many posts trying to say others need mental help. What is mental help? These days, it''s a fifteen minute visit with a person who prescribes a bizarre medication that warns of suicidal thought.

       It's a cool buzzword for people to use when they don't have sufficient reasoning to back their arguments. "You're a shill! No point arguing with you!". It's sheer nonsense.  The amount of people being called shills in this sub just serves to show how paranoid some people are. Severely overestimating the care people would have for promoting a specific narrative in a conspiracy sub lmao.

       I know exactly what you're saying and it's crazy to see. I'm not sure if it's because I stopped giving a shit about politics (because it's rigged to keep the small group with power in power), or I refuse to swallow the loads of bullshit the media feeds us. Since I decided to think for myself, and start questioning why, it's made it easier to see through the craziness.

       It really boils down to this:
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't fall in step with view point "A", or view point "B", you are a tin foil hat wearing psycho and your opinion isn't valid. The powers that be will silence you and ensure your voice doesn't get loud enough to disturb those willing to eat their shit. Or disrupt their ad revenue.

       I believe your character is important do the discussion at hand since given your documented history of making outlandish claims your

       And you didn't really answer my question. You made a claim about td having private discord channels where they coordinate brigading on this sub and I said back up your claims. Then you said I've made similar claims without backing them up. So which claims have I made. If you're gonna accuse me you're gonna need to be a bit more specific friendo.

       I think you your looking for a reason to whine about T_D. Considering there is No Vegas conspiracy that is on the top of T_D you fail to make your point. Try posting a conspiracy about the Vegas shooting on T_D and see how far it gets. T_D is definitely not brigading but you sure are trying too.
