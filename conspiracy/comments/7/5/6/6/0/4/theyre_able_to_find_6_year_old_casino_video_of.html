       There's a difference between questions and ignorance. If you knew about the video from the lawsuit, then you should have done research into instead of immediately thinking there is a conspiracy at work.

       I saw the video but did not see it was due to a lawsuit, hence why I said " oh that makes sense I didn't know that". Regardless, he's dead now, there should be footage released. Even of him walking in.

       That's literally why I posted it. To investigate further, and j already found it's from a lawsuit before you came in derailing everything and calling people dumb for not knowing your narrative. If you're all done I'm going to move along.

       What makes you think they are going to release any video of him to the public right away, or at all? What obligation do they have to share their private security footage with anyone other than law enforcement? Why would they open themselves up to any potential legal action, or reveal their security set-up? Why would they willingly prolong terrible PR and negative advertisement? This is a business after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the footage is being used as evidence you will get to see it, along with the rest of us. Law enforcement isn't going to release what they have on an active investigation because that's obviously against common sense and I imagine a bunch of protocols, and the hotel won't for reasons listed in the paragraph above.

       Alright, first, you gotta relax, this is a conspiracy subreddit, designed to inform people, because he didn't know the video was used in a prior lawsuit doesn't mean he's ignorant. If anyone is being ignorant here, it's you dude, it doesn't matter if the video is being used in an investigation right now, if Stephen Paddock was a LONE SHOOTER, then they should have at least released screenshots from the security footage, and yes they are obligated to do that, because hiding information from the public and expecting people to believe your narrative is exactly why conspiracy theories are a thing. Now if you want to be toxic, I recommend a different subreddit. Thanks!

       You're coming off as awfully hostile and demeaning for someone who is trying to frame me as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to your argument that they should release that information? Who should release it, and why? I already explained why the hotel won't release it, and why the police won't. I backed my argument with logic and a reasonable argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       A conspiracy subreddit that's "designed to inform people" should take the time to fill their theories with valid, accurate information and with logical, reasonable arguments. If you can't manage that, then your theory isn't a very good one and should be discussed on those exact terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise any theory is as valid as any other, and you and I both know that's not true. The theory that Godzilla is really ruling the world from a secret Moon lair doesn't deserve to be taken as seriously as a theory with reasonable logic and proof behind it.

       Casinos def have tons of footage. But casinos HATE to release security footage. Even big lawsuits in Vegas take years and years because the casino will refuse to release security tapes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if they think it will compromise their security setup if people know camera locations and resolutions or what, but I know they are very reluctant to ever release security camera stuff.

       They're open to huge litigation.  I think this was his motivation.  Create 500 lawsuits against a hotel that should have done a better job protecting the area around the hotel (and knowing what's going on with their walls).

       That's an interesting angle.  I've been thinking that the CONCERT organizers could be held liable.  I've been to college football games (large campus, popular and often top ranking team) where the police secured building rooftops that were close enough to the stadium (actually they had marksmen on top of dorm towers).   That was three or four years ago, so standard OP for event security, I'd think for a crowd that size.  You've gotta think -- nightclub, concert and party shootings are somewhat common. Not crazed mass shooting types, but "gangster driveby after an argument" types that kill a hand full of people are common.  Any reasonable organizer of an event that size can't really say "oh nobody could consider this a danger".  Especially in Las Vergas, where gunfire is commonplace.

       A shootout between a couple individuals or groups of individuals isn't as bad as a random dude getting guns into your  hotel and killing more than 50 civilians and wounding over 500. I don't know the exact biker case your talking about, but I'd assume not as many casualties and the ones who died were most likely participating in the shootout, not innocent civilians enjoying themselves.

       It just seems different to normal. Normally they release footage to the public in case it jogs anyone's memory or there's somethign that someone sees that they know about that could be of importance. If you think about it, if they are so sure there's just one shooter, then why keep everything so hush hush, one reason I can see for being tight lipped would be if they don't want to tip someone off that they're onto them or something.

       Considering normal people got killed in a place they shouldn't have and the police is supposed to protect and serve, they owe us everything. Normal people want to know exactly what happened, because they don't want it to happen again. Normal people who pay the police via taxes, in order to get answers.
Yeah I agree with the not rushing things, but they owe us BIG time or they can all go and feck themselves as we get more competent investigators in, for whom we pay! They are not our keepers and we are not toddlers that need to be lied to.

       You could say literally any crime against the public entitles you to all this info. Nobody owes you anything. When I see all the ridiculous ideas people passionately run with on this sub, I'm thankful they don't report on ongoing investigations. And there's no evidence they're lying to you.

       Yeah, botched arms deal of a small amount of weapons all in this guys name in a Vegas hotel....do you hear yourself? I'm pretty sure people who are going to do arms deals don't put the guns in their own name or even leave a paper trail. You certainly wouldn't conduct such in a Vegas hotel with thousands of people and cameras.

       Yes a very small amount for an arms deal. In a very public place. And then it supposedly went bad so instead of just getting rid of Paddock and keeping it quiet...they decided to open fire on 22,000 people and bring national attention to themselves. Tell me the logic in that? There is none. Not a single shred.

       I don't see how it would matter who shot first. How would any of that lead to a mass shooting? I don't expect you to have factual answers but I do expect if you are going to put an idea out there that you have thought it through and consider the possibilities of what happened and how...if you can't do that then your theory holds no weight. U can't pontificate on one aspect and be able to connect it to the other.

       I worked for a Casino and did a lot with the surveillance systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have footage they could dial up from I would reckon over 2500 cameras around the building with 20 minutes notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       They would have him entering, exiting and breaking the glass out of his room. (There is a 360 camera right above the section where his room was.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I was working at the Casino when a man was killed by security and the footage was produced the following day to the police.
      </p>
      <p>
       There might not be as much recording around the hotel as the gaming floor but storage is cheap for what they need to cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they could film you practicing your gaming techniques in your room they would do it to give the house any advantage it can get.
(Though they would never let that get out.)
