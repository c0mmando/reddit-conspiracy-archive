I will agree with the hoax theory, in that I have no seen any IRREFUTABLE proof of real gunfire or people being killed or hit. And trust me I&#39;ve looked at just about everything out there, as I&#39;m sure most of all you have. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure for most of you, you&#39;re reasoning for this will be- well of course, people actually died.
But I would like people that are adamant about it being a hoax to reason this for me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m posting then because I&#39;m torn and going crazy trying to understand. All the evidence we have is pretty convincing of a hoax. There is no evidence that I&#39;ve seen, that definitely proves it&#39;s not a hoax. </p>

<p>But these posts are real. I know them to be real. I just don&#39;t understand why all evidence essentially lead to hoax. But this thing with my friend and her sister tells me it&#39;s real.

<p>&quot;Jhov12&quot; -- first you will need to convince us that your story is legitimate.</p>

<p>this, i am sorry to say, is going to be difficult for you -- especially given your very limited history on reddit. </p>

<p>/good luck, mate</p>

<p>the internet is anonymous, and it&#39;s full of bullshitters.</p>

<p>simply saying you are going to have a difficult time proving that you are not one of them.</p>

<p>the &quot;all of it&quot; part:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>firstly, prove that you are not a disinfo agent</p></li>
<li><p>then, prove that the screenshots are not completely photoshopped.</p></li>
<li><p>then, prove that &quot;red is a girl&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>then, prove that you have know her &quot;for years&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>then, prove that &quot;red&quot; girl&#39;s account hasn&#39;t been hijacked.</p></li>
<li><p>finally, prove that &quot;red&quot; girl is bullshiting you.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>sorry, mate - your fighting an uphill battle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m kinda doubtful it&#39;s a hoax or complete false flag.  If any of you are from the west coast and super social in college like me you are bound to know of someone that knows an injury or attended. I know of at least three gofundme.  I see posts about this bartender I knew fighting for her life due to gunshot. I also think the media narrative is bullshit. Much bigger players involved.  </p>
