       Let me just first say I am honestly open to all ideas about what happened (or didn't) in Las Vegas. I will agree with the hoax theory, in that I have no seen any IRREFUTABLE proof of real gunfire or people being killed or hit. And trust me I've looked at just about everything out there, as I'm sure most of all you have.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure for most of you, you're reasoning for this will be- well of course, people actually died.
But I would like people that are adamant about it being a hoax to reason this for me.

       That's the same style video they always release. Not much you can make from that, that couldn't otherwise be 100% staged by those trained in the field of crisis acting. There are countless videos depicting how this is done, just do a quick search.

       So what are you implying? That the video is somehow a fake? I don't see how. Yes, it is odd this guy is probably in shock and just trying to help. Pretty disturbing he video taped it. But now its evidence so I won't fault him.

       I know they aren't fake. They are from a person that I know in real life, from her Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm posting then because I'm torn and going crazy trying to understand. All the evidence we have is pretty convincing of a hoax. There is no evidence that I've seen, that definitely proves it's not a hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       But these posts are real. I know them to be real. I just don't understand why all evidence essentially lead to hoax. But this thing with my friend and her sister tells me it's real. If it was real, why isn't there ONE SINGLE piece of evidence that proves without a doubt people were shot and killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So essentially, I have no idea what to think and I've been going crazy obsessing over this for the past week.

       There are tons of videos and pictures, and except for a VERY fishy "aftermath" video, nothing shows anyone getting shot or any gunshot wounds. With the amount of videos taken from within the crowd, why don't you see one person getting hit? Nobody is freaking out like the person next to them just had their brain come out the back of their head, no one is writhing in mortal pain. It just doesn't make sense that not one instance of this would be captured.

       Yeah I thought that as well, but I mean what am I to think? This person that I've known for years and her family are all in on some conspiracy and her sister is now living on some island somewhere?

       Well in very suspicious of everything and everyone, but for some reason I believe you aren't just telling a story or a shill.

       Personally I think people did get killed there, BUT like you, I the lack of video is strange.

       It's been driving me crazy all week. Had I not known this girl, I probably would've fully bought the hoax explanation by now and called it a day.  But it's really got my head boggled.

       I actually moved  about 1400 miles away in January, so I haven't seen local paper. I haven't heard anything about a funeral as of yet, however on the gofundme that was made for them, it talks about having to travel to Vegas ( or at least transporting her from Vegas, in not sure which or both) so that may take longer than usual. But I will ask my family (who do currently live in the same town as the sister) what they've seen/heard. And will do my best to get details on a funeral.

       Me too man. I listened to Dr Pieczenik and Robert David Steele, both ex cia, say that no one died at this event. I was seriously considering this to be true, but then I saw a local story here in my city, which isn't even in the USA, about some girl that got injured by a bullet. She went on the radio and told her side of the story. It really mind fucked me for a minute.

       I'm kinda doubtful it's a hoax or complete false flag.  If any of you are from the west coast and super social in college like me you are bound to know of someone that knows an injury or attended. I know of at least three gofundme.  I see posts about this bartender I knew fighting for her life due to gunshot. I also think the media narrative is bullshit. Much bigger players involved.
