<p>But how could this actually be done? How could you get all these people to act it out and not say a word. Especially the children? It&#39;s impossible to pull this off without anyone leaking that it was fake. How do you fake a child&#39;s death? Unless the whole school was in on it. And then how do you keep children quiet</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously they literally built an entire town completely ordinary in every way to concede the building of a mega weapon that would forever change the world. An entire town of people going to ordinary jobs living ordinary lives as an act to hide something super massive. Also like you mentioned MK ultra. That shit went on for a long time because the head creep in charge get powerful people involved and then black mailed them into continuing his funding. Evil people do evil things and wrap up others with greedy fingers until you have enough people in your pocket that you can do whatever you want.</p>

<p>Imagine someone approached you and offered you 250k tax free to be star in the next mass shooting hoax... </p>

<p>Would you? I mean 250k is alot of money.. That could change lives, multiple generations of lives if used properly... </p>

<p>Now, hopefully you would say NO.. 
But think about your peers, think about the guy working the drive thru at taco bell, or the mom with 3 kids, or better yet the attention seeking types.... Do you think those people would say NO. </p>

<p>Because I&#39;m pretty sure there are people who would kill someone for a vacation to the beach and some pocket money.. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem isn&#39;t just paying the families. It&#39;s paying everyone involved in the operation, paying off, blackmailing, or &quot;suiciding&quot; anyone who suspects anything and keeping everyone quiet FOR GOOD. Sure, in a tech heavy world it is crazy that we didn&#39;t get pictures but honestly it&#39;s easy to see that it was out of respect. What&#39;s even crazier is that every time someone tells me a theory about Sandy Hook, I can debunk it with 2 minutes of google. I love theories but it&#39;s too much IMO. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not offering very good/specific information but I believe there was a law passed restricting the disclosure of evidence to public, even though court records are supposed to be public, as I understand. Like no pictures of the &#39;victims&#39; from the incident are public. So technically, a case could be resolved in court and there would be no way for it to be scrutinised by public at large. The parents have also become prominent anti-gun activists (which would make sense either way) and political spokesmen when something like Vegas happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You couldn&#39;t. And it turns out, if you did, a few weeks later you&#39;d realize no one really cares anyway. It&#39;s just a footnote. How many Americans have thought about Sandy Hook in the last month? 0.0001%? If you were able to fake it, you&#39;d be able to create some amazing PR campaigns that would have a much deeper and longer lasting affect on the nation. Which isn&#39;t hard, since Sandy Hook changed nothing.</p>

<p>People are so focused on big events, because it&#39;s easy to detail and discuss. But that&#39;s not how you control people, influence people, sedate people. It&#39;s the small things that produce the desired effect. You dont push the nation in the direction you want with a sledgehammer. You gently nudge them with a pillow, once a day, so they don&#39;t even notice the very slight change in direction. </p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t controlling the food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breath, the media we watch, in the end, be a much easier and more powerful way of getting what you want? If you need the largest mass murder in the history of the country to influence people, you&#39;re a fucking retard. The powers that be didnt get there by being stupid. Stop focusing on the big events that happen every few years, focus on the events that happen EVERY FUCKING DAY, that&#39;s the dangerous stuff. </p>
