<p>They&#39;re also in Banking, Hollywood, Porn, MC-Complex, Google/YT and many other places, although I don&#39;t have as neat proof for that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a thing, guys.</p>

<p>Not all jews are in though. Just ask holocaust/ccamp victims. Check out this video, for example, which seems pretty genuine: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILfmmawu4mQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILfmmawu4mQ</a></p>

<p>Or this interesting article, &quot;Why do the Illuminati hate Jews?&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.savethemales.ca/001482.html">https://www.savethemales.ca/001482.html</a></p>

<p>So let&#39;s be careful not to fall for another episode of &quot;Divide and Conquer&quot;! Also let&#39;s not forget the Vatican/Jesuits. Who is pulling whose strings? It easily gets confusing. Some perspective:</p>

<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c0sJx2ZgYpQ/Uw4VFRGWXnI/AAAAAAAAAdw/OUvjtI-YclI/s1600/illuminati+pyramid.jpg">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-c0sJx2ZgYpQ/Uw4VFRGWXnI/AAAAAAAAAdw/OUvjtI-YclI/s1600/illuminati+pyramid.jpg</a></p>

<p>Some people make a distinction between so-called Khazarian Jews (of Turk, not Hebrew descent, some also call them Ashkenazi) and Hebrew Jews. Then there&#39;s the group(s) called &quot;Zionists&quot;.</p>

<p>Jews, please speak up! I would welcome Jews&#39; opinions on Khazar, Ashkenazi, Israelis, Zionists, and Jews being fucked (metaphorically) by other Jews (e.g. in Nazi Germany).</p>

<p>It would also be awesome to hear some historian/genealogist opinions.</p>

<p>I leave you with a quote from the third link in this list:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The promising news is that there is now a growing number of actual Torah Jews, True Hebrews, and even a growing number of Khazarians around the world that understand Zionism and all the evil it produces. These folks now want to give the Israeli settlements back to the Palestinians, establish Palestine as a nation and push the crazy Likudists out of power in Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a jew, I can say that if there is a conspiracy or cabal or whatever, I wasn&#39;t invited. Culturally, we&#39;re encouraged to be successful and pursue careers that we can support our families with. If that means being a doctor, lawyer, banker, etc, so be it. Whether there&#39;s more to it than that, I don&#39;t know. I think bankers have their own agenda, regardless of religion. Plenty of them just happen to be Jewish. That said, most Jews in America are what we call culturally Jewish. Less religious and more into the culture (family values, pursuit of success, traditional foods, family gatherings, complaining together, etc). I personally don&#39;t agree with zionism or a lot of what&#39;s been going on in Israel. Many Jews agree, many don&#39;t. There&#39;s no hive mind with us. We&#39;re just people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Journalism is a high paying job, so it makes sense for people to pursue it. With Jews having a culture that encourages that, it makes sense that there&#39;d be plenty of Jews in journalism positions. (Almost) Everyone with a strong enough political or social view AND position of influence will use said position to further their political or social cause. Everyone has a bias. Except for maybe zionists, Jews in media likely are just as driven to report fairly as their Christian, Muslim, and atheist colleagues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So the gist of what you&#39;re saying is that the seemingly over-proportional presence of Jews in various high-paying/high-prestige industries (politics, MSM, film-making, banking etc.) is, among other things (like being forced to resort to certain livelihoods in the past), a result of their traditional striving for these things (i.e. money and prestige)?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Essentially, yes. Financial security for our families. Perhaps in the darker days of Europe&#39;s past only the wealthy Jews were safe from the wrath of intolerance, so historically wealth and family unity have been a means of protection and survival for my people. Anybody, no matter their heritage, if faced with death or survival for them and their loved ones, would choose survival and adapt to ensure their family is safe. Better to adapt and integrate with your home than always remain unchanging and unwilling to respect the ways of your neighbors. Jews have a history of integrating into their homes (America, Europe, etc) and keeping their traditions that aren&#39;t disruptive to their non-Jewish neighbors. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really, no.</p>

<p>Look the thing to remember is the vantage point of your perspective.</p>

<p>You see a lot of Jews being in &quot;control&quot; so to speak.</p>

<p>But think about how it looks from a different perspective. How would <em>you</em> maintain secrecy? You&#39;ll only include people you could trust... They&#39;ll be like-minded, from the same socioeconomic class (generally speaking), and those you know.</p>

<p>My point is the prevelance of Jews in power is predictable, if the top dogs in the group are Jews.</p>

<p>Look at any smaller group and evaluate.</p>

<p>IMHO, it&#39;s not because a certain ethnic group is conspiring, it&#39;s a result of humans conspiring that inevitably leads to a certain ethnic group being the majority of conspirators.</p>

<p>If your white and conspire, you&#39;ll likely end up with a bunch of white conspirators... Does this alone make you racist? If you&#39;re black and conspire, you&#39;ll likely end up with a bunch of black conspirators. The people looking at this can say say &quot;it&#39;s a white/black&quot; cabal, which may be true, but to say the white/black people are conspiring would not be correct.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, but this is:</p>

<p>I was cranky and responded reflexively because there is so much one-dimensional scapegoat shitposting and has been since &quot;posts&quot; were hand printed and actually put physically on posts. Your post doesn&#39;t seem to fit this mold and I appreciate its subtlety in contrast to the usual.</p>

<p>I still have no real idea what can be done beyond awareness and individual adaptation to new context, but this is a problem in common with many of the issues being brought up here. I guess my question is always: ok, so now what? Invariably it seems you just go on, knowing a little more, trying to act with a little more intelligence and hope the ripples catch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for getting back to me. I agree there&#39;s a lot of one-sided discussions and propaganda around, and that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to remedy with posts like this. But I guess I might just not be very good at it yet. ;-)</p>

<p>And yeah, one step at a time. Every little bit of knowledge gained and shared helps, because awareness is the thing that will set us free. &lt;3</p>
