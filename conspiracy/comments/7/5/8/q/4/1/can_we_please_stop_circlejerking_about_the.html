<p>Not how it happened, he disappeared (and, safe to assume, committed suicide) a month before the bombings. His disappearance was the main reason Reddit &#39;detectives&#39; had him as a prime suspect - they were sure he had spent that month off the grid planning the bombing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When reddit really circlejerks over stuff, it gets intense and death threats are formed and it just gets toxic. With the Boston Bombing, we thought we &quot;found&quot; the guy who did the Bombing, and it got fucking <strong>INTENSE.</strong> The Sunhli guy was found dead in a river later, he killed himself. And when the real Bombers were found, Reddit felt bad. Imagine if that happens again but with the Las Vegas shooting. We start a circlejerk with whoever we think this &quot;second shooter&quot; is, and basically the same thing happens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As soon as I heard about the shooting I knew this sub would be all over it, not because there would be any inconsitency or reason to doubt the official story, but because everyone here desperately wants to believe they know something the rest of the world doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>So every day it&#39;s the same crap:</p>

<ul>
<li>armchair psychoanalysis intimating that whatever the shooter did in the hours, days, weeks before the shooting was somehow &#39;odd&#39; for someone planning a massacre</li>
<li>using the often garbled and factually incorrect reporting and witness testimony taken within minutes of a chaotic and traumatizing event to prove that the MSM is hiding something</li>
<li>expert medical diagnoses of injuries that somehow &#39;don&#39;t look like they should&#39; or &#39;there&#39;s not enough blood&#39; based on cell phone pictures</li>
<li>the usual wholesale rejection of any reputable news source coupled with blind acceptance of anonymous 4chan posts and unverified twitter accounts</li>
</ul>

<p>And who&#39;s responsible, and what&#39;s their motive? Why it&#39;s &quot;the powers that be,&quot; of course, shadowy nameless people, probably led by Hillary Clinton so she can take away our silencers because, somehow that will increase her already cosmic levels of power.</p>

<p>All to explain something ultimately mundane: that in America, anyone with the resources can get some big guns and a good vantage point and kill a ton of people. Nobody can deny that. And, some people in America are deranged -- can&#39;t deny that either. Maybe r/conspiracy can&#39;t cope with the real truth and they need these fantasies to get by.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The other day I took the time to lay out a clear and well thought out argument to someone who I disagreed with. This person reaponded that I&#39;m only worth responding with insults. It really pissed me off. His only criteria for that was the fact that I don&#39;t believe in a free market, and yet the whole reason I was arguing was to see the strength of my point of view and either learn or educate. It was a complete waste of time to try and talk to a pompous British &quot;academic&quot; (I shit you not).</p>

<p>Insults really do nothing productive. Not that I&#39;m above it, but I&#39;m just speaking the truth. </p>

<p>But the person you responded to seemee respectful but firm, having taken the time to articulate his POV. I think that&#39;s the kind of person worth talking to, even if they think you&#39;re insanely wrong. </p>

<p>People like myself are frustrated at conspiracy culture because there are actual problems like campaign finance, mass surveilance, and weakening education. Real issues are ignored on this sub, which instead focuses on conspiratorial crisis actors and debunked pizza pedophiles.</p>

<p>I actually used to be a conspiracy theorist. When I criticize people on this sub it is out of a desire to wake people up and help them. There are a lot of good intentioned people here who could do some great activist work if they simply learned how to be more critical of information on the Net. </p>

<p>Despite my well intentions I was at one point banned from this sub for criticizing it. It was an incredibly short sighted and needlessly authoritative decision by one mod. After I civilly challenged it his colleagues reversed the decision, but not without the original mod warning me to &quot;quit while (I was) ahead&quot;.</p>

<p>It sounds like you&#39;ve had bad experiences with people who disagree with you. That&#39;s incredibly unfortunate because you don&#39;t deserve that. It&#39;s also unfortunate because no one of any viewpoint or culture will ever be able to grow unless they&#39;re comftorable mingling with those sho disagree with them. I suggest you just try to make the most of things and see the good where it exists.</p>
