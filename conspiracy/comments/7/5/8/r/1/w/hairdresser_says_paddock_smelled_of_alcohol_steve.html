       6.15min Makes a very VERY specific point of mentioning that in 6 years no one at any part of the hotel had ever seen either of them drinking alcohol.

       Even the group photo that was posted here somewhere of him, a bunch of asian/islander women with 3 white guys. One of them was Paddock with the same shirt on as the shotglass photo. Mysteriously, there was only water bottles on the table and no alcohol in sight. We need to find our who took the shotglass pic and the group pic.

       Have you seen more than two photos circulating of the man? For someone who seems to have all the answers and incessantly argues against anyone who isn't parroting the MSM narrative, you seem to be uneducated about the topic.

       thats a pretty stupid comment, buddy
      </p>
      <p>
       is this an msm website where they put their story across or is it a website where lots of easily debunked theories and
       <strong>
        assumptions
       </strong>
       are posted?
      </p>
      <p>
       if something is easily debunked, would it not be hypocritical and dishonest not to say so?
      </p>
      <p>
       why should the msm be immediately dismissed as false, but everything here should be blindly accepted as the truth?

       It's because the media and authorities have been sharing precious little actual evidence with the public. I've only seen two photos of the man circulating since this happened. Have you seen more? Like I said, you comment incessantly day and night, yet never seem to know anything beyond your limited MSM viewpoints. This is my subjective opinion and can be disagreed with, but you comment history is very telling imho.

       i think theres about 5 or 6 photos of him.
      </p>
      <p>
       no photo was mentioned in OP's video so how was i to know which one the comment was about.
      </p>
      <p>
       i probably do share some viewpoints of the msm, and i certainly dont have an issue with evidence not being released yet. but if youre going to ignore what i say in favour of your agenda then then i dont beleive youre as subjective as yo would like to believe

       People are asking questions because what we've been told makes no sense. You're trying to convince people that the MSM narrative is entirely factual, while attacking those who are pointing out the inconsistencies found within said narrative. There's a huge difference. The people questioning are open to new information, but you seem very limited in your viewpoint and I don't know why.

       no, you repeated it because you want to give the impression there was confusion or argument about it.

       That only reinforces my point. If you've seen the photo and even commented on it, why do you seem unaware when others being up inconsistencies within the narrative?

       the photo was not mentioned in the video afaik so it could have been literally anything he was talking about. "the photo" is really kinda vague.

       Understanding context clues goes a long way, especially when there have been very few photos released of the man. One of them is the man holding a shot glass and you've proven that you've already seen and commented on said photo. Nothing is vague about the situation. I'm happy to clarify and indeed have, but I'm just surprised that someone so involved with the topic wouldn't immediately know what's being discussed.

       i probably have commented on a thread with the photo in it. as soon as he said what photo he was talking about i instantly had a good idea which one he was talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       the point youre not grasping is that there was no mention of this photo in op's video so i asked for clarification on which photo he was referring to

       Clearly Wynn has seen that picture. For him to go out of his way to state explicitly that Paddock never had a drink is very strange when the only picture we have is him with a drink.

       That coupled with the fact he mentions the service elevator at 7.10 as though it's already a known fact he was in the mandalay service elevator unaccompanied and its not until Wallace further pushes him on it does he back away from that statement. Together it would suggest he's had private conversations with close vegas ties and knows more than the general public and the official narrative is drastically lacking in answers.

       how is this not in the title?? It's the single biggest thing here....Sounds like the casinos or at least the MGM is trying to cover this up if they let him use a service elevator...that would be insane lawsuits especially if he took the guns up that way....theres def video in a service elevator....

       It would be interesting what other casinos say about this.  Maybe he didn't drink in Vegas because he didn't want to make a mistake gambling?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wynn obviously knows WAY more than anyone but law enforcement.  I don't think much happens in Vegas that he isn't privy to.  Pretty much everyone in town needs to act like they are on his payroll, because either they are, or they will be replaced by someone who is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, even without the dark politics, just as a casino owner, they are going to get more information quickly to adjust security measures.

       This is exactly right. In a civil suit Paddock filed against the Cosmopolitan he states on record that he never drank while playing, in order to keep his wits and not make mistakes.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Wynn probably never saw him actually drinking, so he just assumed he didn't drink.

       He didn't just assume though and he said he never drank (with dinner). I'm not saying Paddock didn't drink, he clearly did. I'm saying the most emphatic thing Wynn says here and he even comes back to it after getting side tracked is that this guy never touched a drink.

       This actually makes everything make sense. Wynn saw him usually while he was playing, so he never saw him drinking. But the dude obviously drank because we have pictures of him doing so.

       In the deposition Paddock said he gambled 14 hours a day, 365 days a year. That leaves ten hours for boozing and sleep. It also said they found a bottle of Valium which contained around 14 pills left out of 60. But the bottle was over a year old.
      </p>

       I’m no conspiracy person per se, but I find the media and govt to be completely fishy with this entire thing. Nothing concrete ever just adds up.

       The deposition was for a slip and fall lawsuit against the cosmopolitan hotel. If he was a guy gambling a million dollars a day, they would suck his dick here to Sunday if he slipped and fell in their casino. The hotel ended up winning that case. Strange

       There is a point for all of us where we get a peek around the edges of the show. I was into UFOs, but the rest of this shit, at best, made me chuckle at how serious everyone was. Now, I really won't put anything past the bad guys. I still play devil's advocate quite a bit, because there are lots of obvious explanations that are completely avoided by our group here, but that is just reflex at this point. Pretty sure it is worse than our most paranoid imagine.

       I'm sure that in his deposition, he fluffed the facts.  I don't know why he lost, but there is no indication it was due to him having a history as a drinker in the casino (contributory negligence).
      </p>
      <p>
       He probably stated that as fact because he knew they knew they didn't have any vid of him doing it.

       I don't think he was as big of a gambler as is being made out.  Wynn said he was a modest gambler by their measures.  He sent his brother a picture of a $40,000 jackpot.  That suggests winning $40,000 was out of the ordinary.  I would guess he gambled $10-20,000 a day.  He probably played $100 hands of video poker.  Not really a big fish by casino standards.  He was pretty much the smallest fish in the high limit rooms.

       In his deposition he stated he gambled upward of a million a day, which could be utter bullshit. My point is there seems to be discrepancies on everything when it comes to this case, and that’s what tickles the spidey sense. Nothing is ever cut and dry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m assuming if Wynn knew of him, the guys under Wynn knew every detail if Paddock’s life, down to how many shits he takes a day

       He sounded credible.  But again, drinking in a local bar playing $.25 shooting shit with your neighbor, and then getting a haircut the next morning, IN MESQUITE, has nothing to do with drinking in a casino.
      </p>
      <p>
       All reports indicate he treated gambling, in the casino, using a comp card, like a job.

       These casino people are a law unto themselves, there is a thin blue line with them. I'm pretty sure this is why we'll never see a "motive". Don't flay me r/conspiracy. Even if there is a deep state connection, these guys would cover it up. They'd literally go out of business in toto if

       i have daily interaction with coworkers and regular customers and buy materials several times a day from the same stores and i couldn't tell you specifically a day so-and-so smelled like alcohol. Plus IF the guy that called the radio show was legit, he played video poker and drank beer regularly. So, having alcohol on his breath would not be such an out of the box thing that it would be filed away in your brain. $.02 just a thought.

       Considering the facts of what we know about his player's card and the way he approached gambling as a "job" it is entirely possible that he drank when "not working", i.e. play high stakes video poker for mostly perks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The photos of him taking a shot are in the phillipines, not in a casino.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steve Wynn would only have information about his comps and behavior inside HIS hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
       They both could easily be telling the truth....

       a Las Vegas prostitute who was hired by murderer Stephen Paddock has spoken out about their 'violent' sex sessions and how he bragged about having 'bad blood'.
      </p>
      <p>
       The woman, who spoke anonymously, said she would spend hours drinking and gambling in Sin City with Paddock, who she described as 'paranoid' and 'obsessive'.

       In order to 'answer' how does a 64 year old who doesn't look like the picture of health get 100s of pounds of guns, ammo and equipment into the room let alone his car to/from other locations they had to paint a picture of health although without a hardcore fitness routine and/or supplements including steroids the lone gunman narrative doesn't fit.

       I don't think either are lying...I think Wynn just might be ill informed. After all, the shooter was pictured holding a shot. Not saying that says he is an alcoholic but Wynn claimed that the shooter never drank. Maybe he just hasn't when Wynn was around.

       i probably do share some viewpoints of the msm, and i certainly dont have an issue with evidence not being released yet. but if youre going to ignore what i say in favour of your agenda then then i dont beleive youre as subjective as yo would like to believe
