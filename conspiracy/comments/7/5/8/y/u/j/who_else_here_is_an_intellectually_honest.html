       I thought it might be helpful to quell the constant shill accusations by letting this sub see that there are many of us who have digested all of the evidence that we could find and remain unconvinced that the Podestas/Alefantis/Comet Pizza are involved in any way with child pornography or human trafficking. Please note that I am not saying it’s impossible - of course it’s possible. I’ve often been surprised by the things that seemingly warm-hearted people have done. But none of the emails, Instagram posts, or ‘creepy’ art have convinced me that something nefarious is going on, and I truly believe it’s unjust to spread a narrative that these people are monsters based on such flimsy &amp; circumstantial (at best) evidence. It frightens me because it would be so easy to ruin the lives of innocent people if that’s all it took to damn someone in the public imagination. 
And that is precisely why I don’t want to ignore this. I don’t want to see our curiosity weaponized by anyone. And I want people to see that, yes, conspiracy theorists can be skeptics too, and that to defend someone accused of vile crimes is not equivalent to defending those crimes. I’m also not saying that people should stop looking critically at things. What I’m wary of is the fact that so many users become entirely convinced by relatively weak evidence and then begin pushing the narrative that person X is certainly guilty of crime Y, and that if anyone objects then they are part of the problem. That’s absurd! And it’s very dangerous, since it pollutes our discourse and makes it so much more difficult for people to see truth for themselves.

       That's Pedogate, Pizzagate is specifically using pizza as code words for pedophillia and focuses on Alefantis.

       I thought the ‘pizza’ refers to Comet Pizza? In any case, this all seems to be pointed at a handful of people in particular, and the evidence offered to prove their guilt is - for many of us - entirely unconvincing.

       It was originally, but it appears to me shills successfully morphed the narrative into having people think pedo gangs exclusively operated out of pizza shops, thus dismissing the actual point.

       I don’t believe that at all! Of course that’s a ridiculous idea. I’m simply stating that based on the evidence I’ve seen, I don’t believe John Podesta, his brother, or James Alefantis to be guilty of human trafficking, child pornography, or child abuse.

       Gotcha, and thanks for the clarification. I’m not out to fool/ridicule/hurt anyone. I want to know the truth just like everyone else here - and an important point is that I don’t claim to know the truth! Not yet, anyway.

       We have several PG posts working their way up from new right now. Imho this is bait to get us off the vegas shooter story. They did this when PG had new hot findings too. All a sudden, there were dozens of 911 posts everywhere.

       I don’t think it’s all about Alefantis. I consider pizzagate and pedogate to be distinct. I know that there are human trafficking and child sex rings, and I believe they need to be dismantled. But that needs to happen without accidentally destroying the reputations of innocent people.

       I think a lot of the people(who aren't paid to say so online) that think there's nothing wrong with the pedo bands, the years of pedo innuendo and pics of children/babies on Alefantis' Instagram, the creepy art of Tony Podesta, the code words in Podesta emails, etc etc are like my friend but their favorite team is the Democrats. And the Democrats have told them it's an attack on all of them so they put blinders on and defend the pedos as one of their own..

       That seems like a poor comparison. Presumably there would be direct evidence that the boy’s scrotum was injured, and there was also an admission of guilt. In the case of pizzagate, there is nothing that directly suggests that any children were harmed. If you have evidence to the contrary, I’d like to see it. But the art and emails do not a pedophile make.

       I’ve seen those before. And you’re being intellectually dishonest. Can you provide any evidence that could be used to at least raise a civil suit? Or, perhaps the better question is: what next?

       Someone figured out that one of the guys that 'liked' a lot of his pedo innuendo posts was an FBI agent that is in a division that investigates these things. They have people in the inside protecting them.

       As far as victims, have you heard of Saville? When he took some of the royals out on his boat, they would throw the kids overboard after they were done with them. When the predators are that high of a level, they don't run the risk of potential future witnesses to testify.

       Alefantis is connected with very high level people, Clintons, Obama, Rothschild, etc..

       I did not want to believe it either when I first heard about it but the evidence is overwhelming and it all points to the same thing.. I try to be as intellectually honest as I can be and that doesn't allow me to ignore it.

       Assuming they are above the law, which is why this has been covered up by the authorities, we continue looking for evidence in the hopes of finding some evidence that nobody can ignore. That's about the only option, as far as I can tell.

       That raises an interesting question, that I’ve asked elsewhere: can we pursue these investigations without accidentally harming innocent people? Or is it the case that we will always run the risk of harming innocent people in the process of bringing real monsters to justice?

       It was one of the details that got overlooked by most somehow. He 'liked' a lot of Alefantis' pedo innuendo posts with an instagram account with his real name and picture. Search the name and it came up as an FBI agent in either the DC or NYC division(I forget which) and the pictures matched as the same guy.

       At this point both Podesta bros and Alefantis have possibly been libeled and sometimes by prominent names. Why have neither of them taken a case against it? Are they worried about what discovery might turn up?

       You gotta ask yourself, if a celebrity called you a Pedo on twitter what would your response be and why isnt there's even somewhat equal?

       That makes me think about the validity of the theory more than any questionable art could.

       I think that’s fair, but I will say that if I were in their position, I might wait as long as possible to let it quiet down by itself. Have you ever heard of the Streisand effect? By fighting the accusations directly, they would only stir up a hornet nest of trolls and would be waging a meme war that would onsume every waking moment of their lives. If they are innocent, and I have no reason to believe otherwise at this time, then they’re in an awful situation as it is. Responding to their aggressors would probably only make things worse. If people are truly convinced of their guilt, then they need to raise a civil suit against them! (Since the police seem unconvinced as well.)

       It just doesnt seem like a normal response.

       Away from PGate specifically, Trump called out Bill Clinton as a sexual predator, with accusers in attendance, on live tv!
      </p>
      <p>
       He had millions of first hand witnesses (including law enforcement &amp; politicians) as well as indisputable material evidence. That would have been a lawyer's wet dream, a 100% slam dunk win against a billionaire. Nothing happened.

       Maybe he's not that litigious? And what would he have to gain? He certainly doesn't need financial compensation from the accuser. And there may not be enough evidence either way. How could he prove that he

       I don’t want to stray from the Podestas and Alefantis, since in my mind they are very distinct for a number of reasons. Big one is the lack of any accusers in the case of pizzagate (that I’m aware of, mind you).

       Libel is incredibly difficult to prove in court. Considering all of the recent Streissand Effect examples that have happened recently, it makes perfect sense for them to not start a libel suit. I doubt any legal or PR experts would recommend that course of action.

       I've been following since the very beginning... and I will admit, 100%, there is no concrete evidence whatsoever. It could all be nothing more than coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the contents of the artwork, the censorship, the logos, the deletion of profiles/entire sub-reddits/de-monetization of YouTube channels, death threats (re: Pegasus), relationships to known pedophiles, very creepy/confusing coded messages in multiple emails across multiple leaks, correlation to previous human trafficking cases, musicians with very questionable content performing at "All Ages" shows starting in the late evening, rumored contents of the AW/HA "laptop"...
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing is concrete, it is all speculation, but there's a hell of a lot of smoke for there to be no fire.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And I want people to see that, yes, conspiracy theorists can be skeptics too, and that to defend someone accused of vile crimes is not equivalent to defending those crimes. I’m also not saying that people should stop looking critically at things.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Agreed 100%... I've been skeptical of numerous things, related to PG and a ton of other conspiracy theories. Do I get attacked for being skeptical? Do I get called a shill for questioning the fringe narrative? Of course, but, I agree with you. The best way to prove anything is to hold ourselves to a higher standard. We should be collectively poking holes in our own/other people's ideas, if no more holes can be poked and it still holds water - there's a good chance we have a solid lead on our hands.

       Thank you. I agree that there’s some strangeness (or ‘smoke’ if you prefer) but by itself I don’t think it’s anywhere close to proving that anyone is particular is a pedophile, or participating in a child slavery ring. I wonder what the next steps are for those of us who truly believe that these particular people are guilty of terrible crimes. What do you think the next steps should be?

       I think that the focus needs to be placed on human trafficking, especially anything related to children... we're seeing reports of government officials/law enforcement/religious figures being implicated in crimes against children at a blistering pace. Multiple times per week, they are getting caught red handed. Both current and former officials. (I could cite over 100 cases in the last 12 months alone - usually only covered on a local media scale and never revisited after the initial report)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm assuming that the speed of these arrests is increasing purely due to the reverse engineering of these sick networks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compared to the extremely disturbing history of massive cover-ups related to child trafficking/abuse (Dutroux, Saville, Boys Town, Aquino, Buckingham Palace, Epstein, The Finders, Westminster, Congressional reports of boys in the WH from the 80's, Afghan/Private Security coverup, Hapstead, etc... the list continues) it begins to make you think... if THIS LIST, which is only a small subset of a much larger list, is being aggressively covered up - why wouldn't there be a massive, more organized, deeper cover-up that could potentially implicate some of the most powerful people in the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, I'm not sure that leaves much in the way of next steps for us to help with. Aside from giving more coverage and participating in more discussion pertaining to these crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We would need to stumble upon a lead that is not already being pursued by LE officials, and then somehow legally obtain hard evidence and share it with LE. It would probably be a very bad idea to share such information/evidence on unofficial channels first - as it could put the same people we want to protect in harms way and/or give the perpetrators time to flee and cover their tracks.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should stay vigilant and keep our eyes open. Support our POTUS, support citizen investigators, support each other. There is no denying that these crimes are happening - whether or not the PG implications are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally? I think we're going to find links between drug running, gun running, human trafficking, child trafficking, high-end artwork and real estate transactions that will unveil a massive black market/barter system used by the elites to fly under the radar.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just hope this is exposed sooner rather than later and the hammers all drop simultaneously. Lopping off the heads of the hydra in one shot, denying them the chance to retreat/regroup/double-down on their secrecy efforts.

       Thanks again, stranger. I have absolutely no doubt that these rings exist, and I am fully committed to seeing them dismantled and the perpetrators punished (and depending on the nature of their particular crimes, preferably rehabilitated where possible - but I acknowledge that this is itself a controversial opinion).
      </p>
      <p>
       I am mostly interested in how these crimes can be investigated by conspiracy theorists without hurting innocent people (either erroneously targeted or caught in the crossfire). I think it’s safe to say that if Podesta and Alefantis are in fact innocent (and it sounds like you maintain that they very well might be) that they have already been harmed by pizzagate. Do you think it’s possible to engage in these civilian investigations without harming innocent people?

       Honestly... I'm not maintaining their innocence or their guilt. I suppose that without concrete evidence, they should be presumed innocent. I'm just concerned with the contents of their emails, social media feeds, art work, commentary, and connections to those who have been charged w/ CP and/or leverage references to CP in their public persona.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said. You seem to be concerned with the persecution of these individuals and the marring of their public image, especially if they are entirely innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, my suggestion to THEM would be to explain the contents of the communications/imagery in question. The hot tub party? Please explain. The "pizza related handkerchief"? Please explain. The removed artwork of decapitated children? Please explain. Hastert fleeing to a remote island in Japan? Please explain. A "hot dog stand in Hawaii"? Please explain. Death threats to individuals who discovered the Pegasus Museum? Please explain. The details behind the "Pizza PAC"? Please explain. Why a pizza logo contained the exact Pedo insignia within it, was changed within 24 hours of being discovered? Please explain. Why a pizza shop requires a secure log-in page on a hidden section of the website with multiple file repositories? Please explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that's the underlying issue. There could be innocent explanations for all of this. But absolutely none have been offered. For any of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Megyn Kelly allowed a quick explanation of why a girl was duct taped to the table @ CPP... but, failed to ask why that same girl was wearing a t-shirt that read "Pizza Slut" in another photo. That seems wildly inappropriate given the context of these questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that if these are all truly innocent, coincidental things that just "look bad" but aren't really all that bad, they should be easy enough to explain... no?
      </p>
      <p>
       And those explanations offered to the public would at least give them a side of the story for people to consider. Right now the speculation has just gone wild.

       I’m of two minds about this - I can just as well imagine that a response of the kind you described would only generate more headlines linking their names to pedophilia or worse, and it’s an unfortunate truth that merely defending oneself against accusations like these can raise eyebrows. I really don’t think that would end the suspicions. If Podesta explained that the hot tub email from a grandmother was perfectly ordinary (and I struggle to see anything weird about it - I read ‘entertainment’ as sarcasm) would that really quell doubts in that particular instance? Of course you can replace that example with any other. I think it would only agitate the accusers, who would claim that they’re lying to defend themselves.

       But if you follow that breadcrumb trail specific to the hot tub party (I won't name names or post links... you can dig on your own!) it only makes you scratch your head harder. The language used, the social media relationships, the images posted...
      </p>
      <p>
       By itself the email invitation could be seen as innocent, but within the larger context of those who were named in the email, it raises far more questions than it provides answers to.

       We can show direct ties to the DNC/HRC/JP/TP and other prominent figures. Combined w/ the hot tub email and the blog she ran... I don't know of ANYONE that would publicize/discuss/describe their children or grandchildren in this way.

       I can’t seem to move past head-scratching, and I don’t know if that is necessarily a problem. I wonder how easy it might be to identify any number of suspicious links among truly innocent people, and that under intense scrutiny anyone can be made to look suspicious with circumstantial evidence. It’s a tricky problem!

       The issue is that we do self-scrub leads in most channels... I've seen numerous cases of people announcing "This is no longer a lead, please remove all mentions of xyz". And then it dies on the vine.

      <p>
       Businesses, local areas, persons of interest, confused identities, etc... the air gets relatively cleared, relatively quickly. Leaving us with a series of unanswered/disturbing questions that get immediately scrubbed from the web and now only exist thanks to Archive.is.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't think this is necessarily true. We had people pointing fingers at different politicians, actors, lawyers, store owners, etc... and then when evidence dried up or there was no way to actually link them beyond supposition, they were essentially "cleared" and never mentioned again.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue we're left with now is a pile of circumstantial evidence and strange findings that have simply never been explained/addressed.

       The world would be a more peaceful place if everyone had a head as level as yours. I fully support cautious, responsible civilian investigations IF they don’t devolve to witch hunts where the accusation of guilt precedes any damning evidence. Most of the pizzagate posts I’ve seen to date begin with an accusation of guilt, even though what we have at this stage is a mountain of circumstantial evidence and plenty of head-scratching. Any idea what can be done to push us out of this rut?

       On the ground, knocking on doors, picking up phones, involving law enforcement, getting testimony and networking/crowd sourcing while dealing in nothing but facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue? His incredibly rigorous process had originally ignored Pizzagate/Pedogate... but is now coming full circle back to the black market of human/child trafficking + dumbo drops.
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone as disciplined as GW starts to chip away @ PG, even though he was intentionally avoiding it, you need to step back and think "Hmmm... maybe there IS something to this".
      </p>
      <p>
       But, to answer your question, we need less armchair internet investigators (myself included) and more crowdsourced/crowd-funded individuals on the ground, talking to real people, uncovering new evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if that means a group on the web hires private investigators to tackle specific subjects - such as the deaths related to the DNC case, more detailed background on the relationship to Epstein/Weiner/Clintons, how does Awan connect to human trafficking, looking into those implicated in actively covering up previous investigations, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Only so much can be done from the safety of your monitor. I personally don't have the time/background to conduct an investigation like GW does - but I would gladly fund said investigation for those who do.

       Pizza slices is perfect for money, think about pizza being a denomination, say $1million, and each slice being $100k or something similar.  Hotdog could be illegal contributions, and so on.

       Do you think Podesta and crew used code in their emails? Or do you think they were talking about food? If they were honestly talking about food, what did they mean by the email saying something along the line of 'do you want to get dinner or have pizza for an hour' (or something like that, I'm too lazy to google it).
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do think they were talking in code, why were they? To cover up illegal activity or just because they had an innocent secret code among themselves? If it was innocent, a quick explanation would have thrown a lot of cold water on the situation.

       There might be code, absolutely. Some of the food stuff is strange for sure. But it doesn’t make me think that they’re involved in child sexual slavery. I dunno, even some of the coded language I can read as inside jokes. I’m not saying that you’re wrong to be curious about them. I just don’t think that they are particularly damning. And in the case you offered, I don’t see anything weird about that phrase.

       It's not that the phrase is weird it just suggests that they don't mean food when using the term pizza, so it has another meaning. If you feel it categorically doesn't refer to child sex slavery (and I'm not insisting that it does), do you think they could be referring to drugs? Adult prostitutes? Other unsavory stuff?

       Real conspiracy theorists are skeptical by definition. You should always be skeptical of everything. But you should also always take in as much information from as many sources as humanly possible, and then use this information to form your
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       opinion of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that there is no hard, damning evidence that the Podestas and Alefantis are involved in a large human-trafficking ring in DC. But I also believe that the circumstantial evidence surrounding Podesta’s leaked emails and Alefantis’ social media accounts (before they were made private) are enough to warrant suspicion, and to enough for me to conclude that these men are more than likely very sick individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, here is my issue with what you’re saying; with the lack of any
       <em>
        hard
       </em>
       evidence of crimes we are left to make up our own minds about whether or not Podesta and Alefantis are involved in some sinister shit. If one decides that they are not guilty, then everything stops right? If one thinks it’s not likely these incredibly powerful people could be guilty of such horrific acts, then what motivation is there to continue investigating?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, if the circumstantial evidences leads you to conclude that Podesta and Alefantis actually ARE into some incredibly nefarious crimes (which is my personal belief), then what happens next? Do I buy a gun and go try to take justice into my own hands? Absolutely fucking not. Only a lunatic would do that. OR someone being paid very well to do it for the purpose of creating a media event so that “normal” people will associate anyone who might believe in pizzagate with this idiot who shot up Comet Ping Pong. In simple terms, to smear conspiracy theorists even more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s talk about the lack of hard evidence and why it might be that none has been discovered. IF there actually is a DC human-trafficking ring involved in satanic rituals and the rape and murder of children, wouldn’t it be pretty highly likely that the police, judges, district attorneys, and other powerful and influential people would be in on it? Don’t you think the cover up would be massive and involve blackmail and other shady dealings?
      </p>
      <p>
       My point here is OF COURSE there is no hard evidence of these crimes. If there were such evidence, we would hope that these people would be tried and thrown in jail for the rest of their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ONLY type of person who is going to “weaponize” this conspiracy are complete lunatics or someone being paid to make people who believe look bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while you’re worrying about offending someone or what people think about you, more children will suffer.

       Exactly - what the hell can be done without hard evidence? What SHOULD be done? Perhaps we need to start with specific instances of missing/abused children? Or human trafficking rings? I just don’t think that the pizzagate investigation will achieve anything other than potentially harming innocent people, and at best, harming the reputation of monsters. It seems to drive a huge wedge people otherwise likeminded people... that much I know for certain.

       It depends on your definition of the pizzagate investigation. Does your definition only include Comet Ping Pong and Washington DC? Because I think it’s much much bigger than that, and calling it “pizzagate” is fucking stupid because it makes people who know nothing about it and haven’t researched think that it’s only about one pizza shop in DC. Which is incredibly wrong. The problem is that the thousands of people who have done research and seen the circumstantial evidence that created the conspiracy in the first place are incredibly outnumbered by people who have NOT researched and only know about Pizzagate because some idiot was paid to go to Comet Ping Pong and fire a gun off (for the purpose of discrediting the theories and make all of us look crazy).

       I don’t want to stray from the Podestas and Alefantis, since in my mind they are very distinct for a number of reasons. Big one is the lack of any accusers in the case of pizzagate (that I’m aware of, mind you).

       Thanks again, stranger. I have absolutely no doubt that these rings exist, and I am fully committed to seeing them dismantled and the perpetrators punished (and depending on the nature of their particular crimes, preferably rehabilitated where possible - but I acknowledge that this is itself a controversial opinion).
      </p>
      <p>
       I am mostly interested in how these crimes can be investigated by conspiracy theorists without hurting innocent people (either erroneously targeted or caught in the crossfire). I think it’s safe to say that if Podesta and Alefantis are in fact innocent (and it sounds like you maintain that they very well might be) that they have already been harmed by pizzagate. Do you think it’s possible to engage in these civilian investigations without harming innocent people?
