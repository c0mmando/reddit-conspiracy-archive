       glad about this, and would only hope that it continues to happen to more and more predators like Weinstein.  Unfortunately, I imagine that he's going to be used as a sacrificial, limited hang out goat and the other Hollywood predators (of which I'm sure there are various others) will likely remain behind closed doors.

       Exactly.  A limited hangout through and through.  Weinstein's likely not any sort of exception to the rule.

       He's likely rather indicative of many of his buddies.

       The problem is simple:  He can be hung out to dry as far as the United States is concerned, but there are several additional issues:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Can you get him extradited back to face charges?
      </p>
      <p>
       2) What stops the Hollywood establishment from pipelining targets to the guy?
      </p>
      <p>
       and most importantly...
      </p>
      <p>
       3) What starts happening to a lot of these people like Affleck and Damon and all that stuff?

       ...Wait a minute.  I admit I haven't been keeping up with this 100%, but...did he go somewhere out of the country or something to try to get away from all this ala Roman Polanski?

       I have a feeling Affleck and Damon will likely just lay low, not really comment on this scandal a great deal, let it blow over a bit, and then come back out after people have kind of forgotten about their association with Weinstein.

       1) Word is he's already either done it or is about to try.  All such protection systems have to have an "All Stop".  Meaning, if the legal hammer is about to come down and he can't take getting nailed (or, worse, the entire system), they'll find a way to smuggle him out.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Shouldn't it be obvious, though?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) If this ends up a temporary moment, sure.  If this ends up "tip of the iceberg", especially with Cosby getting at least his name dragged through the mud, etc. ...  Look out.

       Just checked my files.  I don't have any condescending response from you actually.  The last message I have from you before this most recent one here is

       Nothing here I felt was condescending really (if at all actually).

       Confusing me for another response you left to someone else, perhaps?

       Either way, no worries, sir.  All is good.

Honestly they're all there, Morrison, Zappa, the Mommas &amp; the Poppas, the Monkees, Nicholson, Fonda, Manson - and that was just the height of the 60s. It's been going on since the founding of the US and long before in feudal Europe:

       Very good question.  I'm wondering the same thing.  He pissed
       <em>

       off.  I just listened to a reciting from a book Trump wrote the other day about how he "always gets revenge" on others.  Apparently Weinstein did something fucked up to Trump perhaps and Trump wasn't having it.  I don't know.

       I like the track that you are on...he pissed someone off with a lot of power...&amp; I def. wouldn’t put it past Trump BUT the media like The NY Times which started this shit hate Trump so I dont know if they would go along with the character assasination for Trump but I like where your head is at...It’s something along those lines.

       But, as far as Trump goes it is about that time he is going to be using his power rob FUCK UP the people who he thinks did him wrong.

       Many of those people are just as if not more powerful than Trump, however, so he's going to continue to not have an easy time w/whatever he's attempting to do.  If it involves putting pedos and sickos down, however, I'm cool w/his m.o.

       Yeah, I wonder what they are trying to keep Weinstein from doing? Because these kind of attacks usually are to discredit someone that they think is going to do something against their agenda. So, who knows?

       Harvey seems pretty lock step with the establishment so I can't really imagine what. But, it's probably something.

       I don’t know if they were trying to keep him from doing anything in particular so much as simply hanging him out to dry as their public sacrificial limited hangout operation lamb.

       That’s not a bad point either actually.  Maybe it’s a mix of various things.  A bit of what you said on one end,
       <em>

       they needed someone to take the fall for the heat they’ve been getting lately since PizzaGate.

       Well, it's definitely a distraction from The Vegas thing, from Pizzagate, from other stuff we are probably not even aware of,  from all of it...so, I bet they are happy about that.
