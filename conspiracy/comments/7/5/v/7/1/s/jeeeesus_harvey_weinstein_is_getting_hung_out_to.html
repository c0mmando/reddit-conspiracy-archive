<p>In case the heading of this OP might sound ambiguous, I personally am <em>very</em> glad about this, and would only hope that it continues to happen to more and more predators like Weinstein.  Unfortunately, I imagine that he&#39;s going to be used as a sacrificial, limited hang out goat and the other Hollywood predators (of which I&#39;m sure there are various others) will likely remain behind closed doors.</p>

<p>...Wait a minute.  I admit I haven&#39;t been keeping up with this 100%, but...did he go somewhere out of the country or something to try to get away from all this ala Roman Polanski?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What do you mean by targets?  People or scripts?</p>

<p>I have a feeling Affleck and Damon will likely just lay low, not really comment on this scandal a great deal, let it blow over a bit, and then come back out after people have kind of forgotten about their association with Weinstein.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Word is he&#39;s already either done it or is about to try.  All such protection systems have to have an &quot;All Stop&quot;.

<p>2) Shouldn&#39;t it be obvious, though?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1)  Wouldn’t be surprised if he has sufficient protection to keep him from getting <em>too</em> hung out to dry, actually.</p>

<p>2)  It’s sufficiently obvious, unfortunately.</p>

<p>3)  I think it’s definitely a “tip of the iceberg” type of situation, but I also don’t think the system will allow the iceberg to be uncovered since the perpetrators are the very ones in charge of said system.  Disgusting.</p>

<p>Just checked my files.  I don&#39;t have any condescending response from you actually.  The last message I have from you before this most recent one here is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/719ijj/kindlifresserbrunnen_fountain_of_the_eater_of/dn96rh9/?context=3">this one</a> 21 days ago, and then the next ones were from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/70ljcd/kubrick_exposes_bob_hope_in_eyes_wide_shut/dn4cwhm/?context=3">this thread</a> nearly a month ago.</p>

<p>Nothing here I felt was condescending really (if at all actually).</p>

<p>Confusing me for another response you left to someone else, perhaps?</p>

<p>Either way, no worries, sir.  All is good.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good question.  I&#39;m wondering the same thing.  He pissed <em>somebody</em> off.  I just listened to a reciting from a book Trump wrote the other day about how he &quot;always gets revenge&quot; on others.  Apparently Weinstein did something fucked up to Trump perhaps and Trump wasn&#39;t having it.  I don&#39;t know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like the track that you are on...he pissed someone off with a lot of power...&amp; I def. wouldn’t put it past Trump BUT the media like The NY Times which started this shit hate Trump so I dont know if they would go along with the character assasination for Trump but I like where your head is at...It’s something along those lines.</p>

<p>But, as far as Trump goes it is about that time he is going to be using his power rob FUCK UP the people who he thinks did him wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I wonder what they are trying to keep Weinstein from doing? Because these kind of attacks usually are to discredit someone that they think is going to do something against their agenda. So, who knows? </p>

<p>Harvey seems pretty lock step with the establishment so I can&#39;t really imagine what. But, it&#39;s probably something.</p>

<p>I don’t know if they were trying to keep him from doing anything in particular so much as simply hanging him out to dry as their public sacrificial limited hangout operation lamb.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That’s not a bad point either actually.  Maybe it’s a mix of various things.  A bit of what you said on one end, <em>and</em> they needed someone to take the fall for the heat they’ve been getting lately since PizzaGate.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well, these sickos are worse than the mob, and they’re not willing to let each other hang out to dry if it saves their own asses.</p>

<p>I still wonder if it was just random like &quot;Might as well throw Harvey under the bus. He&#39;s got tons of dirt on him. Who cares&quot; or If they specifically targeted him as revenge for something. </p>

<p>Absolutely.  This.  Can not agree more.</p>
