       Look dude, I'm not trying to discredit anything or anyone, but that's a completely invalid answer to anyone asking for a shred of evidence that something may be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never asked for proof to immediately shoot down the theory. I'm simply asking because I would like to understand both sides of the field and come to my own conclusion before I decide to jump ship over to the theorist side.

       What??? You've gotta be shitting me. Okay dude, all validity to what you've said is out the window in my book.
      </p>
      <p>
       Number one, not everything everyone says is some sort of code or conspiracy. Your brain is now hardwired to think that because you've been led to believe there's an ulterior motive to everything from reading into all this tinfoil hat shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Number two, no, I would never be defending the pedophiles or cannibals or whatever else you want to believe. When I said "both sides of the field" I meant the people who believe the theory and the people who don't.

       WikiLeaks uses a very thorough method of verifying any information they receive. They have never been proven to publish a false document in over a decade of existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best evidence, though, is that Podesta basically admitted that they were his.

       is at all reliable. Everyone is acting like I'm attacking them when I ask any questions that contest the narrative. Sorry if I'm late on the Pizzagate thing but it's a conspiracy, it's still talked about, and this is a conspiracy subreddit. There really shouldn't be any issue.

       I suppose if you were here a year ago, you'd understand our reaction. We were inundated with shills, correct the record, shareblue, and other HRC/democratic fan boys who would defend Podesta, then pedos in general. I think this sub suffered from PG fatigue after us 'truthers' were beat down.

       Only thing we know for sure there is that Podesta hasn't denied them being real. Hillary hasn't denied them being real. Obama hasn't denied them being real. Only thing we've heard any of them say is that Russia hacked the election and that Wikileaks are bad. And considering the campaign they got going in the US to supress everything that comes out of Wikileaks, one can only come to the conclusion that they are real. Wikileaks has so far NEVER released false papers.

       I don't believe so. Put it this way: if you were gonna frame your friend for murder, you wouldn't write a letter saying "Yeah I killed that guy behind 7/11 last night with a shotgun." You'd probably make it much deeper, something that the investigators and people involved would a lot of spend time with because that would throw them off your trail and lead them into a wild goose chase. Some sort of cryptic messages or a note-to-self style letter detailing how the framed person feels about the murder but not outright saying "I did it."

       Yes, the Podesta emails. I read a few earlier about color-coded handkerchiefs and a one slice of pizza cut thinly for multiple people. I assume that the pizza means a child they're about to cannibalize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's why I'm a skeptic: why would they make it so blatantly obvious? Why not say "Hey how many people are going to be there so I know how many slices we're gonna need?" It looks innocent, doesn't lead anyone to believe anything other than a real pizza party, and still gets the ulterior message across.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think, personally, that someone doctored the emails. It does strike me as odd that Julian Assange is immediately public enemy number one with the Clinton administration all of the sudden. That could be because they're being called pedophiles and people don't like being called that.

       Cannabalism was never really part of the pizzagate narrative; besides the one portrait in podestas office that supposedly depicts  cannabalism, and anecdotal evidence that satanists do it too, there isn't anything that definitively ties cannabalism to the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the pizzagate narrative is a factual narrative, then the multiple people sharing a piece of pizza is more than likely describing group sex with one abused kid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately there's a lot of evidence out there you will probably never see, not like we saw it. For example, when this shit storm first broke you could go to goggle maps, look up besta pizza, which is on the same block as comet, and you could see the boy lover signal right there in google maps plain as day, the same symbol the FBI released years earlier. A few days later besta had redone that logo. There's other examples of other restaurants doing the same thing, and twitter profiles that used to be public that no longer are. Editorials in newspapers describing the artistic tastes of the podestas that have since been pulled down. Things like that.

       Why has no one included in the leaked emails said they're fake? They even claim in the emails there was a leak and the fact they're balding it all on Russia, even though they admit it was an internal leak in the emails. Theyre 100% real.

       I've already said that I plan on researching what is presented to me. I'm trying to have a discussion here, and I'm trying to contest everyone's perceptions of proof with what I feel is a valid argument against it.

       The problem is that it seems one-sided. I'm willing to listen to the theories and ponder over what you're telling me, but it seems like the majority of the people here don't want to even think about listening to anything that says this theory might not be true.

       Wikileaks verified every e-mail using DKIM and add to the fact that not one person has come out officially calling them fake. Wikileaks has a 100% accuracy in published leaks because they take the time to have irrefutable proof it is legitimate. In fact, CNN tried to lead you to believe it was illegal to even look at them. If you had been in on it at the start and seen the censoring and scrubbing of information real time like a lot of folks did, there would be no doubt in your mind we have pedophiles in our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, Franklin Files should clear up any doubt that pedophiles exist in the top parts of our government. Dennis Hastert scandal (friends of Podesta go figure) Jeffrey Epstein, etc etc. Look into it but don't get pidgeon holed into looking at just comet ping pong. It is just one piece of the state sanctioned pedophilia puzzle.

       On I absolutely believe beyond a shadow of a doubt that pedophiles exist heavily in Hollywood and government. As of now, I just don't think Pizzagate in particular is exactly true. It feels like someone created these emails to bring light to the pedophilia problem in the government.  Someone wanted to draw attention to a serious problem by mocking up a leak and getting the public to open their eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just what it feels like right now. I'm going to read into every suggestion given to me. I go back and watch YouTube clips of CNN, FOX, NBC, Vice, and whoever else had news coverage on it. I will compare and contrast and I will draw my own conclusion.

       You don't have to do anything like that to know they are real. The DKIM signature is how they are proved to be authentic e-mails from john podesta's gmail account. The other e-mails are from Clinton's official government e-mail. Don't you think the easiest way to have discredited these e-mails would of been to call them fake? They can't because they are 100% confirmed through technology.
      </p>
      <p>
       The argument is whether the codewords are about pedophilia or not. But if you look into George Webb, he takes the e-mails and goes in a total different direction about rat lines of drugs, guns and human trafficking from e-mail sources and etc. There is a lot to look into but the authenticity of the e-mails can be verified by learning just a little bit about DKIM and how it is used to verify data.

       Podesta and Hillary basically admitted they were real. Whenever the contents were brought up (in a debate with Hillary, Trump tweets about it to Podesta), both Podesta and Hillary pointed to Russia and how it's unethical to view material if it was collected by a foreign government. They never denied the authenticity.

       The emails could be fake or real, it doesnt matter, they pointed us to their art collection, their instagrams, their satanic connections, the rat lines and the code language,  even if they werent real they are relevant, PIZZAGATE is real withouth a doubt at this point, the emails are real too.

       No, I administer an email server with opendkim, I know how it works. Do you know about Dennis Hastert? He was 3'rd in line to presidency as speaker of the house. What he was convicted of was only the tip of the iceberg.
