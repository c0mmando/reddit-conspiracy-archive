       I think nobody was shot, but I will not look for the video that is posted inside "bestgore .com" supposedly there is one, I rather not browse that site my brother died too recently and he used to love it.  Warning that site shows extreme real life gore.

       Because no one got shot at this drill/hoax. It's really quite simple. People want to play the part of "clever sleuth" who is "woke" and realizes that there were multiple shooters, when this is a talking point designed to intentionally confuse and obfuscate that is being promoted by the event's very own crisis actors and broadcast on mainstream television news.
      </p>
      <p>
       But yeah, you can't have multiple shooters if you can't even prove a single shot was fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have definite crisis actors, we have symbolic elements, we have drills taking place, everything we see at prior hoaxes with no real deaths. Why would they need crisis actors if anyone got shot? There would be real grieving families. Why would it matter if anyone claims they know someone who died if there really were a mass shooting on this scale? It would be obvious enough anyway thanks to the mountain of conclusive evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       We even have multiple people on video saying "it's not a real gun" and "bunch of fake gunshots" and my personal favorite "it doesn't really look like anybody is actually injured."
      </p>
      <p>
       A post called "MULTIPLE SHOOTERS PROVED" or something like that reached the top of the first page, yet people who want to investigate why we should even think shots were fired are pilloried. People still actually point to the fake Liveleak aftermath video as "proof" that people got shot. Not only is it weak and fake, but it's been out since like day 2. If it were a real shooting we would have 30 other videos which actually show any bullet damage, gunshot wounds, or medical response.

       There was plenty of video of people getting shot, and or laying on the ground with their brains blown out. These were posted in the early hours of it all here on Reddit. 
It was pretty well determined by even hardcore conspiracy buffs here that PEOPLE DID DIE. Violently. The conspiracy now is just, why?
      </p>
      <p>
       LV is being considered a false flag- people die so an agenda of some sort is pushed. 
A HOAX is when the whole thing is staged and no one dies. Literally almost no one is claiming LV is a hoax.

       Dude, I was up all night following every turn of the event here as it happened, as videos were uploaded. I clicked on visceral videos I wish I hadn't. Did I bookmark or save them? No. Why the fuck would I? Am I going to search for you when you can do it yourself? No. Maybe someone else will take you up on your offer- but not me

       But let me guess, you believe in the bible as literal record even though it's been transcribed by leaders and holy men crafting a narrative for centuries? There's no video of Christ riding from the grave either.

       Seen them all pretty much, neutral observer and would have to say that if there was a video of that, we would all know. Did see one with a young woman badly injured in the head, bleeding, but not the way you describe it.

       I try to avoid videos with gore and I had the same question. So, a few days ago I looked up "vegas shooting funeral" and there were a number of links to various local news stations around the country reporting on local victims. I watched some of their coverage and now I'm fairly certain people did die.

       One thing you see is people who show up to unnecessarily remind people the difference between a false flag and a hoax, as if we don't know that already. Yes we know hoax means fake. Fake deaths, fake actors, fake stories. It's still a false flag operation because it's an attack that's blamed on someone other than who is staging it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something else that's amusing is the idea that "Paddock had other shooters who were supposed to show up, but they didn't, so he just tried to carry out the plan the best he could."  Lol what? That's seriously something that someone just made up. There's nothing to suggest this whatsoever and even the details we get from the "investigation" are probably red herrings anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prove that a bullet hit anything or anyone and then you can make up bizarre speculations that somehow get taken more seriously than the logical position at this point, which is that it was staged fakery from beginning to end.

       I did find it odd yesterday when I watched several videos of the shootings that I never heard people wailing out in pain? Initial shots,. people start running, but nobody is screaming out in pain. Nobody is doing the death wail. It should have sounded like a scream fest but it was eerily quiet.

       It's an outdoors event with 22000 people. The shooting occuring in the middle of all the people. Screaming would go upwards and the people around them would dampen the sound going lateral.

       Once you see one crisis actor you can almost guarantee no one was really hurt. Actors aren't going to agree to stand around in an open area where people are actually getting shot "but don't worry he won't shoot you, you're wearing a lapel pin." Yeah right.

       There was actually a video of a guy checking on people shot after the crowd dispersed and the shooting stopped. There were definitely people shot. The video was uploaded to liveleak but was deleted due to violating some rules. Which is really weird  because liveleak has videos of beheadings and those never get deleted

       I work for a casino and although it's not in Vegas, our company has many properties in Vegas. We all got an email full of pictures of a victim who works for our company in Vegas and were prompted to donate to the victims. He just got taken off of the ventilator at the hospital and luckily is going to survive. He is a bartender in Vegas. Did the FBI infiltrate my companies email infrastructure and invent that employee and falsify pictures of him in the hospital?

       Why would they need to do that when they can just get a staffer with a Reddit account to invent a story out of thin air that they work for a casino who has a Vegas branch where a bartender was shot but luckily is going to survive.

       I'm not arguing. I'm just letting you know that you're paranoid and absolutely out of touch with reality. I don't care what you think and I'll leave it be now. Conspiracies DO happen. Our government IS fucked up, but people like you are the reason "conspiracy theorists" is synonymous with "nut jobs" and generally get a bad rap. You're so wrapped up in your little fantasy world that you're actually sick if what you said a few minutes ago is an actual belief of yours.

       I actually agree with this guy. But my question is how much proof is enough? When will this sub say, okay that guy is dead? Because remember in this day and age, everything can be faked.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ultimate proof would be a camera phone recording the shooting, staying with that person till they died on camera, with the person to the hospital, dissection, cause of death, and burial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we expect that for each victim?
