    <div class="md"><p>Because no one got shot at this drill/hoax. It&#39;s really quite simple. People want to play the part of &quot;clever sleuth&quot; who is &quot;woke&quot; and realizes that there were multiple shooters, when this is a talking point designed to intentionally confuse and obfuscate that is being promoted by the event&#39;s very own crisis actors and broadcast on mainstream television news.</p>

<p>But yeah, you can&#39;t have multiple shooters if you can&#39;t even prove a single shot was fired.</p>

<p>We have definite crisis actors, we have symbolic elements, we have drills taking place, everything we see at prior hoaxes with no real deaths. Why would they need crisis actors if anyone got shot? There would be real grieving families. Why would it matter if anyone claims they know someone who died if there really were a mass shooting on this scale? It would be obvious enough anyway thanks to the mountain of conclusive evidence. </p>

<p>We even have multiple people on video saying &quot;it&#39;s not a real gun&quot; and &quot;bunch of fake gunshots&quot; and my personal favorite &quot;it doesn&#39;t really look like anybody is actually injured.&quot;</p>

<p>A post called &quot;MULTIPLE SHOOTERS PROVED&quot; or something like that reached the top of the first page, yet people who want to investigate why we should even think shots were fired are pilloried. People still actually point to the fake Liveleak aftermath video as &quot;proof&quot; that people got shot. Not only is it weak and fake, but it&#39;s been out since like day 2. If it were a real shooting we would have 30 other videos which actually show any bullet damage, gunshot wounds, or medical response.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was plenty of video of people getting shot, and or laying on the ground with their brains blown out. These were posted in the early hours of it all here on Reddit. 
It was pretty well determined by even hardcore conspiracy buffs here that PEOPLE DID DIE. Violently. The conspiracy now is just, why? </p>

<p>LV is being considered a false flag- people die so an agenda of some sort is pushed. 
A HOAX is when the whole thing is staged and no one dies. Literally almost no one is claiming LV is a hoax. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One thing you see is people who show up to unnecessarily remind people the difference between a false flag and a hoax, as if we don&#39;t know that already. Yes we know hoax means fake. Fake deaths, fake actors, fake stories. It&#39;s still a false flag operation because it&#39;s an attack that&#39;s blamed on someone other than who is staging it. </p>

<p>Something else that&#39;s amusing is the idea that &quot;Paddock had other shooters who were supposed to show up, but they didn&#39;t, so he just tried to carry out the plan the best he could.&quot;  Lol what? That&#39;s seriously something that someone just made up. There&#39;s nothing to suggest this whatsoever and even the details we get from the &quot;investigation&quot; are probably red herrings anyway. </p>

<p>Prove that a bullet hit anything or anyone and then you can make up bizarre speculations that somehow get taken more seriously than the logical position at this point, which is that it was staged fakery from beginning to end. </p>

<p>Why would they need to do that when they can just get a staffer with a Reddit account to invent a story out of thin air that they work for a casino who has a Vegas branch where a bartender was shot but luckily is going to survive.</p>

<p>The ultimate proof would be a camera phone recording the shooting, staying with that person till they died on camera, with the person to the hospital, dissection, cause of death, and burial.</p>

<p>Do we expect that for each victim?</p>
