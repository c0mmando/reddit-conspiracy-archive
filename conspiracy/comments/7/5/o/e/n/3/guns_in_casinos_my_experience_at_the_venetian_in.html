      <p>
       My dad used to live outside Kingman, Arizona and we would fly into Las Vegas and drive down for a couple days' visit and then go back to Vegas and stay there for a couple of days before flying home.  Dad's place abutted a huge tract of BLM land in the Hualapai foothills and before this trip he got a side-by-side ATV so we planned a half-day excursion into the back country.  I brought my GPS and a .44 Magnum revolver, mostly because it was fun to shoot outside and partly because the back country is weird.
      </p>
      <p>
       To meet TSA regulations, I packed and checked my gun in a briefcase-sized locking aluminum case.  Not very low key, it looks like you're either carrying a gun or the launch codes for nuclear missiles.  But it's super locked -- it has a stainless steel rod that passes through fixed eyeholes and the padlock prevents the rod from being retracted.  I also add a trigger lock to the gun in case the case was breached/stolen so the gun is made all that harder to use/access, plus I can't be accused of carrying a usable gun because its further locked and unloaded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, dad and I did our thing, however I managed to lose my normal prescription eyeglasses somewhere out on the back country and it was too far out to go find them, so I would have to get a new pair made in Vegas.  I still had my prescription glasses (mirrored Ray Ban Aviators) which I had to wear to see at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       We pull up to the Venetian and a bellhop starts unpacking our car.  My wife plans to go drop the car off at the airport since we won't need it in Vegas.  He immediately notices my gun case and ask "Is that a gun?"  I told him it was, and I wanted it checked into the hotel safe or with security.  He said "Yeah, you'll have to.  They will spot you and give you grief if you don't.  I  can call them for you."  He took our names and our bags except for my gun case and went away.  My wife took off for the car rental return.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my 5 year old son and I walked into the lobby, expecting to be met by security.  Nothing happens so we go to the check in.  We checked into the hotel and I told the clerk I had something I needed to check with security (I didn't say gun).  The clerk totally blew me off and said there was a safe in the room.  I said I didn't want it in the room, but with hotel security.  She told me there was a security office just across the casino floor (!), and I wondered how far I'd make it without getting in serious trouble or possibly arrested.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making it all weirder, I'm wearing mirrored aviators, carrying a locked aluminum briefcase...and toting a 5 year old boy by the hand.  Anyway, I start for the direction of the security office.  Sure enough, we get stopped by an armed guard who tells us to stay right where we are (very calm).  I explained I had a firearm in the case and I wanted to check it with security.
      </p>
      <p>
       A security supervisor came up and began asking questions.  I told her we had just arrived and I had a firearm I wanted to check with security.  She said yes, you need to check it with us, talked into her radio and both the first guard and the supervisor escorted us into the service area, and then down to the security office.
      </p>
      <p>
       They opened the case, wrote out the serial number to the gun, gave me an official security receipt and it got locked back in my case and stored in a giant locking cabinet in the security office.  Then they took us back up to our floor and we went to the room to wait for my wife to come back from dropping the car off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm assuming they spotted me on security (sunglasses?  gun case?  5 year old?) and didn't want me wandering around.  I don't know that the bellhop contacted security or not.  I thought it was strange when the check in clerk totally blew off my security request.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we left (on a Monday) I had to back to the security desk in the casino, present my receipt and they walked me down to the security office, checked the receipt vs. the gun (it was locked, I had the key, and my name and address are engraved into the case, but I like the thoroughness).  I met the security chief of the hotel then and said they get shooters all the time, but insist on locking guns up for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I told him about my check-in experience and he wrote down the date/time details and said "she blew it".  And I got an armed escort to the cab queue, I guess to make sure I didn't wander around the property with my double-locked gun.

       I'm not at all sure what the point of posting this on this subreddit is. If you're trying to compare it to the lv shooting it's apples and oranges. You walked in with an obvious gun case. Vs someone throwing them in regular luggage

       Just a real world example of how closely monitored just walking into the main lobby of a casino with a potential gun case.  Yes it was "obviously" a gun case, but mostly it was just a briefcase sized case, and I had a 5 year old with me, so not exactly fitting the hazard definition.

       you made a big deal out of it. Security didn’t approach you, you approached them. This lunatic put his guns in regular ass suitcase. i’m sorry but wtf are you posting about? one experience with one hotel where you ask the security to store your gun.

       He just needed to be relevant. I'm not sure why he felt we needed to know he left his glasses and was wearing sunglasses...or that he was walking with a 5yr old lol.

       No, I never approached security directly.  I wanted to, but the check-in woman blew me off and told me to use the room safe.  The bell-hop out the driveway suggested it, but I don't think he ever followed through.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way they likely knew to approach me was on video -- the guard who did approach me came from down that long hallway the leads from the main lobby to the casino, so he wasn't watching me from some post in the lobby.  He had to be told to come intercept me.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point generally is that they're more aware of what's going on on their security cameras, and in theory Paddock bringing in an abnormal amount of luggage possibly could have triggered someone to say "What's up with that?"

       Who says what an abnormal amount of luggage is? Who defines that? People bring all kinds of luggage, boxes and bags into the hotel. They aren't going to stop a guy (let alone a regular) for having a lot of normal looking luggage. It doesn't happen. You had a gun case lol. Bell hop saw it. You made a big deal out of it. Why even bring it in the first place? Your story doesn't relate. Come back again when u have walked through the lobby with ten pieces of luggage on a luggage cart and get stopped. Prior to this event...it wouldn't happen. I have seen a couple who had their luggage cart filled to the top. Casinos don't hassle their guest...they can always leave and take business somewhere else.

       Oh alright I gotcha. I came across earlier like i didn’t care at all about your experience at the venetian. And I apologize for that. Yeah i mean in theory someone could have been suspicious of him. The methodology this asshole took to plan this, it wouldn’t surprise me if he did a trial run to the hotel several times with (X ) amount of luggage to see just how much shit he could bring in at a time.  People bring all kinds of shit into hotels. Guns, drugs, dildos, all kinds of unmentionables to a stranger, personal weird shit, you name it. I envision TSA style X-ray/thermal/infrared/ type security and some “random” security examinations in the future for ALL OF THE MAJOR CASINOS in Vegas. Just like at the airport you have no choice to go through the x-ray scanner, metal detector, etcetera. In the end when you travel through America to anywhere area/private property/concert venue/etc with over 5,000 people in a one square kilometer area; you will be subject to TSA style screening. After that it’s cctvs everywhere in America next just like Europe. You won’t be able to go anywhere untracked. It will be illegal to disguise yourself to trick the cameras from recognizing your face or digital biometric fingerprint. It will be a felony to alter this finger and you will be jailed indefinitely without counsel. Ok that’s all i got. lol

       Given how systematic he was, he probably DID do practice runs.   At a minimum he could have spaced out his runs for luggage over several hours so each additional piece was like "Oh, I forgot that one" and he's never seen with all of them at once.

       I was wondering if anyone had any experiences of walking into the casinos/hotels with a gun without informing anyone and got stopped...are you allowed to carry in LV? There's rules about concealing them I know but if maybe someone had one in a suitcase and was stopped before all this. I'll do homework at some point but I'd like to see if they do have all this detection equipment and if someone got caught with it.

       Ok anyway...back to lurking.

       I have a valid CCW and live in Las Vegas, NV.  I carry EVERYWHERE that's legal.  In NV, "no gun" signs don't hold weight of law, so if a restaurant or hotel has a sign that says "No guns" there's nothing legally binding me to keep my guns out; However, if they find out I'm carrying (they would need to wand me or me pass through a metal detector) all they can do is ask me to leave, if I refuse, then I can be charged for tresspassing.  The only restricted places are government buildings and schools.

       I have walked ALL over the strip in Las Vegas, including the casino floors of numerous hotels and casinos here.  I have also been up to some of the rooms when friends/family visit and stay on the strip.  Every time, I'm carrying, and I've never been stopped or questioned by anyone.

       I honestly don't think any of the hotels have any way of knowing what people are carrying on them or in their bags.  MAYBE some of the large ones have some way of checking if a bag has large amounts of metal in it or something, but if you're bringing in 1 rifle at a time, I don't even know if it'd be able to register, but maybe, who knows, I haven't tested trying to bring one of my AR's into a hotel before.

       Ooh, Aviator glasses
Making you and the kid walk around like that is weird, and so is the check-in gal misguiding you. Also, I thought children were not allowed on the Casino floor. I know this because me and the kid were exploring tourists, wanting to check out a river boat Casino, and were told children were not allowed.

       I wonder if the new laws will allow for confiscation.
