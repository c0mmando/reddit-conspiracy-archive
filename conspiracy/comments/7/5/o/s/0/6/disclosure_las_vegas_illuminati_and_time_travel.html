        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With the recent shooting in Vegas and the reveal of the &quot;Las Vegas&quot; card from the 1995 Illuminati card game I&#39;ve started to question whether we may actually have been visited many times by time travelers to try and warn us of our future. </p>

<p>Some background if you&#39;re unsure of what I&#39;m talking about.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati_(game)">In 1995 a card game was created titled <em>Illuminati</em> By Stephen Jackson</a>
The game is basically like any other card game where the goal is to win over your opponents. The strange thing is many of the cards have seemingly offhandedly predicted events in the future through the artwork.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://imgur.com/a/ciHKx">9/11 Terrorist Attack</a></li>
<li><a href="https://imgur.com/a/ItZiU">Princess Diana and the Paparazzi</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://imgur.com/a/yodrj">The Fukushima disaster</a></li>
<li><a href="https://imgur.com/a/8kg11">Las Vegas</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Now I want to focus mainly on the last point here, the &quot;Las Vegas&quot; card. Looking at the card it doesn&#39;t seem to have very much to do with anything, BUT if you look at the cards beginning with the </p>

<p>Jack = 10</p>

<p>Ace = 1 (or 11)</p>

<p>Combined we can get the date of 10/1 (The date of the Las Vegas massacre). </p>

<p>Now this in itself isn&#39;t much and I myself would chalk this up to merely a coincidence (like people tend to do with all conspiracy theories) but the card becomes even more peculiar when we have a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/odrZU">look at Jason Aldean&#39;s tattoo</a>, the singer that was on stage at the time of the shooting.</p>

<p>Now for the last part. </p>

<p>Roughly 45 minutes before the shooting began a witness claims <a href="https://youtu.be/g21RVXgQdwE">a man and woman tried to warn concert goers that &quot;they were going to die&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>On top of that we also know that the security guard was supposedly alerted to the 32nd floor NOT because of a shooter but because a door was conveniently left open?</p>

<p>With some of these clues could it be possible that this man and woman were from the future and tried to actually warn people of what was about to occur? Did someone purposefully leave a door open on the 32nd floor before the shooting took place? Thinking about the connection to Jason Aldean&#39;s tattoo and the &quot;Las Vegas&quot; card from the Iluminati game is it possible that since that card was created 20+ years ago that someone from the future was subtly trying to leave clues about what would happen in our future.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that people from the future <em>are</em> visiting or have visited us in the past and left us clues in <a href="https://youtu.be/g21RVXgQdwE">movies</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/41FRnNDZkuI">tv shows</a>, card games and literature, WHY? Why would the they (the Illuminati) do this? My guess?</p>

<p><strong>DISCLOSURE</strong></p>

<p>When the time comes to bring about disclosure they will use these clues as a way to prove to us that they have travelled into our past and tried to &quot;warn us&quot;, &quot;change history&quot;, etc. That they were the &quot;good guys&quot; trying to help humanity. </p>

<p>Now I have my own thoughts on what their goal may be when it comes to disclosure and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good (do not trust the deceivers) but I believe that they will claim that all these clues they have left us will be just one of the many ways to prove their legitimacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we stick with my theory of time travel they are leaving clues based off of Aldeans&#39;s tattoo etc. Everything has already happened, they have already seen these events so the clues they leave won&#39;t be changed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate a good conspiracy theory as much as the next Coast to Coast AM listener, unfortunately I need to look at facts to build up to the narrative, not a narrative built fittest and then select my facts. </p>

<p>But don&#39;t get me wrong, the imagery of the Route 91 10/1 Harvest flyer is quite suspect. Literally looks like bullet holes drawn into the staging lights. The Luxor pyramid in the background etc. The day after (((Yom Kippur))) and the ending ritual sacrifice performed to close out the holiday (Holy-Day). 32nd floor (Masonic numerology) etc.</p>

<p>Im just glad the public is more awoke now and not giving as much credit to that angle and is mainly focusing on the actual shooting and disinfo campaign the FBI is running.</p>

<p>Removes a bit of the intrigue and &quot;romance&quot; of it all, but I&#39;m cool with that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What really boggles my mind about what&#39;s going on now is that I started watching COsmic Disclosure about a year ago, with Corey goode, the guy who calims to be a secret space program whistleblower, and the things he&#39;s said AGES ago seem to be playing out now, with the disclosure stuff, like the things about the elite being perverted, sexual abuse, the alien thing, even the rise in earthquakes and hurricanes and stuff. Is the guy legitimate? Is he being brainwashed and used as a tool by someone? It&#39;s just crazy to me. And kind of exciting, I&#39;m glad the world and reality isn&#39;t as boring as I thought it was! And when you thin about it, why would it be?!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would say it&#39;s just a normal tattoo. The significance is probably personal to him. But I kept trying to rationalize all these &quot;illuminati&quot; coincidences and clues and as these people being an insider as a part of a plan etc. and to think that all these TV shows and writers etc were leaving clues as they were a part of it and &quot;in on it&quot; seemed a bit far fetched (like time travel isn&#39;t? I know this is too but it&#39;s a fun theory). </p>

<p>My theory is that these events already happened and they were warning us in the past so the details don&#39;t change like the tattoo etc. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea its a crazy idea to entertain but there are definitely more probable theories out there. Gun runner or money launderer really seem to fit the events.

<p>And this page, which discusses it specifically in the context of the Vietnam war:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The story we heard was that the Vietnamese were inveterate card players--and that was true; I saw mamasans playing cards many, many times in any shade that was available--and that some of the common superstitions about certain cards had penetrated Vietnamese culture, by way of the French. For instance, the Ace of Spades was a death card. The Queen of Hearts was a love card. <em>The Jack of Spades represented an enemy.</em>&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I enjoy reading this, but a Jack = 11, not 10. A 10 = 10. But then with those numbers you now have 11,11 or 11,1. I don&#39;t know if that means anything of itself, but I know about synchronicity and this - in my opinion - looks more like synchronicity. Potentially could be predictive programming (is that the right word?). But I think time travellers, in this specific case at least, isn&#39;t likely. I mean, there&#39;s just too many variables to be able to assume either way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep we know hardly ANYTHING about anything, especially as TPTB have ensured that we&#39;re lied to about so much. When you realise just how much you used to believe about the world that turned out to be lies coming from the media, you realise that ANYTHING is up for grabs. Especially looking at some of these declassified CIA files that talk about paranormal things and other stuff they obviously seriously investigate and put time and resources into investigating, you realise that it&#39;s not because they&#39;re nuts, it&#39;s because when you don&#39;t have societal structures shutting down the possibilities of what reality truly is or could be, investigating those things IS serious, and there&#39;s no reason to flat out deny the existence of time travel or telepathy or anything, especially not without serious investigation!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it much more likely that the planners of these attacks created the card game. These events have been planned well ahead of time. Those at the top of the hierarchy pull the strings of the visible leaders while covertly maintaining power over millenia. They maintain their power due to the fact that most people are ignorant of their existence and so continue to buy into their ponzi schemes and willingly become their footsoldiers in manufactured wars / conflicts. A great example of this is Amazon; they operate at a loss to get rid of all competition which is only enabled by the fact that they are backed by the deep state and its nigh unlimited funds. Now they have massive data on most people&#39;s consumption habits feeding into supercomputers which are constantly running probability scenarios on how future events will pan out so that they can optimally maintain power from their position of relatively small numbers. If people knew the full implications of saving that dollar or two by using Amazon they never would do it, but most are already strained enough as it is so any savings are welcomed. The same can be said of Google, Facebook, GM, GE, etc. </p>

<p>Through corporate hegemony they achieve economic control which allows them to more easily afford the means to mind control assets from birth to carry out their large scale sacrifices such as 9/11, Fukushima, vegas, etc. These events were all perpetrated by the same groups: the aristocratic bloodlines (black nobility, house of windsor, germanic and austrian noble lines, etc) who possibly receive marching orders from an extraterrestrial bloodline that have covertly ruled for millenia (e.g the Annunaki). </p>

<p>These people have no power outside the power we give them. Awareness of the location and causes of a sickness is the first step towards curing oneself. Boycott the deep state controlled companies, grow your own food and harvest rain water, invest in means of achieving grid independence (wind power, ion harvesting, solar, etc). Create local systems of barter to remove oneself from dependence of the fiat money ponzi schemes. These are how we extricate ourselves from their control matrix. Fighting it is futile, creating our own systems to transcend it is the only viable option.  </p>
