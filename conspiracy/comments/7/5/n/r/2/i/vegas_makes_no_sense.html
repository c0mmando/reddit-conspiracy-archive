       This is my first post ever but this is bothering me so much. The official narrative has changed so much in the past few days, which I 100% expected, but this shooting feels much more weighted than the others. First, there's video evidence of shots being fired before the automatic starts, but that's not talked about. Neither are the two shots that occurred after the automatic fire stops.
      </p>
      <p>
       The timeline is fucked. Why would Campos not call in being shot at by 200 automatic rounds? Not to mention being hit? Why is there no record of him even existing? Why is CNN reporting that the shooter had tracer rounds and incendiary rounds, when previous reports said that he couldn't buy those rounds?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is such a shit post and I know it, but I gotta get my thoughts out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh, not to mention, that all the news about Vegas is completely overshadowed by the whole Weinstein thing. Seriously, had CNN on just to check if the story had changed and it's been several hours since Vegas was even mentioned, no matter how brief.

       Yea, they are really trying to divert people's attention.

       Campos is definitely the biggest question in the entire thing.  They tried to not even mention their change of story regarding Campos, saying it was a minute change?  Give me a break, it was a huge change.

       they can't even prove Campos is a real person. His story has been all over the place.  You'd think he'd be one of the people Trump would most want to meet with in the hospital, being the hero (who didn't call 911 or notify anyone apparently) and all.

       they know that they lost this. they know that we aren't fooled and for once 80-95% (just guessing) of people are questioning something they normally won't, which helps us, because the more people question officials, the more pressure they're under, which causes them to slip up more, giving us more to question.

       On top of that, he had a bulletproof vest, some type of gas mask, and literally thousands of rounds of ammo. He was set to make a stand against police, and even if he was getting overrun and feared going to prison, he could've jumped. The whole "suicide" aspect of this story is some of the biggest bs i've heard.

       He had over an hour he could shoot. he shot for 10 minutes. i get that by the end of those ten minutes, the majority of the crowd would have dispersed. but you still have over 20 rifles with a lot more ammo. IF, and this is purely hypothetical, i was the shooter, id shoot until i had NO other choice. the suicide makes no sense at all.

       Why would they go with such a crazy story as campos being shot at with 200 rounds?? Through a door? 6 minutes before the "main event" even happened? This is the OFFICIAL STORY,  folks! Is this an experiment in cognitive dissonance?  To see if people will believe a story that patently cannot be true? I'm just trying to picture Paddock emptying his magazine then going through nearly SIX MORE magazines,  shooting mindlessly at his hotel door. Surreal.

       THATS THE THING. There wouldn't be a door anymore. 200 rounds from anything, let alone a .223, would decimate that door. There's no door when police breach, if we follow the official story.

       This is every conspiracy. Soooo many holes. So many red flags telling us thins aren't as they are reported or appear.

       LV is great because it looks like they won't be able to cover it up to the main stream people. There simply too much evidence that proves the official story wrong and the official story sounds fuckey to everyone hearing it.

       i just dont get why the shooter would risk letting campos tell anyone. why didnt he go out and off him? you already shot him, you know he cant run away from it, why take the chance to not buy yourself a tiny bit of time, unless the guard was in on it somehow.

       because campos is just another scape goat. if shit really starts to go south they will pull campos in as "under further investigation we found campos to be the second shooter, which is why nothign made sense up until now, amirite guys?"

       Possible theory: Maybe the guy didn't shoot 200 rounds? I have no idea where they're getting that number from but that sounds crazy. Let's say a full 30 clip.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guy fires that much through the door at the guard. Sees the guard drop, assumes he's dead (because no one can survive that volley of fire) and continues with the carnage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a thought. But now that the cops are changing their stories I don't know what to believe anymore.

       Not to mention that they're now saying is check in date was the 25th, not the 28th. This change coming after the picture of a receipt showing he was in the room on the 25th.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is the information not available and accurate right away? I get that early reports can be incorrect based on insufficient data, but that should be an easy thing to check in the system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless he booked one room early, and then upgraded 3 days later.
It's very weird.

       I have been saying this! Nothing seems 'normal' about this shooting compared to previous ones. None of the facts are adding up with photos, statements from victims, etc...
Then the first thing said by the left is gun control, NOT heartfelt sentiments about the shooting. Maybe I'm alone in this thought, but it seems as it was all set up and planned by someone/some group.
