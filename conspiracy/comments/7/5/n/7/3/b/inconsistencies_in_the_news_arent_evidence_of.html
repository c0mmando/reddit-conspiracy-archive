<p>You&#39;re not confused because the powers that be are &quot;scrambling&quot; to create a narrative, you&#39;re confused because you&#39;re living in the digital age of news hysteria and the supply can&#39;t keep up with the demand. The world is now <em>saturated</em> with news outlets and they&#39;re all looking to get the story out <em>first</em> so that they can sell that precious, clickable advertising space on every page refresh.</p>

<p>This leads to confusion not just for the readers, but among the reporters and journalists as well. They print an edited version of what they thought they heard, and often what they actually heard is inaccurate to some degree. When every paper in the country is churning out story after story in a media frenzy, the misinformation is going to produce inconsistency and contradiction.</p>

<p>They say you should never mistake for malice that which can be attributed to incompetence. This is never more true than in the case of the news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t benefit the police. It&#39;s the police purposefully withholding information because a higher up told them to. The reasons alone why that would happen is exactly what makes the Vegas Shooting a peculiar one and one worth investigating. If you disagree then fine, but there have been multiple uncharacteristic slip-ups by the LVPD and other sources. Multiple contradicting stories and irrelevant &quot;facts&quot; about Paddock that we conveniently can&#39;t prove or disprove. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would a &quot;higher up&quot; tell the police to falsely state that Campos was shot after Paddock began his rampage? (This, of course, assumes that Campos being shot <em>before</em> the rampage is <em>truth</em>.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they&#39;re trying to cover what really happened. That&#39;s kinda the point of this sub, to investigate stuff like what they&#39;re doing.

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you&#39;re suggesting that they deliberately planned to change the story, and the police accidentally almost went with the <em>second</em> version first.</p>

<p>Your theory is that the &quot;powers that be&quot; are deliberately creating confusion so that they can &quot;cover up&quot; what <em>really</em> happened. So they have it planned out in advance that they&#39;re going to keep changing the story? And none of this actually happened at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t buy that. I appreciate you debating with me on this, but I just can&#39;t understand how or why it would matter so much that they&#39;d deliberately <em>lie</em> about something that would undoubtedly be corrected sooner if not later.</p>

<p>What narrative is reinforced by Campos being shot <em>after</em> the rampage had begun? If they were deliberately lying about it, what actual purpose does that lie solve?</p>

<p>To believe that they would think that the lie would stick requires that they&#39;re not only nefarious, but incompetent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unless there&#39;s some specific narrative that requires Campos being shot <em>after</em> the firing had begun, it makes more sense to chalk this up to the police not being sure about the sequence of events and then making their best guess for the benefit of the press conference only to wind up being wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the most obvious narrative that requires that is that Campos wasn&#39;t involved in the shooting, and he was injured trying to stop Paddock. But that didn&#39;t happen. He was shot before it started, which raises more questions than it answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody suspects Campos of being <em>involved</em> in the shooting except the conspiracy theorists. Him being shot during or before doesn&#39;t change anything in that regard.</p>

<p>In fact, it makes <em>more</em> sense that he would be shot before, since it coincides with responding to an open-door alarm. A lone security guard would be crazy to approach a room after hearing gunfire coming from it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s possible Campos himself wasn&#39;t sure whether or not Paddock had been firing into the crowd before he arrived and was shot himself. You&#39;re expecting too much from people who had no idea what the hell was even happening at the time.</p>

<p>Nobody is getting confused because of the media. We are watching it directly from press conferenced by the FBI and police. BTW Mandalay Bay just said that the police&#39;s new timeline is wrong. </p>

<p>It would seem like such as easy thing to figure out within 1 hour of watching security footage and asking Campos himself but apparently the police and the hotel can&#39;t develop a solid story. Guess they&#39;re sooooo confused by the media too!</p>

<p>In this case, sources are probably inapplicable. Your reasoning is common-sense (which I personally almost never find compelling and believe no-one should). Hotel patronage is hardly adequate experience since at no point that I know of do the patrons themselves interact with the computers or databases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure how you arrived at that number, but I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a reliable way to determine the percentage of <em>actual</em> errors from the percentage of reviews that mention those errors.</p>

<p>While it&#39;s safe to assume that <em>most</em> check-ins at any given hotel are not in error, I wouldn&#39;t presume to comment on the liklihood of it being possible. Without having any experience <em>working</em> at a place like the Mandalay Bay, it&#39;s impossible for me to know under what kinds of circumstances there might be confusion about what date a specific person checked in. (For instance, let&#39;s imagine that they checked in for a day, checked out, and then checked in again for a week a day after that. If someone asked me to search for when they checked in, what if I only noticed the second and not the first?)</p>

<p>Human error can produce all kinds of problems when trying to relay information. It doesn&#39;t even need to be an actual issue with a reservation. Add on top of that getting that information to the police, to the press, and multiple presses getting it from multiple sources... News reporting in the aftermath of a fiasco like this is guaranteed to produce major inconsistencies.</p>

<p>Goddamn that&#39;s all I&#39;ve been trying to say for 50 comments. I was only trying to speculate on standard operating procedure at MB and nothing else, nothing related to the event. The logical conclusion from that (maybe, at least for me) being that MB had it correctly noted in their computer at one point in time (only).</p>

<p>Your points are reasonable and I agree. If it makes you feel any better, yes there&#39;s a lot of jumping to conclusions and irrationality here, and other nefarious stuff, but this is a diverse community. There is also no grand conspiracy theory consensus here which is pretty interesting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nobody suspects Campos of being <em>involved</em> in the shooting except the conspiracy theorists. Him being shot during or before doesn&#39;t change anything in that regard.</p>

<p>In fact, it makes <em>more</em> sense that he would be shot before, since it coincides with responding to an open-door alarm. A lone security guard would be crazy to approach a room after hearing gunfire coming from it.</p>
