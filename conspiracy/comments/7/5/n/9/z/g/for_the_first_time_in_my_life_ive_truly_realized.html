So many people want to come to the US but it&#39;s really just a police state. Hell but a hell unseen and completely outside of the minds of people. Must be nice for some. Everything is subsidized by the federal government. You are a government corporate asset if you have a birth certificate and a SSN. Just a number in the computer and an asset to be traded and manipulated on the controlled markets. A cow with a branded hide prepped for the slaughter.</p>

<p>Kind of down tonight. Just looking for someone to say something. I have an opportunity but that would mean that I sell my soul. Eat or starve? Have money for a roof or just rough it. Government always makes things seem so shiny but like the devil he will always tempt. It&#39;s a rotten apple in the end.</p>

Once government is over thrown all the technology that&#39;s been suppressed for decades can be released. At least you aren&#39;t mind controlled like the majority of our countries. I live in Canada. :) Keep your head up and start eating better :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly already feel stateless. I am a US citizen and nothing but pain and agony has come from it. Sure I have some privileges but that&#39;s all they are and they can be taken away at anytime. Everything I&#39;ve ever been taught was a lie. I know and can accept this. I had the biggest light bulb moment of my life earlier today. I&#39;m afraid of my own government. I am a prisoner. There are no physical walls but the walls are very real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand your sentiment but the reality is that being stateless is an extremely bad  situation to be in. The U.S isn&#39;t perfect but it remains one of the most free countries in the world and having its citizenship beats statelessness by a long shot. You don&#39;t have much to gain by giving up your American citizenship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you actually do. Being stateless is actually a plus. The US is not free by any means. If you are a citizen you actually have a target on your head. Everything is about implied contract and consent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re stateless, you have no place to live and work permanently and your right to travel is significantly restricted in comparison to being a US citizen.

<p>You also legally lose your right to own arms if you give up your American citizenship. The U.S is one of the few countries that recognizes your right to bear arms; you won&#39;t have that as a stateless person or a citizen of a different country. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve dealt with similar issues. One of the main things that help me sleep is the Constitution.   I know it&#39;s still a long shot but IF shit hit the fan... I think if we are armed, and we band together once the truth becomes apparent... We can use it to overthrow our government and clean house. It may take something drastic to convince everyone to get on board... But we have the right to do so if needed. I&#39;m prob living in a fairytale land but I do think there will be one last push with an armed militia when the time comes. </p>
