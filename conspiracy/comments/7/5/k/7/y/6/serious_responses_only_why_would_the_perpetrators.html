       One died in his arms, the other buddy was shot three times with an assault rifle and is "doing good"? You believe that one could be shot in the chest three times with an AR-15 or M240 and then make an appearance on TV the next day?

       Let's assume the bullets were real and many people died. They have to use crisis actors anyway to control "the narrative," e.g., the story is that Paddock acted alone, so we can't have real witness saying that there were shooters in the crowd or perched elsewhere. We can't have them giving descriptions of other people and events within the event that don't match what they're trying to sell.

       I'm a firm believer in government bullshit and I suspect conspiracies exist all around us, but I have never been able to get on-board with the notion of crisis actors. Honestly, can somebody explain when this idea originated? It seems to me to be too far fetched to believe. I tend to think that conspiracies are not possible when too many are involved...it becomes to complicated to control. In all instances where I have heard this theory, I have thought the people spreading it where nuts.

       Can you watch the video I linked? Every person involved in these hoaxes react in a simliar rage-less, emotionless state. Unlike on local news when you see real crying, rage, terror, fear, tears, etc. You can tell the difference if you pay attention.

       I agree he acts a little strange considering the circumstances but I attribute that more to gender and perhaps personality than acting. I think he seems to be trying to maintain composure and he may be the type that doesn't show emotions. Maybe he has a military background? I have a difficult time showing emotions in front of strangers so I might come off as weird too. I've seen some videos before and I've entertained the idea but it just does not ring true to me. However, I would not doubt that the entire event could have been manufactured on a government level and victims considered simple casualities in the war against citizens.

       You respond to the Craigslist add and show up at the Howard Johnson's Motorcourt Executive Module. You fill in a complete resume so they know everything about you, and you sign certain non-disclosure agreements. Your team leader then tells you what to do, say, and where to stand.

       Sure, you took a paycheck from murderers, they have all your info. You have none. Your point is not clear. Whether or not they know "what disclosure means" they know that they are in danger and more likely to keep their mouths shut. What is your point?

       Not likely. Somebody with more resources would be more likely to disclose. The dispossessed former middle class, under educated, medicated, easily manipulated, would be better candidates. All they want to do is disappear into the woodwork and, yes, they should be scared.

       No offense, but you seen to think you are special, and above others. Have a bit of compassion.

       I disagree. In my opinion, people with resources have wealthy families to protect, and the punishment is more than just defying an agreement.

       The only reason I notice this, is because a homeless, teen political shill yelled about her experiences on a local street corner. The poor gal didn't even have enough bus money to get back to her home state.

       You are like a broken lens. On one hand you make things clearer and I agree and on the other hand you obfuscate and reverse causality, shattered. What does compassion have to do with anything in this discussion? I don't give a fuck about being special: we
       <strong>
        all are
       </strong>
       if we give ourselves permission and detox. You are coo coo. Why would a wealthy sibling protect any more vehemently than a poor person? You see, you have revealed your elitist tendencies. Most of the conscripted Soros robots I've met were incongruently faithful to the operators who turned and employed them, almost imprinted like baby geese. What technologies can do that? It certainly isn't in the public domain.

       False flag does NOT mean that the event itself is false or that it was fake or that it didn't happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       False flag simply means that one element disguises it's actions to appear as though perpetrated by another element.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speculation here that letters acted to create a false flag event and attribute the actions to a non letters individual, entity, etc.
