       If you have Facebook (some do, some don't. Don't make a big deal out of it), you'll know what I'm talking about. Tons of people are sharing and discussing links/threads and posting statuses questioning the legitimacy of the shooting, mainly the "lone wolf" narrative. People I NEVER thought would be opening their eyes to conspiracy theories are starting to embrace them now.
      </p>
      <p>
       With each false flag that happens, more and more people wake up. The cabal knows this obviously, and they have no choice but to press forward with this, hoping were too distracted and busy with work and bills and tv to probe into the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a bonus, the newly awakened people who are studying false flags will be more open to looking at PAST events, particularly 9/11. Once we get enough people to question and demand a 9/11 investigation, things will REALLY start heating up and looking good for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       All while this goes on, The NWO struggles to get us to hate each other. Struggles to push forward with Orwellian bills and struggles to get the conservatives and theorists to trust their new puppet president.
      </p>
      <p>
       AND, the noose around their neck tightens as they're backed into a corner regarding the pedogate and pizzagate findings that exposed an entire can of worms about how governments, politicians, prime ministers, Hollywood moguls, and tons of others are coerced into power by promises of sadistoc sex acts with children, and the blackmail "glue" that keeps this whole shitty sinking ship barely afloat 😂
      </p>

       To the shills and any elite cocksuckers reading, go choke on a big fat bag of fresh dicks you defective human fuck ups 🖕

       I go to Berkley COM. Usually full of stuffy egotistical musicians. The group I hang out with are what you could call the "cool kids", the stoner, self taught musicians who hate the establishment. They're telling me even some of the professors are talking about this in the hallways. Crazy times.

       Any time a
       <em>
        whole bunch of people

       get caught up in something and basically agree on it, my anti-hysteria sense kicks in and I'm suddenly reminded that I think most people are fucking stupid. If "most people" think there's a conspiracy, I'm inclined to side with the fact that there probably isn't, or if there is, it's not the retarded and nonsensical one that they're all getting behind.

       I feel bad for people growing up now because they never truly have time alone to formulate their own thoughts and opinions. They just jump on on the latest bandwagon of whoever or whatever is most agreeable to them and get swept up in this paranoid, angry internet mob.
 But I don't think it's going to limit itself to just the internet for too much longer, you can already see it crossing over. As a younger person it makes me feel scared and hopeless. People over 40 don't really care either way because they know they're gonna die soon anyway. What can you do, right? Try to keep your head down I guess

       That is hilarious. If you're 40 there's a good chance you could still have another 40-60 years. Plus people over 40 have kids and grandkids, and most people kind of care about what happens to them. I know people whoa re over 40, heck I know people who are 87 who care about this stuff!!
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the thinking people only care about their own individual lives is part of this culture you've grown up in, which is sad. It's not true!

       I'm exaggerating obviously to point out that 40 being the halfway point or point of no return in most people's lives but good on you for focusing in on that and letting me know how long you think most people live for

       I agree. I had an older woman I work with over hear me and my buddy talking the latest news and she came up and was like yeah something is definitely fucked up with the story they're telling and I'm not a conspiracy theorist but there is stuff not right about this. People are definitely waking up.

       I just think it’s odd how early on they decided to profile this dude as a lone wolf. They just know that so quickly? Based on what?
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet they keep describing him as that almost as though they’re trying to say “NOPE HE WAS ALONE all alone this guy was a lone wolf and not a single other person was involved. Lone wolf, y’all. All alone.”

       The police themselves appear to assume he must have had help at some point before the event, so those theories have at least some basis of support from qualified professionals.
       <em>
