        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If you have Facebook (some do, some don&#39;t. Don&#39;t make a big deal out of it), you&#39;ll know what I&#39;m talking about. Tons of people are sharing and discussing links/threads and posting statuses questioning the legitimacy of the shooting, mainly the &quot;lone wolf&quot; narrative. People I NEVER thought would be opening their eyes to conspiracy theories are starting to embrace them now.</p>

<p>With each false flag that happens, more and more people wake up. The cabal knows this obviously, and they have no choice but to press forward with this, hoping were too distracted and busy with work and bills and tv to probe into the event. </p>

<p>As a bonus, the newly awakened people who are studying false flags will be more open to looking at PAST events, particularly 9/11. Once we get enough people to question and demand a 9/11 investigation, things will REALLY start heating up and looking good for us.</p>

<p>All while this goes on, The NWO struggles to get us to hate each other. Struggles to push forward with Orwellian bills and struggles to get the conservatives and theorists to trust their new puppet president. </p>

<p>AND, the noose around their neck tightens as they&#39;re backed into a corner regarding the pedogate and pizzagate findings that exposed an entire can of worms about how governments, politicians, prime ministers, Hollywood moguls, and tons of others are coerced into power by promises of sadistoc sex acts with children, and the blackmail &quot;glue&quot; that keeps this whole shitty sinking ship barely afloat 😂</p>

<p>To the shills and any elite cocksuckers reading, go choke on a big fat bag of fresh dicks you defective human fuck ups 🖕</p>

<p>Have hope my friends! Incredible times await us! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel bad for people growing up now because they never truly have time alone to formulate their own thoughts and opinions. They just jump on on the latest bandwagon of whoever or whatever is most agreeable to them and get swept up in this paranoid, angry internet mob.
 But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to limit itself to just the internet for too much longer, you can already see it crossing over. As a younger person it makes me feel scared and hopeless. People over 40 don&#39;t really care either way because they know they&#39;re gonna die soon anyway. What can you do, right? Try to keep your head down I guess</p>

<p>That is hilarious. If you&#39;re 40 there&#39;s a good chance you could still have another 40-60 years. Plus people over 40 have kids and grandkids, and most people kind of care about what happens to them. I know people whoa re over 40, heck I know people who are 87 who care about this stuff!!</p>

<p>I guess the thinking people only care about their own individual lives is part of this culture you&#39;ve grown up in, which is sad. It&#39;s not true!</p>
