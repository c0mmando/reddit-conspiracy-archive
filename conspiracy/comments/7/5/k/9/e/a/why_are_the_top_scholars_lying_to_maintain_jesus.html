        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The historicity of Jesus is only based on a couple of passages of Paul.</p>

<p>Mark Goodacre <strong>invented a line of Paul</strong> in a radio debate with Richard Carrier:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58dG-wWBPBI&amp;amp;t=1200">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58dG-wWBPBI&amp;amp;t=1200</a></p>

<p>Bart Ehrman has a long track record of obscuring what Paul actually says:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.richardcarrier.info/archives/11516">https://www.richardcarrier.info/archives/11516</a></p>

<p>Remember the Gospels and Acts were composed AFTER Paul&#39;s letters.</p>

<p>Encyclopedia Britannica: &quot;The books are not arranged chronologically in the New Testament. The Epistles of Paul, for example, which address the immediate problems of local churches shortly after Christ&#39;s death, are considered to be the earliest texts.&quot;</p>

<p>According to Richard Carrier, Paul&#39;s letters indicate that Cephas etc. only knew Jesus from DREAMS, based on the Old Testament scriptures.</p>

<p>1 Cor. 15.:</p>

<p>&quot;For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins <strong>according to the Scriptures</strong>,  and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day <strong>according to the Scriptures</strong>, and that He <strong>appeared</strong> to Cephas, then to the twelve. After that He <strong>appeared</strong> to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep; then He <strong>appeared</strong> to James, then to all the apostles; and last of all, as to one untimely born, He <strong>appeared</strong> to me also.&quot;</p>

<p>The Scriptures Paul is referring to here are:</p>

<p>Septuagint version of Zechariah 3 and 6 <strong>gives the exact Greek name of Jesus</strong>, describing him as confronting Satan, being crowned king in heaven, called &quot;the man named &#39;Rising&#39;&quot; who is said to rise from his place below, building up God’s house, given supreme authority over God’s domain and ending all sins in a single day.</p>

<p>Daniel 9 describes a messiah dying before the end of the world.</p>

<p>Isaiah 52-53 describes the cleansing of the world&#39;s sins by the death of a servant. </p>

<p>Psalm 22-24 describes the death-resurrection cycle.</p>

<p>Gerd Lüdemann says: </p>

<p><em>&quot;Not once does Paul refer to Jesus as a teacher, to his words as teaching, or to [any] Christians as disciples.&quot;</em></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><em>&quot;Moreover, when Paul himself summarizes the content of his missionary preaching in Corinth (1 Cor. 2.1-2; 15.3-5), there is no hint that a narration of Jesus’ earthly life or a report of his earthly teachings was an essential part of it. . . . In the letter to the Romans, which cannot presuppose the apostle’s missionary preaching and in which he attempts to summarize its main points, we find not a single direct citation of Jesus’ teaching.&quot;</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the records are completely silent about Jesus until late in what we now call the first century CE. He left no physical trace, no artefacts, no writing, no eye-witness accounts that he existed. The Romans, Judeans and contemporary chroniclers like Philo of Alexandria never mention him in any writings, which is very surprising for an individual described as the &quot;king of the Jews&quot; by much later chroniclers. The existence of Jesus is an article of faith, not a historical fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Titus Flavius Josephus (normally referred to as Josephus) is often cited as the earliest source, but even he is not regarded as a reliable source. Many historians believe his mentions of Jesus were interpolated (added) at a much later date by Christian monks looking to shore up the Jesus narrative.</p>

<p>In any event, Josephus was writing long after Jesus supposedly died, and he does not claim to be a writing from first hand experience. Can you suggest any other &quot;person&quot; apart from Jesus of whom no contemporaneous record exists?</p>

<p>Nero fastened the guilt on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace.

    <div class="md"><p>Composed AFTER the letters of Paul, Mark and Matthew were INTENDED as symbolic fiction, being written in a symbolic chiastic structure.</p>

<p>Watch this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e7uhaed594&amp;amp;t=1367">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e7uhaed594&amp;amp;t=1367</a></p>

<p>Only with Luke-Acts did Christians start to view the four Gospels literally.</p>

<p>The sayings of Jesus in the Gospels are things Paul originally said. See Nikolaus Walter&#39;s ‘Paul and the Early Christian Jesus-Tradition’.</p>

<p>The events in Mark and Matthew are based on the Old Testament, directly borrowing its language:</p>

<p><strong>The Donkey(s)</strong> - Jesus riding on a donkey is from Zechariah 9.</p>

<p>Mark has Jesus sit on a young donkey that he had his disciples fetch for him (Mark 11.1-10).</p>

<p>Matthew changes the story so the disciples instead fetch TWO donkeys, not only the young donkey of Mark but also his mother. Jesus rides into Jerusalem on both donkeys at the same time (Matthew 21.1-9). Matthew wanted the story to better match the literal reading of Zechariah 9.9. Matthew even actually quotes part of Zech. 9.9.</p>

<p><strong>The Sermon on the Mount</strong> - The Sermon of the Mount relies extensively on the Greek text of Deuteronomy and Leviticus especially, and in key places on other texts. For example, the section on turning the other cheek and other aspects of legal pacifism (Mt. 5.38-42) has been redacted from the Greek text of Isaiah 50.6-9.</p>

<p><strong>The clearing of the temple</strong> - The cleansing of the temple as a fictional scene has its primary inspiration from an ancient faulty translation of Zech. 14.21 which changed &#39;Canaanites&#39; to &#39;traders&#39;.</p>

<p>When Jesus clears the temple he quotes Jer. 7.11 (in Mk 11.17). Jeremiah and Jesus both enter the temple (Jer. 7.1-2; Mk 11.15), make the same accusation against the corruption of the temple cult (Jeremiah quoting a revelation from the Lord, Jesus quoting Jeremiah), and predict the destruction of the temple (Jer. 7.12-14; Mk 14.57-58; 15.29).</p>

<p><strong>The Resurrection</strong> - Jesus was known as the ‘firstfruits’ of the resurrection that would occur to all believers (1 Cor. 15.20-23). The Torah commands that the Day of Firstfruits take place the day after the first Sabbath following the Passover (Lev. 23.5, 10-11). In other words, on a Sunday. Mark has Jesus rise on Sunday, the firstftuits of the resurrected, symbolically on the very Day of Firstfruits itself. </p>

<p><strong>Barabbas</strong> - This is the Yom Kippur ceremony of Leviticus 16 and Mishnah tractate Yoma: two ‘identical’ goats were chosen each year, and one was released into the wild containing the sins of Israel (which was eventually killed by being pushed over a cliff), while the other’s blood was shed to atone for those sins. Barabbas means ‘Son of the Father’ in Aramaic, and we know Jesus was deliberately styled the ‘Son of the Father’ himself. So we have two sons of the father; one is released into the wild mob containing the sins of Israel (murder and rebellion), while the other is sacrificed so his blood may atone for the sins of Israel—the one who is released bears those sins literally; the other, figuratively. Adding weight to this conclusion is manuscript evidence that the story originally had the name ‘Jesus Barabbas’. Thus we really had two men called ‘Jesus Son of the Father’.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, the records are completely silent about Jesus until late in what we now call the first century CE. He left no physical trace, no artefacts, no writing, no eye-witness accounts that he existed. The Romans, Judeans and contemporary chroniclers like Philo of Alexandria never mention him in any writings, which is very surprising for an individual described as the &quot;king of the Jews&quot; by much later chroniclers. The existence of Jesus is an article of faith, not a historical fact.</p>
