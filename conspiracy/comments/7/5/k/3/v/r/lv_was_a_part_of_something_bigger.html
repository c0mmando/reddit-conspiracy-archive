       So much of the event is fishy, but for every theory I see, I can’t figure out why it happened/who stood to gain from the event. So here’s some rambling thoughts:
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock was a part of a group or cell that had planned this and possibly other attacks across the US. This group or cell was not well known, and maybe even unknown by our intelligence agencies. This is the reason for a lack of updates on the investigation. It’s possible this uncovered something mind blowing and the investigation has taken a completely different turn than expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attack did not begin when it was planned to begin. The attack began after Campos was shot. Other associates of Paddock either fled or were not there when Campos was shot. Since the shooting was not supposed to start when it did, it’s possible Paddock’s associates were not there at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion, the lack of updates on the investigation is because authorities are trying to track down Paddock’s associates on that night, as well as learning about the cell or group Paddock belonged to. If the shooting began when the other shooters were not there yet, tracking them down becomes much more difficult. Authorities have to review tapes to see every single person Paddock interacted with and then they have the investigate all of those people. The depth of the investigation must be astounding.

       Agreed.  It was either the act of a crazy person being random, or it was purposeful.  I wish we had just a little more info, as it being random and crazy seem to diminish daily.

       I don’t buy any type of arms deal theory. Why would he bring all those guns up just so someone has to bring them all down? Also, not a lot of guns and not a lot of power.  I also have a hard time believing the attack on the festival wasn’t planned and it was just a coincidence that it happened.

       Why would the police think he was planning to escape? Would he just leave registered firearms there for the police to find? Anybody with half a brain would know they aren't getting out alive without being in handcuffs.....

       The fact that there were rooms booked at other venues around the country makes me think he was part of something bigger. Like he was waiting on orders from someone. Someone higher up was deciding which venue would be optimal for their purposes. So maybe he was just their hitman?

       Now CBS is reporting that Paddock had access to the freight elevator, which means that someone at the hotel (whether Campos or others) we're wittingly or unwittingly helping him.

       Have you looked into Paddocks antifa connections or watched the interview of the brother? The brother knows more as to why methinks. He talks about how his brother (Stephen) showed him the guns and helped test fire them.
