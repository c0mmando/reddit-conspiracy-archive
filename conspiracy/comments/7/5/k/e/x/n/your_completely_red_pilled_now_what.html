       Over the past year, two years, I've seen a rise in the amount of red pilled, woke, awakened, whatever you want to call yourself after you've had a dose truth, struggling with that truth. Often they come to iur community, or conspiracy, or some pqranormal subreddit, inevitably their truth is being suppressed and they want to do something about it, they wanna rally the troops.Some suggest March's,  some suggest riots, petitions,  changing voting patterns etc... I've tried to hash out how these various scenarios would play out. I can't for the life of me see how any one of these things is going to have an effect within our lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy theorists are at the forefront of the most wild theories. The information they aquire to prove their theories could be used to start any number of movements.Point being they need to be left to what we do best : deciphering the mysteries of the world.  We've been pissing in the wind for decades, stick your neck out and get your head lopped off. When the world is ready they will come to us for answers, not the other way around, and I think that's what we've been seeing since the last election
      </p>
      <p>
       . A wild amount of interest was generated in conspiracies , turning that into action though? What action could possibly stop the forces we are talking about? marches do nothing, voting does nothing, violence will only beget more violence, Congress, the white house, the Senate,  the courts ,in all counties, all states, all provinces,  all COUNTRIES , all rigged against us, the banking system, the food system corrupted, water tainted, doctors and scientists lying , supression of life saving treatments, controlling our children, their education, their health, we are institutionalized.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do I suggest? Breaking out of this system...you need to disappear to the elites. Don't give them your money,  don't work for them, don't buy their fancy bottled water, don't take their vaccinations, don't take out loans, don't do anything which encourages this system to reproduce.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it this way, you have two pots full of soil. One is the current society we live in, the other is the society we want to live in. Which do you feed? Which do you water? Noting you have to live in the one pot until the other can sustain you. So that's it, there is your March,  there is your revolution. The revolution is inside each and every one of you and the actions you take every day dictates how long it will take. So maybe you can't quit your job today, start looking for a alternative source of income, decrease your cost of living, make / repair as many of your products as possible. But we cant just kick the legs off the chair..in its place there must be a society based on serving/giving and rooting out greed. How many times have you let food rot rather then give it to your neighbour? How many times have you tried to haggle a return off of some old product you have no use for anymore? Do you freely help your friend move or do you charge him 20$ for gas and the use or your truck?  Hoarding knowledge in any form should be shameful, it's our biggest downfall, if we all freely gave ourselves to eachother, we are all greasing the wheel. It's harder to see a benefit from serving others and when I say serving I mean freely giving yourself to their aid or cause. Experimentally in my own life, I am always "greasing the wheel" , and you know what? I ALWAYS get some positive benefit from it, maybe 6 months down the road Jerry's wife gives me a bottle of jam, or I need a part for my rig, " hey just take it" he says. You won't always get that response because most of the world isn't in that mode, they are helping themselves every chance they get, not their fault, they just haven't learned yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways I'm sure there is a coherent idea in there somewhere in those run on sentences with poor grammar and punctuation for which I apologize, just the general vibe I've been getting lately is that all previous CATALYSTS of change have been subverted. How surprised would the elite be if WE went to flint and gave them clean water, how surprised would they be if i loaned my friend 1000$ for a car interest free? How surprised would they be if one day I went into the bank, and closed my account. Because my friends and neighbour's helped me build my house, we grew our own food, we crowdsourced our tractors, our best seeds freely given to a neighbor because we want them to fucking FLOURISH?!?!

       You've completely missed the point though I admire your enthusiasm. I'm not encouraging physical violence in any way, shape or form. There are valuable aspects to communism, as there were to capitalism. Atheists aren't inherently evil either, just the highest form of skeptic. We live in a society where it's hard to believe in anything

They have created an illusion of self that is too strong, and cannot act in the real world. Literally the first mind virus, they don't realize what made/makes religion different is that it was a "virus" with growth i.e. life, not degeneracy. They do not understand that without their own specific and demented illusion of self for the time, their morals will decay and no work will done for the good. The only people who believe in communism and atheism could never support the structure required for its function. This is on top of the ridiculous defense of any in group member, like certain religions. Look at the hypocrisy surrounding Weinstein. Coincidence by the way.

       Liberal intelligence lacks wisdom, foresight and grounding in reality.

       But go learn the real history, and the origin of the ideas if you don't believe me.

       This is exactly what i needed to read. I am the ripe age of 19, having just been thrust into society in the past year. Although everyone around me is ignorant and sheep-like, ive had the nagging feeling that this was not how life was supposed to be played out or lived. And this just opened my eyes. Thank you so much.

       No worries man. I hope you can take a few of my thoughts and put them to good use! One thing about people, and showing them truth, learn which people are going to be receptive (any of the downtrodden)  learn when a argument is starting to go circular(stalemate) and learn how to be satisfied with dropping seeds, they do flower eventually. If and when they come back to you after having looked into whatever seed you dropped, don't tell them "I told you so!" , ride their newfound enthusiasm for truth, show them the next destination (and there is ALWAYS a next destination)

       Not to the extent id like to. As I said we have to live in this system until a new one arises. I try to be outside the system as much as possible, but a person needs to work, drive, goto the hospital occasionally, and feed themselves. So here I am one foot in one foot out.

       There are whole books written on the subject of actually disappearing from society(and as you alluded to anyone with any tech knowledge knows, digitally removing yourself is actually impossible there's backups or backups of backups and I highly doubt any account delete option actually deletes your content or data, just quarantines it, that's aside from the massive data gathering operations by various governments) , that's not really what I'm proposing, because your not really contributing in any way by being out in a forest by your lonesome.
      </p>
      <p>
       So on the not digital part ot my life.. as far as staying out of the system...not a part of any political party, my kid goes to school but learns alternative ideas, I'm not a part of any organized religion but have a set of morals derived from many different religions and philosophies,  pay minimal taxes, donate food to the food bank, I don't take loans from the bank (anymore) , no credit cards, my monry doesnt sit in the bank for any period of time (not that i have enough to matter to them, but i want to make it clear my cheque is only depsited there for the couple hours thats its there because its the only legal way for me to receive the money for whatever reason) buy produce directly from farmers , honey makers, Canning, jamming when stuff is in season, I wear my clothes , cars, electronics and basically any other consumable until its full consumed, I'm healthy and strong, I'll help anyone move anything and often the favor is returned. I quit shopping at basically every chain store, 100% of my clothes are second hand, 100% of my books are second hand, i dont have a phone, ive never had cable or satellite. If i see something that has a place in our new society i try to encourage its growth and that includes people...It's not easy and it's a work in progress and to be honest alot of this is just standard frugal type behavior, but i believe in it , i have a thriving Amish community nearby who really sets the precedent for this type of behavior. They pay what they have to to the government,  and not a cent more. They educate their young, they help each other build houses basically debt free, they work their land together, and every family helps the other come harvest season, at the same time there is alot of detestable parts of that community not relevant to this conversation, but i love there if attitude towards helping eachother

       Serious answer incoming.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been pondering this for quite a while. You're right that violence isn't going to work and I feel that's because you have to look at how our society is set up. Since the time of revolution against aristocrats our society has been constructed to stop that sort of thing happening. Weapon control, police forces and most importantly enormous surveillance operations. 'They' have made organised, violent revolution very difficult because that was the previous way that people dealt with them. The same with an ideological revolution, since Gandhi was successful in India it taught them how to combat such a thing, and that is poisioning the grass roots capabilities via the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet has become a double edged sword in that everyone can communicate with one another, but that ability is used to argue over intricacies while ignoring the bigger picture. Look at US politics as an example, the problem is the system itself but the entire world used the internet to argue about which
       <em>
        candidate
       </em>
       was worse, ignoring that the system in which they are participating is the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the most frustrating factor is that the 'woke' among us, have been demonised and ridiculed by the media to the point where no one is taken seriously if they try to talk to people about what is happening to us all behind the scenes. For most of us this is the most frustrating part. People just don't give a shit. They concern themselves with whatever trivial matters they value and care nothing for the greater world around them.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I am where you are at. We know things are wrong and that the sword of Damocles is hanging over the entire species but what can we do about it? The system is built so violent or ideological revolution won't prevail due to the international Intelligence community. So we need to come up with a third option. We need lateral thinking. When option A and option B won't work, we need an option C. Unfortunately I don't have am answer yet, but I feel like thinking like this is the first step to solving the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the meantime we can all definitely make individual changes that reflect what we want to see. I would suggest the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Stop buying unnecessary shit
         </strong>
         . This whole economy is based off people working to spend the money they earn, thus needing to work more. Only buy what you need and stop trying to live a life that we all can't afford and shouldn't even want in the first place.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Stop being mean and unpleasant to one another
         </strong>
         . Everytime you're about to rip into someone over the internet or in person, for whatever reason, stop take a breathe and just turn the other check. Pride is a toxic emotion and you can spend your whole life with the 'no one fucks with me attitude' and nothing will ever get better for you. There is no end game with that mentality. If people are rude to you it's almost always an issue they have within themselves, engaging them just feeds that negative energy. 99% of the time it just isn't worth it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Stop eating meat
         </strong>
         . This one might not be so popular because meat is delicious. It's also farmed in a horrifying manner and is the indirect cause of a lot of humanities problems. Chickens and cows are loaded with chemicals and drugs harmful to us, land required to farm cattle is killing the biosphere, and we are scouring the ocean of life so we can eat fish. Humans
         <em>
          can
         </em>
         eat meat, we don't
         <em>

       We will succeed, we will save ourselves. I'm the meantime, while we figure out just how we can do that, they are some positive steps to follow. Light and love is how we do this. Positive thinking and compassion are our greatest weapons.

       You've completely missed the point though I admire your enthusiasm. I'm not encouraging physical violence in any way, shape or form. There are valuable aspects to communism, as there were to capitalism. Atheists aren't inherently evil either, just the highest form of skeptic. We live in a society where it's hard to believe in anything

       No worries man. I hope you can take a few of my thoughts and put them to good use! One thing about people, and showing them truth, learn which people are going to be receptive (any of the downtrodden)  learn when a argument is starting to go circular(stalemate) and learn how to be satisfied with dropping seeds, they do flower eventually. If and when they come back to you after having looked into whatever seed you dropped, don't tell them "I told you so!" , ride their newfound enthusiasm for truth, show them the next destination (and there is ALWAYS a next destination)
