      </p>
      <p>
       MY THEORY:
I watched the ballistic analysis video (
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxmEFeKy8aI">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxmEFeKy8aI
       </a>
       ) this morning and decided to look more into the "dirt mound" he said that could be the 2nd Gunman's snipers nest.
      </p>
      <p>
       I immediately noticed this "dirt mound" is near the two mysterious "pillars" others have discussed. I discovered the pillars are the former (now ABANDONED) site of the "SKYVUE" L.E.D. ferris wheel and that it isn't a "dirt mound" at all, but rather a huge, elevated and shaped CONCRETE foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
       LOOK!
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3anrk">
        https://imgur.com/a/3anrk
       </a>
       I made this image to show in detail where the sniper probably was.
He can even move from one side of the "pillars" to the other and change his position. This might explain why the bullet trajectories in the crowd are so steeply horizontal?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: thanks to all who upvoted and shared this!
Can someone in Vegas area investigate on foot and see if this location has a line of sight?

       It makes sense since many people who were in the front rows said the shots were coming from behind the stage and not from above and to the side.

       yea except none of the videos show that, and none of the videos show more than 1 shooter. Let's focus on finding the truth of what actually happened, not by distracting everyone with this silly fucking notion of more than 1 shooter

       I agree. But why use two rooms when he's already shot 200 rounds at the security guard? Maybe just stick to the one room to be safe?

       the story at the moment seems to be that he was only in the 2nd room at the start to shoot the fuel tanks. that would also "explain" why the door was locked from that side.

       Stage mics were hot, they pick up noise and project it from the stage.

       Why be behind the stage where basically every single person in the crowd is looking at.

       Inside the hollow pillar. My guess is he had to shimmy his way up to the top, rest on air, namely the gaping 100ft hole below him while creating the perfect decoy sniper nest to pick of specific targets in the crowd. /s

       I like the way you think lol. Supposedly this skyvue project was scrapped and Las Vegas was left with these ominous 9/11 looking pillars. Will they continue to stay up or will they tear them down soon since the harvest is done?

       I'm not so sure! If you watch videos from that location, most people are just scared and huddling but not getting hit. Maybe that is the "sweet spot" behind the stage where the sniper can't hit?

       I also thought in this particular video, the woman saying that they were not moving and potentially dead... so huddled or dead, I think the snipers would have a hard time getting many/any right in front of the stage (as the still seemed to indicate).

       I only judge people posting theories and not backing it up with evidence, or being able to refute evidence that refutes what theyre saying.

      <p>
       Anything else is fair game. I just want an evidence driven discussion.

       When you view that intersection in Google street view, note the lamp posts with 360 degree cameras, as well as each overhead traffic light mast sporting a static front facing camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least 1 of those cameras should have a periphery view of the pillars, and grounds around it.  At the very least some movement should be detectable.
      </p>

       True... Municipalities cannot afford to pay for the storage of the footage from these cameras and traffic cameras on interstates and major roads. If you toss them beforehand IE a warrant or an active Stakeout then they can be recorded.

       This is true. I worked on an investigation in Vegas where we did a subpoena for the traffic cams, they stated they are not recorded at many intersections.

       We did get a bunch of nearby businesses though, which we used to piece together the crime.

       Yes, some of the shots seemed to come from the left of the cab driver when she was at Mandalay Bay.  I was wondering if the second shooter was able to go up one of the pillars.  Maybe it is not necessary.

       The police scanner mentioned they were looking for someone wearing camo at an RV, or something like that.  Did anything ever come of that report?

       Ssssh, don't also remind them that if someone was shooting at that range from the crowd then the gunfire would be significantly louder and be noticeable on audio from recording devices.
      </p>
      <p>
       I swear the majority of people who support the 2+ gunman theories have never been to outdoor shooting ranges and lack any knowledge of what actual gunfire sounds like.

       The dirt mound is perfectly in the range the health ranger stated was the distance a second shooter had  to be based on the audio forensics. Another video i seen claims the towers have stairs built in and openings in them. Can not confirm the stairs though. But a shooter would have a great vantage site from that location but lousy escape route.

       That plot has been for sale, or at least was for at least a year. I saw a billboard on it, said to look at their site for a price. I checked it out, just out of interest. Then I was never able to find the page again.

       Well holy shit...and no one can argue about the variations in ammo because most 5.56/.223 have a very similar muzzle velocity.   And most 7.62mm rounds are slower, so that wouldn't work with the known variable of how far the window at the hotel is from the parking lot.

       If they were using an M240 like it sounds like in a lot of the sound analysis there would be brass casings and belt links they use to connect the rounds together.
      </p>
      <p>
       One interesting tidbit I found about the M240 is that after 10 mins of shooting, the barrel has to be changed. Might explain why the shooting stopped after 10 mins. Only had one barrel.

       And yes I there should have been casings and links visible in the photo of the room and dude. It probably took that huge time for swat to breach because someone at dhs was holding them while they scrubbed the scene and shuffled back up to the saudis

       that location doesn't make tactical sense from a security/cover/concealment POV.  to many approaches for LE or "an hero" citizen.  muzzle-flashes would be in the middle of a more-or-less unlit vacant lot.

       Love that Nature Ranger analysis, but it's essentially useless without linking his sources and addressing different calibers. Curious to know if there's a firearm/ammo combo that would yield those differences and place the 2nd weapon at Mandalay Bay.

       Unless I'm missing something, this would be fairly easy to disprove. Did they not search the entire surrounding area to the concert post-shooting? There would be casings EVERYWHERE. They don't just disappear after they pop out of the gun.

       I don't think anybody should give that "forensic acoustic analysis" video any legitimacy until he provides actual evidence.

       I agree with the commentor, evidence is crucial.  He ought to provide the wave form analysis to make his video stand up against criticism. Asking for evidence isn't silly, or for any lack of comprehension, it's the reasonable thing to do when someone makes assertions, just like we are doing with the FBI, and LVPD, requesting the evidence.  It's no different for a smooth talking guy on YouTube that runs shooting.news in addition to naturalnews.com, and probably countless other.  Everyone has an agenda.

       He never shows what he's actually analyzing nor exactly how he came to his conclusions. He shows us the math and then just jumps right to the claim, filled with a bunch of agenda spewing nonsense to show his bias.

       I showed it to my husband, a former Marine and he asked to see the original video.  Soundbites have a source.
       <br/>
       I wish he would have included the videos he got the soundbites from.  Could some have been echoes?  Could the distance the video was taken have any bearing on this?
The only thing that perked my ears was that he claimed that there were times when both guns could be heard.  I wish he would have backed that up with a video.

       The day after the shooting someone posted a photo of a news station's internal memo that described "scoped rifles and a belt fed machine gun". Then the leaked images from the hotel room came out showing scoped rifles but no machine gun. So either the person who wrote the memo was mistaken, or there was a second shooter who escaped with the MG.

       He provides method and suggests the use of certain videos. He doesn’t cite the name or link to the video or show any of the raw data or screen shots of the wave forms being analysed. It’s compelling ideas, but extremely flawed in execution and the the sensationalist comments about the shooter being a wizard are just insulting. He should do a follow up video addressing these points and incorporating the math for different types of rounds compatible with the types of firearms shown to see if any of those match.

       100% agree. I wish he would've, at a minimum, cited which video clips he used so we could independently take a look at what he's claiming. With such a claim, you'd think he'd back himself up a bit more than he did.

       I agree. I feel like that guy possibly has another agenda. Whether it's actually wanting to work with the FBI (was he serious about that?) or just wants to sell health supplements, I'm not sure how much faith I'm putting into the video.

       Yeah idk, at a minimum he's just farming clicks/views. I mean, the content on his channel is normally nothing I would be interested in, yet he got me to watch almost an entire 30 minute video that is 90% ramblings.

       Half of the videos I begin to watch have misleading titles. It's quite alarming because I'm generally at work (granted in a room by myself). Someone starts screaming about Trump and all kinds of weird political stuff and I'm scrambling to turn it off in case someone comes in!

       Half of the videos I begin to watch have misleading titles. It's quite alarming because I'm generally at work (granted in a room by myself). Someone starts screaming about Trump and all kinds of weird political stuff and I'm scrambling to turn it off in case someone comes in!

       But then why the new story about the security guard and 2 smashed windows? I thought both of those things pointed to a cover-up as in.... a second person in Paddocks room. Now convienently the guard can say he was there before/during/after the shooting and "no one else was there."
      </p>
      <p>
       Were there 3 shooters?

       I believe the audio analysis is under question because the assumption in his video is that the only cartridge being fired was a .223 Remington round. We have already established that multiple weapons were found in Paddocks room... but have we determined that the only round fired from his room is .223? Basically if Paddock was using multiple calibers that had different lag times then that could account for why the estimated distances were different.

      <p>
       I own a variant of gun(s) that fires all of those rounds. The difference between the sounds of each of those rounds is minimal at best. I will say that 7.62 has a little bit more of a dull bass tone to it (literally sounds like a punch) whereas 5.56 and .223 sound like a loud crack with more treble than bass.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t remember if he had any other ammo types. I think he might have had blackout rounds as well. I’m no expert but I at least know that with those 3 calibers there is minimal difference in sound even at range.

       What makes you think there was a second shooter? Why would shooter 1 locate himself somewhere tactically awesome and shooter 2 locate himself where his position could be taken out in seconds? I get that this is a conspiracy sub but seeing conspiracies where there are none has a name I think. =P

       I wondered about those things as well, but why is the middle burst so short? Echo would be consistent throughout the sound of the first gunfire. It really doesn't sound anything like impact. It's too loud and powerful. Definitely sounds like a second weapon which stops while the first weapon continues.

       His implication is a 250 yard radius.  I’ll propose you should be looking UP!  Listen to this video at 1:02. You can hear the helicopter overhead.  The phone is filtering it out as background noise but it’s there for sure.  It’s also there in the same spot (by sound anyway) just after the first few shots and the pause in the music.

       Can that explain the helicopter that landed near/in the Harley Davidson dealership parking lot? I couldn't find the video so if someone can find/post, please do!

       The riverbed is east of the pillars and it runs north and south. They could have easily ran down the riverbed, across an empty dirt lot, and right into the HD parking lot.

       Absolutely, but, if memory serves correct, their business is actually on other outer edge of the airport. I believe they do tours of the strip and the Grand Canyon. I'd say it's improbable that a shooter was extracted via tourist helicopter attraction.

       I like this theory, and it is plausible.  I believe the pillars must be hollow to allow for maintenance and or emergency access for the Ferris wheel.  But the fuel tanks are right next to this, why would the shooter (whomever that might be) shoot at the tanks and blow up his friend?
      </p>
      <p>
       UNLESS...whoever was with Paddock told him they have a sniper with a bead on his forehead if he pulls some bullshit.  Or, they didn't say anything, and the sniper (probably FBI or CIA) shoots out the window in the middle of the transaction (which was the plan all along).  Maybe even killed him.  Then, the other party shoots at the pillars, until he realizes he can't even see the son of a bitch and jettisons the plan.  Then they begin to shoot into the crowd to create a diversion and pandemonium ensues.  Shortly thereafter, they get a VIP armed police escort out of the hotel, away from the violence, which we saw on video.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why there were no deaths during the first few shots.

       Heres what I got today. The dirt mounds aren't really elevated to get a good view unless the shooter wasn't worried about shooting through the chain link fence of the venue. The pillars that are full of rebar wouldn't be a good option because rebar. But, as you can see, it's just a chain link fence around the perimeter and wouldn't be that hard to get into.

       But, when I was driving over there I saw this Motel 8 on the right and the roof of this place looks to be a perfect vantage point. I also took a Google Maps screenshot to get a better view of the building, it's the one with the blue trim around the top. This spot is about 1500ft away from the venue.

       This is the right theory.  The tanks are right behind the pillars.  They are all 3 in a row; shooter's window, pillars, tanks.  Whoever shot from that window wasn't shooting at the tanks, he was shooting at the asshole shooting at them from the pillars.  This is it.  It wasn't a planned massacre, it was a fubared arms deal, courtesy of the US Govt.

       I am trying to find something to believe in here, but the IPhone recording don't account for the angles of bullet trgectories, echo, and ricochets. I have heard some audio guy explain it here and it sound legit.  TBH I don't even hear what I should call overlapping shots. but the angles of the glass hotels and other surfaces seems to point at that.  Is there any reason you guys thin one man with all that crap couldn't have filled 28 people?  The Pulse Night club guy killed 50 with far fewer targets and fare less armaments!

       I think you picked a viable spot if the analysis is correct.  However, his analysis would be correct if the distance from the device recording the sound to the bullet was the same.  But if one video picked up the sound of a bullet 15 ft away vs. another one that was 3 ft away the lag time might change.  I would give more merrit to his video if he showed the videos that he sampled the sounds from.

       Regarding the 'natural news' forensics guy, isn't it possible he was just picking up echos?  He spends like 5 seconds saying "they couldn't be echos because of the patterns", but wouldn't echos be the same pattern of the source?  It seemed like an odd thing to leave out.  I'd expect some kind of methodology for not including some noises, since there would obviously be a ton of echos.

       It's laughably bad.  I watched the 5 second bit on echos again and it makes no sense.  He discounts them because of 'a clear pattern'.  So, is the insinuation that echos do not follow the pattern of their origin point?  This guy has a degree in baloney.

       Interesting theory, but I'm not convinced that this was the location of the shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you remember, early on it was reported that the shooter was at one point aiming for
       <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@36.0941392,-115.1680045,227m/data=!3m1!1e3">
        jet fuel tanks
       </a>
       nearby. According to this
       <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/the-strip/las-vegas-strip-shooter-targeted-aviation-fuel-tanks-source-says/">
        article
       </a>
       from 10/4, they actually punctured one of the tanks, but it didn't explode. If their plan was to explode the tanks, I don't think they would have their buddy set up their second shooter location at the towers or the "dirt mound" 1000 feet away.
      </p>
      <p>
       My own personal theory is that they initially planned to blow up the tanks with the
       <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/the-strip/explosive-possessed-by-stephen-paddock-may-have-been-used-in-nyc-bombing/">
        car packed with explosives
       </a>
       , but that plan backfired when their buddy bailed on em, so they tried to blow up the tanks from Mandalay Bay. I would venture to guess that the person who was supposed to drive the car over and blow up the tanks was the same person who was reported to have been telling the concert-goers that they were all going to die 45 minutes before the concert started. They got cold feet and decided to warn as many as they could.

       Here is a close up pic i took earlier this morning. Metro still has some of the side streets(east of the stage on giles) closed off and the lane closest to the west sode of harvest fest on North Las Vegas BLvd is coned off.

       I will attempt more angles soon and try to get a closer shot so we can get more people working on this theory.
If anyone else is local, snap what you can in order to build a more clear vantage.

       Managed to get closer. The pile is a ways back and would barely give a clean view to the crowd.

       These could be the entrances to maintenance shaftslike others have speculated. However, without getting inside(locked chain link fence with metro barricade right across the street) we cannot be certain

       I like the way you think lol. Supposedly this skyvue project was scrapped and Las Vegas was left with these ominous 9/11 looking pillars. Will they continue to stay up or will they tear them down soon since the harvest is done?
