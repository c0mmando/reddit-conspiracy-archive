       Seems to me that dispite everyone talking about being "woke" we have been unable to orgamize and make any real change.  Why dont we march up to congress and demand they all be replaced by people we nominate? Is there any serious way we can rise up to stop this shit without using the very system that put us here?

       Way back during the lead up to the Iraq invasion the "marchers," were shut down.  They could already use the internet and cellphones to track and disrupt any mass opposition.

       All the mass demonstrations since then, including OWS back in 2009 and that post Inauguration  Trump protest and the "Women's protest is carefully created and managed.

       <em>
        your

       Congressional representative every two years. You do not get to jump the line, nor do you get to pick

       Congressional representatives.

       thats my point, theres all this red tape and beurocratic nonsense.  people need change now not when the system tells us its ok.  Besides that what makes you think using the system the way it is will bring any change?

       of course.  it may have worked at one point but in an age where everyone posts what they had fro breakfast we dont need this system.  we can streamline our entire way of life and the biggest setback is paperwork bullshit.  these people never represent the voters  and is completely useless.  i think people are just afraid of change

       a computer based system that is completely transparent and everyone has access to.  votes will be done in real time on real topics.  laws will be reduced to basic laws.  for example right now we are all supposed to pay taxes.  ppl like donald trump for example use loopholes in these laws to get around doing so.  In my simplified version even if there is a loophole in the law itself the law says you have to pay the tax therefor negating the loophole.  I never said I was a genious but I think you have to be pretty stupid to think we cannot improve upon our govt and how it operates.  There are others who are trying to do what i speak of but they are trying to get approval from the people they are looking to can lol.  My thought is why not start small towns that only use crypto currency.  in those towns create law the way you want it and make sure EVERYTHING is local or imported from another sister town.  essentially create a new govt within this one and show ppl how much better things can be.  it would spread like wildfire leaving thier house of cards to topple

       You need to go read as much as you can about direct democracy and why it isn't used, and also about monetary policy. While you're at it, go learn about how computers are incredibly fragile and insecure and why any computer with important data on it is physically disconnected from the Internet.

       You clearly know nothing about politics.  The people elected represent the voters who voted them in. It's in their rational interests to do so, otherwise they don't get re-elected.  Can you streamline national defence? What does posting about breakfast have anything to do with governance? If you're talking about individual autonomy, then who provides the law and order when your neighbour steals your property?

       so you think politicians are here to represent you and i and not the company that funded thier campaign? your silly if you think this is true at even the state level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes you can streamline national defense, its called make allies and use technology, not human lives when life is at stake.  send in drones and bots to fight if thats where its going to end up.  But im sure you probably think most threats to us are real, hint, they arent.
      </p>
      <p>
       my point was that people everywhere have a phone in thier pocket that connects us all.  if people have the time to show me what meals they are eating surely they can use this to create live voting
      </p>
      <p>
       as far as police that should be strictly up to the local laws.  small towns could have a volunteer program, or pay police directly with local taxes if you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point remains that improvements can be made and if your fighting for the ild ways tou may as well be one of "them"

       Wrong community to organize a March from. Conspiracy theorists are at the forefront of the most wild theories. The information they aquire to prove their theories could be used to start any number of marches. Point being they need to be left to what we do best : deciphering the mysteries of the world.  We've been pissing in the wind for decades, stick your neck out and get your head lopped off. When the world is ready they will come to us for answers, not the other way around, and I think that's what we've been seeing since the last election
      </p>
      <p>
       . A wild amount of interest was generated in conspiracies , turning that into action though? What action could possibly stop the forces we are talking about? marches do nothing, voting does nothing, violence will only beget more violence, Congress, the white house, the Senate,  the courts , all rigged against us, the banking system, the food system corrupted, water tainted, doctors and scientists lying , supression of life saving treatments, controlling our children, their education, their health, we are institutionalized.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do I suggest? Breaking out of this system...you need to disappear to the elites. Don't give them your money,  don't work for them, don't buy their fancy bottled water, don't take their vaccinations, don't take out loans, don't do anything which encourages this system to reproduce.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it this way, you have two pots full of soil. One is the current society we live in, the other is the society we want to live in. Which do you feed? Which do you water? Noting you have to live in the one pot until the other can sustain you. So that's it, there is your March,  there is your revolution. The revolution is inside each and every one of you and the actions you take every day dictates how long it will take. So maybe you can't quit your job today, start looking for a alternative source of income, decrease your cost of living, make / repair as many of your products as possible. Lastly....the most important part is the creation of our new society. It must be a society based on serving/giving and rooting out greed. How many times have you let food rot rather then give it to your neighbour? How many times have you tried to haggle a return off of some old product you have no use for anymore? Hoarding property in any form (including DATA such as lifesaving cures)should be shameful, it's our biggest downfall, if we all freely gave ourselves to eachother, we are all greasing the wheel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways I'm sure there is a coherent idea in there somewheres, just the general vibe I've been getting lately is that all previous CATALYSTS of change have been subverted. How surprised would the elite be if WE went to flint and gave them clean water, how surprised would they be if i loaned my friend 1000$ for a car interest free? How surprised would they be if one day I went into the bank, and closed my account. Because my friends and neighbour's helped me build my house, we grew our own food, we crowdsourced our tractors, our best seeds not reluctantly sold to a competing company, but freely given to a neighbor because we want them to fucking FLOURISH?!?!

       Educate others on this and the federal reserve.  If we unify in an idea against the world bankers we all can stand behind it and make progress.

       The only way to make a dent in this system is for a ton of decent people to run for office for the next several decades, ideally not as Democrats and Republicans and for the apathetic public to actually participate and vote for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marching to demand elected officials be removed is a good idea, but it should be complementary to a larger movement of building up alternative political parties with clear platforms and "untouchable" politicians, as in Elliot Ness "untouchable".

       no . they fucked you over a long time ago .. the anti war movement that existed back in the Vietnam era didn't work to well , you need to hit them in the donors but most of them are masons or part of the war for profit complex .. and they are not going to do shit to help you.

       figured youd say that but this is not it at all.  you, my friend are close minded and this convo will go no where so why keep it up?  i love arguments because they allow me an opportunity to learn and grow.  this is just you asking me useless questions and providing no additional inpit of your own.  this is a non productive comvo so i cut it short.  sorry to burst your bubble but tour not as smart as you think you are.
