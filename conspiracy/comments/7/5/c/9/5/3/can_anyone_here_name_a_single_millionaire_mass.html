        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">18</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-09 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/stickdog99.html">stickdog99</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Can anyone here to name a single millionaire other than Paddock who ever shot any number of complete strangers in a premeditated fashion and then killed himself (or herself)? Can anyone here recall a single news report of this ever happening before in the history of the world?</p>

<p>Rich old people do not kill strangers for no reason and then off themselves.</p>

<p>Upon full review of 4 different mass shooter databases, here are all 5 previous mass shooters (4 or more victims) over 55 in US history:</p>

<p>William Bevins, 71, was in a bizarre and sordid sexual relationship with a young girl, Katie Sue Click, who was married to one of his 6 murder victims. Bevins had been regularly paying Katie Sue Click and her husband for her sexual favors and his shooting spree was set off by an unexpected demand for an increase in the charge for her sexual favors. While definitely a nut case, he did not senselessly kill strangers in an availability heuristic altering event, and his initial shooting was not premeditated.</p>

<p>William D. Baker, 66, killed 4 co-workers and then himself in a revenge killing for sending him back to jail. He fits the profile of a powerless, pathetic man with absolutely nothing to lose. He did not senselessly kill strangers in an availability heuristic altering event.</p>

<p>Kurt Myers, 64, killed 4 people in a deadly rampage after setting fire to his house. He killed 2 people he knew in one location and then 2 other strangers in another location once he knew he no longer had anything whatsoever to lose. He had no money to his name was was being continually pestered by debt collectors. He fits the mass shooter profile of a powerless, pathetic male with absolutely nothing to lose. He did not senselessly kill strangers in an availability heuristic altering event.</p>

<p>Carl Drega, 62, was a nut with a history of getting in trouble with authorities over his property rights. When some cop stopped him and cited him for having too much rust on his pickup truck, he snapped and shot down two cops. Then he decided to kill a judge who had ruled against him while he was at it. He also shot a guy who tried to disarm him during this revenge killing. He fits the profile of a man who snapped violently then felt he had absolutely nothing to lose. While definitely a nut case, he did not senselessly kill strangers in an availability heuristic altering event, and his initial shooting was in no way premeditated.</p>

<p>William Bryan Cruse, 59. shot 6 people, but did not then off himself. His wife had Parkinson&#39;s disease. He hated kids for cutting through his yard. One day he shot one little kid who did so in a fury, then went on a mall rampage and killed 5 more people including 2 cops who were trying to take him in. He fits the profile of a man who snapped violently then felt he had absolutely nothing to lose. Again, he was a complete nut, but he did not senselessly kill strangers in an availability heuristic altering event, and his initial shooting was in no way premeditated.</p>

<p>There seem to be no precedent for what Paddock is accused of. No mass shooter of any age has ever been a millionaire. None of the 5 previous mass shooters over 55 killed more than 6 people. None of the previous mass shooters over 55 killed strangers in a premeditated fashion. One planned a revenge killing on his last day before jail, and all of rest them simply lost it for one reason or another then continued rampaging because they no longer felt they had anything to lose.</p>

<p>Furthermore, mass shootings themselves are exceedingly rare, even the USA. In all of USA history, there are 131 total events in which four or more people were killed by a lone shooter (or two shooters in three cases). An average of eight people died during each event, often including the shooters. That&#39;s 131 mass shootings of 4 or more people (sometimes including the shooters themselves) in all of US history. This includes shootings in both public and private places, shooting sprees, crimes of passion, unplanned rampages, and shootings in which the shooter did not end up killing himself. In only 7 events in all of US history have more than 14 people been killed. Each of these 7 cases (other than perhaps that of Charles Joseph Whitman, the original 1966 availability heuristic altering event) had the earmarks of extreme spook-iness.</p>

<p>No US citizen has ever been accused of shooting so many people before. No US citizen over 55 has ever killed more than 6 people in a mass shooting before. No US citizen over 55 shot only strangers in a mass shooting before. Only one US citizen over 55 planned his mass shooting, and that was to get revenge on the people who were about to send him to jail.</p>

<p>But what Paddock did so likely that we require no motive whatsoever for his actions?</p>

<p>Remember that we are considering the relative likelihoods of a completely and totally brand spanking newly minted mass shooter profile in the all the annals of mass shooting versus the same old, same old well worn and indisputably documented Operation Gladio strategy of tension.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying Paddock could not have done it because he&#39;s old and rich. Some of the worst people I know are old and rich. I&#39;m saying that I don&#39;t believe that his shooting strangers for no reason whatsoever on his lonesome then offing himself is the likeliest explanation given that no motive or evidence of his guilt has been presented to any us to date.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am referring to clear bullshit disinfo that The Daily Mail paid an &quot;anonymous prostitute&quot; to say: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4959970/Vegas-prostitute-says-Stephen-Paddock-enjoyed-violent-sex.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4959970/Vegas-prostitute-says-Stephen-Paddock-enjoyed-violent-sex.html</a></p>

<p>A Las Vegas prostitute who was hired by murderer Stephen Paddock has spoken out about their &#39;violent&#39; sex sessions and how he bragged about having &#39;bad blood&#39;.</p>

<p>The woman, who spoke anonymously, said she would spend hours drinking and gambling in Sin City with Paddock, who she described as &#39;paranoid&#39; and &#39;obsessive&#39;.</p>

<p>If he hit a winning streak, he would take her back to his room for &#39;really aggressive and violent sex&#39; including living out rape fantasies, she said.</p>

<p>Paddock also boasted about his bank-robber father, saying that &#39;the bad streak is in my blood&#39; and &#39;I was born bad&#39;, according to texts seen by the Sun on Sunday.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old woman said Paddock, 64, would often rant about conspiracy theories including how 9/11 was orchestrated by the US government.</p>

<p>The escort, who said Paddock paid her $6,000-a-time for their meetings, also had texts in which he described tying her up &#39;while you scream for help&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s see:</p>

<p>It conveniently explains away the bill for two people, the use of Paddock&#39;s keycard when his car was out of the garage, and the staff hearing Paddock &quot;pretend&quot; he was talking with other people in his room. It also gives idiots a reason to claim that a millionaire senior citizen fits the profile of a mass shooter even though there has never been a single millionaire mass shooter before in all of human history nor a single person over 60 who ever shot multiple strangers without any provocation in a premeditated fashion.</p>

<p>Finally, it simply demonizes Paddock as well as anyone who thinks he is more probably a patsy. &quot;So you think that rich asshole misogynists don&#39;t senselessly murder people and then off themselves for no reason?&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL. He didn&#39;t gun down people randomly for no reason and then off himself on the same day.</p>

<p>And he probably lived to a ripe old age in Brazil as well.</p>

<p>If you want to expand the definition of mass murderer to include rich fucks who order others to kill for them so they can gain power and profit while they are alive, that is called human history, It has nothing to do with senselessly murdering strangers than offing yourself. The former goes on every day in every country and is basically business as usual. The latter is an exceptionally rare occurrence that requires some sort of motive and evidence to be presented, unless you are incredibly gullible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL. He didn&#39;t gun down people randomly for no reason and then off himself on the same day.</p>

<p>And he probably lived to a ripe old age in Brazil as well.</p>

<p>If you want to expand the definition of mass murderer to include rich fucks who order others to kill for them so they can gain power and profit while they are alive, that is called human history, It has nothing to do with senselessly murdering strangers than offing yourself. The former goes on every day in every country and is basically business as usual. The latter is an exceptionally rare occurrence that requires some sort of motive and evidence to be presented, unless you are incredibly gullible.</p>
