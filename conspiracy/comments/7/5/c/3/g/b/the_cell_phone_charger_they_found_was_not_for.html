    <div class="md"><p>yeah, I know.  some shit site is saying that the guy who did the murder/suicide in NY is connected to Paddock because he was the lead engineer on a charger and/or a battery.  There were reports that the investigators found a charger in Paddock&#39;s room they couldn&#39;t link with a phone.  This shit site said that it was a charger for a non-rechargeable battery.  Here is the site.  It&#39;s laughably horrible, but people have been peddling this shit all day in this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I saw that when it was on the front page. This is a completely unknown website and they are the only one making the claim that he was a witness to the shooting. All other more well known sources and Redditors who live in the area say it had nothing to do with Las Vegas. Do you have a more reputable source for him being involved or that shows what type of charger was found? Also, why would the charger be for a non-rechargeable battery. That makes no sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No idea. However, think about this...the only way they would have found &quot;a phone charger that did not fit his phone&quot; would be if he had androids and they found an iPhone charger. </p>

<p>What type of phone did Paddock have? If he had an iPhone and they found a &quot;phone charger&quot; that means they found a micro usb charger. They wouldn&#39;t be able to claim it was a phone charger then, since it could charge so many other things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm thats a good point. It would explain why the charger was left behind. You have to give it the initial charge but you only charge it once... Makes sense. </p>

<p>It wouldnt make sense to have it already charged because batteries will lose charge if stored at full charge and the battery will be less reliable.. Kudos sir. If these were milspec it would be proper to not have them charged until needed.  </p>
