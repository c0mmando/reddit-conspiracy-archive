       I did a quick search a couple days ago I thought I came up with a different part number. How sure are you that's the right number?  I do remember it being Li-Mn02.  I don't know shit about these batteries.  Assumed it rechargeable.

       yeah, I know.  some shit site is saying that the guy who did the murder/suicide in NY is connected to Paddock because he was the lead engineer on a charger and/or a battery.  There were reports that the investigators found a charger in Paddock's room they couldn't link with a phone.  This shit site said that it was a charger for a non-rechargeable battery.  Here is the site.  It's laughably horrible, but people have been peddling this shit all day in this sub.

       The guy was never a lead engineer.  He was a plastics dude that happened to work for a company that made
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       military products.  He changed jobs 5 years ago.  Nothing there suggests he'd somehow be involved enough in this to be murdered.

       Is it just me or does that list seem really weird and vague? What the heck is a "bank theft tracking system" and why is it battery powered? And "RFID" is so vague it's practically meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, do you have a link that actually shows this was the model battery charger that was found? I feel like I missed when that detail was revealed.

       Yeah, I saw that when it was on the front page. This is a completely unknown website and they are the only one making the claim that he was a witness to the shooting. All other more well known sources and Redditors who live in the area say it had nothing to do with Las Vegas. Do you have a more reputable source for him being involved or that shows what type of charger was found? Also, why would the charger be for a non-rechargeable battery. That makes no sense.

       No idea. However, think about this...the only way they would have found "a phone charger that did not fit his phone" would be if he had androids and they found an iPhone charger.
      </p>
      <p>
       What type of phone did Paddock have? If he had an iPhone and they found a "phone charger" that means they found a micro usb charger. They wouldn't be able to claim it was a phone charger then, since it could charge so many other things.

       It's now reported that they found a phone that matched it in his room:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Earlier, senior law enforcement sources said investigators were puzzled by a charger that did not appear to match any of Paddock’s cellphones. Police have now been able to match all of the cell phone chargers found in the room with multiple cell phones that Paddock had with him.

       How could they fuck that up originally? They knew what phones he had with him obviously, and every fucking American can tell the difference between an iPhone chargers and a micro usb charger.

       It seems like you can't just go buy things that take those batteries. It would of had to been some custom engineered thing. Do you think Paddock was capable of that?

       You still haven't explained why a non-rechargeable battery would have a charger, or provided a legitimate source for this being what they found. I'm not going to speculate about the uses until I actually know this is what was found.

       Hmm thats a good point. It would explain why the charger was left behind. You have to give it the initial charge but you only charge it once... Makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wouldnt make sense to have it already charged because batteries will lose charge if stored at full charge and the battery will be less reliable.. Kudos sir. If these were milspec it would be proper to not have them charged until needed.
