       The security guard, Jesus Campos, was shot BEFORE a single shot was fired at the crowd. The sheriff said Mr. Campos was shot at 9:59, before Stephon Paddock broke the windows and began shooting. Just heard in Live presser..

       There’s a live press conference happening now. The sheriff said the timeline has changed. The security guard was responding to an alarm BEFORE any shots were fired. Stephen Paddock shot Jesus Campos, THEN began shooting the crowd. Just heard on CNN Live presser

       The alarm was for an "open door" but not Paddock's room.  Guard then heard drilling coming from Paddock's room.

       The fact that the security guard is not in custody is reason enough to believe that Paddock shot him then began shooting out the window.  Security guard would most definitely have been tested for gunshot residue

       million dollar question. The new timeline means that if the other info is supposed to be trusted... the guard would have been up on the floor from the time he was shot 9:59pm till 10:18pm when he told the officers he was shot and directed them to the room Paddock was in. 19 minutes went by and he was Evacuating people from the floor we are being told.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sense. You take one round out of 200 fired at you. You call it in and just evacuate everyone from their rooms into the same hallway you were just shot at from... you know.. the hallway with the gunman at the other end of it.

       Didn’t really connect it until reading your comment but saw on here earlier it’s now believed Paddock may not have reserved the adjoins room. Door alarm could have been him breaking into there from the suite.

       Pretty sure you’re right about that. Based on the layout of the rooms tho (on mobile and don’t have that pic currently) he would have to have been in the hallway drilling the stairs. If Paddock actually shot through a door at Campos then he was in one of the rooms when Campos heard drilling. Made me think it was something else.

       He was going to film the transaction in one room. The security guard went up as a precheck for the room the deal was supposed to go down in. Was in the room, heard the drilling, realized it was a sting and shot paddock. His boys then had time to run in, fire hundreds of rounds and run out.

       How in the hell do people think a gun deal lead to mass murder?? Yes, lets set a gun deal in a busy hotel on the Vegas strip for a small amount of guns and if it goes bad instead of just killing Paddock and making it look like a suicide we will shoot out windows and fire at 22,000 people and draw national attention to ourselves. Said no one ever. No gun deal...he didn't have enough guns to even be worth the time. And don't forget the guns were all in his name.

       Where in the timeline did that door get locked?!? You have to be on the other side to lock that kind of door, but haven't they said he was going back and forth between rooms? He would've had to go into the other one, lock the adjoining door, exit that room, and then go back into his room at the end of the hall. I am thoroughly confused

       They are meant for separating guests when the rooms are booked by two different parties. I don't know what doors Mandalay had, but in the hotels I've stayed at, there are two doors, each with one lock for the guest on that side. You can unlock and open your door from your side, but can't open or unlock the other one.

       The timeline is a mess after yesterday but assuming all of this is accurate, he could have broke into the adjoining room (32134?) from the suite, triggered the door alarm, Campos comes up to investigate and hears him drilling that door shut which would require them to breach.
      </p>
      <p>
       What wouldn’t make sense for this though is him moving between rooms during the shooting, as I’ve assumed, or that his body was apparently in the suite, on the wrong side of the screwed shut door which needed to be breached.  Not even to mention the fact that the suite window may have been in tact during the shooting.

       This goes with the theory that Paddock was running guns. Whoever he was selling guns to back stabbed him and shot him. Neighbors reported gunfire/fighting so the security guard went up to the room to check.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe the gunmen were just in the adjoining room and broke in to Paddock's and he was just set up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way i'm starting to think Paddock's not the guy. I'm curious how long he had been dead before the police got there.

       Either that, or Paddock was really radicalized.  They set it all up, knowing the FBI is watching, 2 guys get his Alan Snackbar video, and blast 200 rounds into the hall, where Jesus is pretending to be a hotel security guard.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 guys escape in the hall, barricade it so they can't follow and head up a couple levels to a safe escape (everyone would be on Floor 32).

       None of this gun-running stuff makes any sense.  A deal goes bad....so 32 floors in the air, let's shoot a bunch of innocent people and then get out of there without anyone noticing.  Did they take elevators?  Stairs?  Nobody saw these people who got mad over Paddock charging $5.32 more for their guns, so they shot 500+ people at a concert to get back at Paddock?

       If you're selling guns, you don't want to bring attention on to yourself by entering a building that has a shit ton of cameras.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you don't sell guns multiple stories up in a building because there isn't an easy escape if the deal goes bad.  You have to either run down the stairs or wait for an elevator which most likely will get you caught.

       I've wondered that myself. Guess it may depend on who arranged the meeting place/time.

      <p>
       Your point is why I've questioned the gunrunning scenario myself. I'm just chalking the change in the narrative up as a point for the gunrunning scenario. There's still holes in the theory.

       Terrorist gun runners who want to kill Americans would.  It isnt that far fetched, but Paddock would have to have been in on their scheme.  He did most of the shooting up there, while his partners likely escaped (becoming the multiple shooters everyone is claiming)

       I highly doubt these imaginary terrorist gun runners are that fucking dumb.  Get a grip my friend, you're reaching.  If this were even close to being the case--They would kill Paddock, flee with their guns, then plot to kill Americans at a later date.

       So, these terrorist met with him for a small gun deal and then ran? There is no evidence of their being a shooter anywhere else. Terrorist wouldn't deal in small amounts of guns and their death numbers are usually much higher.

       When you take into account all of the surveillance footage available in Vegas from police body cams, to hotel footage, to cell phone footage, and more, this is going to take awhile. Stories will change. That shouldn't stop people from asking questions and demanding the truth. But as skeptics, or even people who simply want the truth, we also have to be cognizant of how human error, human emotion, and time will play into this investigation. Lots of moving parts here. Be patient.

       Bullshit. I work in medicine and in the 10 years I've been doing it I've learned exactly how and when people leave out information. If it sounds fuckey, start asking yes or no questions. You've got the Sheriffs office, LVMPD, and the fucking FBI. The story should have been straightened out by 5pm on Monday, at the absolute latest. Or whenever Jesus fucking Christ Campos got stabilized at the hospital.

       I'll see your medicine; I've been a practicing attorney for 7 years; have worked both on the private side and in criminal law. I've interviewed and taken hundreds of depositions in high profile cases -- things not nearly this complex, which sometimes takes years to get to trial due to the extensive information that has to be reviewed, analyzed, annotated, and then put into the story. You think the "story" should be straightened out because you're thirsty and impatient. We are all in this sub because we think something is off or bizarre, but I'm not an idiot who will jump to any conclusion because the information isn't immediately provided or correct.

       The Sheriff appeared to have an interesting slip about Campos. Around 6:05 ET he said, "He (Campos) was able to confirm for us exactly what he heard and saw in the moments before the... (pause) he was shot. " Sheriff also seems like a shitty public speaker, so it could have just been a honest mistake.

       Not too sure, I'd have to rewatch it again. It just stood out as an interesting moment of dead air. The Sheriff sounded like a dull 3rd grader giving a book report, so it's likely benign.

       I read/replied to your comment before watching the press conference, and when I watched it and got to that part, it was exactly as you'd written it. I couldn't figure out where he was originally going with that sentence but it didn't strike me as significant. Perhaps he was going to say "before the shooting began" but then stopped himself because he knew phrasing it that way would call attention to the new [shady AF] timeline.

       I felt really bad for him and empathize with his frustration. He's spending so much time and energy correcting people who are accusing him of lying about stuff he never said (e.g. there being a "note" in the room, which he never said) plus it seems pretty clear that the FBI has been jerking him around. Like why isn't his handler (Agent Rouse) spending any time at the podium? He's obviously the one with the most intel about the investigation, and the discretion to decide what can/cannot be shared publicly. I don't blame Lombardo for being pissy and passive aggressive in that situation.

       I actually like Lombardo a lot.  Whatever BS is going on is definitely not coming from him. He would prefer to be completely open and honest- you can tell by watching him. He just can't.

       maybe Campos was the second shooter (there are two broken windows after all) and the two single shots at the very end of the mass shooting was Campos offing Paddock and then shooting himself in the leg to sell his story and why he's been referred to as a suspect and why we haven't seen this guy in the media yet???

       I've speculated this as well. Campos was the second shooter. He never called the cops or for help. He was in the adjoining room and then shot Paddock in the head. Then shot himself in the leg to be a more convincing story of a security guard.

       I keep seeing this theory floated that Campos was "posing as a security guard" but actually the second shooter. I feel like this is a very easily debunked theory. "Hey XYZ Security. Does Jesus Campos work for you?" "No?" Busted.

       I still think Paddock was running guns and had security guards at different hotels that were in on it. Something went wrong with this one, and he got killed. Possibly by Campos. Possibly by the buyers.  For some unknown reason, Campos realizes he’ll implicated, and opens fire on the crowd from Paddock’s room to create the impression Paddock just went off the fucking rails and extract himself from the situation.

       I'm wondering if he had line of sight of his vehicle in the parking garage from the room. Blowing the fuel tanks on one side of Mandalay Bay and blowing up his vehicle in the parking garage would be a really big diversion. He would be able to exit much easier in the chaos and confusion. He would need help to get away, but nobody is buying that he did this alone anyway.

       My theory is that an accomplice was supposed to park the van next to the fuel tanks. There's a road that leads right by them. Explains why he was shooting at them, his accomplice bailed and didn't place the van.

       Yeah it's really hard to check the video cameras and interview a security guard to determine if someone was shot before or after the biggest mass shooting in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's easy to tell it was only one shooter immediately after the shooting stopped. No further investigation necessary.

       Maybe it doesn't matter whether anybody knows what actually took place that night. Maybe they really only care about measuring our collective attention span. I wonder how long, in comparison to historic mass shootings, this one will be one the news or talked about in the media. Considering the absolute assault on the senses we've have since last year, something this big might fade away as quickly as everything else, including the whitehouse being called "an Adult Day Care" by a republican senator....on tv.

       Nope. While all Las Vegas hotel/casinos have a shit load of security cameras on the casino floors, most hotels actually don't have any security cameras in the hallways. I pretty sure that Mandalay Bay didn't, but someone else can confirm. All they can see from footage would be what Paddock did at the casino and parking garage.

       This actually makes a lot of sense. It means that Paddock may have been caught by surprise by Campos. He may not have been fully prepared to begin the mass shooting. This may explain why the scene seemed disorganized and why there were so many lulls in firing. He may not have had everything in position yet for quick reloads and it slowed him down.

       It opens up more possibilities that's for sure. Whetger it's a good or bad thing idk. It may explain the car. Perhaps paddock didn't have time to place it. It also asnswers the question people were asking about why he wouldn't wait until the concert let out when the street in front of Mandalay would have been packed. Maybe he intended to but he didn't have time.

      </p>
      <p>
       Now has more credence to it. In the counter argument to the OP of that thread people are saying that the other shots being fired were the shooter shooting at the door but we now know this is not correct in that Paddock shot at the door before shooting into the crowd so now the chance of there being more than one shooter is higher based on the video given.

       That's what I'm thinking. The so-called debunking of the taxi cab video regarding two shooters was based upon the theory that the muffled gunshots were Paddock firing his weapon inside his room and not out one of the 32nd floor windows. So if Campos is already down, who is he firing at inside of the hotel itself? The muffled shots are from another shooter further away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, they say he shot 200 rounds into the hallway (supposedly at Campos). Where is the brass in the foyer just inside the main suite door? And the only gun I see looks like a long barrel modification of an AR-15, with no mag loaded into it, by the way. Man this shit stinks to high heaven.

       But wait didn't the security guard arrived literally a minute before the police and that is how they're confident there is only one shooter in the room? Also can't they hear the internal shooting on the recording? Also if it wasn't the security guard that made him stop shooting and decide to go ahead and kill himself than what did make him just suddenly stop?

       Total speculation here.  But if the main stream narrative is to believed, it's certainly possible that Paddock had scanners set up in his room and heard the police chatter about knowing his exact location.

       That's about all I can think of though.  None of this story fits together very well at the moment.

       Anybody have the police chatter transcripts with timestamps?  If Paddock was listening, that would give us a clue.  If the police said "32nd floor, 32nd floor!" at 10:15pm, and Paddock stopped at that moment, then boom, we have our answer.  We can overlay the transcript over the Raymond Page and taxi drivers' video and see if there is correlation with the final pistol shots.

       Thanks, I don't feel like this changes anything. I mean the way she put it was that there was one(1) single shot fired that hit the guard and then the volleys started going off.I have no idea where she got that from I was under the impression that the gunman let it rip after he saw Campos in the hallway, meaning full volley fire for two whole mags.

       It is definitely inconsistent. The 200 round volley and hit in the leg was the story up until tonight. The release of the 6 min early event (one shot or 200? who knows) was dropped just before this interview, even Floyd was confused and said he had to think about it but did say for certain he did not hear one or 200 6 mins early. It stinks.

       That's what I've been curious about, but never bothered to look at the lineup info for the show featuring anticipated set times for each performer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming Aldean was the last act, the shooter should have had everything set up by then (easy access to guns which were previously loaded, extra ammo for his preferred guns within arm's reach).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also be interested in hearing audio from LVMPD dispatch prior to 10:05 P.M. PST. Had officers been informed of shots fired, along with the specific location/floor of the incident, who knows how this could've played out?

       Would explain the small hammer, to knock out the small cut out hole. The police would know this though since there would have been a drill and stuff laying around. The only reason we know anything is from those leaked pics of the crime scene, imagine what the story would be if we didn't even have that. Unless thats what they want us to think...

       He did not look happy Laura Loomer was there waiting to ask questions, at the start of the press some noise emanated from where Laura was standing and Sheriff turned around and looked annoyed in her direction. Then a minute later he said "I will be answering a SMALL amount of questions." He seemed really annoyed by her presence.

       Yeah but there is not motive for them to hide him being a suspect. Unless he's one of those powerful, well hooked up security guards with deep CIA ties

       The "motive" would be that he would flee if he thought he was a suspect. I imagine there's a very specific reason why we found out the new info we got today and not earlier. Maybe they have him in custody already.

       This erases the reason for him to stop firing and off himself though...
      </p>
      <p>
       Up til now it was the going theory that him seeing the guard coming caused a panic that made him fire at the hallway and then decide not to risk getting caught and kill himself then.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he shot the guard before the massacre, why would he stop so soon with nothing on his security feed to spook him?

       These strike me as rather peculiar.

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         How did Campos only get hit in the leg after a hail of 200 bullets fired his way into the hallway with no cover?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         After he was shot, why did he just sit there in the hallway without taking cover for 20 minutes and not call for reinforcements? Very odd.

       Wait, wasn't he shot in the hallway? (correct me if I'm wrong)
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't someone notice a fucking security guard bleeding out in the hallway 30 minutes before the shooting started? I mean it's Vegas so I know people are getting all trashed and gambling their kids college funds away but someone must have walked down that hallway.

       Yeah it's really hard to check the video cameras and interview a security guard to determine if someone was shot before or after the biggest mass shooting in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's easy to tell it was only one shooter immediately after the shooting stopped. No further investigation necessary.

       million dollar question. The new timeline means that if the other info is supposed to be trusted... the guard would have been up on the floor from the time he was shot 9:59pm till 10:18pm when he told the officers he was shot and directed them to the room Paddock was in. 19 minutes went by and he was Evacuating people from the floor we are being told.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sense. You take one round out of 200 fired at you. You call it in and just evacuate everyone from their rooms into the same hallway you were just shot at from... you know.. the hallway with the gunman at the other end of it.

       How in the hell do people think a gun deal lead to mass murder?? Yes, lets set a gun deal in a busy hotel on the Vegas strip for a small amount of guns and if it goes bad instead of just killing Paddock and making it look like a suicide we will shoot out windows and fire at 22,000 people and draw national attention to ourselves. Said no one ever. No gun deal...he didn't have enough guns to even be worth the time. And don't forget the guns were all in his name.
