       Lol. So a hotel worker finds Paddock, kills him, then commits the largest mass murder in us history using paddocks guns. Because I assume Paddock and county music lovers are shitty tippers?

       It seemed so strange from the beginning the way the media is portraying the guard.  Mentioning that he's a hero in the middle of an article.  If someone really was a hero like that, the media would have a field day.  That's what they live for.  They would show pictures of him and his family hugging in the hospital and set it to emotion music.  He would get interviewed on every station.  There would be a GoFundMe with like a million dollars in it for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, we get a casual mention.  Now obviously knowing he was shot before the shooting started, he's not really a hero, but you would think he would have called the police which got the ball rolling in a quicker response time, so still kinda heroic, even if unintentional.  But we hear nothing from the media.  Maybe he really is just a private guy like they're trying to say, but I don't buy it.

       I can absolutely understand wanting to stay private after something like this, the media attention is cancer but after this twist in the story questions have to be asked about the guard.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was now shot prior to any shots outside, why? 
And the whole shooting at the fuel tanks.. why would he think it would work? After the amount the planning and explosive substances in his vehicle why  would he just go full meme movie style and shoot a heavily armoured fuel tank.

       The sheriff says the guard "encountered" the shooter before the shooting, not that the guard was shot before the shooting. Maybe the entire press conference will clarify the meaning of "encountered".

        On Monday, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo announced a change to the sequence of events that occurred on Oct. 1, saying a security guard who encountered Paddock was actually shot at 9:59 p.m. local time, minutes before the 64-year-old unleashed a hail of gunfire on unsuspecting concertgoers.

        this
       </a>
       is that the FBI and LVPD can come out 8 days after the fact and completely changed the basic facts of their story of the worst mass shooting in the history of the United State while opening up a whole huge set of patently obvious and critical new questions such as:
      </p>
      <p>
       Why didn't Campos contact the police or at least his hotel security coworkers at 9:59 PM (6 minutes before the mass shooting began) to tell them he had been shot?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why didn't Campos contact the police or at least his hotel security coworkers at 10:05 PM when he must have heard the hundreds of 160 decibel automatic weapon rounds being unleashed on an innocent crowd?
      </p>
      <p>
       If he did so at either point, then why wasn't any of this information reported on any police scanner?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did the supposed 200 rounds shot at Campos also happen at 9:59 PM?
      </p>
      <p>
       How could this occur without other hotel residents hearing the shots and calling 911 or at least the Mandalay Bay front desk?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why weren't any of the 17 armed Mandalay Bay security guards immediately dispatched to investigate the situation and subdue the guest? You had better believe that they can protect their chips and vaults against far more than one 64 year old shooter with extreme deadly force!
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was it a complete surprise to the cops when they found an injured Campos on that floor some 13 minutes after he was shot?
      </p>
      <p>
       What didn't the hotel security cameras catch Paddock drilling expensive hotel property?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why didn't other guests report any of this drilling or shooting to the front desk or the police?

       If they compted the room to him, setup some easy just be there type meeting for stephen promising a large pay out, guard is supposed to look out...for what?  You are still assuming that stephen was the actual shooter and shot those people from his broken hotel room.

       Yes, i too ask why didnt ANY staff or hotel guests report hearimg the shooter or some dude blasting a machine gun down the hallway, when you can hear it ringing outside and down the strip. Check this out...makes you wondee if spooks secretly rented out all of the rooms on that floor to ensure no one would be there to actually see anything.

       Now this is really not adding up.  He was shot several minutes before the shooting even started?  I wish we knew more about this security guard.  Here's a theory, and it should go without saying that nobody should direct any animosity toward this guy because for all we know he could be 100% innocent, but is it possible he was involved and it was politically motivated due to the whole immigration thing and the election?  I mean, it was a country music concert that was shot up.  Is this guy Mexican heritage?
      </p>
      <p>
       But even if that theory were true, it still doesn't add up.  Does that mean Paddock was in on it and then Campos shot him so he would take the fall?  Or was Paddock just a patsy from the beginning, which doesn't make sense for a civilian to not only plot this all out solo, but create a patsy too.  For someone to do that alone they would have to be meticulous person with a genius level IQ practically.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the security guard was involved, there was most likely at least one other person involved as well.  On the other hand, it seems unlikely that this Campos guy could get interrogated by the FBI for a few hours and not have them break him, or at least detect inconsistencies with his story.  But at the same time, the FBI can't be trusted, which we have to remember.

       Well yknow I once knew a guy just like that. He was a carpenter with lots of crazy ideas. Some saw him as a hero but others feared and hated him...

       And no I'm not talking about Jesus. I'm talking about Miguel from set design-

       .. honestly.. the more I read (and I saw this posted in one of the million threads popping up).. I think we're actually building the narrative for TPTB.. for how late any info coming out and how it's asking many of the questions we've been asking..
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk.. it's just a suggestion - we should be building theories in private with every bit of info and comparing when they release an update.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't disagree but something in this case is missing. With on going investigation it has only done one of two things .. further confuse any narrative OR discredit their own original narrative.

       Good work all! (For those of you genuinely wanting to figure this out.. step back from the situation.. you're great thinkers but you're getting to caught up in a situation to evaluate what's up and down: not in a negative way but like a bad relationship.. you don't know what's good and bad based on your compass)
