        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So he was in room 32135 when he shot himself, but had also been shooting out of 32134 which was linked with an internal door which was found locked when SWAT entered. </p>

<p>In the pictures outside of room 134 the trolley with cameras is pushed up against the door, so at some point during shooting he had to leave the room he broke in to, push the trolley back against the door and go to room 135 before Jesus Compos turns up. He would have also of had to have camera set up in both rooms in order to see Jesus and shoot him in the leg. Unless Jesus knocked and alerted him that way. </p>

<p>Is there even a gap in the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/juaMQSU.jpg">Anon timelime</a> long enough for him to move rooms. It&#39;s possible I have just misunderstood something. </p>

<p><del>Edit: I just realised that SWAT also said he had screwed the door closed with a metal plate and had to use a pry bar to get in, how did he have time to screw the door shut? He must have used the internal door.</del></p>

<p>2nd Edit: The door that was screwed shut was the stairwell door, I guess the important thing here is if room 134 was his or Brian Hodges. If it was his then he would have had time to set up both rooms and screw the stairwell door closed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So he would have had to wait for Brian to leave, break in to his room, take atleast a couple of riles and camera equipment and a hammer through to his room, it seems like a risk when he could have just been caught in the hallway or Brian could have just come back as he was poking a camera out of the door. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seems more and more like Paddock was the patsy.  </p>

<p>Perhaps he did some work for one of the private U.S. military organizations and this was their scheme to achieve a goal, more fear mongering, and justification for increasing surveilance and control of individuals.  .  .  </p>

<p>And to keep him from, sharing.  He probably dared to say no to further assignments or was for some reason deemed to be no longer trustworthy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s my recent understanding that the inside doors (there&#39;s two) both lock automatically when shut. So it&#39;s possible Paddock (assuming Brian Hodge is wrong) could have simply shut the doors behind him as he switched from 134 to 135 and they would end up locked from the inside like SWAT found</p>

<p>Who was in Room 134 though? I did a tweet where I have arrows pointing to the wires that are in Room 135 and go in the direction of Room 134. I&#39;ve pointed out the wire behind the camera on the cart and how there appears to be a wire coming out from under Room 134&#39;s door. Here&#39;s the tweet I did (I also included a link to the video that shows how close the doors of Room 135 are to Room 134 too)...
