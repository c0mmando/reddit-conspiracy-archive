<p><em>edit, 5:09.  *<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ABC/status/917516195342905344">Apparently</a></em>, the security guard was shot <em>6 minutes before</em> &quot;paddock&quot; opened up on the crowd.</p>

<p>*edit 5:31. Surely most of you have seen the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mXe9dk77bk">comparison of an M240 machine gun to bump-stock firing</a>.  Bump-stock can only be fired with bi-pod if the gun has a sort of sliding mount. Interesting, isn&#39;t it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s speculation, like most all else, because the people who are supposed to be working for us (supposedly) have not yet given us any actual evidence.  Only one good leak of a man who appears to look like Paddock (ear lobes???).  <strong>BUT</strong> we have some of our own evidence.  More and more video footage and audio from the location.  We also have footage of the authority&#39;s changing story.... where will it lead?  Let&#39;s pay attention to the evidence we have.  Don&#39;t discount theories too early.</p>

<p>I work at the Mandalay Bay. Rumors are flying that Campos is Al Qaeda and recruited Paddock. They carried out the massacre together, but Campos double-crossed his White AQ brother and killed him, framing him as the lone patsy. Campos has the service elevator keys. No one knows where he is now and we think he&#39;s fled the country. Of course LVMPD won&#39;t report this!</p>
