    <div class="md"><p>I have a feeling the LVMPD hasn&#39;t had a chance to talk to Jesus directly, or at least not Sheriff Lombardo. The FBI took over the investigation pretty early on, so the Sheriff was probably initially going off of what Jesus told his guys when they arrived on the 32nd floor, and then from there going off secondhand information from the FBI. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always found the security guard story shady so I&#39;ve paid close attention to it in all the press conferences, and it&#39;s the topic Lombardo consistently seems least confident in discussing. </p>

<p>I suspect that&#39;s one of the reasons he was so agitated in today&#39;s briefing. He looks like a jackass every time he gets up there and tells a new story, and then late last week he came out saying Campos was a hero, and now a few days later he finds out the FBI and/or Campos have been lying to him about what happened. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you’re right on he Lombardo end. Why do you think we haven’t seen any photos or pressers with Campos?  Seems to be lauded as a hero in the biggest mass shooting we’ve had and nothing. Also odd that a 27 year old in Vegas has no social media footprint</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One scenario I shared last night (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7570se/jesus_campos_beenverified/do40so9">here</a>) was that he&#39;s an illegal who speaks poor English. This would explain several things. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>If he doesn&#39;t speak English very well, that could explain why his story keeps changing. Instead of the story changing, the truth is just getting lost in translation. </p></li>
<li><p>If he&#39;s not a legal citizen, that could explain why officials haven&#39;t released his photo, why he isn&#39;t giving any interviews/doing the talk show circuit, why he has no social media presence (if he&#39;s trying to stay under the radar), why we haven&#39;t heard from his family, and why we know nothing about his personal or professional background. </p></li>
<li><p>If this is the case, then maybe officials are scrambling to get him retroactive citizenship so that he can legally testify (if necessary) against any accomplices and step out into the public spotlight as the hero he truly is. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>But after finding out today that he was actually shot before the shooting, I&#39;m leaning heavily toward Scenario #2 (that he was in on it). Either that or the Feds are influencing his story for some reason.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An illegal immigrant can absolutely testify in court.</p>

<p>Additionally there is no way the casino would have a security guard who wasn&#39;t a citizen and even if they did they would not have someone as security who can&#39;t speak English since they routinely speak to guests and law enforcement. </p>

<p>And even in the off off off chance they did they would absolutely have a translator there. Plus most agents are bilingual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A psyop within a psyop? Trying to gauge people&#39;s reactions when they blatantly lie. They probably did not have to change their story so many times...but they want to keep pushing it to fuck with us.</p>

<p>Seriously this security guard info would have been released the next day. It&#39;s extremely easy to verify and get the story straight on something like that.</p>
