    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking, perhaps whoever he ordered room service with...perhaps who helped with the shooting, or perpetrated it entirely themselves. After that press briefing, all we have is a dead man in a room filled with guns after a shooting, it&#39;s perfect. Of course the body must be that of the perpetrator, if logic is followed. Yet we are told no video footage of his entry to the hotel or casino exists...why? Perhaps he wasn&#39;t alone. Key facts are being concealed by omission and deceit.</p>

<p>The second shooter was the one shooting for the 9 to 11 minutes. They probably kept it limited so they wouldn&#39;t get caught.</p>

<p>&quot;
Donaldson ran the last few blocks to the hotel, he said, but he ditched the cowboy boots he was wearing in the casino because they hurt his feet.</p>

<p>&quot;I was faster barefoot and I was going to be more effective barefoot,&quot; he said.

    <div class="md"><p>Also they keep saying how nice of a guy he was. Which I think he might have been. But the people that are nice guys like that always have some fucked up shit in there closet like Cosby. </p>

<p>1- was he killing long before this? A serial killer never caught. It&#39;s hard to believe that someone decides to kill at 64 let alone kill so many. What if he was a serial killer and went for the big one
2- a patsy
3- CIA agent
4- an FBI pushing someone to do something they might not have done and hoping to catch him before he went through with it?
5- someone like the Unabomber? Some bs CIA torture program that messed his head up?</p>

<p>For some reason I don&#39;t believe he was isis or arms dealer. </p>

<p>Maybe the guard was his accomplice. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a really confusing one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to go all out with theories on what happened but it is readily apparent there&#39;s some extremely big details they are trying to hide.</p>

<p>The FBI and the entire police department did not give the wrong time a security guard got shot by mistake. This guard is alive and well. It was impossible to get this information wrong and then give it to the public for a week straight incorrectly.</p>

<p>Debunkers are always trying to say &quot;Occam&#39;s razor&quot;...so what is more likely? LVPD, FBI and whatever other agency working on this couldn&#39;t find out one of the most critical details in the case either by interviewing the guard and simply watching video tape OR there is more to the story?</p>

<p>If someone believes it&#39;s the first option..I would love to hear how this simple info was not figured out the day after the shooting. You think the guard didn&#39;t give his story to police until today?</p>
