        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Ok so I haven&#39;t seen this posted anywhere and I am unsure if anybody else has made this connection. 
I feel the events that I will go on to explain in detail are too strategic to be random. </p>

<p>I will start with a brief explanation of why these events were significant and give a little bit of background to the players involved for those of you who do not follow British politics. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, a general election was called. There wasn&#39;t supposed to be one, it was called as a power play by the prime minister Theresa May. 
It was her belief and the belief of all political commentators at the time, that in doing so she would win a higher majority and that would enable the Conservative party to pass anything they wanted through parliament without much opposition. </p>

<p>The reason they believed it would be a landslide victory was because, at the time, the Labour leader, (basically the democrats for Americans) Jeremy Corbyn was polling the lowest figure imaginable for a leader of the opposition. Theresa May was something like 20 points ahead in the approval ratings.  This was mostly due to unfair reporting by the predominantly right-wing media in this country who portrayed Jeremy Corbyn as a &quot;Marxist&quot; and a &quot;terrorist sympathiser&quot;. Jeremy Corbyns view is that instead of cutting welfare for the poor we should increase taxes on corporations and invest the money in public services in order to kick start the economy. Which as you can imagine went down a treat with the likes of Rupert Murdoch who would dedicate front page after front page of his highly popular newspapers slandering Jeremy Corbyn. The best way to describe Jeremy Corbyn to those of you outside of the UK is basically a British Bernie Sanders whom actually became the leader. </p>

<p>So, Theresa May calls an election and everybody has accepted it as basically a formality. The woman was seen as someone who could do no wrong. Then a few weeks into the campaign Jeremy Corbyn releases a manifesto which really appealed to people, it promised to abolish tuition fees and to tax the top 1% to invest in the 99% amongst other things. </p>

<p>Theresa May obviously couldn&#39;t compete with that and when her manifesto was leaked the day before the launch, for the first time ever during Mays stint as Prime Minister she was being questioned. One thing in particular that the press picked up on was something labelled the &quot;dementia tax&quot;. The Conservatives were also accused of performing a &quot;U-turn&quot; on their proposed policies as a reaction to Labours manifesto. 
This would lead to a complete blunder of a press conference in which Theresa May would earn the nickname &quot;<a href="https://youtu.be/LMSoIw1gIM0">Maybot</a> &quot; as she seemed robotic and almost like she was &quot;malfunctioning&quot; during a press Q &amp; A which you can see <a href="https://youtu.be/rPLU6QaNJLI">here</a>. </p>

<p>This is where the conspiracy starts. The media had no choice but to attack her as to ignore this and pretend everything was great would just be too obvious of a bias. The media had to be relentless as social media and word on the street was that doubts about her leadership and the Conservatives in general were beginning to form. Theresa May then had a grilling <a href="https://youtu.be/QPzlFxYhR28">interview</a> later that evening. </p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t the plan at all and Labour were now becoming much less of a joke in the eyes of the public. What exactly could possibly stop this nightmare for the Conservatives? 
Well, that very evening, <a href="https://youtu.be/PdQPaxFtVdk">this happened.</a>
I chose the news program purposefully to show you how much Theresa May was being battered by the press, until all attention was diverted to the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/40009766">Manchester Arena bombing</a>.
This completely changed things. All those headlines, the press narrative that was heaping pressure on Theresa May was gone, just like that. It was a shocking and tragic event. This also caused all campaigning to be stopped for a few days out of respect. I feel it&#39;s important to also add that the Conservatives are seen as tougher on security than Labour are. </p>

<p>Now, I know what your thinking at this point. This is just a coincidence. Yeah the timing was perfect for the Tories in a political sense but it&#39;s just one of those things. I certainly didn&#39;t think there was some conspiracy at the time either. That was until <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-40105324">this</a>. </p>

<p>Theresa May, on the 1st June,  decided to not appear in a live TV debate. This again had social media in a frenzy and forced the mainstream media to again attack her. The attacks were again, relentless. Jeremy Corbyn was now in a really good position. Certainly not leading in the polls but he was gaining, and gaining leaps and bounds. From being 20 points behind when the election was called, Jeremy Corbyn had now reached the point where some polls were placing him as close as 5 points behind. This was unimaginable at the start of the election. The momentum of Jeremy Corbyn was gaining, the momentum of a man who, if he became Prime Minister, would raise the taxes of the top 1%. </p>

<p>So what could possibly stop this momentum in its tracks? I mean, the last thing that stopped it was a terrorist attack but that couldn&#39;t possibly happen again. What exactly would be the odds of <em>another</em> terrorist attack happening to release the mounting pressure on Theresa May and to put a halt to the increasing momentum of Jeremy Corbyn? </p>

<p>Whatever the odds of that happening may have been, it didn&#39;t matter. Because that&#39;s exactly what <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40146916">happened</a> two days later, on the 3rd of June. </p>

<p>So once again, 5 days out from the actual vote. Two days after pressure was once again mounting, terrorists decided to strike. Two terrorist attacks which proved to be very convenient for the Conservatives. </p>

<p>This ultimately lead to an outcome which kept the Conservatives in power but not by much. They ended the general election weaker than they were going into it. They lost seats and decreased the majority they had. It meant the Conservatives having the largest share of votes but not enough to even form a government. So, they were in turmoil. The election was seen as a complete disaster and in order to stay in power they were going to have to make a deal with a party called the DUP, to have enough seats to form a government. This lead to the press once again going after Theresa May. It was even considered possible that there could be another general election or that Labour could form a minority government if the Conservatives couldn&#39;t agree a deal with the DUP in time. </p>

<p>Pressure was mounting, the press were <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/815375/General-Election-2017-Theresa-May-Conservative-revolt-backlash-Boris-Johnson-David-Davis">relentless</a>, social media was full of people laughing at the Conservatives and it seemed like the government was going to crumble. Every day after the election, the attacks were increasing, there seemed to be nothing that could possibly divert attention away this time. I mean it&#39;s not like another terrorist attack could happen to just sweep all this away. The last two were just &quot;lucky&quot; for the Conservatives but there was no chance that something like that could happen again, was there?</p>

<p>Six days later, six days. Not even a full week after the general election, the biggest stories in the media were still regarding how much of a disaster the Conservatives were. Six days with nowhere to hide, no escape, then <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-40283176">this happened.</a></p>

<p>The Grenfell tower block, home to many poor people in this country, was engulfed in flames. Many lives lost and destroyed. Momentum was building in the press regarding the disarray of the Conservatives party and suddenly another catastrophic event forced it&#39;s way into the headlines. All attention was once again diverted and the Conservatives were once again blessed with a fatal bit of &quot;luck&quot;. No longer was anybody talking about the general election disaster, all attention was firmly on yet another disaster. </p>

<p>Now this was all well and good for the Conservatives, that was until it was revealed that the reason that tower block caught fits so quickly, was because the government had bought and approved of cheap and <em>flammable</em> cladding to be used on the building. Cladding which residents of the building had brought up with their local Conservative council, out of fear for their safety, concerns which fell on deaf ears. So the press were now no longer talking about the election disaster and instead were pointing their fingers at the Conservatives for at the very least being <em>indirectly</em> responsible for the fire. Things began to heat up again, people were angry and were beginning to blame the Conservatives for the disaster. That was until, five days later, a miracle happened for the Conservatives, a miracle in the form of yet another <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/22/finsbury-park-attack-victim-makram-ali-died-of-multiple-injuries-postmortem-finds">terrorist attack.</a></p>

<p>The attack on Finsbury Park, was finally enough to ease the pressure on the Conservatives. They made their deal with the DUP, got the majority needed without the media attacking them, and have remained in power since. </p>

<p>So there you have it. Theresa May is still Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the media pressure on her and the Conservatives has eased dramatically. It was never allowed to build momentum due to a series of unfortunate events. 
What do I think happened? I don&#39;t know exactly. Either the top 1% became spooked at the thought of losing a considerable amount of wealth and arranged for these attacks to happen in order to keep the status quo.
Perhaps Theresa May herself arranged for the attacks to happen, in order to stay in power or maybe they let attacks that could have been thwarted &quot;slip through the net&quot;. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know who did it, I don&#39;t know if it was a combination of the above explanations. One thing I do know though, these weren&#39;t just coincidences. The odds of these being coincidences are far greater than the odds of these being inside jobs. Perhaps somebody here, in this community full of minds far greater than mine, can solves this. I hope they can, the victims and the families deserve the truth. As a citizen of this country I have never felt more unsafe, these attacks have proven anyone is expendable as long as the rich and powerful get to remain that way. </p>

<p>So what do you think r/conspiracy? False flags to remain in power or acts of god which have resulted in the deaths of the poor and the innocent in order to satisfy the greed of the rich and the powerful?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you have said is spot on. I have upvoted you just for the excellent information you have provided in the right order.</p>

<p>Everytime a terrorist attack occurred, I was sad for the people who had died but my second thought was always &quot;this is going to help the Conservatives&quot;. We will never know if this helped them in the end as the other narrative could be &quot;They are unable to keep us safe&quot;. Both from terrorists and Health and Safety.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if these were false flags. But I do know for a fact the Corbyn is Pro Palestine and against the ever encroachment of Israeli settlements. </p>

<p>Finally, if you have noticed recently, the narrative against Corbyns Labour Party is that they are Anti-Semites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for reading and for the upvote. I have been meaning to post this for a while now but haven&#39;t quite found the time until tonight. That was also my thoughts but I also knew that uncertainty and threat normally leads to people less likely to pursue a change for one reason or another. I do think of these tragedies hadn&#39;t occurred it&#39;s very possible that Jeremy Corbyn could have become Prime Minister though as there wouldn&#39;t have been any let up for Theresa May and the Conservatives. </p>

<p>I have no idea who is responsible but I definitely think there is a truth that hasn&#39;t been revealed yet. I just can&#39;t believe that this was all just coincidences and something else that I should have maybe mentioned was just how &quot;normal&quot; everything has become again after all of this. No acts of terrorism or catastrophic events, just back to business as usual. I think it&#39;s inevitable though that as long as May is Prime Minister there is going to be a period of mounting media pressure after some form of blunder and that something else will happen when it does. </p>

<p>I have noticed this also and I think he even mentioned it at the Labour conference speech. It&#39;s interesting times ahead indeed. </p>

<p>The problem is that in most of the English speaking world, people conflate anti-Israeli with anti-semite. I&#39;m sure Israel itself encourages this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to write this up. It&#39;s nice to get some perspective on the politics in another country, and I was unaware of how these terrorist attacks aligned with the political timeline. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have too much to add other than these events sound like the typical globalist schemes. Who knows how the future will pan out, but it&#39;s encouraging to know that these types of plans aren&#39;t nearly as effective as they used to be </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I also don&#39;t believe it&#39;s coincidence. Who made the sophisticated IED in the Manchester attack? </p>

<p>Then you have stuff like today where the story was released by the BBC as a timed deflection tactic carried out at the request of the Tory Party.</p>

<p>Grenfell Tower isn&#39;t coincidence either.  The sad truth is that it wouldn&#39;t have been reported much if the Tories didn&#39;t need a distraction. Before then it would have been a page 5 story, glossed over by the media as &quot;Tower blaze kills 10 people&quot; or whatever the number was of already confirmed dead at the time. The media and especially the BBC have the power to choose what the public focuses on.</p>
