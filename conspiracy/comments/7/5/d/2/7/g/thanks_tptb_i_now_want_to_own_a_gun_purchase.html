<p>BCC is what is described in Satoshi&#39;s whitepaper. The person who literally invented Bitcoin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, words do have meaning.</p>

<p>You asked me...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Show me exactly what you claim I project. If you want to make accusations, back them up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I showed you were you projected. Your following reply was you clearing up your definition was it not? Your original definition was that it is a free market anarcho capitalist tool. You now state that it is a p2p digital cash. Do you see where the projection happened? How a Bitcoin is p2p digital cash which MAY be used as a free market anarcho capitalistic tool? If I recall the white paper only made mention of p2p digital cash and nothing about free market anarcho-capitalism. Words do have meaning.</p>

<p>As for your first sentence. No, it is not &quot;hard&quot; and nor is it free money. It is a decentralized form of money that is exchanged through a digital mechanism dealing with ledgers and cryptography. Discrediting the &quot;hard&quot; money part. I get it, you meant &quot;free&quot; as in not controlled. But let us be realistic with the terminology and what attributes define &quot;free&quot; as I have just shown that &quot;free&quot; is such a broad term. Bitcoin does have a deflationary nature. As for &quot;store of value&quot; and it not having any value you are completely wrong. The most accurate summation for its value and thus itself (the unit, not the mechanism governing it) is equivalent to the variables: human supply and demand for it (human use of monies i.e liquidity/volatility), available energy immediately available and the efficiencies for harnessing the energy (mining costs money), and the implicit waste of energy for calculating SHA256 (it is not really a waste though as you&#39;re buying into SHA256). In essence, with the second and third cases, Bitcoin acts as a warrant canary or even insurance policy guarantee for all western security systems (SSL/TLS, Implementations of HMAC, etc). So yes, it does have value in the form of an implicit energy currency and also a guarantee that the modern security cryptosystems that utilize the same hashing mechanism Bitcoin uses have not been breached at the hashing layer.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry but if this make you nod your head and agree but then go like oh but this is why BCU or BCC is good... It is exactly why Bitcoin Core Developers should remain in place. Like you said, words have meaning. And developers work only with words (variables) that have meaning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Typically, fuck anyone who considers themself a &#39;thought leader&#39;. In all industry it&#39;s always the same everywhere. A small handful of psycho&#39;s who wanna fuck the program and others.</p>

<p>I want to say believe me, but that would be ironic. So believe your own gut. It is right most of the time.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a huge invention. And Satoshi nailed it when he made it. As with all good things since the dawn of time, some people wanna corrupt it. Break it. Control it. It&#39;s always the same patterns. Infiltrate and subvert, control opposition, create censorship.</p>

<p>It&#39;s ridiculous how blind some people remain when the facts are so blatantly present. When someone fucks you over once, shame on them. When they fuck you over twice, shame on you. Well not &#39;shame&#39; cuz emotions are retarded but you get the idea.</p>

If he &quot;nailed&quot; it then why are there so many BIPs post whitepaper?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s analyze this real quick. Corruption is identical to greed which I have pointed out earlier to be a possibility for your actions (pumping coins anyone?). I&#39;m going to play devils advocate and pretend that you were ignorant in your marketing for BCU and BCC and it was non-malicious. In which case is a fork by definition breaking the block chain into two or more &#39;forks&#39;? Yes, it is the same patterns of attack, BCU and BCC. </p>

<p>Tip: Look at the geopolitical reasons of why the backers of BCC and BCU would try to fork the chain. BCU is the most obvious as it related to the largest creditor nation in the world. Think clearly, there are very real significant monetary consequences that can be disastrous for countries that have not fully adopted to Bitcoin or have significant assets to lose if Bitcoin became mainstream successful/trusted (existing owned debt). If you have been keeping up with China&#39;s policies and their citizens, you will actually be bewildered that China actually uses digital cryptocoins EVERYWHERE today. Go to a McDs or a KFC and you need to use a QR code + cryptocoin to purchase food and items. Legacy tenders are almost extinct! Yet they are not using Bitcoin and yet their &quot;cryptocoin&quot; which is not decentralized (completely state owned) is used more commonly and more relevantly than Bitcoin. And guess what... Bitcoin came first too.</p>
