       Are you insane?  Just subtract the word "Trump" from your post, and explain what fucking movement you claim to pledge allegiance to and then do some research and when you come back to something relevant, IF YOU CAN COME BACK, explain how Trump is your 1st choice of evil.

       I find it strange that when Bush was in power, the mainstream conspiracy community had no problem criticizing him. That all changed with Trump, even though Trump is not an ounce different.

       That should raise alarms for you. If it doesn't, your judgement is in question.

       Well, Jones has a consistent stream of new listeners coming in. So, for every ten that figure out that he is a traitor, ten more new ones replace them. But even so, he is getting really sloppy. Even his buddy Ron Paul called him out as a neocon on air.

       Most conspiracy theorists are Trump supporters. It's interesting. Lots of christian conspiracy theorists too. Which seems ironic because they don't believe anything on the news, yet they believe stories that dudes wrote down 2,000 years ago. You see it with Alex Jones and his crowd too. His fan base is religious and conservative Trump supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       They think Trump is the only non corrupt politician to ever exist and he's on their side. It's hilarious. But you aren't going to convince them otherwise. He's their guy and they would keep cheering for him if he chopped his dick off and married Obama. So most of the posts that hit the front page here are about how democrats suck. You'll rarely ever see a bad post about Trump here unless some serious shit goes down.

       Correction: most newbie conspiracy theorists are Trump supporters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The original, older conspiracy theorists don't play the right vs. left game, so they don't support any politician because they know that they are all working together.

       Absurd. Check polls for how many Americans think Bush had something to do with 9/11. Even if they do believe the offical narrative -- it's a conspiracy theory. Everyone is a conspiracy theorists.
