</ul>

<p>According to police scanner during the event it takes LVPD about 17 minutes to even identify the floor it&#39;s on.</p>

</ul>

<p>In 23 minutes from being shot , neither Campos ,especially, nor any other guests on that floor had called the cops to tell them someone just got shot?</p>

<p>The cops had no idea. Listen to the scanner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Police officers who started searching the hotel after the shooting began didn’t know a hotel security guard had been shot “until they met him in the hallway after exiting the elevator,” Lombardo said.</p>

<p>Charles &quot;Sid&quot; Heal, a retired Los Angeles County sheriff&#39;s commander and tactical expert, said the new timeline “changes the whole perspective of the shooting.&quot;</p>

<p>Heal said that if police had known immediately that a guard had been shot, they would have rushed the room while the gunman was still firing. He said it seemed to signal a breakdown in communication.</p>

<p>“It doesn&#39;t say much for hotel security,” Heal said.</p>

<p>After Campos was shot, a maintenance worker appeared on the 32nd floor and “Campos prevented him from receiving any injuries,” Lombardo said.</p>

<p>Representatives for the Mandalay Bay hotel casino and the union representing Mandalay Bay’s security guards did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.</p>

<p>This is what happened. Campos was busted in position keeping a lookout before the shooting by this maintenance guy. Maintenance guy talked. That&#39;s why the story changed</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure would be nice to know which door had the supposed alarm...</p>

<p>I doubt there&#39;d be an alarm on a guest room door.  People prop those open with the security latch, for instance when they order room service and want to be able to just yell to the guy to come on in.</p>

<p>If it was the stairwell door, that would make more sense.  Those could automatically lock in the event of a non-fire emergency - like an active shooter, to prevent that person from being able to move about freely.  &quot;IF&quot; it&#39;s true that Paddock had planned on escaping, he could have blocked a stairwell door from closing and thus locking him on the floor.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One would assume there&#39;s an activity log for security procedures. In some places, security guards usually carry around an electronic key reader which they have to use at certain &quot;checkpoints&quot; throughout their shifts. On top of that, everything should be logged by both the security branch, along with the surveillance branch (in casinos, these appear to be two separate branches, so to speak).</p>

<p>So where are the logs which would explain how a security guard ends up on the 32nd floor without an accompanying guard? If an alarm had gone off as previous reports had stated, even something as seemingly insignificant as that would still have to be documented.</p>

<p>His position and the way it coincides with the shooting is one of the more troublesome concerns regarding any efforts to put the pieces of the puzzle together. Also not sure that I believe the guy from Australia, if I&#39;m not mistaken, who claimed to be next door to Paddock, and who says there were multiple shooters (including one dead security guard).</p>

<p>The rabbit hole is becoming a sinkhole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure would be nice to know which door had the supposed alarm...</p>

<p>I doubt there&#39;d be an alarm on a guest room door.  People prop those open with the security latch, for instance when they order room service and want to be able to just yell to the guy to come on in.</p>

<p>If it was the stairwell door, that would make more sense.  Those could automatically lock in the event of a non-fire emergency - like an active shooter, to prevent that person from being able to move about freely.  &quot;IF&quot; it&#39;s true that Paddock had planned on escaping, he could have blocked a stairwell door from closing and thus locking him on the floor.  </p>
