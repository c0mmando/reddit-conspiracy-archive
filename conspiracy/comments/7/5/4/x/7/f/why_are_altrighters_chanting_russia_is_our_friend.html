I think Russia is a key ally in defeating Sunni extremism. That&#39;s about it.

    <div class="md"><p>If the polling was done by CNN, sure.  Trump is really irrelevant concerning the tensions between Russia and the US.  This is just a point that was jumped on because it aligned with partisan political opportunism, and neoconservative foreign policy objectives.  The Neoconservatives have been trying to escalate tensions since at least 2008, and really kicked into high gear with their foreign policy being shut down in Syria.    All of the posturing about concerns for journalists, or whatever oppressed population in Russia, is just that, posturing.

<p>I am not sure you have been following the developments here... Reagan and Gorbachev, almost agreed to nuclear disarmament, and we were very friendly with his government.  In the 90&#39;s we openly interfered to make sure Yeltsin wins.  The west in conjunction with the IMF developed &#39;Shock&#39; therapy that was implemented to transition the Russian economy, etc.  Russia was the first country to offer military aid, and support in access to airspace and logistic as a response to 9/11.  Obama made fun of political opponents who insisted on anti-Russian foreign policy.  Clinton attempted to do that ridiculous reset, etc.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are familiar with this term &#39;whataboutism&#39; right?  It came on the scene in 2008,  as a way to deflect hypocrisy in foreign policy.  To point out that Saudi Arabia has a worse record on gay rights and are supported, demonstrates that gay rights are not the real issue.  That was what the video attempted to demonstrate by linking all the policy papers that the Neoconservatives were putting out about how gay rights are an extension of foreign policy. </p>

<p>Lexicographers date the first appearance of the variant whataboutism to the 1990s,[1][10] while other historians state that during the Cold War Western officials referred to the Soviet propaganda strategy by that term.[7][13] </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>The point is not that Obama made fun of Romney, the point is he made fun of Romney because Romney had a stance that US foreign policy should treat Russia as the biggest threat. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps you haven&#39;t heard of the Magnitsky Act, or that Russia invaded Ukraine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps you haven&#39;t heard that Bill Browder is accused in conjunction with HSBC of defrauding the Russian treasury? Or that most of the information concerning Magnitsky comes from Browder? If you are interested in hearing from voices that are being censored by Browder, you can read the analysis of documents supposedly shared with Trump Jr. here:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6obu2i/documents_that_were_supposedly_shared_with_trump/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6obu2i/documents_that_were_supposedly_shared_with_trump/</a></p>

<p>There is also a good documentary on the Magnitsky case that Browder is having legally suppressed in the West. </p>

<p>Or maybe you are not familiar how the neocons got busted planing a coup in Ukraine? </p>

<p>u/Amos_Quito made this insightful post you should follow up on. </p>

<p>Maybe you don&#39;t understand politics and debates, or how leaders act.  Obama was simultaneously saying &quot;fuck you Putin&quot; while enacting sanctions on him.</p>

<p>Perhaps you don&#39;t understand the sanctions.  Nobody defrauded the Russian treasury.  And it&#39;s very easy to say &quot;accused of&quot; something.  This is the convenient one that somehow involves Comey too?</p>

<p>According to Browder, himself, it was Magnitsky who figured out who was behind the fraud perpetuated against the treasury?</p>

<p>You bring up the Magnitsky act, but you are clueless about the background of what Magnitsky supposedly did that makes him a hero. </p>

<p>Just to reinforce the point, read the judges opinion in the legal case I linked to.</p>

<p>You can see how my interlocutor has no idea what he is even commenting about. </p>

<p>Magnitsky sanctions did not target Putin in any way. </p>

<p>You can read the list of individuals that were targeted in this PDF from the treasury. </p>

<p>Maybe because, people are waking up to the propaganda that Russia is our enemy? We in the US are sick and tired of wars, whispers of wars, and boogieman enemies. The real enemy to  US citizens is the Corporation acting like our government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s simple.  A lot of people love Putin now because of their hatred for Hillary.  It&#39;s really quite bizarre how they think she&#39;s worse than an actual dictator who has people killed on a whim.</p>

<p>They know Russia interfered with the election, but they don&#39;t care.  To them it&#39;s all justified because Hillary lost.</p>

<p>Not coincidentally, some Trump supporters are white nationalists that hold these beliefs, and a lot of the white supremacists also hate gays, and that goes along with Putin&#39;s anti-LGBT stance.</p>

<p>Note:  Not saying all Trump supporters are white nationalists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought it was well know Democrats want to pin everything on Russia.</p>

<p>&quot;And now, for mostly political reasons, the Clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on Russia. After Trump suggested Wednesday that if Russia had indeed hacked Clinton&#39;s private email server it should release the emails, the Clinton campaign sent out its Democratic surrogates to bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DNC intended for Hillary to be the nominee. They should be unbiased and support a particular candidate after the public chose them in the primaries.</p>

<p>DNC collusion with media. Interviews were completely scripted and editied to make Hillary look as good as possible. Neither Trump or even Bernie given the same level of preferential treatment.</p>

<p>CNN leaked debate question to Hillary. This shows her true character. As far as I know, Hillary has yet to acknowledge or apologize for being dishonest to the American public.</p>

<p>Thats just the top three that stand out in my memory. I recall major findings in many of the releases, but not as specifically...though at least some revealed pay for play schemes...ironic considering this kind of collusion is exactly what all the &quot;muh russia&quot; hub bub is about.</p>
