       I've seen a few things lately about trump revealing the truth about the LV shooting and redpilling the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is the kind of guy who likes to be the best at everything. He is getting to the end of his life and has acheived the highest position that he can. What if he is planning on redpilling the world in order to become one of the greatest people in history. The president that brought down the largest conspiracy in history. He would be remembered forever.

       Not likely, since we track the big ones carefully and they don't exactly come out of nowhere. A fresh comet straight out of the Oort cloud is the scenario you are imagining, realistically. They don't light up until their first pass of the Sun. We could be in the cross-hairs of a civilization-ending giant right now and not know it. We'd get only 5-9 months warning in the worst case scenario, which is not enough time to do anything without massive preparation and infrastructure already in place.

       Is like to believe that but hes 70 and and he could live to 100 if he wanted to especially with how he doesn't drink or smoke.  I think the truth about trump is he wants to help but he's greedy.and they're using that to manipulate him.

       I would bet my bottom dollar you'll never be a billionaire, nor will you convince 63mil people to vote for you. You may not like the guy, that seems apparent, but to call him an idiot? I think we all know who the idiot is.

       I work in high volume sales, and Trump is better than most people credit at what he is known for. I like Scott Adams take on similar claims.

       He is an idiot - he has no clue what he's doing. He ran for president thinking it would never actually come to fruition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then a man who uses a golden toilet convinced a bunch of middle american morons in fly over states that haven't traveled more than 60 miles away from where they were born that he's the perfect fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't worry - we should respect him because he was GIVEN his money and barely beat the S&amp;P.

       Is Trump not a billionaire? That would be the same as turning $1,000,000 loan into $1,000,000,000(1,000 million)

       I digress, Trump actually made multiple billions, and I did a low ball comparison for the sake of easy numbers.

       Here is the problem, Trump is a lot smarter than you, the media, and his opponents perceive him to be. That has been the downfall for opponents since this he started. Do not under estimate the intelligence of your President. You'll be made a fool.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may not realize this, but Trump is legitimately the best manipulator of the media the world has ever seen. Disagree? Who comes close?

       Yeah, idk, I don't think you'll be writing the history books. He would probably go down in history as a real estate mogul who built a multiple billion $$ empire, sky scrapers across the country, who employed 1000s upon 1000s of people, and who, against all odds, won the presidency. The 1st person in American history to win the Presidency with no political experience.

       I wonder how wonderful a legacy will be for someone named Crumpledforeskin calling the president a buffoon. Please tell me you see the irony in this.

       He hasn't done anything that he said he was going to do. Where is his 60 day plan to beat ISIS? Where is the wall? Where is his health care plan? Where is his economic plan?

       Unfortunately, I am correct, he will go down as the worst president the United States has ever had. He isn't doing ANYTHING. And yet, you sit here smiling from ear to ear. Have you made any money personally? You think anything he is going to do is with your best intentions in mind? Absolutely not.

A corrupt republican controlled congress that can't agree the sky is blue unless their donors say so.

       His pockets are already filled, and the country has been crumbling for the last 30+yrs. I don't know if you realized that, yet. There are 2 ways to control a nation. 1 is by the sword, and the other is with debt. We are $20trl in debt with no logical way to pay it back in a generation. We have created a multi-generational economic slavery system. You, I, your kids, my kids, our friends are all economic slaves.  The dollar will collapse. It's not a matter of "if" but "when." The ship has been taking on water for years and Trump comes along to give people a bucket, and hope to save the ship.

Trump is an evil racist for following the laws already on the books. Trump is evil for wanting congress to put a DACA bill on his desk. You know, following the actual process to make a law. Trump is a dictator!! Muh muh muh feelings. Obama is gone. Deal with it.

       This has nothing to do with Obama. At all. But once again Trump supporters have nothing to support their arguments so they just say, "Look Obama was bad" "Look at Hilary she's done stuff that wasn't correct."  It's ok for Trump to be an idiot and ruin the country.

       You haven't even been able to defend his actions. You just bring up Obama. I truly would love to see what school you went to in middle America. I'm sure they're cranking out tons of talent.

       I don't need to defend any ones actions but my own. I'm not on trial, and I'm not a lawyer. Can Trump be wrong? Sure. Can Trump be right? Sure. Does every time someone make a mistake, I burn the bridge? Probably not. Doesn't seem rationale. Does he need to tweet what he does? Maybe yes, maybe no, I have not control with what he does, but it's fun seeing people like you have a melt down.

      <p>
       This is not a "bla bla you can't defend him."
If he's wrong, he's wrong. If he's right, he's right. Just like everyone else. I have no idea what "recent actions" you are talking about.

       Also nice picture, quick summary
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        During a 2009 visit to Pyongyang to seek the release of two detained American journalists, former U.S. President Bill Clinton raised the issue of abducted Japanese nationals with then-leader Kim Jong Il, a hacked document released by the secret-spilling site WikiLeaks has shown.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The memo, attached to an email sent to John Podesta, a former Clinton White House chief of staff who joined the ex-president on his mission, is part of a trove of emails released by WikiLeaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta, head of the liberal Center for American Progress think tank at the time, now serves as the campaign chair for Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s White House bid. WikiLeaks has been publishing emails since Oct. 7 from Podesta’s account,** which experts say was targeted by Russian hackers.**
      </p>

       HMMMMM Wonder who was behind that.

       Yes, you fucking clown. Manaforts indictment mentions "company A" and "Company B" who he was working on behalf of while he was lobbying. Any idea who company A or company B are?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is bringing up old shit on Manafort, and the sleaze ball broke the law. The charges stem from nothing in connection to Russia/Trump collusion. It's basically tax evasion.

       You mean when a fake dossier was used to wiretap Trump and his campaign at Trump tower? The same time they used that info to obtain a FISA warrant that was struck down, and then repurposed the FISA warrant with narrowing margins to get approval to tap into Trump campaign communications? Around the same time we find our about Susan Rice and others where unmasking Trump affiliates to try and get dirt?

       It's such a bizarre state of mind. It'll be studied in future generations for sure. Just complete denial of any wrong doing and anyone who gets upset with how bad of a job he's doing, they just deny it, talk about Obama, and then eventually try and spin it on you. It's fucking wild.

       Use your imagination. Trump literally owns hotels all over the world. Do you think he needs people to tell him anything OR that he prefers they do things they shouldn't in his hotels?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's limited vocab is deliberate (and A+ marketing). Average American reading age is pathetic. America is supposedly still a democracy so mass communication is valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
       He want's you to think he is a buffoon. That is literally his plan. Then his opponents get arrogant and lose. This has been a very effective strategy.

       Yes - Trump can't speak effectively or even in a way that seems some what thought out because the Average American won't understand him. Yup.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think that's even real (wow) than you have a lot more to think about if you're supporting someone who is playing everyone (yourself) for a fool. If he believes that the country is just stupid and should pander to them - then why is he in charge? You want someone who is going to play you for a fool? What.

       I literally took politifacts "pants on fire" and efficiently countered them with sources. Hoping to shine light to another person that the media skews what Trump is saying along with showing Trumps sales/persuasion techniques. I think it is you that does not want to be proven wrong.
