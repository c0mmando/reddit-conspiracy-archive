        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So i keep reading about this 2 shooter theory.  About how the echo doesnt match the gun fire and it sounds different.  And before I go into explaining this I want to say I am a firm beleiver that we are being lied to and some things do not make sense.  So hear me out please.  </p>

<p>First off, the echo will sound different in every video because of various factors.  First one being the device used to record.  Second one will be location of the recording.  The third one which IMO is the biggest factor, and that has been completely omitted so far, is the sound a bullet produces as it goes by you. </p>

<p>A bullet can travel anywhere from 370 m/s to 485 m/s depending on the caliber used and the weapon itself.  Sound itself travels slightly slower through the air, at around 340 m/s.  So what i am getting at here is that I think people beleive they hear a second shooter because of the sound of the bullets coming before the echo does.  </p>

<p>When an object breaks the speed of sound, it produces a cracking sound (sonic boom).  Depending on the distance at which the bullet passes you, it may also sound like a buzz (bee) which would mean the bullet just narrowly missed you(we are talking inches).</p>

<p>Now because the bullet travels faster than sound itself, a person that would have been at the concert (roughly 0.3 miles or ~500 meters from the shooter) would&#39;ve heard the cracking sound before the gun firing itself.  So there are 2 distinct sounds already.</p>

<p>Thirdly comes the echoe, which may be double or amplified by the structures around it, IE. Metal, glass and possibly water.  As sound travels and suffers attenuation from reverberating, bouncing off and/or travelling through a medium, the higher frequencies are lost and you are left with only the lower frequencies.  Meaning that the further away you are, the more muffled or &quot;low&quot; the noise will sound.  This can be heard on the videos and you can tell roughly if a person was far or close from the scene just by listening to the sound of the gun. </p>

<p>Now the echo factor, coupled with the sonic boom and the source of the sound itself, will definitly make it sound like there was 2 shooters.</p>

<p>These are the reasons why I beleive that there was only one shooter.</p>

<p>Source:  Analyzing sound is my job.  And although it is mainly axed towards underwater sound analysis, the concepts remain the same above water, only the speeds change.</p>

<p>P.S. 
Provided I do not get lynched, I will try to answer questions to the best of my knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This video proves my point more than anything else.  Thank you for posting it here.</p>

<p>When the first voley goes, you can gear the initial shots and the bullets cracking (high pitch sound between the shots).  Shortly after comes the muffled echo due to the sound having to travel through the air or boucing off another surface.  If you count the number of shots fired and the number of shots that echo, it is a perfect match with a count of 8 on each.  </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be fooled by a video like this one.  This is not an indepth analysis, it is simply a representation of the Decibel level that was recorded by the device.  An in depth analysis would require a frequency detecting recorder which would have had to be present at the scene.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Car really wasn&#39;t moving that far during <strong>this clip</strong>, hence why it&#39;s damn good evidence for multiple shooters in different locations. The gunshots in the question are the load bursts near her (with echoes), and the one off in the distance near the ~0.50s mark, then the loud bursts near here again (with echoes). Those are separate locations of gun fire, not any type of echo, being that would be nearly impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You would be surprised as to how far sound can travel if it reflects off of the right surfaces.  Glass for example (which there is a lot of over there) carries sound at 4540 m/s.  That&#39;s not a typo.  4540 m/s, effectively making it possible for the sound to be refleced off of glass from building to building.  Now the sound traveling further would sound different because as I explained, the higher frequencies are stripped due to distance travelled.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The audio analysis is clear as day, it&#39;s your cognitive dissonance that <em>is getting in the way.</em> Two distinct gun fire ~40 seconds a part. That is not an echo from the first bursts. You hear the echo from the first bursts, then ~40 seconds after, you hear distant gun fire, followed by the same burst and echo as the first. Seriously, you need to start using your ears. </p>

<p>What you&#39;re saying/implying does not fit actual reality based on the evidence we have. It&#39;s like you are covering your ears and closing your eyes to what is right in front of you...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again this isn&#39;t audio analysis.  It&#39;s a clip that shows how loud sound gets at certain points of the video.  I think confirmation bias is getting in your way.

    <div class="md"><p>Easy there budz.  I think we are being lied to about the motives of the shooter and if it was even him that did it in the first place.  I can tell this is getting you fired up, and I like that you&#39;re so passionate about this, but you have to come to terms with the fact that not everybody is going to agree with you.  Do not pretend to know what happened, because no one does.  I gave my professional opinion, you don&#39;t have to adhere to it, but the least you can do is respect it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, I was looking for that post from a few days ago.  I know there was a really good discussion on those waveforms.  Do you have a link to it?  </p>

<p>I was rewatching these two videos.  In the first one, you can hear single shots being fired at about 3:12, then you hear the machine fun being fired and another single shot.  This tells me there were two shooters.  </p>

<p>In this video, you can hear muffled machine gun fire at 2:00, then you hear very loud machine fun fire on top of the muffled machine gun fire.  This means that it is not an echo, and there were two machine guns being fired at the same time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the enemy could have overplayed their hand.  I think it is very important that we figure out what happened here.  If it is a false flag, then they are done for.  Besides, if they will do this to people at this concert, then they will do it to us and others.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There were two shooters or two weapons used. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muiHkkbPpdU">It begins around 3:00 in this video</a></p>

<p>There are a half a dozen shots where the bullet snap (bow shock from faster than speed of sound) can be heard.</p>

<p>However, there&#39;s no muzzle report. About a minute after this begins the auto-fire starts which you can hear muzzle report.</p>

<p>This means by logical deduction either a silencer was used for the first shots (different weapon), or the shots were taken from different locations (the first being out of range of muzzle report).</p>

<p>You can have muzzle report and no bullet snap (indirect fire), but bullet snap and no muzzle report tells you the gun is either very far away, or silenced. And if we hear muzzle report later, supposedly from the same gun, it presents a problem in the physics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. That video.  We need a waveform analysis of it, and this one, too.  </p>

<p>You can hear muffled machine gun fire at about 2:00. Then you hear much louder machine gun fire, but the muffled machine gun fire is still there. To me, that eliminates the echo theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s right: normalcy bias. From &quot;you are not so smart&quot;:</p>

<p>Normalcy bias is refusing to believe terrible events will include you even though you have every reason to think otherwise. The first thing you are likely to feel in the event of a disaster is the supreme need to feel safe and secure. When it becomes clear this is impossible, you drift into a daydream where it is. Survivors of 9/11 say they remember gathering belongings before leaving offices and cubicles. They put on coats and called loved ones. 
They shut down their computers and had conversations. Even in their descent, most moved at a leisurely pace—no screaming or running. There was no need for anyone to say “Remain calm everyone,” because they weren’t freaking out. They were begging the world to return to normal by engaging in acts of normalcy. To reduce the anxiety of impending doom, you first cling to what you know. You then mine others for information. You strike up dialogs with coworkers, friends, and family. You become glued to the television and the radio. You gather with others to trade what you know so far.</p>
