It just showed up at some point Monday and has been one of only two photos of him circulating. Just wondering if it&#39;s ever been made clear where it came from, he didn&#39;t have any social media as far as I&#39;m aware, was it from his girlfriends fb account? It&#39;s just such a random photo. All the media seemed to have this same picture pretty quickly upon his name being revealed, where did it come from and why does there seem to only be like one other photo of him?</p>

I mean, if he really is the mastermind and sole individual responsible I&#39;m fine with preserving his image as one that is not flattering, but I just think it&#39;s a weird choice to pick that one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there&#39;s more to it i&#39;m sure, i live here in mesquite, it&#39;s a retirement town, majority of housing estates are 55+ only. i imagine the general buzz in those communities and similar around the country is mix of fear, anger, confusion, paranoia pretty much the exact emotions they want us in.

Probably not the case, but it’s all that makes sense in my head. I’m an Apple dev and can tell you that the whole facial recognition shit goes very very deep and very very intricate.</p>
