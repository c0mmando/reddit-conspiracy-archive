       You fucking right he's questioning it.

       That timeline basically fist fucks the Mandalay Bay and places negligence on them for not providing proper security to contain this before it escalated into what it did.

       Yea watching it myself, MGM spokespersons quote is “We cannot be certain about the most recent timeline that has been communicated publicly, and we believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurate”
      </p>
      <p>
       So at what point does the security guard himself go on camera and give an interview?

       Why couldn't paddock be the one that stopped something big?  Maybe paddock was FBI and was part of something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock was the one shot for 6min and then silence as the security guard panicked and tried to figure out what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now, why was "security guard" there and why is he being "vouched" for as a security guard by the FBI?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because IF the FBI admit he is not security -?! What are the implications? Paddock was running guns on their payroll?

       Why can't paddock be a mental unstable lunatic who killed people all on his own? I get the high you guys get from trying to "discover the truth" but when it's more important to be entertained or chase that aderaline high you do a great disservice to the real truth.

       You put together a believable story as to how paddock pulled this off in vegas and I'm seriously willing to entertain it. It's not that we get off on painting evil and treachery into these things, it's that we get pleasure from inconvenient truths.

       There's always people like you on these threads talking about made up truths yet there are new facts that contradict what the FBI has told the public constantly. Their own story is changing every single day and it's making less and less sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the theories here are far fetched, but if you're so set on believing what the government is telling you then go to another sub. There's a really cool thread on AskReddit right now you might enjoy.

       While I was working tonight ALL I kept hearing was "trump this trump that IQ this IQ that" OMG shut up already!!!!!! I like trump, and the media is TRYING AO HARD to make everyone hate him it's honestly pathetic at this point. I'm starting to hate him because he's all I hear about and it's getting so annoying.

       The obsession the media and almost every person against trump is so annoying to deal with. My sister literally has CNN on all day at her house, a trumptalk podcast for when she drives, and is constantly talking about the disagreement she has with trump. I don't like the man either but damn the obsession has to be real. If you don't like him why listen to people talk about him every fucking day? This has nothing to do with paddock but your comment spoke to me haha

       I merely have had it on in the background the last few days to try catch any breaking news about the shooter, it's the first time ive had CNN for extended periods and it's eye opening for sure.

       I hate CNN because all they would cover was trump. Have they been covering this incident or is it rare? Thanks to this, I got my reality check. It's insane now, I don't feel safe anywhere, but not paranoid about it. 
I never made fun of conspiracy theorist or thought they were crazy but this one has to be an eye opener for the world if 9/11 wasn't.

       I think people can't work it out, how someone who was presented as so awful ended up being voted for by a lot of voters. It's the echo chamber/bubble created by the media and social media, where people just have no idea what 'the other side' thinks or why and to get over that confusion they keep having reinforce their own opinion again and again so that the belief that 'the other side' is just insane and/or ridiculously stupid makes more sense, and that their own belief is the rational sane one, as supported by all this incessant trumphate.

       I don't understand it. I didn't vote for Obama. I didn't like his policies for the most part. But i had no animosity towards him. He was the president and that was that. He made some funny videos and seemed like a personable guy. Probably why he had such a high appeal. I don't agree with some of Trumps policies but I do agree with others. He's the president for the next 3 years. People hate him whether he does something silly or does something good. Everyone is pushing this agenda anyway they can to divide the people for or against him. It blows my mind. If people spent half as much energy trying to make a difference in their own communities collectively as they do berating and condemning Trump the country would be a much better place.

       Edward Bernays figured out how to engineer a democracy with a free press some 90 years ago.  He was American, and the science of propaganda he founded has been the best in the world ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have experienced uniparty rule for several decades as a result.  Trump is the first outsider since maybe JFK, maybe longer.  He's not even an outsider, he's just not the chosen candidate.  Imagine if he actually were an outsider.
      </p>
      <p>
       The American press has always been this biased.  The difference is that now you have alternate sources of information so you can see the contrast and thus see the magnitude of the lies.  There are multiple reasons for this.  One is the Internet.  Another is that Edward Bernays' techniques are finally -- after continuous use for almost a century -- being utilized by people other than the American Fascist Party (what most would call the MIC and its satellites).

       It's because he's a political outsider with a relatively dirt-free past, so he can't be blackmailed to any real degree.  He also knows everyone's secrets, being a NY power player and international celebrity for decades.  Basically the entire media had colluded with the Democrats (DNC Leaks, Wikileaks, etc. prove this) and they've been trying to find a way to get him out since election day.

       That agent is seriously creepy and yes I do fully expect Sheriff Lombardo to start just yelling out the truth and for the creepy agent to suddenly morph his arm into a large tentacle, pluck Lombardo off the ground and then swallow him whole, to gasps from the onlooking journalists.
