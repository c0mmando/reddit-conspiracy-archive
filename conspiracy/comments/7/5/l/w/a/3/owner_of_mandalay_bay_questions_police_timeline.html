<p>Paddock was the one shot for 6min and then silence as the security guard panicked and tried to figure out what to do. </p>

<p>So now, why was &quot;security guard&quot; there and why is he being &quot;vouched&quot; for as a security guard by the FBI? </p>

<p>Because IF the FBI admit he is not security -?! What are the implications? Paddock was running guns on their payroll? </p>

My sister literally has CNN on all day at her house, a trumptalk podcast for when she drives, and is constantly talking about the disagreement she has with trump.

It&#39;s the echo chamber/bubble created by the media and social media, where people just have no idea what &#39;the other side&#39; thinks or why and to get over that confusion they keep having reinforce their own opinion again and again so that the belief that &#39;the other side&#39; is just insane and/or ridiculously stupid makes more sense, and that their own belief is the rational sane one, as supported by all this incessant trumphate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand it. I didn&#39;t vote for Obama. I didn&#39;t like his policies for the most part. But i had no animosity towards him. He was the president and that was that. He made some funny videos and seemed like a personable guy. Probably why he had such a high appeal. I don&#39;t agree with some of Trumps policies but I do agree with others. He&#39;s the president for the next 3 years. People hate him whether he does something silly or does something good. Everyone is pushing this agenda anyway they can to divide the people for or against him. It blows my mind. If people spent half as much energy trying to make a difference in their own communities collectively as they do berating and condemning Trump the country would be a much better place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Edward Bernays figured out how to engineer a democracy with a free press some 90 years ago.  He was American, and the science of propaganda he founded has been the best in the world ever since.</p>

<p>We have experienced uniparty rule for several decades as a result.  Trump is the first outsider since maybe JFK, maybe longer.  He&#39;s not even an outsider, he&#39;s just not the chosen candidate.  Imagine if he actually were an outsider.</p>

<p>The American press has always been this biased.  The difference is that now you have alternate sources of information so you can see the contrast and thus see the magnitude of the lies.  There are multiple reasons for this.  One is the Internet.  Another is that Edward Bernays&#39; techniques are finally -- after continuous use for almost a century -- being utilized by people other than the American Fascist Party (what most would call the MIC and its satellites).</p>
