       Find a slow draining drainage ditch long enough. Minimum 5 miles. Or a lake with an island or a point that can be used for the center point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not hard to find. I have an 8 mile drainage ditch within an hours drive of my home town. And a huge lake that would also suffice not that much farther.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get a high powered laser:

      </p>
      <p>
       Not hard to find. 50 mile range for 135 USD. 70 mile range for 150 USD. 100 mile range for 195 USD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Set up the laser on a solid tripod on one end of the ditch and point it at the target at the other end of the ditch. Find it's exact elevation in relation to the water level in the ditch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Set up a large white target. Maybe a sheet of 4X8' plywood painted white. With an X marked at the exact same level relative to the water in the ditch as the laser.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make sure the laser light hits the target at the exact same elevation as the laser. Measure the elevation in relation to the surface of the water. Intercept the laser light beam at the exact center point between the laser and the target. Measure it's elevation against the level of the water. The beam should be feet lower than the elevation of the laser and the target.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you set up a middle marker measured to the exact same elevation as the laser, the marker should be a few feet above the laser beam.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it doesn't meet the mathematical expectations, there may be something wrong with the spherical Earth model as it currently stands.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can easily measure reasonable elevations with a simple laser and an accurate measuring stick"

       This is a very rough mock up showing that the laser will be well away from the waters surface. The refraction issue will be taken out of the equation.

       yes.  also the bedford thing has never really been accurately done.  consider that it took 50+ years before a refutation of the work could be made - and this came in the form of the refraction argument.  so to test this, one would need to make air density measurements along the length of the run to validate this "scientific explanation".  nobody's done that.
      </p>
      <p>
       we've not yet seen an experiment that demonstrates curvature using the refraction /bedford level experiment design.  it's all "take my word for it".

       The equipment can be put well above the level of the water. Where refraction would be minimal. On the sides of the ditch. Not above the water.

       I... I just gave you 4 sourced reviewed papers about how refraction works. What are you talking about?
      </p>
      <p>
       So you acknowledge refraction exists but you dont think it affects light?

       There is a disconnect between what you are saying and what you are trying to say.

       there's no disconnect only you avoiding the argument.  there are localized changes in air density.  if you have an experiment using refraction over a long distance you'll have to account for those.  that means you'll have to measure them.  that's not been done in a bedford type experiment as proof of curvature.  find one and prove me wrong.

       So you accept that refraction exists, so how do you not understand how it works?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats where Im having the issue following you..
      </p>
      <p>
       So we know air density can affect how light travels, right? We agree here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if the earth is a globe then the air would follow this curve, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So if the air is curved over the surface and the density patterns are just right (many of these laser experiments are not reproducible over the course of the day, they only work at very specific times or atmospheric conditions) then the light would follow the curve of that refractive index, right?

       you're absurd.   here's a thought experiment for you.  you hang a cord for 5 miles from 2 poles.  you want to validate that the cord hangs in a catenary curve.  you can pick a couple of data points and say hey yes it fits the catenary.  or you could pick more than a few data points and know with more validation.
      </p>
      <p>
       now let's move to refraction over a distance and apply the same approach.  the only difference is that refraction will have a cumulative effect on how the light travels.  since you're dealing with a long distance, you're most likely dealing with a setup that's outdoors.  that means the environment is different.  that means there are local changes in temperature along the route where your test runs.  and those local changes affect, like a narrative, the next portion of the run.  so you have to measure that.  step by step.  that's how you'd validate it.  if you don't do those local measurements you'll have no guarantee that that you've accounted for local variations in air density and thus refractive index.  period.
      </p>
      <p>
       no experiments have done this.
      </p>
      <p>
       ergo no experiments with this design have validated refraction as the cause of whatever the observed results are.  in fact, you could never validate this model without it.  you could provide other predictors and models, sure.  but we're talking about refraction here.  and refraction isn't going away.  if you had a hot spot somewhere in the line of sight of the experiment you'd have a skewed result.  period.  there's nothing to argue.  that's just the reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       now go ahead and find an experiment that has done this.
      </p>
      <p>
       prove to me that local atmospheric conditions have been accounted for in an outdoors experiment ala bedford.  go for it.  i dare you.

       that i had to explain this to you and you had a mental block in understanding this can be explained by 2 answers.  1.  you have a cognition issue.  2.  you're intentionally being ignorant.

       nobody's arguing that refraction is a phenomena.  are you still misrepresenting my argument?  i'm relying on it existing as a phenomena.  the theory uses it to explain how you can see past what curvature alone would predict.  that's the whole point.
      </p>
      <p>
       you're arguing a theory to explain a theory.  i'm arguing an experiment to validate a theory.  your approach is a circle jerk.  my approach is empirical.  which is kinda the point of doing experiment.

       You've seriously and badly conflated the concept of refraction to suit your argument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Localized temperature differentials, especially prevalent over cooler water and/or hot pavement on a sunny day, can cause refraction. That just means that light might be redirected in some way from it's direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't mean that light will be caused to travel along and follow the curvature of the earth. That is ridiculous.

       Exactly. "during certain times under certain conditions". I don't care about the exceptions. The experiment is designed to minimize those.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most times, under most conditions, when the line of sight is well away from the surface of water or a hot pavement, it isn't such a big concern and does not negate your ability to make a measurement.
      </p>
      <p>
       And refraction does not equate to causing light to follow the curvature of the Earth. That is 100% grade A bullshit.

       This is an attempt at illustrating the cross section of a drainage ditch. The "w" shows where the water is outside of flood season. the "o" shows where the equipment will go. That is the laser, the markers and the end target.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will not be close to the waters surface. It will be well above. Something like 15 or 20 or more feet. And it can be raised even further using platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
       The water is used as a reference only, to measure from, using a theodolite and a measuring rod.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only refraction issues would be from air refraction from temperature differentials in the air above the roadway where the instruments are. But that should be minimal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole purpose of this design is to get away from the waters surface and the resulting refraction. And rather than rely on the eye or optics to see long distances, the laser light will give a solid reference point to examine the entire length of the ditch.
      </p>
      <p>
       The variance in the curvature of the Earth will be easily measured with a relatively small error factor, even including any refraction.

       3 miles is the length of the ditch, or whatever it is. If they were in England they could do it at Bedford, where the Bedford level experiment took place on 6 miles of still water. Anything more than a few miles and the laser beam starts to really spread out, making it more difficult, so shorter distances should actually be better.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter the length, they should be able to see a result of whether the water curves or not, even if a tiny, measurable amount.
