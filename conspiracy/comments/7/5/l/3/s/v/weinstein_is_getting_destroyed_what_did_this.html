       Normally when an elite like Weinstein gets in trouble it is swept, see what happened previously with the nyt or pizzag. But when someone is getting destroyed, they'll spend money on air time to constantly repeat the negative stories.

       I am sure they are all true, but he was a protected class level person until now. Did he upset the wrong people, or not want to play ball?

       They are separating themselves. They don't want to go down with the ship. Its damn interesting to me how CNN has turned on Obama and Clintons because of this, like CNN is celebrating from them too because they know some major shit is about to go down.

       Based on what he's done so far just in his life before the campaign, I would argue he is the greatest ever lol. I didn't even vote for him, I voted Gary. But he is still the greatest simply by his "fuck you" attitude.

       I'm curious about this perspective. I'd like a president who offers constructive solutions and tries to bring people together. Trump seems to pick fights when it's not necessary.

       Government did such a good job jailing all those corrupt bankers after the crash in '08.  All those stimulus packages really helped out the common man too.  They really are holding those corporations to account when it comes to net neutrality.  Obama sure did get Goldman Sachs out of the cabinet and the administration.  Quantitative Easing versions one through five really did a lot for working folks.

       I totally agree that they kind of work together and the average Joe's best interest is the last thing on their minds, but at the same time the corps are tempered by the govt in that they have to give them ultimate authority. If the federal govt weren't around the corps would take it upon themselves to do whatever they wanted to increase profits

       Interesting. I am definitely in favor of the presidency being not such a big hoopla. Two years to elect someone to a four year term, and then they're the lead story almost every day. To me it seems like a waste of mental real estate; we should be more focused on our own lives.

       So what kind of system are you and Joe proposing? Is there still an executive leader, but with a reduced role?

       I'm not a big Trump fan but I respect that he "calls it like he sees it". The media, the deep state and the rest of the establishment in Washington has been against him 1000% since day one. This to me was very telling that there was a major reason they did NOT want him to win. In my 30+ years I've never seen so much push back against a candidate in our country.

       We haven't had an honest exchange of ideas for a long time in Washington. The left and the right are one in the same and have been for a long time. If it all comes tumbling down we may be able to begin having honest debates again but until then I don't see an end in sight unfortunately.

       I don't mean in Washington, I mean between you and me. If I were to cite an example of why he worries me--say the recent repeal of the Clean Power Plan--would you be open to that or would it further cement your support of Trump? Just wondering how regular citizens can break through this impasse, as I believe functioning democracy starts with people actually talking to each other.

       You are right though there are those out there that no matter what he does as president they will either stick up for him or chastise him good or bad. I believe a lot of it is based off of CIA propaganda and programming. They want the us vs. Them mentality as when it's time for the cards to fall they want to be able to maintain the control and power structure they've built over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
       This could be pizzagate, Trump/Russia, ET disclosure, DNC/ Muslim brotherhood etc. But whatever comes next the propaganda has pushed many to the far extremes of the us vs. Them side and that is what the deep state/powers that be want.

       I'm intrigued by your worldview. I don't see things through the same framework of elite powers controlling things. For example what you say could be CIA propaganda and programming, I see as the consequences of human tribalism plus profit motive in the news. In short the current mess we find ourselves in is partially everyone's fault, because we support divisive messages with our attention and dollars. While there are powerful individuals and entities with an interest in keeping people divided--news media and politicians--I don't see it as as the grand design of an elite class. Rather just the natural outcome of capitalism, I guess. No one's really in charge, and the world is what you make of it. But I could be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm honestly curious, how do you get through the day seeing things this way? If I genuinely believed I was powerless to change things, I would be very paranoid and depressed.

       Well I don't watch the news or TV. Look up operation mockingbird it's quite telling the type of things our government has done to our own people. There have been numerous psyop campaigns perpetrated across the globe by those that are meant to lead/protect us. I spent many years in the military and saw first hand the corruption of our leaders. This doesn't depress me as I don't focus on the macro and just worry about my day to day life, my job, my family etc.

       I enjoy reading this sub and I notice this sentiment comes up a bunch. If you go through the history of the comments, it's always the calm before the storm, something big is always about to drop, the dominoes are always about to fall. I could probably find a few more examples on the front page now. Anyways I bring this up because I think it should spark some self-examination about a worldview that always anticipates something that never happens. I could be wrong, just seems like a pattern.

       I believe in this case he's referencing the exact words of Trump. It does get said a lot here, but this time is literally a different thing altogether—it's not us predicting anything, rather, waiting to see what

       This all seems like they're going to reveal soon Trump was like the bestest buddies ever with Weinstein, and they're gonna have these "celebrities" come one by one talking about it and then reveal a huge "scoop/rumor" that Blumpfth was the head of the gang. We've had 3 more celebrities (all extremely anti-Trump) speak about the abuse like Rob Schneider just an hour or two ago.

       What if this is all a play by Chinese media companies hoping to destabilize Hollywood in order to snatch up even more controlling interest in our movie production crews?  China has been making huge pushes, buying up stock in our movie industry.  Perhaps this is a concerted effort to drive prices down further so they can complete their takeover?

They are going full on monitoring and eavesdropping.  There was mention of all the Chinese companies taking bigger stakes in American companies and pushing their control.

       Does it not seem convenient that a well known "secret" to Hollywood insiders has now become public and just keeps growing which is helping distract sheeples and also drain the "limited" time on the nooz. Seeing as there are much bigger questions the mass media should be asking like I don't know the whole Las Vegas thing. The guy will disappear to his private island and then emerge a bit later to announce he was in therapy and how he is cured, write a book and start over.

       It's as simple as this: They can't control everything. Once something goes viral, it is more to their advantage to distance themselves and throw the perpetrator under the bus than to convince 300 million Americans that their ears are deceiving them.

       It's long been known that there's a HUGE pedophile racket happening amongst many/most of the so called 'elite' who practice all sorts of weird 'Luciferian black magic' that involves child abuse/sacrifice ....

       it has also been said that "the cabal" aka TPTB are 'under attack' and that many of them will be exposed as being pedophiles and having been involved in all sorts of Bad Shit

      <p>
       maybe this is part of the start of this exposure? (which will hopefully lead to some mitigation of these horrific practices)

       The holly tree is sacred in witchcraft and druidic rituals.

       In the Harry Potter franchise, wood from the holly is used to make magic wands.

       Stories and rumours about the notorious Hollywood "casting couch" have been around for almost as long as Hollywood itself and there have always been people who will do or put up with anything to get their big break and a shot at being a so-called "movie star". And of course we have all the true stories about how there are more actors and actresses that have been married and divorced any number of times over their sexual escapades and infidelities than haven't.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what's different now as opposed to the past? I think the times and the technology are slowly and steadily passing Hollywood by and it's not just the movie studios but the TV ones as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's far less expensive to get into the game and there are more genuine filmmakers and actors working co-operatively and sharing the proceeds of their efforts to make good films and being successful at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The big studios and the inordinate power their executives once wielded are being challenged on all sides and they were bound to eventually be challenged on this side of it, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weinstein is a start, if he can be taken down, you can be sure that there are going to be others that are going to get called out and exposed for their abuses as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's gotten to the point where the times we live in have become so utterly corrupt that it simply can't be hidden or ignored any more.

       Probably hit on the wrong person for once. So it was time to pull the switch. Remember Strauss-Kahn? another one who was known for years for the same type of behavior?

       Anyways, my conspiracy theory is that it's all in the name Harvey. You know, first the Hurricane, then the Weinstein. Originally it was a six foot invisible bunny though. See, what  no one realizes is that the matrix needed to have a little "fun". Spice up the game.

       This too I want to know. It is pretty common for them to all be in a power struggle, gathering dirt on each other even tho they all are doing the same thing. Way I see it, one of two things:

      <p>
       1) He was bad at covering his tracks, bad enough to where even the lay people were convinced
      </p>
      <p>
       or 2) more likely that he pissed off someone higher up the chain than him. Either as OP said, he didn't play ball, or he botched a power play.

       <p>
        That’s why the story about Harvey Weinstein finally broke now. It’s because the media industry that once protected him has collapsed. The magazines that used to publish the stories Miramax optioned can’t afford to pay for the kind of reporting and storytelling that translates into screenplays. They’re broke because Facebook and Google have swallowed all the digital advertising money that was supposed to save the press as print advertising continued to tank.

       Based on what he's done so far just in his life before the campaign, I would argue he is the greatest ever lol. I didn't even vote for him, I voted Gary. But he is still the greatest simply by his "fuck you" attitude.

       It will get bigger and start snowballing to saturate the news. To be clear I am in now way defending the guy just thinking it's a conveniant time for the noise considering there is soo much happening which the media should be reporting but will get shelved.

       This all seems like they're going to reveal soon Trump was like the bestest buddies ever with Weinstein, and they're gonna have these "celebrities" come one by one talking about it and then reveal a huge "scoop/rumor" that Blumpfth was the head of the gang. We've had 3 more celebrities (all extremely anti-Trump) speak about the abuse like Rob Schneider just an hour or two ago.

       Just the new angle to probably attack him for not being part of their gang and not going thru the initiation ritual.

       I'd like to not have any president at all. We dont need one. I'm on joe  Rogans side. Trump just makes that argument easier to make.

       The holly tree is sacred in witchcraft and druidic rituals.

       In the Harry Potter franchise, wood from the holly is used to make magic wands.

       I also read somewhere that the holly tree is associated with sun worship.

       You're fucking delusional guys. It's been barely one year what the hell did the guy even do other than stack a cabinet full of Goldman Sachs excecs, do a billion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia? He hasn't called bs on any false flags or anything the guy is just another puppet. Wake the fuck up...

       I'm not a big Trump fan but I respect that he "calls it like he sees it". The media, the deep state and the rest of the establishment in Washington has been against him 1000% since day one. This to me was very telling that there was a major reason they did NOT want him to win. In my 30+ years I've never seen so much push back against a candidate in our country.
