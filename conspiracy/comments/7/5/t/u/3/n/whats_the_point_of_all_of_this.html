    <div class="md"><p>It won&#39;t be covered, and if it is, it won&#39;t be covered fairly.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been to such rallies... People stretching from the Capitol Buliding to the Memorial. More people in one spot than I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.</p>

<p>All that was shown were a few unrelated people hanging around hours after the event wrapped up. Funny thing however... The CNN van was there, parked at the steps to the Capitol building, the entire time. Coverage (lack of) was intentional.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying though we need to think outside the box. </p>

<p>Going to the capitol building isn&#39;t going to do much. We need to let these people know we know where they live. We need to go to Washington and <em>stay</em> in Washington.</p>

<p>Peaceful Peasant revolution </p>

<p>There&#39;s the name right there. We&#39;ll keep a lid on the violence; just cling to our numbers and moral high ground. </p>

<p><em>Fuck</em> CNN</p>

<p>It won&#39;t matter that they aren&#39;t reporting when Mitch McConnel can&#39;t get out of his driveway to go to work, much less meet any other child molesters.</p>

<p>We need to BESEIGE the NYPD, LAPD and FBI buildings and demand the information they have be made public.</p>

<p>YES! This will cause chaos.</p>

<p>YES! This will shatter our infrastructure.</p>

<p>HELL YEAH! More people will die. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for optimism but as far as <em>here</em> goes, will never be successful. A new platform with new controlled opposition is the starting price. Traction would need to be manufactured for a year, at least (think Twitter).</p>
