       This sub seems wholly obsessed with shitting on Democrats and Clinton (which has it's place) even though Trump and Republicans have literally sold out to every big money interest in washington: wall st, big oil/coal, private prisons, nra, pharmaceutical companies, telecoms, military industry, etc. Those used to be the conspiracies we talked about here.
       <strong>
        Follow the money
       </strong>
       . Question those in power. I am not saying Democrats arent bad as well but when was the last time you saw a post here about the corruption of the RNC, the numerous sex scandals on the right or data literally being scrubbed from EPA websites. All I wish is that the Republican party which runs all three branches of government got the same amount of scrutiny as Democrats get here. Also if you really thing both parties are equal I suggest comparing this subs values with congressional voting records:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6pc5qu/democrats_propose_rules_to_break_up_broadband/dkon8t4/">
        https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6pc5qu/democrats_propose_rules_to_break_up_broadband/dkon8t4/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy time... Republicans have conned millions of Americas by using Trump to fuel cultural divide and outrage to distract from a massive consolidation of wealth and power for the elite.  Unfortunately most people in this sub have decided that it's more important to contradict the narrative in the media than those with power. I want to say that one more time. This sub has decided that it's more important to contradict the narrative in the media than those with power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get it. I hate the media too but occasionally you find yourself on the same side as people you dont like. Honestly sometimes this sub feels like a parody of itself they way it spouts government talking points like it's their job. I would never call people here russian shills even though criticizing this administration will gets me instantly labelled a shareblue shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly this sub claims to be so woke about identity politics being used to divide and distracted yet no one ever mentions that Trump intentionally fuels these divides while hes supposed to be uniting and leading our country. This administration has no interest in your privacy, has no interest in getting money out of politics, has no interest prosecuting the criminal elite, has no interest in reforming the justice system, has no interest in transparency, has no interest isolationist foreign policy. It's time to wake up, the Republican party and this administration are the enemy. Stop giving them a free pass.

       I honestly can't answer that question. Partisanship is so far off my radar at this point that I really pay no mind to it.  Until we can all distinguish that parties are yet another divisive tactic we are doomed to fall into the same gaps. End game is the same regardless of what they claim to be. Basically I feel like if your still looking at pol parties as teams, your doing so by design. They even have fun mascots!

       I'm glad youre so enlightened but my point is that the rest of this sub clearly is not. This sub clearly only plays attention to Democratic wrong doing while the corruption of the Republican party is almost universally ignored. How obsessed is this sub with the Weinstein scandal? How much attention did this sub pay to O'Rilley, Rodger Ailes, Dennis Hastert? How obsessed with the false flag narrative are they with the Vegas shooter when there is no  real political motive. That never seems to happen when the shooter is brown or Muslim even though that's exactly the kind of false flag a government like this would want.

       Not really, back then this sub was filled with exactly how many people HRC has personally murdered, how many children she trafficked for pedos, how she literally should face life in prison (or possibly death) for these crimes. there wasn't much room for anything else.

       The only people talking about George Bush are conspiracy theorist and the type who watch 
the news and accept his new innocent painter image.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the people who are glorifying old Republicans like Bush, Cheney, and Rice on the news with stories against Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not even a conspiracy theorist would accept that nonsense. So who is really trying to give Republicans a pass?

       Yea totally on the up and up with republicans. I especially like how they let us know they're shitting on us while they're shitting on us. That's why we don't need to talk about them and when they get caught in lies or the fact their own party is worried about them starting ww3. Not important. /s

       Well, I think the majority of people who voted for Trump were voting against Clinton of course, but were also voting against the GOP, the establishment GOP didn't want Trump in office any more than the DNC. Given limited options, they opted to give the finger to both.
      </p>
      <p>
       How that pans out we'll see, but I think a lot of Trump voters were behind him as a person, not the GOP at large. This was a sole populist victory for trump, and a vote against the power structure. The DNC and the GOP are two sides of the same coin. Voters saw a situation where a Clinton might run against a Bush again and were horrified. They went with the dark horse candidate.

       Yes but now it's plenty clear Trump isn't a dark horse. He seems actually like exactly what the elite want. He's might as well be Bush except little less religious but a little more racist.  A figure head that can convince the people hes on their side while blatantly selling out to right in front of their faces.

       Trump is more indulgent with the religious right,  he has proposed allowing chruchs to donate to

       Trump is far worse then any president of the last 50 years. He's driving us to nuclear war, destabilizing the world while allowing Russia and China fill the void of our leadership. The establishment sucks big time but trump is far    worse.

       It is ludicrous to me that people think one political party is more guilty of
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       kind of abuse than another.

       If more Democrats than Republicans were pedophiles, we'd have more convictions. And more arrests. And more allegations...allegations made by the victims, or by witnesses.

       This train of thought is so stupid it makes my head hurt. This exact line of thinking is why tons of users in the sub voted trump, and still, they can't imagine why pizzagate could possibly be a conspiracy driven by Russia. What happened to pizzagate? What happened to Seth Rich? These things drove people to be political foot soldiers and then the narratives just grind to a total halt.

       Bannon(and maybe Russia, I honestly have no idea) co-opted the conspiracy-niche of voters and hitched them to Trump's wagon, they done this by highlighting the real grievances and shady doings of the dems/Clinton's while either sweeping the other side's under the rug, or calling it neo-can and grouping it in with Clinton under Globalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       This successfully put Trump above and apart from the perceived "man", even though he's anything but. It was a brilliant strategy honestly, I don't like Bannon but I respect his gameplay.

       Yeah US foreign policy has been complicated and a unmitigated disaster recently. Clinton had no choice but to defend it. When Trump talked about past policy he talked with the ability of hind sight which is obviously that we should have been more isolationist. Whenever Trump talked about the future it was in terms of surprise attacks with boots on the ground and bombing innocent civilians. People had selective hearing. It was fun to think Trump was fighting globalist super villains while also indulging in american military fantasies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I dont think they have a choice. They had to pump the DEEP-STATE angle when the Russia angle heated up. Remember before they were all about the FBI and intelligence committees when it was Hillary being investigated. Now no one has credibility but Trump.

       Not so much republicans. Just Trump, and not from everyone on this sub but he gets a total free pass from far too many.

       As a UK outsider I loath Trump's racism and divisive language. He has a responsibility to ensure their is peace among all sections of society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I right in thinking that he has relaxed guns laws, especially in regards to people with mental health issues? Is this true? Because if so, that's bloody mad.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I do think he has a certain appeal in terms that he is very funny to watch and could do some pretty wonderful things. He more than anyone has an opportunity to open the lid on what really goes on behind closed doors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comments like the Israeli leadership are a real hindrance to peace in the middle east is refreshing. I also would like him to open the door on big time theories like aliens and extreme business interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think his foreign policy is quite good in regards to N.Korea. It is almost like he is speaking their language and using it to tell them to back down. Who knows if this could open a more positive dialogue further down the line. Kim Jong Il just wants to stay in power and wouldn't risk a military strike on any terms. Its all noise.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he doesn't open the lid and continues to propergate racism. He shouldn't get another term.

       the negative things you said about trump are well established and don't need to be picked apart. The positive things you said about trump were that his North Korea "policy" of shit talking them on twitter is helpful. It really isn't, it has both aggravated tensions between the two countries and made the US seem weaker. It puts the US on the level of North Korea, making petty threats they will not go through with. You may be an outsider to US policy and politics, so you may not realize that this is very damaging to the US foreign policy objectives.

       Fine, here:

      <p>
       If “not engaging in a war” is what you think the bar for success is then you definitely don’t have a full understanding of US objectives in foreign policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not being manipulated when I can see for myself what you apparently can not - that it is detrimental to the US foreign policy objectives when the POTUS engages in a Twitter war with an easily agitated leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you’re an outsider to the US politics, but over here we take the presidents level of discourse seriously. When the president does this nonsense it is considered beneath the dignity of the office of the presidency, which is one of the reasons why a lot of people (not just the media) hate these constant twitter battle distractions.

       N.Korea only wants to propergate war as it keeps Kim Jong Il in power. If he has a war, he will lose and therefore lose his power.

       Again I’m trying to have a conversation and you are being aggressive with name calling and saying my head is in my ass. I’m not watching that video ha I’m at work making a living. Listen until you can provide proof that “dead people voted for Hillary” don’t even bother replying bc I’m not interested in arguing. Dont send me a link about “maybe this happened” or “dead people are registered” I’m not interested in maybes and mights. Thanks!

       Shown up? The kid was charged with voter fraud for 18 dead people? I was right you idiots. Man you neckbeards must be really fucking stupid. They said it as a disclaimer because they don't know if the votes got through and effected the election's. Why else would they say it? But as usual the good neckbeards of reddit defend the criminals. Your so progressive...... back to anime porn for you.

       I can't believe you guys can't get past that. They put that there so they are not on the record saying they think voter fraud occured. So people like you don't call them and start bitching that they are "conspiracy theroist." It doesn't mean the kid wasn't charged trying to use dead people as votes for a friend of the democratic party for a quota. Your totally missing the fact the kod was CONVICTED of doing it. I made sure to blow the word up so you would read and I will do it one more time. CONVICTED!!!! MEANS FOUND GUILTY OF A CRIME. Please stop being so dumb and just don't answer.

       What actual undercover journalism instead of getting paid to read governemnt news provided by the CIA every morning? Have fun being a useful bitch to these people. And I posted CNN one in there just for your sorry ass. Funny how you mention that one out of every video I posted.  Back to anime porn neck beard.

       If you had any fucking honesty you'd do some research into O'Keefe before you started using him as a legitimate source. But you won't because you're a fucking shill. Now go back to fucking your Trump fleshlight you god damn child.

       I saw the video, and it was interresting, but gave me more questions than answers honestly. If you know the answers to any of these please answer. 
It is required to have ID to vote, why did she get through this. 
We didnt actually see her vote, did she?
Do you have proof of people ACTUALLY tampering with votes, and not just showing it is possible.

       Not in some states. That wasn't the full interview. The commissioner says on camera he is told to stand down on voter ID laws by the Governor. So that alone should be proof enough for you, but yeah there is plenty. Some guy voted as Eminem. Why thee insults? Because the people's ignorance on this thread is cancerous.

       As i said, can you give me proof? I am not trying to be condescending, but i want proof so i can form an educated opinion. 
No offence, but i dont take your word for it, although the video was interresting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throwing insults is just as ignorant. 
And your argument that they are ignorant is based on the facts you gave them with the article which directly contradicted what you are saying. 
You prove yourself wrong, and then get mad that they read the article. That is counterproductive to be honest, and creates conflict where there doesnt need to be one

       Trump said there was voter fraud, which has been debunked numerous times. 
For someone who is running his mouth on fake news he sure does like to spread them. Thats his trick. He tricks gullible idiots to believe his lies. 
Congratulations, you are perpetuating the stereotype of how gullibld Trump voters can be.

       Like I said they were attacking him for thinking about running for President. He wasn't even president yet. Just out of no where Hitler was reincarnated because Trump announced he was running for president. So I am assuming you think Trump is also Hitler if you source them. So what are some Hitler like things Trump has done go ahead do explain. Did he hurt your footbal players feelings is that why he is now Hitler?

       Yes.. weee are the zombie-fied horde but you are the one who blindly follow the exact words of the «god emperor», and REFUSE to even look at evidence that contradicts him.

       That literally has nothing do with anything, as i have said. I am not an American, so you dissing your own presidents is inadvertently dissing yourself.

       Why does that have nothing to do with anything? Because a corrupt old haggard bitch that also ran for president sold weapons of mass destruction to the very people she accuses Trump is colluding with? You people are pitiful what are you even doing on this sub? I see now why the no shill rule exsists because this sub is full of them ans only loosing subscribers.

       You are implying because i dont like Trump i am a Hillary supporter. 
You have a toxic mindset of an «us vs them» and «party before logic» attitude which you definately prove when you say you actually HOPE someones kids get sexually abused. Why? Because i dont agree with you politically?
That will show me to take your party seriously, wouldnt it?

       If you are not even from here then why are you trying to discuss this with me? That is the probelm with the whole world today they look at Americans outcomes because "it effects them." How about all those things you are being "effected" by, how about you fix it instead of worrying about America's help for it? How about you worry about your own elections to pull you away from America instead of getting closer with it? Oh that is right because we have been exploited for years and all are tax dollars go to protecting people like you. Where are you from?

«You’re not from america so your opinion doesnt matter»
Except i view america from the outside, and i can see EXACTLY how messed up it has become. America has become the laughing stock of the world. 0.2% of my country supports him, we are laughing at his mistakes and our reporters make fun of him. He is ruining americans reputation, and you can say «no he isnt» but you would be wrong.
I am from the richest country per citizen. 
We have the best Prison system in the world (which is an undeniable fact) and free healthcare. Where do you think i am from?

       What exactly is your video «evidence» good for?
Showing me canadian healthcare which is inferior to the one i have is not evidence of any kind. 
I pay lower taxes than you do, and i dont pay for any treatment. 
I dont pay for transportation, i dont pay for health checkup, i dont pay for casks. Hell, i wouldnt pay for the most expensive surgery you can think of.

       Yeah you must be really proud. That is why you can't even say it because you know I will rip it to shreds more then likely. Free health care always leads to the rich getting treatment and everyone dieing off. But anyway have fun saying your country's name loud and proud there bud I can tell you are so progressive for your people.

       I am from Norway, find some fake news about it and give it back to me will you?
Can you explain how giving free healthcare to EVERYONE means that everyone but the rich gets treatment?
That is inherently false. What the fuck kind of thought-process do you have to think that? Hahah what!?

       Hey that is great guess what I actually work for my treatment and the things I own and have. Have fun being a lazy fuck and gaming while jacking off to American politics and letting your governemnt rape you while doing so. Hopefully Russia busts a Crimea grab on you guys and puts you back in check haha.

       I.. i struggle to comprehend how you are able to drag all of this shit out of your ass.
How am i a freeloader exactly?
Again with the strawman why are you attributing these things to me i have never said?
Actually Norway has this thing which your country should totally try, it is called INTEGRATION, so our citizens actually leave behind the toxic mindset which does not belong here. Wait, i got your answer ready for you «THEYRE LYING TO YOU!!!!» no they’re not. Its an extensive thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should i want universal income when every norwegian is secured over 1 million dollars?
      </p>
      <p>
       So you are actually proud to be able to say you waste your hard earned money when i can save it and use that for buying a house or car or you name it?
You are actually PROUD to say you are wasting money?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just let me know, are you an accurate representation of the average American? Are all of you really this dumb?

       Yeah because your country doesn't pay there protection fees to NATO whike American's who pay there taxes pay for your protection. So again your freeloading off another countires work. So that is why we will be letting Russia take your land soon enough. You people literally have classes for immigrants on how they are supppses to treat women and we are the dumb ones? Okay? hahaha

       You are aware the LEADER of NATO is our former prime minister? Right? Or does that make too much sense to you?
So we are dumb because we actually want them to conform to our culture instead of imposing their laws and beliefs on us? Isnt that what you DONT want? That is hypocritical. 
And that makes us the stupid ones? Jeez man.

       Haha maybe you should go ask the women in Sweden if it was Poles or any kind of European that were raping them. And maybe you should look up the word "Refugee" before saying anything else. What part of Norway do you live in?  Oh I can keep the facts coming all day long with actual video proof you just speak out of your ass not providing anything as is usual.
I like how you don't even listen to actual victims of your own people either. Are you sure your Norwegian?

       Oh boy, where do i begin..
Firstly; the video is from 2006. The text is mostly wrong, partly right. 
Did you notice the «traumatized countries» part? THAT is the reason we teach them how to act properly! You literally proved my point which you said was stupid, so Thank you. 
Secondly; one isolated incident you find proof of, is not proof that everyone does this, even you should figure this out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirdly: i never said i knew more about your country than you did. Again with the strawman. Stop it, Its childish. 
Let me put it this way. 
America has NEVER BEFORE been so heavily in the worlds eye. NEVER. All because of Trump, and all the shit he pulls. As i said earlier, i am only voicing MY OPINION. Every platform, be that YouTube, Snapchat and Reddit shows news upon news upon news about what is going on with america at the moment. I have an opinion. 
You dont know anything about Norway, and probably have only heard the name 2 times before this conversation. 
Is it really comparable when you say you know more about my country than me? Please enlighten me more on a country you dont know anything about
I never tried to pull out bullshit made up facts to you, which you did to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fourth; i am a norwegian with ancestry all the way back to the viking age and one famous Earl. I couldnt be more norwegian.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fifth; You do know we are famous for not spending a single cent of our oil reserve right? Even if, and thats a big if, the oil runs out, we can check how our money is doing
       <a href="https://www.nbim.no/no/">
        right here, in real time
       </a>
       Thats 1 trillion dollars by the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every Word you said was wrong lol, except the thing you unwillingly confirmed for me though. Thanks for that

      <p>
       His values have been stated over and over again. That he will put American's first instead of the rest of the world like his predecessors did. That is why he wants to take us out of NATO because we meet the financial requirements every year while countries like yours haven't been paying at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess what your trying to say is that he is wrong because he wants to put his country and people first over others when your country doew that excat thing.

      <p>
       So I will ask you again and let's see if you can actually provide a straight forward answer.  What do you think Trump's values are?

«Never a straight answer or a source» 
Have you been in a different conversation or are you that willfully ignorant, like, are you legit serious?
You have never educated me, you have never tried this, you have only stated inaccuracies and lied about my country. Are you trying to convince yourself, or me here?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trumps values is not that he puts america first. That is only partly true. He puts his rich friends first, and the rest of america second, and doesnt give a shit about the rest of the world. 
He believes in
       <a href="https://www.google.no/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-us-canada-38753000">
        torture
       </a>
       which even people who have used it says doesnt work. Doesnt matter, his opinion is the only one that matters, just like you. 
He does not believe in global warming, and the dangerous greenhouse gasses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, in an increasingly more interconnected world he wants to step out, and isolate themselves. America first, right? That is a step backwards i Todays world

       So are we, but how we do it like this. 
Show them how our countries rules and norms differentiate from theirs, and if they cant understand that, we send them back. It has been a hugely successfully implemented idea.

       Nope not at all. But I grew up with them and most are racist as fuck. And it isn't a secret they work here for cheap labor then just send it back to Mexico. People like your lords that push global warming to tax Americans more love the cheap labor so they protect them even though there not citizens.  They would rather pay the Mexican 10 dollars an hour under the table TAX FREE then pay the average American 18 to 25 for picking in the fields and contirbuting to America. There is literally documentaries on this with illegal immagrants admitting this.

       There will be no wall. Only Iron Domes and National Guard will be deployed on the border. We will protect ourselves and our interests. If there is problem you may proceed however you like. Just know there is a little under 165 million people who support us over your 5 million people's point of view. You can take it however you like it but that is just the bottom line.

       By the way my family holds a ruin stone of Lief Eriikson left behind in New Vinland. So I am just sad to see the way places like Sweden have fallen to a Hitler like plan aka the EU.

       It also sickens me Saudia Arabia hasn't taken in any of these refugees. Your country alone has taken in more "refugees" then there actual homeland has even considered taking in. I don't know..... call me what you want man but I am pretty sure I am seeing a broder spectrum of things.

       You arent talking about the guy who actually wants to what hitler wanted, and ban an entire religion are you?
Or are you talking about the similarities between the Berlin wall and trumps wall?
Before you say the Berlin wall was not hitlers idea, i am aware. It was made long after his death. 
It was still something that divided more than it brought people together, as was Its plan.

       Here's my theory, and I am probably being biased because I consider myself a conservative and align with many republican views. Nonetheless, I think the last administration, especially when they were in power for two presidential terms, gets a lot of the conspiracy flack because they were the ones conspiring. Therefore, the current conspiracy theories point to the democrats. If you asked 8 years ago, it was the Republicans that couldn't get a break. That said, the bias also tends to focus on certain topics as well. Democrats are usually the ones blamed for education and welfare and chemical substance based conspiracies because they tend to focus more on those programs as a matter of policy. The Republicans are generally the topic of military, financial, and prison based conspiracies, much for the same reason. I saw a chart at some point in the last couple of years that showed conspiracy bias over time via Google trends, but I forget the exact context, and it seemed to support my view of trends aligning with the recent administration's political party. I hope at least part of my answer is helpful.

       I agree with your general analysis but how do Democrats have to do with chemical substances? Arent they the ones usually trying to be a check on the FDA and pharmaceutical companies? Aren't liberals usually more skeptical of pesticides and food additives?

       They're usually the ones involved in the pharmaceutical and drug regulation stuff, so they end up getting the blame for all the stuff like human experimentation and drug company favoritism and stuff. Recent examples that come to mind are the human experiments at Synthes and the AIDS drug dilution stuff. Like I said though, my experience is limited and I haven't researched this topic directly, so I am definitely showing some bias, and this might be one of the areas in which I am biased. I'll keep an eye out though.

       Why do so many in THIS sub think there's a difference between them? After this past "election" the 2 "opponents" literally being business partners who socialize publicly together, their children are life-long friends who hang out together, and there are so many people that think they are on a "side". Not sure if this is a new thing to this sub, but when I see people on r/conspiracy spewing blind support for any political party, it takes away from the integrity of the sub as a whole.

       there is a botnet and artificial amplification dedicated to propping trump up and denouncing his enemies. It is not all artificial but it builds on some existing sentiment and reinforces zealotry. Of course there is a small segment of the population that organically feels this way, and the amplification both reinforces them and makes them seem louder than they really are.

       Because most people on here know that republican Vs democrat or left Vs right is all an illusion of choice and free will.  Right now democrats as a whole are more obviously worse, but that's likely just because we have more evidence exposing them.  Just because we don't have emails from republicans doesn't mean they don't do the same shit.

       That is so fucking nuts. Can you think of anything obvious to make America a weaker nation, a less respectable nation, in the eyes of the world? It's been done already by the GOP. Or, if it hasn't, you are predicting their next action. They are anti-government in our government. Wrecking the ability of Americans to take meaningful actions on the world stage.

       Well the Republicans have hijacked the highest levels of the Democratic party over the past few decades, so there is only a fictitious differentiation between the two parties as far as actual policy that is passed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are still looking at American politics in terms of Left vs. Right instead of Rich vs. Poor, then you are missing the big picture entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are Republicans getting a pass?  Are Democrats getting a pass?  The answer doesn't matter because crony capitalists and the wealthy have always gotten a pass throughout all of history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you upset that your political party appears to be losing the public relations battle at the moment?  Perhaps it's time to work together so that we can all be on the winning team.

       Man going through this sub the last week or so the same thought crossed my mind especially with the Weinsteingate happenings. No mention if our current president and the sexual harassment claims against him. And when they talk about the "Washington Elites" and pedophila almost always bring up Podesta and the "Dems" but somehow no republicans involved or even aware of a pedophile ring. Thats one reason to be very cautious when Pizza Gate narratives and the like that oust one side and never mention the other players.

       It's all a smear against democrats, never republicans. "We hate people in power touching kids." No mention of the House page scandal. "We hate people in power molesting women." No mention of Trump, even though he bragged about it. "Sexual harassment is awful!" No mention of Roger Ailes.

       How is this post getting so many upvotes if this is a Russia shill zone like you claim? This sub has discourse from both sides, the amount of libs on this sub is insane. This post is just yet another example of the divide and conquer plan by the global elite to enslave us, creating disruptions in our investigations and putting up roadblocks (like those RINOs in Congress who insist on increaseing the Obamacare death toll by not repealing it).

       It's because people are waking up to the disinformation campaigns the DNC has been behind with (((CNN))) and other liberal controlled news outlets. The Clintons can't get over the fact that they lost the popular vote, and are trying to save face by putting up beaurocratic roadblocks and having their cronies in the media slander Trump, turning people against each other in their divide and conquer strategy. How are you not seeing this? You are just enabling the (((globalists))) takeover of this country!

        Fear
       </strong>
       is the kind killer. It shuts down positive emotions, complex thought and it makes us vulnerable to manipulation. It works as it should. Fear has to do this to function. For when you are faced with a threat to yourself or those you love, you must react quickly and effectively, fighting or fleeing or there may be no more of those positive emotions. This reallocates blood to muscles from digestive organs and also from complex thinking parts of the brain to faster, simpler parts of the mind. That's exactly the way evolution should go. Proficient manipulators do not ignore the utility of successful exploitation of this system.
      </p>
      <p>
       They create deceptive constructs of belief and sell them to others in order to get others to serve their own interests in some way. Frequently, it's to get more money, by influencing policy, by influencing elections, by influencing the electorate, by selling their poison to every day people. Although, con artist employ the same practice to generate stupid, irrational decisions that serve them at the expense of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dichotomy of fear vs love is misleading. We need both in balance to able to properly react to our ever changing environments. When threatened, we should protect ourselves. When we aren't, we should release the stress, feel good and think with more complexity. In politics, spirituality and other mindful endeavors, we should strive to abandon fear and instead analyze the reasons for the fear. Logic can serve us, to help us cut through fear and find sensible solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, while the left polarizes toward compassion for others, it neglects to fear moochers and frauds. It is just a tendency of vulnerability toward the fault. Many leftists do a count for moochers and fraud. The right goes to the other extreme. It fears threats often ignoring compassion. Many right wing people do have compassion, but less so in the policies they prefer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Balance is best for us all, but we are encouraged to polarize to accommodate the corruptors of our reality that want to make us crazy and own us. They prefer we favor fear because it's easier to control us with fear than love. Love, through stockholm syndrome, through submission to abusers, through forgiveness for intransigent abusers, can also control us. Our enemy dies not want us to balance protection and growth modes of being, which we call fear and love respectively. We need to honor both in all areas of life to defeat them.

       This train of thought is so stupid it makes my head hurt. This exact line of thinking is why tons of users in the sub voted trump, and still, they can't imagine why pizzagate could possibly be a conspiracy driven by Russia. What happened to pizzagate? What happened to Seth Rich? These things drove people to be political foot soldiers and then the narratives just grind to a total halt.

       I honestly can't answer that question. Partisanship is so far off my radar at this point that I really pay no mind to it.  Until we can all distinguish that parties are yet another divisive tactic we are doomed to fall into the same gaps. End game is the same regardless of what they claim to be. Basically I feel like if your still looking at pol parties as teams, your doing so by design. They even have fun mascots!

       Not really, back then this sub was filled with exactly how many people HRC has personally murdered, how many children she trafficked for pedos, how she literally should face life in prison (or possibly death) for these crimes. there wasn't much room for anything else.

       I am guessing you are a serial sexual assaulter since some fox news reporters have been accused of it?
      </p>
      <p>
       That is how dumb you sound. 
You are literally dragging arguments out of thin air and attributing them to me because i refute your claims.

      <p>
       You just proved you are impossible to converse with.
You just added to the stereotype of Trump supporters. Jeez

       Well that is defnietly not a bad thing. Just do me a favor and stay out it is so white supremacist here. Yup. Total Nazi. You should try and convince the Hiliray supporters to move to you that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

       Nope, not Canada. 
Far from it actually. 
Canada is not the first country in the world with free healthcare. 
USA is the last though

       Yeah you must be really proud. That is why you can't even say it because you know I will rip it to shreds more then likely. Free health care always leads to the rich getting treatment and everyone dieing off. But anyway have fun saying your country's name loud and proud there bud I can tell you are so progressive for your people.

       I.. i struggle to comprehend how you are able to drag all of this shit out of your ass.
How am i a freeloader exactly?
Again with the strawman why are you attributing these things to me i have never said?
Actually Norway has this thing which your country should totally try, it is called INTEGRATION, so our citizens actually leave behind the toxic mindset which does not belong here. Wait, i got your answer ready for you «THEYRE LYING TO YOU!!!!» no they’re not. Its an extensive thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should i want universal income when every norwegian is secured over 1 million dollars?
      </p>
      <p>
       So you are actually proud to be able to say you waste your hard earned money when i can save it and use that for buying a house or car or you name it?
You are actually PROUD to say you are wasting money?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just let me know, are you an accurate representation of the average American? Are all of you really this dumb?

       So are we, but how we do it like this. 
Show them how our countries rules and norms differentiate from theirs, and if they cant understand that, we send them back. It has been a hugely successfully implemented idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       How you do it. 
Ban EVERYONE! «USA is superior, you are inferior! There is no helping you, goodbye»

       And the Sweden horde..? 
More inaccuracies or what are you even trying to imply here?
