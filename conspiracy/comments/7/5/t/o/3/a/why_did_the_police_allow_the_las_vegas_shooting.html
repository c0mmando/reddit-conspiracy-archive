       Hotel employee Jesus Campos was shot six minutes before the mass shooting began. He called in the shooting to hotel staff immediately. The police should have known the gunfire came from room 135, floor 32 of Mandalay Bay even before the crowd was shot at. The windows have alarms on them also. The hotel should have been aware of exactly which room the shooter was in as soon as they were broken.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did it take the police over an hour to locate and enter the room?

       It wasn't an active shooter situation at that point, it was a barricade, so they followed barricade protocol (evacuating nearby guests, getting explosives ready to breach, etc.)

       To be fair, they were there in 15 minutes, but they could have been there before the shooting even started. Why MB didn't notify police is a mystery. Must have been someone running interfere

       I've found no evidence of this. Closest I can find is a random witness account (on CNN, shortly after the shooting) saying the police located the shooter from the smoke alarm going off in his room. When asked about a smoke alarm at the media briefing on Monday afternoon, the Sheriff said "I don't recall a smoke alarm." And I believe the guys on
       <em>
        60 Minutes
       </em>
       the other night (the makeshift SWAT team) said the smoke alarm was activated when they breached the suite door, but not before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Window alarms haven't been mentioned at any of the media briefings. I believe it's just a rumor.

       There aren't window alarms. It would cause way too many false alarms. Helicopters fly right by those windows all the time. People touch them. Lean on them. I would imagine have sex against them. The guard came because of an open door alarm of a room on his floor.

       Couldn't there just be a string or two of wire inside each window? If the wire strand breaks, alarm goes off. No need to worry unless the window actually breaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine it could look similar to defrost wires on the rear window is a car, but a bit thicker.

       I have stayed at Luxor and Mandalay...there are no wires. There are no alarms on the windows. Those windows aren't breaking unless u do it on purpose...which up until now hasn't been an issue. Vegas caters to their guest...if there were wires in those windows blocking a perfect view...folks would be pissed. People seem to forget that Vegas is a grown persons playground. Not a lot of questions and as much privacy as they can give u outside of main areas.

       No windows on curtain walls do not have alarms. That would be a multi-million dollar cost that I'm not sure exists on any high rise on earth, much less a hotel built in the late 90s.

       I'm not sure why that someone would call the maintenance office and ask them to call the police though. Were they not allowed to carry their personal cell phones? I'd be dialing 911 myself, if someone was firing a rifle down the hallway and the security guard was cowering in a corner with a bullet hole in him.

       Everything about this shooting points back to Mandalay Bay/MGM being liable for the result, which is why the entire goal now is to prevent the public from getting the impression that MGM/MB security fucked up and caused it.

       For all we know, Paddock was in that room, doing whatever, but had no plans to shoot that crowd. Maybe it was an arms deal, who knows.

       I'm not saying that what they did was wrong, I haven't followed it closely enough. Thats why in Australia they create royal commissions/inquires into exact police methods what they did/could have done/should do in the future.

       In the US theres tactics and procedures that are put in place by a department, theyre pretty much the same nation wide, on how to respond to certain incidents. By the time police arrived at his door, if we go off the latest timeline, this was no longer an active shooter situation it was a barricaded gun man. At a barricaded gunman job the goal is to end the situation peacefully hopefully by having the gunman surrender and that takes time.

       I realise police have tactics but it's always good to have a review of them if almost 60 odd people get killed and over 500 injured.

       Australia has them if one person dies in a police operation and we haven't had a mass klling incident since '96 involving fire arms.

       And America's armed citizens so far havent been allowed to stop these events because they've all taken place in "gun free zones" where a law abiding citizen isnt allowed to have a gun.

       It doesn't help when 'your land' also has one of the highest gun ownership and gun deaths. There's no need for citizens to own high powered/capacity weapons, in Australia you can still buy guns but the regulation is tighter. Your gun lobby over there and the weapons companies use fear mongering to sell more guns/get more membership and power.

       Yep, I'm glad the worst guns they can get here to commit terror are a shitty sawn off shotgun and a revolver, not high powered assault rifles with with capacity that can just mow down hundreds or potentially thousands in crowds.

       I am puzzled.  If Campos gave police the master key to the rooms, why breach the door?

       Tested and studied, as in the police are testing/ studying/ training and I should have said using these tactics everyday.

       And America's armed citizens so far havent been allowed to stop these events because they've all taken place in "gun free zones" where a law abiding citizen isnt allowed to have a gun.  The guy who is about to commit mass murder doesn't care that the law says he can't bring his gun, he is about to commit the highest crime in the land.
