</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve found no evidence of this. Closest I can find is a random witness account (on CNN, shortly after the shooting) saying the police located the shooter from the smoke alarm going off in his room. When asked about a smoke alarm at the media briefing on Monday afternoon, the Sheriff said &quot;I don&#39;t recall a smoke alarm.&quot; And I believe the guys on <em>60 Minutes</em> the other night (the makeshift SWAT team) said the smoke alarm was activated when they breached the suite door, but not before. </p>

<p>Window alarms haven&#39;t been mentioned at any of the media briefings. I believe it&#39;s just a rumor. </p>

By the time police arrived at his door, if we go off the latest timeline, this was no longer an active shooter situation it was a barricaded gun man. At a barricaded gunman job the goal is to end the situation peacefully hopefully by having the gunman surrender and that takes time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I realise police have tactics but it&#39;s always good to have a review of them if almost 60 odd people get killed and over 500 injured. </p>

<p>Australia has them if one person dies in a police operation and we haven&#39;t had a mass klling incident since &#39;96 involving fire arms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t help when &#39;your land&#39; also has one of the highest gun ownership and gun deaths. There&#39;s no need for citizens to own high powered/capacity weapons, in Australia you can still buy guns but the regulation is tighter. Your gun lobby over there and the weapons companies use fear mongering to sell more guns/get more membership and power.</p>
