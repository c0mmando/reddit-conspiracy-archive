      </h1>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Difference between the Illuminati and Illuminati controlled secret societies (Skull &amp; Bones, Freemasons, Bohemian Grove, etc) for DUMMIES

       Last Prophet replies:
       <br/>
       You know neither one of the basic facts about secret societies nor one of the basic facts about the illuminati.

      <p>
       <strong>
        Basic facts about secret societies
       </strong>
       <br/>
       1. Secret societies have two types of members: public and hidden, the members that will not be revealed.
       <br/>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Basic facts about the illuminati secret society
       </strong>
       <br/>
       1&amp;#46; Illuminati officially denies that it exists.
       <br/>
       This implicates that every member is hidden.
       <br/>
       In other words nobody who is a member will admit it.
      </p>
      <p>
       2&amp;#46; Illuminati controls a number of other secret societies, that do not deny their existence (Skull &amp; Bones, Freemasons, Bohemian Grove, etc).
       <br/>
       This implicates that some members of each of these secret societies is public.
      </p>
      <p>
       3&amp;#46; It was never as easy as now to know who a large if not the majority of illuminati members are, as a consequence of one of the Laws of End Time Reductionism (1).

       “Illuminati” is laughable (Adam Weishaupt, I know Yada Yada). Plus, people who assume the Freemasons are nefarious and hell bent on doom are laughable too. They’re a boys club, before the internet, people had to actually socialize and needed places to routinely gather. Sure there were back room dealings between different Freemasons, but the organization as a whole, is
       <em>
        mostly
       </em>
       harmless. Skull &amp; Bones can fuck off tho.
      </p>
      <p>
       Focus your efforts on the OTO (Ordo Templi Orientis) if you wanna start digging up some of the real good stuff.

       You are not questioning the name of the secret society, which, unlike freemasonry, Bilderberg or Skull &amp; Bones, was never officially stated by one of its members.
       <br/>
       You name the perps "Ordo Templi Orientis" as opposed to the secret society of the illuminati (who are behind OTO, Freemasonry, Bilderberg &amp; Skull &amp; Bones, etc).
       <br/>
       The illuminati or Ordo Illuminatus first stepped on stage as an identifiable organization in 1190: Ordo Teutonicus, admission requirements included proof of German nobility for at least four generations.
       <br/>
       So
       <strong>
        you are in denial that the basic fact
       </strong>
       .
       <br/>
       The basic fact is that ONLY total control by one and the same secret society of media, politics and depending entities (from judges to directions of sport federations), explains the basic facts of:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        terror acts like 9/11, with media inserting a "plane" "live", shortly before hundreds of firemen are ordered to enter the chambers to be nuked "live" on TV, etc;
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        "elections" with voting machines giving Romney in the winner role in Florida 800,000 votes although less than 5,000 people voted for him or giving McCain in the loser role in the US 58 million votes although less than 5 million votes (a simple poll will confirm this), despite the fact that he was "opposing" a guy (who was already an adult when he was re-) named "Hussein Obama II" - in other words where ALL "candidates" are playing a scripted role;
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        mega frauds like the Mega Millions and EuroMillions lottery "drawings" "live" on TV, week after week for years now;
        <br/>
        <a href="http://lottery-for-dummies.blogspot.com/">
         http://lottery-for-dummies.blogspot.com/
        </a>
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        a "justice" that for instance has sentenced some of the greatest sports champions, from runner Ben Johnson to cyclist Alberto Contador, based on false accusations and manufactured "evidence";

       Hold on there, champ, pull the reins back a little bit. You are trying to connect a lot of dots that aren’t necessarily correlated. Your first couple of paragraphs were a bit tough to read, as if English isn’t your first language, so I’m not going to knock it. If you think the Teutonic Knights were the first rendition of the controlling secret society in the world, you’ve got a lot more digging to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you think the “Illuminati” as you describe it are a controlling hand that has orchestrated each and every individual society through the aeons of human history, you again have a lot of revision to do. It is not that simple. There is no one overarching group that dictates the actions of all others. In today’s corporatocracy, the bilderberg group, council on foreign relations &amp; trilateral commission are the closest thing you’ve got to that. But now you are venturing into a “New World Order” type of model, that is completely separate than your perceived “Illuminati”.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Illuminati you speak of, by their own admonition, are a group of light bringers whose sole purpose it was, to perpetuate and advance the spiritual state of man. They were never a group hell bent on world domination. The closest thing to a group trying to dominate through evil spiritual pursuits in today’s day and age is the OTO and their magickal practices. However, they date to eastern secret societies that were spawned in Egypt and even earlier in Sumer.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no discernible link between all of the bullet points you listed. They are individual events with their own levels of certifiability, and orchestrated by varying groups for varying purposes. Not just “the Illuminati”.

       I pray you’re a bot and not this big of a fool. You don’t know any of my opinions on anything. Not to mention you have zero factual idea who the maestros of these events were, or if they were the same group. So don’t act like you do.

       It was you that claimed "individual events ... orchestrated by varying groups for varying purposes".

       You suck at the internet arguing game. The onus of proof lies on the one making the wild ass claims, and that’s you. Obviously those events were false flags, but to say they were carried out by the same nameless faceless organization is just foolish. ESPECIALLY when you’ve said you have no proof of their existence, just speculation and some bullshit blog.

       Yes.
       <br/>
       Although the current Israel government, since 1975 coup, consists only of treasonous illuminazi agents working overtime to complete the destruction of Israel agenda.
       <br/>
       Same as at least 192 UN recognized governments doing nothing but to execute orders from the Illuminati Grand Master.

       Now there's need to answer my previous question since you just presented your CIA psy-op card.
