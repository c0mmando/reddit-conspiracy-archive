       He did call in a shooter, what others did with that information I don't know. I am sure his information helped them a lot in the flow of some things - but keep this in mind. The security team gets a radio call about a man shooting into the hallway, the cops then get information as well about a shooting at the concert across the way. For all they know this is two different incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add in multiple 911 calls from people on the ground there and suddenly you have people claiming shots from everywhere - again, add this into a single guard at the time who called in a shooting in the hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it any wonder at all there was a ton of confusion??

       Yes but the point is he never mentioned Campos shot , but claims they were together , one of my theory is hotel security had a standoff with him and were negotiating send food and all (with camera attached) , he threatened to shot crown of his demands aren’t meet , they would loose million or billions anyway , they try to raid not knowing he had more weapons then them and he got shot in chest or back  then started shooting crowd , maybe he was doing a heist like his dad did n wanted to escape like lvpd said

       A version I just came across:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He told KNPR, a local NPR affiliate, that Campos went up to the 32nd floor to investigate a door alarm. While on the 32nd floor, he found that a stairwell door was jammed and radioed down to maintenance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Campos heard a drilling sound and thought it was odd. A maintenance worker came up to the 32nd floor.
        <strong>
         As the pair started talking, Paddock began firing through the door of his room, first with a single-fire gun and then with a rapid-fire rifle.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Police have said that when Campos radioed what happened, it helped them track where Paddock was holed up. McMahill didn’t elaborate on the six minutes or why police found it difficult to locate Paddock when, according to the new timeline, they had his location minutes before the assault started.
       </p>

       There were entire news articles about this guy's basically stopping the shooting midway through with no mention of another person. Now, exchange is actually before shooting starts toward concert and there is an entirely new witness?

       Why did the hotel say "security wants to know if you know what room" when maintenance was reporting it? Wouldn't Campos have given that info?

       That is assuming he talked to campos. Watch the video of the audio someone posted, it shows the long hallway. The security guard peeked out around one of those corners and may have made hand motions not wanting to give away his position to the shooter. He is shot, probably unarmed, and someone is shooting down the hallway. He hears someone else coming, peeks out, recognizes it is a hotel employee, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And security is two fold here - campos could have radioed it in to someone but the person maintenance talked to might have called someone else (a switchboard for the security team vs direct to another security person via security radio).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also: even if they knew from campos you still ask because there could be more than one shooter in more than one hall. You always ask, that is part of the job.

       So Paddock shoots Campos in the thigh (one of 200 rounds that hit).  Then he goes back in and starts a massacre from two separate rooms. Then he locks the adjoining door and kills himself right before swat comes?

       How does it clear Campos? We don't even know if there is such a person. We know almost nothing about what happened that night. The stairwell was right next to Paddock's and Hodge's rooms. Anyone could have gone in and out of there before the cops arrived?

       This needs verification but I believe Campos worked for a company called Contemporary Services Corporation (providing security for the concert).  What was he doing in the hotel, on the 32nd floor, to begin with?
