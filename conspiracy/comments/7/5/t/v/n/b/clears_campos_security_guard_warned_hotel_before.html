<p>He went to check on the door, heard shots, guard peeks around corner, he calls it in, shooting stops, then they make their way down the hallway. I don&#39;t know if this a phone recording vs radio and how or which ones are recorded. </p>

<p>Is on the floor, hears gunshots, a guard peeks around the corner, he radios it in, shots stop and the employees hook up and make their way down the hallway. They weren&#39;t huddled together initially.</p>

<p>Might help to have a map of the floor plan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He did call in a shooter, what others did with that information I don&#39;t know. I am sure his information helped them a lot in the flow of some things - but keep this in mind. The security team gets a radio call about a man shooting into the hallway, the cops then get information as well about a shooting at the concert across the way. For all they know this is two different incidents.</p>

<p>Add in multiple 911 calls from people on the ground there and suddenly you have people claiming shots from everywhere - again, add this into a single guard at the time who called in a shooting in the hotel. </p>

<p>Is it any wonder at all there was a ton of confusion??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but the point is he never mentioned Campos shot , but claims they were together , one of my theory is hotel security had a standoff with him and were negotiating send food and all (with camera attached) , he threatened to shot crown of his demands aren’t meet , they would loose million or billions anyway , they try to raid not knowing he had more weapons then them and he got shot in chest or back  then started shooting crowd , maybe he was doing a heist like his dad did n wanted to escape like lvpd said </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A version I just came across:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He told KNPR, a local NPR affiliate, that Campos went up to the 32nd floor to investigate a door alarm. While on the 32nd floor, he found that a stairwell door was jammed and radioed down to maintenance. </p>

<p>Campos heard a drilling sound and thought it was odd. A maintenance worker came up to the 32nd floor. <strong>As the pair started talking, Paddock began firing through the door of his room, first with a single-fire gun and then with a rapid-fire rifle.</strong> </p>

<p>Police have said that when Campos radioed what happened, it helped them track where Paddock was holed up. McMahill didn’t elaborate on the six minutes or why police found it difficult to locate Paddock when, according to the new timeline, they had his location minutes before the assault started.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is assuming he talked to campos. Watch the video of the audio someone posted, it shows the long hallway. The security guard peeked out around one of those corners and may have made hand motions not wanting to give away his position to the shooter. He is shot, probably unarmed, and someone is shooting down the hallway. He hears someone else coming, peeks out, recognizes it is a hotel employee, etc.</p>

<p>And security is two fold here - campos could have radioed it in to someone but the person maintenance talked to might have called someone else (a switchboard for the security team vs direct to another security person via security radio).</p>

<p>Also: even if they knew from campos you still ask because there could be more than one shooter in more than one hall. You always ask, that is part of the job.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but the point is he never mentioned Campos shot , but claims they were together , one of my theory is hotel security had a standoff with him and were negotiating send food and all (with camera attached) , he threatened to shot crown of his demands aren’t meet , they would loose million or billions anyway , they try to raid not knowing he had more weapons then them and he got shot in chest or back  then started shooting crowd , maybe he was doing a heist like his dad did n wanted to escape like lvpd said </p>
