       I believe a historian could write an exciting volume on just his rise to power and first year in office. If the conspiracies about him are to be believed here, he could be a seminal figure in world history. Just this last year we are witnessing him simultaneously at war with the national media, the Deep State/FBI, international interests, the Washington Establishment/GOP, Hollywood, a virtual fifth column on the Left, the NFL, and he's been on a full court press with North Korea and China.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have ever had a President who has been attacked by all sides, excluding the military/business (for now) like this? They are clearly scared shitless by Trump. So now we must determine whether he is Hitler or he's a hero. It can't be anything else given their reaction to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally think he is more like a Napoleon. Napoleon terrified the elites of his time. They didn't rest, not for nearly 20 years until the French Revolution and Napoleon were destroyed. They won't rest until Trump and his movement is defeated. Therefore, Trump like Napoleon must always be on the offensive.

       It's scary as hell to see people blindly accept that he's some kind of mastermind. When he gets trounced in 2020, he's going to create such a stink that his supporters will start the civil war they claimed Obama had cooking. And I can't stand Barry bombs or anything he stands for. He's a crook like the rest.

       Trump straight up created a narrative to make you question everything but him. This is what fascism looks like.

       He is a mastermind. He went from "tough brash NY real estate celebrity" to "hero of the working class" in one year despite a massive propaganda war against him. He won an unwinnable election and they have yet to trip him up on anything.
      </p>

       You need to be smart to do this. He lives in the heads of his enemies and allies. We have never had a President like that. Maybe Lincoln.

       The man was voted in by people roused by fervor. Basically, every republican president has been elected this way, while dem presidents have always been voted in by the opposite. The promise of change.

       Here's where it's interesting. Roger Stone worked on nixons campaign and on trump's campaign. He helped come up with this

        the Southern Strategy.

       interesting read. You can draw parallels all day.

       Change isn't always good, not when it comes at the cost of selling out to world government and further making Americans wards of the state.That is what the Democrats are about. They are no longer a party for the working class. They are a party for the poor and the global elite. The plantation owner and his slaves.

       He is doing a hell of a lot more for the working man than Obama and the so-called socialists. Trump's policies of opposing open borders and international trade deals were things that DEMOCRATS wanted. The right-wing wanted it.

       I was opposed to Trump throughout the primaries, up until I realized be wasn't working for the Democrats and that they actually hated him.

       He won me over. Rather, the full force of the propaganda war coming from both the GOP and Democrats won me over. You can only call someone a Nazi so many times without proof before we start scrutinizing the name-callers.

       I can't talk for "people" but I can talk for me. I do not "blindly accept" that he's some kind of mastermind. I see the moves he makes, his opponents make and all the little drones mimicking every single talking point. After a day at work and scouring reddit and following the news I sometimes come back and my roommate will just blurt out the same talking points he heard on french TV relating to the same events and guess what, he says the same buzzwords but in french. It's really easy to identify what info is good or not when you identify the patterns

       You're focused on trump too much. He is a product of the masses being made aware of its governments misdoings via the Internet. Keep digging you'll see the cosmic shift across the globe that has occurred with this. There is a revolutionary spirit in a litany of countries.

       So you agree that trump has been great for the economy, great! The second article basically says trump is probably right but the numbers are fucky and he is exaggerating and they were going down before he gor elected. Oh and i dont read vannity fair thats a joke. Of course they are going to say its unraveling thay are a propaganda outlet trying to destroy him.

       He's the President with a bunch of Goldman Sachs assholes at his side. Today there are pictures of him hanging out with Kissinger.

       Yeah if i was president i would invite that evil old slimeball to the white house to see if i could get anything out of him. Im not a fan of some of his cabinet picks but he is picking from a limited pool of people who know the system enough to be able to handle the job, it would be almost impossible for some bad eggs to not slip through. I dont mind those things either but are you suggesting that our government doesnt waste any money and couldnt do those things with much less?

       No.  The American Dream is to start somewhere and have the ability to multiply your wealth 1000x before you die.  And isn't it nice to be able to slap your own name on things?  I'd rather that, than having to slap Dear Leader's name on all the hard work I'm responsible for.

       They claimed Bush was an embarrassment yet they all wanted to work with him in the GOP. The Democrats today don't speak of Bush anywhere near the same hostility was 10-12 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       They hate Trump. Both sides. Why? His policies are a mix of conservatism and things that Democrats wanted. He is trying to pass the GOP Obama-era agenda and they won't let him. He is called a racist for trying to pass the Clinton-Obama blue collar Democrat agenda.

       He is definitely not pushing any current democrat policies. And our definition of shocking must be very different. His antics have become normal, sadly, but they were fairly shocking at first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conservative leadership is incompetent to begin with. I think they'd like to blame Trump, but watching them fail at "repeal and replace" has been kind of hysterical, in a really sad way.

       Opposition to open borders/cheap labor and TPP/NAFTA were major concerns of the labor/union Democrats. Only with Trump did it suddenly become racism instead of protecting the American worker. The GOP and their greedy business wing was lambasted for years for this until now.

       Yes he's going to go down in history in much the same way as Benedict Arnold. He'll be known as the worst president of all-time, a traitor who sold the country out and hopefully he will rot in prison for the remainder of his life for it.

       Although I can understand and even share that Trump is a hell of a public figure. He won't go down in History as THE president. Or Napoleon. Wtf dude. If everyone is scared shitless is because he might lead us to our doom. WW3? Maybe. End of the planet? Maybe. U.S civil war? Maybe. 
Everyone is scared because he has so much power to change the world. LOL.

       We've been in and out of war since Pearl Harbor. They are afraid of Trump because they are afraid of what he represents. A middle path between the two-party system and a lifting of the veil of everything wrong with this country that nobody ever had the balls to say. The common man isn't afraid of Trump. The elite are afraid of him and have been using their control over the media to scare everyone. It isn't working anymore.

       I am comparing him to Napoleon the political figure. Napoleon and Trump both were unlikely figures who became leaders of the respective poltical movements in their countries. Napoleon became the Revolution. Trump became the face for the revolt against the poltical class in America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both men were at war with the relentless ruling classes. Napoleon was barely afforded any peace by the other European monarchies. Trump, unlike other Presidents, has been given no peace by those seeking to dethrone him. The elite classes of Europe and America are terrified of Trump in the same way they were of Napoleon and the French Revolution.

       They claimed Bush was an embarrassment yet they all wanted to work with him in the GOP. The Democrats today don't speak of Bush anywhere near the same hostility was 10-12 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       They hate Trump. Both sides. Why? His policies are a mix of conservatism and things that Democrats wanted. He is trying to pass the GOP Obama-era agenda and they won't let him. He is called a racist for trying to pass the Clinton-Obama blue collar Democrat agenda.
