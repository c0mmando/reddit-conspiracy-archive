        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe a historian could write an exciting volume on just his rise to power and first year in office. If the conspiracies about him are to be believed here, he could be a seminal figure in world history. Just this last year we are witnessing him simultaneously at war with the national media, the Deep State/FBI, international interests, the Washington Establishment/GOP, Hollywood, a virtual fifth column on the Left, the NFL, and he&#39;s been on a full court press with North Korea and China. </p>

<p>Have ever had a President who has been attacked by all sides, excluding the military/business (for now) like this? They are clearly scared shitless by Trump. So now we must determine whether he is Hitler or he&#39;s a hero. It can&#39;t be anything else given their reaction to him.</p>

<p>I personally think he is more like a Napoleon. Napoleon terrified the elites of his time. They didn&#39;t rest, not for nearly 20 years until the French Revolution and Napoleon were destroyed. They won&#39;t rest until Trump and his movement is defeated. Therefore, Trump like Napoleon must always be on the offensive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s scary as hell to see people blindly accept that he&#39;s some kind of mastermind. When he gets trounced in 2020, he&#39;s going to create such a stink that his supporters will start the civil war they claimed Obama had cooking. And I can&#39;t stand Barry bombs or anything he stands for. He&#39;s a crook like the rest.</p>

<p>Trump straight up created a narrative to make you question everything but him. This is what fascism looks like. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is a mastermind. He went from &quot;tough brash NY real estate celebrity&quot; to &quot;hero of the working class&quot; in one year despite a massive propaganda war against him. He won an unwinnable election and they have yet to trip him up on anything. </p>

<p>The man was voted in by people roused by fervor. Basically, every republican president has been elected this way, while dem presidents have always been voted in by the opposite. The promise of change.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s where it&#39;s interesting. Roger Stone worked on nixons campaign and on trump&#39;s campaign. He helped come up with this <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy">the Southern Strategy. </a> interesting read. You can draw parallels all day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes he&#39;s going to go down in history in much the same way as Benedict Arnold. He&#39;ll be known as the worst president of all-time, a traitor who sold the country out and hopefully he will rot in prison for the remainder of his life for it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I can understand and even share that Trump is a hell of a public figure. He won&#39;t go down in History as THE president. Or Napoleon. Wtf dude. If everyone is scared shitless is because he might lead us to our doom. WW3? Maybe. End of the planet? Maybe. U.S civil war? Maybe. 
Everyone is scared because he has so much power to change the world. LOL. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ve been in and out of war since Pearl Harbor. They are afraid of Trump because they are afraid of what he represents. A middle path between the two-party system and a lifting of the veil of everything wrong with this country that nobody ever had the balls to say. The common man isn&#39;t afraid of Trump. The elite are afraid of him and have been using their control over the media to scare everyone. It isn&#39;t working anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am comparing him to Napoleon the political figure. Napoleon and Trump both were unlikely figures who became leaders of the respective poltical movements in their countries. Napoleon became the Revolution. Trump became the face for the revolt against the poltical class in America. </p>

<p>Both men were at war with the relentless ruling classes. Napoleon was barely afforded any peace by the other European monarchies. Trump, unlike other Presidents, has been given no peace by those seeking to dethrone him. The elite classes of Europe and America are terrified of Trump in the same way they were of Napoleon and the French Revolution. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They claimed Bush was an embarrassment yet they all wanted to work with him in the GOP. The Democrats today don&#39;t speak of Bush anywhere near the same hostility was 10-12 years ago. </p>

<p>They hate Trump. Both sides. Why? His policies are a mix of conservatism and things that Democrats wanted. He is trying to pass the GOP Obama-era agenda and they won&#39;t let him. He is called a racist for trying to pass the Clinton-Obama blue collar Democrat agenda. </p>

<p>I have yet to really see him do anything that is shocking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Opposition to open borders/cheap labor and TPP/NAFTA were major concerns of the labor/union Democrats. Only with Trump did it suddenly become racism instead of protecting the American worker. The GOP and their greedy business wing was lambasted for years for this until now. </p>
