    <div class="md"><p>I liken that idea to Randy Quaid and his wife seeking asylum in Canada because he believes &quot;star whackers&quot; are a real threat.</p>

<p>I believe that idea.  Money and control to keep those who aren&#39;t willing to go down on certain people are good tools to keep them in line.</p>

<p>Mel Gibson goes off about jews running hollywood.....gets his face plastered everywhere like a raving anti-semitic fool.....gets lambasted for saying how he felt, right or wrong.  Someone gets their hooks into him.  Mel just has a ton of money, maybe he can endure....who knows how it works exactly.</p>

<p>Dave Chappelle goes to Africa to get away, media roasts him and says he is on drugs.  Character assassinates him.....lots of examples of the process at work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You fuckers never saw it coming who&#39;d of thunk it or thought it
It be ignored like the ramblings of a drunk if you&#39;d report it
My performances are greeted with plaudits and laughter
If you caught me red handed you probably think it stigmata
Success sucks less than standard existence
But when you exceed the standard dreams what becomes of our ambitions
The average man can dream dreams of a path he&#39;s never walked
But when that path&#39;s your day to day your dreams become warped -- The Struggle - Scroobius Pip</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They really are. Granted, getting an in depth understanding of the person in the chair is the entire point of the show. I imagine that a great number of interviewers/TV personalities could do well if they had that  same outlet. The show on CBC&#39;s, The Hour with George Strombolopolous comes to mind; It was the same kind of format, and actually really good, IMO. He talks to people all of types, musicians and  even writers...I remember episodes with people like George RR Martin, and even Margaret Atwood. Just an all around awesome show. </p>

Then you ask yourself.. wait.. why should they get a pass? Then you realize they control everything and how sick of a world we really live in and that these exact people have created a fantasy for us to live in. Its really scary.. So what do WE do about it ?? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is an interesting though disturbing read here about this kind of thing:</p>

<p><a href="https://butterflylanguage.com/2017/09/24/some-notes-mostly-not-on-pizzagate/">https://butterflylanguage.com/2017/09/24/some-notes-mostly-not-on-pizzagate/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a boss who used to work in the entertainment industry, specifically movie production, for a long time. And she once told me privately—in the most matter-of-fact, calm way—that pedophiles were rampant in the industry, and in more moneyed circles in general. And she said the reason for this was, these people had so much—so much fame, money, achievements, everything they wanted—that they became bored and life started to feel “meaningless.” And so they needed…a “new frontier,” if you will. They needed a new challenge. And so they went to sex: “the ultimate frontier,” the place of possibly no borders. And some got into BDSM—which is cool; if it’s consensual who cares?—and so you had like literal heads of state and media conglomerates going to dominatrixes and getting the shit flogged out of them (and one story in particular sticks in my mind, but I’d like to not die so I won’t tell it to you). But some of these people chose to get into having sex with underage persons. Because that was their “ultimate frontier,” ultimate taboo. And some even mixed that up with occulty sort of things, and drugs, and just a whole interrelated tableau of stuff.</p>

<p>And what she told me didn’t really surprise me all that much, because I myself have been involved in the entertainment field—albeit largely with its sort of “bastard” younger brother, the comics industry—for almost 20 years.</p>

<p>And so I’ll tell you what happens. You get asked by different people in your workplace—it may be your boss, or your boss’s boss, or the head of the company, or a co-worker of a higher rank, or some sort of “celebrity” in your industry—a bunch of “leading questions” to see what you’re “into.” And on the ground-level that’s like, basically, seeing if you will fuck them. And for the purposes of this post: fine. I’m not even going to touch the issue of sexual harassment here, because it is so all-encompassing and a part of the essential matrix of a lot of these places that it’s almost banal to bring up.</p>

<p>But then they may ask questions to see if…you take drugs? (maybe you can party with them) What are your feelings on drugs? (will you be a rotten dirty snitch?) And then it can move from there to “feeling out” your attitude to various kinky practices (mind you, we are talking about being in an office with your superiors or bosses having this fucking conversation)…and then…and this has happened to me a couple of times…it gets really really really really fucking creepy.</p>

<p>“What do you think about sex tourism?”</p>

<p>You are sitting there, and wondering why the fuck you are having this conversation. And then you sort of get to a point where you answer these questions with a weak smile and an “I don’t know” and just feign utter cluelessness and stupidity.</p>
