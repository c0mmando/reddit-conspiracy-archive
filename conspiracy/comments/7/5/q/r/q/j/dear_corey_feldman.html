       My biggest guess why these actors and actresses can't come forward is because their assets are somehow tied to their abusers with an at will contract.

       I liken that idea to Randy Quaid and his wife seeking asylum in Canada because he believes "star whackers" are a real threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that idea.  Money and control to keep those who aren't willing to go down on certain people are good tools to keep them in line.

       Mel Gibson goes off about jews running hollywood.....gets his face plastered everywhere like a raving anti-semitic fool.....gets lambasted for saying how he felt, right or wrong.  Someone gets their hooks into him.  Mel just has a ton of money, maybe he can endure....who knows how it works exactly.

       Dave Chappelle goes to Africa to get away, media roasts him and says he is on drugs.  Character assassinates him.....lots of examples of the process at work.

       Make unproven accusations and teams of highly paid lawyers could come after you for everything. Someone like Feldman can't afford his own legal team to compete, let alone judgements against him. He'd be a victim all over again. It would wreck him. Someone like Gibson is in a position to be the abuser. He has the resources and connections to be able to go on an anti Semitic drunken rant and given some time to let it all die down, be right back in business.

       He was given a spanking, but he makes and has made a lot of people a lot of money, which is all it takes to get back in good graces honestly. The same can't be said about so many other fallen actors and actresses that have bitten the hand.

       Too many regular joes love Mel movies to pass up on letting him get a bit of work, I agree. I hope they let him make more movies! The stipulaiton for Hacksaw was he probably had to let a jew be the leading role (lol).

       Remember when Feldman was on the today show with his performances everyone mocked?  How do you think he afforded to produce all of his songs, and pay his "Angels".  He hasn't had a movie since he was a kid.  I think we know a guilty party is funding his music career for his silence.

       To be fair, I bet Corey's still working. I realize I'm referencing a reality series from a few years ago--it's the reality show he did with Corey Haim. No, I bet he's not floating in money. Maybe it's a case of living project to project instead of paycheck to paycheck like the average peon?

If you caught me red handed you probably think it stigmata

       They really are. Granted, getting an in depth understanding of the person in the chair is the entire point of the show. I imagine that a great number of interviewers/TV personalities could do well if they had that  same outlet. The show on CBC's, The Hour with George Strombolopolous comes to mind; It was the same kind of format, and actually really good, IMO. He talks to people all of types, musicians and  even writers...I remember episodes with people like George RR Martin, and even Margaret Atwood. Just an all around awesome show.

       he doesn't go on the rant in the episode, morty mentions it during one of his drunken video playbacks when he answers a question.
      </p>
      <p>
       He selects the location Israel after one of the vindicators dies and says "its just something rick talks about when he gets blackout drunk"
      </p>
      <p>
       then rick defends himself saying that if he said it it was totally not for anti-Semitic reasons, defense budget and all that jazz

        You fuckers never saw it coming, who'd of thunk it or thought it.
It be ignored like the ramblings of a drunk if you'd report it.
My performances are greeted with plaudits and laughter.
If you caught me red handed you probably think it stigmata.
Success sucks less than standard existence,

The average man can dream dreams of a path he's never walked,

       The bathing suit photo is surely shopped. But I don't think the central point they're trying to make is wrong. She's a victim.

       Watson was a cute child actress, but she's no movie star. If she couldn't even help open "The Circle" after "Beauty &amp; the Beast," and already has direct-to-DVD movies, we're in the back end of her career.

       I bet he was a major victim too and just wwanted to get his childhood back. I think he was mentally scarred and was threatened into not saying  anything. The Pedo Outrage against him could have been an OP to discredit him and keep him quit and if he said anythign they'd lock him up and destroy his name.

       Yeah, I agree. He might have been into little boys, but I agree it was probably abused and was mentally scarred. He tried to physically change how he looked and tried to act and talk like a little boy.

       Jermaine Jackson at one point was shopping a book he wrote that said Michael was abused as a child. He specifically said men would come and take Michael away and he would be 'sick' for a few days afterwards. I believe the story first broke in the New York Post.

       I can't imagine what he's been through. Having grown up in such a dark business, having to watch your best friend lose the battle and succumb to drugs and eventually die too soon, having people not believe you when you try to say something. Then having people get mad at you because you're not saying more when the truth starts to come out. I don't envy him a bit.

       I can't imagine either, I'm assuming there's something we're missing. But, if you've been through that much, what do you have to lose? He tried to speak out, it was at the wrong time, that wasn't his fault, that took a lot of bravery. NOW is the right time.

       If a bunch of former kid actors who were victimized could 'hold hands and jump together', like a reporter some time ago hoped the Weinstein victims would do, their numbers might protect them from major retaliation.

       My understanding is that the statute of limitations has expired on the abuse, and he would be sued for libel if he named names. But then again, that's probably true of most of the victims. Safety in numbers?

       Yeah, and if he can prove he was actually molested it doesn’t matter if the statute of limitations has run as you can still prove they did it.  People complicate shit.  He’s not doing it because he doesn’t want to go through all the shit again and drag his family through it. That’s it.

       There's some documentary out there about all this, (but I can't remember the name) and it makes more sense after viewing why Feldman has stayed out of it.  What I remember is he wants to name names, but if you can't prove it in court, they will sue him for everything he's worth.  The poor guy can't win either way.

       I saw this quite a while ago and thought OMG if this was said about anyplace other then Hollywood there would be some sort of investigation right? Then you ask yourself.. wait.. why should they get a pass? Then you realize they control everything and how sick of a world we really live in and that these exact people have created a fantasy for us to live in. Its really scary..

       I've met Feldman before. He is damaged af. His main "angel" is a former escort from Kelowna BC who decided to leech onto him.

       This is an interesting though disturbing read here about this kind of thing:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I had a boss who used to work in the entertainment industry, specifically movie production, for a long time. And she once told me privately—in the most matter-of-fact, calm way—that pedophiles were rampant in the industry, and in more moneyed circles in general. And she said the reason for this was, these people had so much—so much fame, money, achievements, everything they wanted—that they became bored and life started to feel “meaningless.” And so they needed…a “new frontier,” if you will. They needed a new challenge. And so they went to sex: “the ultimate frontier,” the place of possibly no borders. And some got into BDSM—which is cool; if it’s consensual who cares?—and so you had like literal heads of state and media conglomerates going to dominatrixes and getting the shit flogged out of them (and one story in particular sticks in my mind, but I’d like to not die so I won’t tell it to you). But some of these people chose to get into having sex with underage persons. Because that was their “ultimate frontier,” ultimate taboo. And some even mixed that up with occulty sort of things, and drugs, and just a whole interrelated tableau of stuff.
       </p>
       <p>
        And what she told me didn’t really surprise me all that much, because I myself have been involved in the entertainment field—albeit largely with its sort of “bastard” younger brother, the comics industry—for almost 20 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        And so I’ll tell you what happens. You get asked by different people in your workplace—it may be your boss, or your boss’s boss, or the head of the company, or a co-worker of a higher rank, or some sort of “celebrity” in your industry—a bunch of “leading questions” to see what you’re “into.” And on the ground-level that’s like, basically, seeing if you will fuck them. And for the purposes of this post: fine. I’m not even going to touch the issue of sexual harassment here, because it is so all-encompassing and a part of the essential matrix of a lot of these places that it’s almost banal to bring up.
       </p>
       <p>
        But then they may ask questions to see if…you take drugs? (maybe you can party with them) What are your feelings on drugs? (will you be a rotten dirty snitch?) And then it can move from there to “feeling out” your attitude to various kinky practices (mind you, we are talking about being in an office with your superiors or bosses having this fucking conversation)…and then…and this has happened to me a couple of times…it gets really really really really fucking creepy.
       </p>
       <p>
        “What do you think about sex tourism?”
       </p>
       <p>
        You are sitting there, and wondering why the fuck you are having this conversation. And then you sort of get to a point where you answer these questions with a weak smile and an “I don’t know” and just feign utter cluelessness and stupidity.
