       They said that he was shooting a sniper rifle out of the guest room window at the fuel tanks. Only problem is that they had to breach the locked guest door with explosives(as heard in audio tapes), and he didn't even need to switch windows to shoot the tanks (you want proof of that? look up mandalay bay hotel and look for yourself). He had a great angle to shoot the tanks from either window. They couldn't explain the second window with their narrative, and they literally used the same story that anti-conspiracy shills on here were spouting. Proof that the fuel tank story is bullshit is there if you know anything about how that fuel works and burns. The fuel in that storage tank burns VERY similar to diesel, and only with a sustained fire and a BLEVE explosion can a tank even explode with any force. A BLEVE explosion is what happens when a boiling liquid forces an explosion due to increased pressure and heat. This literally couldn't take place due to a sniper's incendiary fire. The bullet, regardless of it being incendiary or not, would not have been able to create the extended heat required for the fuel to ignite and explode. Paddock would have researched this and knew that, especially if he was the one who shot the fuel tanks. Couple this fact with the story that the LVPD released, which says that incendiary rounds were found, holes were patched, and the situation was cleared by the FBI. Notice
       <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/10/us/las-vegas-shooter-incendiary-rounds/index.html">
        this
       </a>
       article shows a source that isn't named, give information about his fuel tank shooting.
       <strong>
        They even say the company that owns the tanks wasn't available for comments.
       </strong>
       You know why? Because it didn't happen. They are deliberately preying on uninformed individuals who don't know anything about that attack except that "a bad guy shot a lot of people". People see explosions in movies and equate that to real life, and without knowledge or research(like I've done), they can easily fool the masses. Let me make this abundantly clear:
       <strong>
        They (LVPD, FBI) know bullets cannot trigger a fuel tank explosion.
       </strong>
       The only problem is the majority of people glance at the article or only read the title, and automatically assume he did these things, because he was already committing such horrifying acts. People just neglect the facts and topple that story on the list of the their preconceptions about the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: No proof the tanks were shot, "FBI cleaned the scene and patched holes immediately", also airplane fuel tanks don't explode due to incendiary fire. This isn't a Michael Bay movie.

       Seriously, what the fuck is the deal? the one clear discussion I'm having with a redditor is someone that I recognize and have commented to before. No one else has commented. I noticed a few days ago, before the fuel tank story, that people were saying the second window was for the fuel tanks. He didn't even need the second window to hit the fuel tanks. That's a shitty assumption.

       Is your point that Paddock didn't shoot the tanks or that
       <em>
        no one
       </em>
       did? I mean, a lot of people think the car full of explosives was supposed to blow up the tank and whoever was supposed to complete that part of the op fell through for some reason.

       Well, both. I don't think Paddock would have shot them, because he would have done research (imo). I also think that no one shot them, because the owner of the tanks didn't comment, only an FBI proxy did. Reeks of bullshit, especially because most people read "he shot at fuel tanks" and just add that to the preconceptions they have about the shooting.

       I don't think they uncovered anything. I think they were involved directly. Notice the FBI agent appears when the LVPD cops begin releasing info. He's been behind the cop EVERY time.

       Well, I still think the tanks were supposed to blow. The explosives in the car are better evidence to me than the fuel tank folks not having a comment to make. One doesn't exclude the other.

       Campos was there, the maintenance guy was there, and there is no indication Paddock left his room. Also, forget about the locked side door. Whether or not it was locked doesn't matter, because he had a clear line of sight from his suite.

       That's not speculation, that's fact. You're telling me Paddock purchased the guest room just to shoot out of it? Let's assume that's true, and he did. He would only purchase the damn room if he didn't have a clear shot out of his suite. Which he did. That's not speculation.

       the fact is that anyone experienced with the fuel tanks he was shooting at would know that it couldn't be a target. It wouldn't have exploded after the incendiary fire. This is a perfect opportunity for them to explain the second window without controversy, while also creating more panic around "what could have happened". People glance over the title and now hate Paddock even more for "trying to shoot and explode tanks", when there's no actual proof he shot them. You could say he didn't know the tanks would explode, but I reckon that isn't the case, since conveniently the news story doesn't include a source from the tank's owner. That,
       <strong>
        to me
       </strong>
       , sounds like the tanks weren't even shot.

       Well first of all I don't believe Paddock's window was broken during the shooting. I had a popular post on here about a week back showing that Paddock's window wasn't broken during the shooting,  the guest room's was though. I think they're using the fuel tank story to give a reason for the guest room window.

       to be honest i thought i could see discoloring on that part of the window in his room. not as big a hole as we see in later photos, but enough for me to consider the no-hole claim to be inconclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       anyway... so youre saying you think all the shooting was done from the guest room?

       yes, also have you seen the photo of the broken window? Paddock wouldn't have been able to shoot on a stand out the window, and I don't think he would have laid down either. There were two large shards of hanging glass covering half of the window. He didn't have the weapon that could have been used imo, the fire rate was too exactly 10/sec to be bump-stock fire(imo, again).

       Ok, I see the flash, but let me just play devil's advocate for a second. What type of gun is that? And what time frame did this happen? Let me find the video of the pistol shots, and I'm going to compare the length of time inbetween shots to see if that shot was a pistol.

       It was about 10 seconds between the bus stop pistol shots I think? I swear I've seen a video that shows 2 flashes and the gap is more like 5 seconds, but I cant be 100%

        this

        this

       video. Go to :20 on the TMZ video and 2:16 on the other one. They have the same burst happening, and it's exactly 1 minute: 10 seconds before the muzzle flash. I think it's a pistol shot breaking the window.

       38 seconds from the end of automatic fire to the first single shot in the bus stop vid. 45 seconds in the tmz vid. tmz vid appears to be 4 shots. bus stop appears to be 2. but hey, if his pistol held 6 shots then we know where they all went...

       just in case its of relevance to the angle youre taking.... the maintenance guy said that he was 1/3 down the hall and couldnt see anyone because the rooms are set back a foot from the hall, then campos popped out from the side. the suite was at the end of the hall, the guest room is the one set back. that means campos was at the suite door investigating drilling sounds, but the bullets came from the suite door. if he was at the suite door then when was the camera set up because the service trolley was right in front of the door.

       not sure if any of that is relevant, just some observations.

       Why would he lock the door and go into the hall when he could go through the door and then lock it? Presumably after he started shooting and Campos was still limping around the floor. And how does he benefit from being on the wrong side of a locked door in the middle of shooting at a crowd of people 500 yards away?

       apparently the door had to be locked from the inside. i dont know if thats true. i also dont know what type of lock it is. its possible he covered spring bolts with tape and pulled the tape off from his side of the room

       Right, so locking it from the other side won't slow anyone down on that side. It just prevents him from going back into the second room.
      </p>
      <p>
       And remember that security and maintenance are shot at from the suite and there's no report of Paddock exiting at any point. That would mean that Paddock broke the window in the second room, locked the connecting door and went back to the suite though the hall before ever firing a shot. Which would mean no shots were fired from the second room or there was someone else in there.

       yep, im not saying it makes sense, just pointing out that what was being said could not be taken as a fact.

      <p>
       i dont think they were clear on where they were shot at from. the maintenance guy just said the end of the hall and he wasnt sure which room? being unsure of which room suggests it wasnt the suit door, there would be no confusion, one of the doors to the side would make it difficult to tell exactly which one it was if he was at the other end of the hall.

       remember the service cart was in front of that door with the camera on it, the police were there at 12 mins or so, the stairwell was was barricaded.

       maybe the connecting door wasnt even locked...

       Maintenance said he was 1/3 down the hall when campos popped out to take cover and he felt bullets behind him. Only door with an angle for that is at the end of the hall to enter the main suite.
      </p>
      <p>
       Connecting door may not have been locked, may have been screwed shut so definitely need to allow for that, I just keep hearing it was locked from the other side and that doesn't fit the new official timeline at all.

       I don't think breaching a door necessarily means it's locked. It's also a way to circumvent boobytraps and push back anyone who might be on the other side of that door.

       What? Now you're stretching the story, to be honest. If you really want to talk about something suspicious it's the fact that explosion audio can be found on the police scanner, but not on the door they breached. This is because they've changed the story multiple times, from "a key card" to "SWAT" to "group of 4 random cops".

       What? How am I stretching anything? You're saying there's only one possible reason they'd breach the door, and I'm telling you that's false. There are multiple reasons to breach a door, locked or unlocked. It may have been locked, but since not one person who was there has explicitly stated that the door was locked, you're merely speculating. Unless you can tell me where on the audio it says "there's a locked door in here, we have to breach," it is 100% NOT fact that the connecting door was locked.

       Ok, let's stop the speculation here because I don't think either of us can prove one way or the other. That still doesn't answer why he has a perfect angle already to shoot the tanks? He didn't need the second room. Do you remember when this first happened? People on here were talking about how he might have been aiming for the fuel tanks out of the second window. That was before the story broke that the fuel tanks were shot. Now, they changed their story to corroborate that of complete speculation a few days ago. Why? Because that's the only story they can broadcast without shattering the narrative. Seriously, can you think of another reason  Paddock needed the guest room? He had 10+ windows in his suite, half of which could hit all the people and the fuel tanks.

       How does having tannerite in his car "add to hate of Paddock?" He killed 58 people. I think there's plenty of hate to spare for the man.
      </p>
      <p>
       And sure, the whole situation is fucky, but we also don't have any, proof that he DIDN'T do it at this point. I mean I don't think he acted alone (guard? maintenance guy? four seasons / Saudis) and I think that the CIA and/or FBI are involved, but those are just guesses.

       Ok. The fuel tanks. I believe thats what the tannerite was in his car for. Someone was supposed to drive it into the tanks, he shoots or detontes tannerite explosion and ignites the fuel tanks.
