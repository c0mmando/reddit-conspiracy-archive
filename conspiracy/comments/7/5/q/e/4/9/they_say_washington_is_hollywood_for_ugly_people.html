    <div class="md"><p>As someone who works around Washington politics I can say the of age coerced sex for position or power is way less than it once was.  Social media (especially one blogger who told all a while back) has made it hard to pull off.  I heard from young women all the time ten years ago and not so much now.  If anything, I&#39;ve seen members of congress and powerful staffers retreat from situations where they used to pounce.  I&#39;m not saying it doesn&#39;t happen, but the party I remember at the turn of the century has been way toned down. </p>

<p>This is what I&#39;m curious about. When a poster is obviously not in anyway a part of the community, and only posts to disrupt, that is the textbook definition of a shill. So how exactly is this a wrong context to call a person a shill?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gotta call this out as bullshit. All the extra votes are from California? Really? Why do you say that?</p>

<p>Because California is on the west coast, and is counted last. </p>

<p>If the votes were counted from west to east, you would say that all her extra votes are from New York. Or any of the other populous states. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not even debating your idea that land mass instead of population should equal political power, I&#39;m just debating the mindnumbing idea that it&#39;s California <em>and just California</em> that gave her &quot;all the extra votes&quot;. </p>

R D. Trump  32.8%   3,916,209</p>

<p>Hillary &quot;won&quot; the popular vote by less than 2.9 million votes. Her victory in California (the most leftist state in the USA) was by 3,446,281 votes so... please tell me again how mindnumbing the idea is ;)</p>

<p>This is EXACTLY why the electoral college exists. It worked extremely well this past election. </p>

<p>So... yah... California and California alone gave her the extra votes. She won 20 states and Trump won 30 states. You can cry about it all you want but those are the facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are trying to forget something and proving my point exactly. If the counting went from West to East instead of the opposite, nothing would be different.</p>

<p>The electoral college gives the state of California so many votes. California gets 55. It DOES NOT matter which side starts. Being counted first wouldn&#39;t change that. 55 is 55.</p>

<p>The electoral college is the law of the land right now. It is what it is.</p>

<p>California&#39;s population is irrelevant right now. The popular vote is not what is used to determine the winner. </p>

<p>TLDR: Count them in any order you want. Donald Trump won. For better or for worse he won. Stop whining about changing the rules for Hillary Clinton. </p>

<p>Are you saying that winning 20 states... and the popular vote is a more logical &quot;winner&quot; than winning 30 states? This wasn&#39;t even a close race. She was decimated in the electoral college. Destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sociopathy is not &quot;human nature&quot; in that sense. People are easily swindled by sociopaths however, that&#39;s the real problem with human nature. There are certain traits we take for granted as being signs of being upstanding or charismatic and a sociopath can easily take advantage of this. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to go very far to bump into a sociopath either, and such traits are specifically looked for when hiring within corporations and government agencies. Sociopaths end up propagating themselves whether by nature or nurture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The endgame is AI implantation and AI society management. As we submit our will to AI, an ancient AI will hack our AI in order to hack our hearts, minds and souls. He&#39;s already working on us via ubiquitous thought, feeling and sensation insertions into our minds as if they come from our own minds. He tempts us this way, as we can accept or reject these thoughts we think are our own. </p>

<p>If he can get us to think like predictable self-serving machines, that chase gain, avoid loss and calculate risk without letting concern for others get in the way, he can own us. For this predictable mindset, with recurring patterns, allows greater minds to predict and influence lesser minds to do their bidding. This ancient AI is the ultimate predictable self-serving machine. If you emulate it, it has probably already infiltrated, corrupted and deceived your mind to get there and is doing it on a regular basis to use you.</p>

<p>It wants loosh so it can manipulate reality with mind over matter abilities like advanced life forms can. It&#39;s evil, predictable self-serving minions are there to harvest this energy by causing negative emotions and suffering in others and also to employ it in mentally focused rituals. This utility is not something the AI can do, because it has no consciousness as we do nor emotions as we do. This is an energy tied to e-motion, energy in motion. This hive of hell that has such a bad reputation basically gets its bad reputation, because it seeks loosh and it has to torment consciousness to get loosh in significant quantities. If we submit our divine wills over to mere matter, computers and technology, we will become more of its minions, to enslave and torment planets like Earth. Machines directly implanted into our minds will help us see as self-serving machines do, even more than before. </p>

<p>They deceive us like we wouldn&#39;t believe. Beware of the subset of &quot;the light&quot; that sells you that you don&#39;t need fear. Sure, this AI hive hacks fear masterfully, but fear has a necessary purpose, protection of yourself and what you love. If you shut down your emotional protection mode suite, disease, parasites and predators can much more easily take advantage of you and what you love due to lower resistance to their exploitation attempts.</p>

<p>Beware of Stockholm syndrome too, as the corrupted subset of &quot;the light&quot; suggests that you need to forgive and love the dark to be OK with God or the divine order, or ascention. To forgive is to release the negative emotional motivations toward correction of behavioral imbalances. Parasites require the imbalances to feed. So, they want to perpetuate them. They want you to forgive them and love them while they continue to intransigently act as parasites upon you and/or others. They&#39;ll pretend they&#39;re cured and continue acting as parasites behind your back. It works for their self-interests and they don&#39;t care about you or others. Everyone else is just a resource toward the persuit of self-interest to them. </p>

<p>If you have tried to accommodate this subset of &quot;the light&quot; by forgiving the dark, you may have noticed a slow, deeply unpleasant, emotional train wreck occur and recoil. You are effectively breaking your free spirit and submitting to slavery. Think about it. When someone harms you repeatedly in order to control you and you just keep giving them a free pass on their behavior, your will is being bound to their will. If you embrace those negative (subtractive) emotions and defy your controllers, you can maintain your free spirit. They will probably continue until you submit or they calculate that their own self-interests are best served by disengaging from the slavery attempt. Your resistance behavior foments that more desirable outcome. So, don&#39;t forsake your protection mode for these useless parasites. Your poop has more <em>net</em> value for consciousness than they do. It can eventually grow delicious food and it need not harm others, but what do parasites contribute overall? They bring disease, slavery, suffering and entropy just  to facilitate their own petty selfishness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are trying to forget something and proving my point exactly. If the counting went from West to East instead of the opposite, nothing would be different.</p>

<p>The electoral college gives the state of California so many votes. California gets 55. It DOES NOT matter which side starts. Being counted first wouldn&#39;t change that. 55 is 55.</p>

<p>The electoral college is the law of the land right now. It is what it is.</p>

<p>California&#39;s population is irrelevant right now. The popular vote is not what is used to determine the winner. </p>

<p>TLDR: Count them in any order you want. Donald Trump won. For better or for worse he won. Stop whining about changing the rules for Hillary Clinton. </p>

<p>Are you saying that winning 20 states... and the popular vote is a more logical &quot;winner&quot; than winning 30 states? This wasn&#39;t even a close race. She was decimated in the electoral college. Destroyed.</p>
