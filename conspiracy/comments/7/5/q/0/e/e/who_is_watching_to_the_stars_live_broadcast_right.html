       I wasn't expecting confirmation on that level and in the open. They're even offering to release serious business military video footage which is exciting.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is part of why I suspect the people saying this is part of an intentional plan to control the release of information regarding this stuff so as to direct the development of public perception might be on to something.

       They want people to invest, but that doesn't take away from what these former high level government officials are saying. Lou Allesandro (sp) just confirmed that advanced aerial phenomena are real, and he knows this because he worked on projects identifying them in a covert op in the DoD. He even said they're releasing government level footage.

       Yeah but I really think if they want people to give them money on something like this, they are going to need to provide a little more proof of concept in order to peek peoples interest. So you are saying it's real? Okay cool how do I know you aren't just saying that to get money? Show me proof that all this is possible and maybe, just maybe, I'll invest.

       I totally agree with you there. They said they had and were going to release government-level high quality UFO footage, so lets see it. I'm not planning on putting any money into it at all until I'm convinced it's legit. I'm just impressed with the credentials they seem to have, I would say if anyone had proof it would probably be the former Director of Programs to investigate Unidentified Aerial Threats for the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely they understand that if they provide proof, they'll get waaaay more money. I say if they don't release anything soon, its bogus.

       It does seem kinda weird, but the credentials of the people involved here (except Tom) are pretty awesome. I don't know how to verify them though.

       Im keeping an open mind about it, some of the people seem legit on the surface but Im not holding my breath for anything amazing. Also the fact that John Molesta was hyping the whole thing up doesn't mak it any better either.

       He's been a UFO nut for forever though, the wikileaks emails are legit. I think he's just using what "celebrity pull" he might have for this.

       This blink 182 moron is at best an unwitting stooge, at worst just another UFO huckster like Greer trying to make money in the field.

       None of the Podesta UFO emails had jack shit in them other than shoddy YouTube tier info. The real info is compartmentalized to an absolute extreme and NOT handled by the greedy elected stooges that spend temporary terms in office.

       I agree with you. It crossed my mind, if shot's aren't fired how do we know if its real. Then if shots are fired, how do we know it's real. I see what you're saying, I smell an agenda. Say this does get big, imagine a bunch of people being alerted to something going down (could be fake) but big enough to be an distraction to other things happening. This could be a platform for distractions.
