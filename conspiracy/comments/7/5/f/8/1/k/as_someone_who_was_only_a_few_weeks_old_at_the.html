       i do not know if it matters but we never used any real data info net to gather if the news on the crisis at waco was going as the news radio suggested...but what we do now know is the use of the new FLIR video cameras in helicopters aided the case of the govt about the flames and their origin...etc...however when the phoenix arizona giant ufo was crossing the state at a rather slow speed...there were no FLIR camera recordings of the object ever seen by the public...when we know now that equipment was present for use by local Arizona agencies as well as the USAF...so it was a massive coverup of an et event....and the lack of data was a mandatory thing...all FLIR recordings were collected and never released to the public....over and out.

       It all started for me with Ruby Ridge because it's in my backyard. By the time Waco happened I had moved to Utah and it became pretty clear that political and religious pockets of many communities felt they were being
       <em>
        cornered or targeted
       </em>
       . Much of the Constitutional buzz really became more pronounced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because Bo Gritz helped to temper some of the storm at Ruby Ridge the media and local politicians here didn't stand a chance to snowball it very well. In Waco there was also a certain Sheriff that stood up and called horseshit on the bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the time OKC happened the media and head spin doctors got much better at
       <strong>
        telling people what they were seeing
       </strong>
       . Never mind that Yakey hero (who really was a damned hero!) cuz he suicided himself in handcuffs. There was also Trentadue murdered in custody because they needed a patsy for the john doe bomber that the FEDS had to let slip away.
      </p>

       The media have become well trained slavering dawgs on steroids.

       Being as this and OKC transpired long before the internet dominated our lives, thoughts were mostly self-contained. We were younger, more naive and when things didn't add up, we questioned them (in solitude). Most people were fully asleep back then and those that knew didn't have outlets (so they suffered in isolation). 9/11 literally changed everything and came at time when technology made it possible to substantially collect and share information. It was also the most blatant example of deception to occur, hence it woke a fuck ton of people up and permanently out of their comfort zone.
