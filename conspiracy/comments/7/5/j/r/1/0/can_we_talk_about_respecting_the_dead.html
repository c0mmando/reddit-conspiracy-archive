But please remember to respect the dead. I remember when sandy hook first happened a lot of people started hounding the survivors and their families and anyone who provided evidence contradicting their theories instead of being open to debate. It&#39;s disgusting, and embarrassing. Maybe the mafia did it or it had to do with the government but <em>children were murdered in cold blood</em>. It&#39;s been about a week since Vegas, and this is normally when things start getting heated. Just remember, innocent people were mowed down over 15 minutes of constant gunfire. Their memory should be respected. Just, please be mature.</p>

<p>EDIT: I accept my downvotes for trying to convince people to not bully others for having to watch their loved ones die.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah. Yeah, I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any video of when the shooting started. Still, people died. A lot of people act like nothing happened in here mass shootings., but these people have never physically gone to where these shootings took place and their evidence is based on things found online. They ask for evidence and instantly discredit anything brought before them without a shadow of a doubt that they can&#39;t be wrong. I&#39;m pretty sure no one who discredits sandy hook has gone to the community.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think sandyhook was BS. The whole event screamed staged and crisis actors were prevelant. People don&#39;t want to question the narrative because it was kids. They originally said Lanza used a Bushmaster AR-15, which they later found in the trunk of the car. But in actuality the he used pistols. Or at least he was found with only pistols on him. </p>

<p>I totally believe people died in the pentagon as well as the towers. Are you saying they found bodies of passengers or pentagon employees?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t we see any plane debris? why is the lawn perfect? How could a person who only flew prop planes fly their first ever commercial jet at tree top level in the most restricted air space in the country to pin point hit the pentagon without making a scratch?</p>

<p>Just watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzFqXbfv_yg">this</a> and tell me if you see a plane.</p>

Second, commercial planes are only hard to take off and land. Actually maintaining flight is literally just the push of a button. The hijackers never had to take off, and only needed to know how to control the plane in midair. And you can believe whatever you want about sandy hook, but real people died.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When people are CONVINCED beyond all reason (and by that I mean there is literally no evidence that could convince them otherwise) then they are not going to hear you - to them it&#39;s not even up for debate whether anyone died or not, it&#39;s not a question of erring on the side of caution and respecting people in case their loved ones did die, to them it is 100% certainty that these people are lying and deserve no respect.</p>

<p>it&#39;s a huge shame, because these people really harm the truth and prevent others from &#39;waking up&#39; to the realities of our situation. I&#39;ve seen people demanding evidence and photos and footage of dead bodies, and when it&#39;s provided to them they just say &#39;nah it&#39;s fake.&#39; It&#39;s the complete opposite of being objective and critically thinking. That said, I was very surprised when I finally looked at the Sandy Hook evidence to see exactly what people were talking about, and all the extremely strange things that indeed were very off and did make it seem like it was a hoax. </p>

<p>I had initially responded VERY dismissively to those claiming Sandy Hook was faked, I thought it was insane and just went pffft and shook my head and dismissed it as crazy. But I hadn&#39;t actually looked at the evidence, I&#39;d done the very unobjective, prejudiced thing and made assumptions, not based on evidence, but based on my preconceptions about what I thought people would or would not do, what people could or could not get away with etc.</p>

<p>So I think the important things are 1. ALWAYS look at the evidence. If a bunch of people are emphatically telling you something, before you dismiss it because it sounds crazy, at least have a look at what they&#39;re saying and why they think that, and what the evidence is. That goes for people who think Vegas is fake and also for those who think it&#39;s not fake. Don&#39;t ask for video evidence and then dismiss that evidence when it&#39;s provided to you, without good reason. Don&#39;t assume that because something sounds utterly insane and beyond reason to you, that it isn&#39;t true and that you don&#39;t even need to look at the evidence to come to that conclusion. 2. Think about the big picture - if your goal in telling people one of these things is a hoax is to &#39;wake people up&#39; and get them to look at the evidence and see the truth, then put yourself in their shoes and do it gently, don&#39;t go balls to the wall with angrily shouting that no one died it&#39;s all fake, illuminati symbolism, numerology etc, because that will make people INSTANTLY dismiss you and anything you have to say without even looking at the hard facts. And it gives TPTB and the mainstream media an excuse to shut it all down by claiming it&#39;s is disgusting and disrespectful, as indeed it is/would be to harrass people who&#39;ve lost loved ones in a tragedy and tell them that they&#39;re lying about it. The fact is that most people will see it that way, and they&#39;ll be disgusted with you about it and they will never want to associate themselves with you, and therefore by ignoring the reaction of &#39;normies&#39; when trying to expose these things you actually do a great disservice to the whole enterprise of exposing state crimes to the general public.</p>

<p>People have to come to the truth gently in stages. With Sandy Hook, the way I ended up getting over my dismissiveness about the whole hoax theory was seeing someone question it, who seemed to be disbelieving and skeptical about it, but confused about a video they&#39;d seen of a parent laughing just before being interviewed about their kids&#39; death. The fact that that commenter seemed rational and reasonable to me, and wasn&#39;t just getting mad and calling everyone a shill and jus throwing out wild accusations without any links or sources, made me interested in what they had seen, so I ended up clicking on that video, and all you really need is for people to actually look at the evidence because once they do that, it&#39;s very difficult to dismiss it all without question and it&#39;s much easier to see why all these people are saying it was faked, instead of just assuming they must all be delusional.</p>

<p>As for Vegas, I do not believe it was faked. I&#39;ve seen none of the same things that were so weird about Sandy Hook with Vegas. There are videos and images of bodies and injured people. There are multiple witnesses and victims who are themselves questioning the mainstream narrative and saying something is being covered up - I just dont&#39; see why crisis actors would do that, and if they were actors and wanted to expose a cover up then why didn&#39;t they just expose the fact they were hired as actors?</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t for a second put it past these groups/the cabal etc to actually kill innocent people. It makes more sense, is easier to pull off than employing a ton of people any of whom could speak out or get/leak footage proving it was a hoax etc, so why bother with that when they can much more easily and more secretively get someone to kill a bunch of people. It&#39;s not like they have a conscience.</p>

<p>With Sandy Hook, people provided evidence of weird fuckery afoot that was difficult to explain and did point to fakery, although honestly I don&#39;t understand why they&#39;d do that. But with Vegas I haven&#39;t seen any of these hoax proponents providing evidence like that, and I have seen them react in an extremely biased manner to anyone providing opposing evidence, it&#39;s like they&#39;re responding the same as the &#39;sleeping&#39; people but on the opposing view - no objectivity, assumptions and preconceptions before evidence etc.</p>

<p>Anyway this ended up being a long rant, sorry! Just my thoughts on the whole hoax/false flag thing.</p>
