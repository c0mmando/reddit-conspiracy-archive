     How did Campos get away from Paddock?

      <p>
       Is anyone asking how Campos was able to flee from Paddock?
      </p>
      <p>
       We are told that Campos approached Paddock's room, and heard drilling, while noticing that the door to the suite was ajar.  We are told that Campos made entry into the room without knocking. (see the lastest press conference)  Assuming that Paddock was indeed drilling...  What happened from there?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Campos confront Paddock mid task?  Or did Paddock just notice the intruder and go for his gun?  Maybe Paddock noticed Campos on his video display (?) and was able to confront Campos at the door to the suite...
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, we know that Paddock shot Campos... So, with a round in his leg, how was Campos able to flee from Paddock all the way back to the elevators.  And we are told that is where he awaited help from another security agent.  Wouldn't it have been priority-one to get the hell off of that floor?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a long straight hallway, all the way back to the elevators...  There's no way Campos could have made that journey, wounded, with Paddock right behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are also told that Paddock had not yet started his shooting spree at this time.  So, before go-time, a fly appears in the ointment, and Paddock is just going to allow him to flee and call for help?  At that moment the mission becomes, "Dump as many clips as I can and then kill myself?"
      </p>
      <p>
       And then... Campos is on scene five-some minutes before automatic fire takes place, and it still takes 72 minutes for an effective response?
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind, the original story states that Campos was shot through the door, and then the hallway was strafed with more than 200 rounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Campos is supposed to be our "hero figure" along with the black kid that got shot in the neck (shoulder, arm? Either way, he ain't pulling that white T-shirt over his head and going on CNN two days later...)  Both of these dudes share the, "the bullet is still lodged within them..." bullshit.  To me, both of these dudes represent weak links in the chain of their storyline.

       What if campos shot himself in the leg after shooting Paddock and the crowd? Maybe that's why there is 6 minutes between Campos entry and the shooting starts. 
What do we know about Campos? What's his background?
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know that Paddock shot Campos. We don't know that Paddock shot the crowd, do we? We don't even know if Paddock shot himself.

       I've always believed Campos shot himself and not Paddock. I think the two pistol shots could be a multitude of things:
       <br/>
       1. woman in video says she hears glass fall, so maybe 1 shot to paddock and 1 to the window?
       <br/>
       2. 2 shots to paddock from Campos
       <br/>
       3. 1 shot to paddock and 1 shot to campos's leg, from Campos.

        An open door
        <strong>
         a few rooms away
        </strong>
        from the Las Vegas suite of the man who was gunning down concertgoers at a music festival
        <strong>
         set off an alarm that prompted a response from a security guard
        </strong>
        , Clark County Undersheriff Kevin C. McMahill said Friday.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <strong>
         alarm from a room "a number of doors down" from Paddock's likely was a coincidence
        </strong>
        , McMahill told CNN's "The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."
        <strong>
         The door was not forced open, had been open for a while, and Paddock didn't have the keys to that room
        </strong>
        . McMahill said that door either had been left open or didn't shut completely.

       "According to the latest stunning revelation by Sheriff Lombardo, security guard Campos was responding to a door alarm notification, presumably from a fire exit door being opened by suspect Paddock on the 32nd floor.  Upon reaching the floor, Campos noticed the hotel room suite door was ajar, and heard the sound of drilling (he didn’t knock)."
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen to this, even:
       <a href="https://youtu.be/GL4MT39M8vY?t=10m35s">
        https://youtu.be/GL4MT39M8vY?t=10m35s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The sheriff specifically says, "...another open door. Not the suspects open door."  Meaning, the suspects door was open.  The door alarm was for another door, but the suspect's door was definitely ajar.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's even a question that has come up here previously... "Aren't most hotel doors spring loaded to close automatically?"

       Curious the source supposes it was fire exit door. Some hotels have centralized building management systems including door and occupancy sensors, ostensibly for better managing hvac system performance.

       I see the outcome if he knocked on that door before the shooting,
      </p>
      <p>
       he would have made one shot and made sure it was the only one needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no way he spooks shoots the security guard once, and then continues doing what he did. He would have fled as soon as it was compromised.  No way he would let a loose end flee down a straight hall way to wait at the elevator continuing to do what he did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Campos helped take the guns. Why have we not had an interview with him? Oh probably because he is in his luxury home bought with Saudi money to help load the room and get shot.

       This is a good point.  If Paddock was safely locked in his room and hadn't opened fire yet, why was Campos even a threat?  Why would Paddock jeopardize the entire operation by shooting at Campos, if Campos didn't even knock?

       Paddock's door was not ajar, another door was ajar, which is why Campos came up to that floor.  He hears drilling and starts toward Paddock's room.  Paddock shoots through door, hitting Campos who retreats to the elevators.  Paddock, presumably spooked, takes a few minutes to break the windows, load his guns and start shooting (earlier than planned, perhaps).  He had accepted that dying during this rampage was a likely possibility.  He's come this far, he's not giving up on his plan.  He knows he's fucked if he gives up, he's fucked if he doesn't.  If he gives up his plan and escapes, they know who he is, they'll just come for him.  So, he decides to continue with the rampage and die when police get there.  After ten minutes of shooting, it's time to die so he shoots himself.  Maybe he thought police were closing in.  Maybe he decided that was that.   Maybe he was out of bullets.

       "According to the latest stunning revelation by Sheriff Lombardo, security guard Campos was responding to a door alarm notification, presumably from a fire exit door being opened by suspect Paddock on the 32nd floor. Upon reaching the floor, Campos noticed the hotel room suite door was ajar, and heard the sound of drilling (he didn’t knock)."

      <p>
       The sheriff specifically says, "...another open door. Not the suspects open door." Meaning, the suspects door was open. The door alarm was for another door, but the suspect's door was definitely ajar.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's even a question that has come up here previously... "Aren't most hotel doors spring loaded to close automatically?"

       That could
       <em>
        easily

       be a way of poorly phrasing "...another door was open, it wasn't Paddock's door that was open."
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, ALL hotel doors are spring loaded.  And, the alarms are precisely for that; because when they don't close all the way as they should, there could be some kind of problem.

       I don't buy the poor phrasing... The SHERIFF in a very critical press conference was being very explicit.  He was differentiating the open door alarm from Paddock's open door, very clearly.

       Actually, this is more what I would expect.  I get skeezed out by those people who are out grandstanding the day after their tragedy.  If anything of the like ever happened to me, the news is just going to have to fuck all the way off.  I'm not interested in talking to them...

       Campos shot him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Campos lied to the police and told them he was shot at the end trying to stop Paddock. But then that story unwound because another employee placed Campos up at the scene before the massacre started.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Campos is the lookout for the assassin team.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the operation is blown by oncoming cops, who are diverted to 31 to buy time for the shooter team to escape, Campos walks in and kills a drugged out Paddock in the head, then shoots himself in the leg.
      </p>
      <p>
       Campos goes down the firestairs to 31 and tells the cops he's been shot trying to get into the room to stop the rampage.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would be all clean but the fact that the maintance worker came forward and said he saw Campos up there before the massacre blew his story that he first came upon the scene after and saved the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Campos had to change and say oh yeah I forgot, I was up there looking for a "door ajar" alarm and then I heard something in Paddocks room and then he just shot me with 200 bullets and lucky for me only 1 hit me kind of in the leg.

       Looking at the photos of the hall outside his door, among many other inconsistencies, wouldn’t there be a blood trail from where Campos was shot in the leg by a 7.62 or .223 round?? The answer is yes. But there’s not
