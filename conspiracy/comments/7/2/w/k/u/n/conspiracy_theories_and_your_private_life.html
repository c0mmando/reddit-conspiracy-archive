<p>I&#39;ve seen a bunch of false sky reports on r/conspiracy in the last few weeks. But, I can&#39;t comment, because it&#39;s consistently cloudy on a daily basis where I live - so I don&#39;t get to see the sky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has caused me problems. People hate when you challenge their beliefs and infer or show that they have been fooled. 
&quot;It&#39;s easier to fool someone than to convince them they have been fooled&quot;. 
I try to not even challenge the bubble of disinformation that people   say ,I just ask leading questions about what they are claiming as fact. If they ask my opinion, I volunteer another view and have my sources to give them.
At this point they usually say either &quot;Bullsh1t&quot; or &quot;lets talk about something else&quot;. 
My heart tells me to inform people about the lies around us but this is not an easy road in my experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got no fight with my mom, I suppose I was throwing too much at her once. My fault. I recently started shaving my head because I&#39;m losing hair and she asked me if I was part of a white only militia. No you dumb bitch. It can be a struggle sharing this shit with certain people. Sandy Hook for example, nobody wants to hear about a bunch of dead kids. They made these topics taboo and uncomfortable to talk about. At the end of the documentary, September 11th A New Pearl Harbor, the director challenges us to do something about it. So I&#39;m going to be more open and hopefully I can convince people on an individual level. I&#39;ll start with the more obvious and well-researched lie about the World Trade Centers.</p>

<p>We know what we learn with our own two hands and what others tell us. And what others tell us should always be suspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since they voiced their opinion on a questionable subject in the main stream (conspiracy theories) to people within their social circle (coworkers, friends, family, significant others) they lost their sense of respect in the eyes of those people in their social circle.</p>

<p>example: &quot;This person believes in conspiracy theories?  The government, the news, and society tells me that kind of thinking is for crazy and stupid people with poor judgement.  I&#39;m going to treat this person different negatively because of this.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was talking to my friend who is italian about idea of &quot;the elite&quot; and in particular their father who is extremely rich. </p>

<p>I never thought for a moment that they would engage this conversation as they are skeptical generally.</p>

<p>They were fully switched on.</p>

<p>They agreed that there was an upper echelon that no one can reach unless they were rich AND nasty. Their father never got there because he had a conscience, he would actually care about people and do things ro help people worse off. </p>

<p>This conversation made me believe that people are generally good. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dated a guy that would practically regurgitate Joe Rogan or some white, male comedians, but when I wanted to talk about anything further than corporate corruption or social engineering, he&#39;d raise his eyebrows in this smug way. I finally broke it off, because I saw him for what he was, a consumer of pop culture and content that reinforced his entitlement, but not someone willing make individual sacrifices or seek alternative means to improving life for himself, his community or the world. He will die content on UFC, nicotine and Keebler. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, my friends and family find it pretty endearing.  By all accounts, I&#39;m considered a &quot;normie&quot; (just learned that term here today!)  I&#39;m pretty smart, successful-ish and mainstream - but I like to drop in conspiratorial references on occasion and it always takes people aback.  But since I honestly don&#39;t give a shit what other people believe, and I&#39;m happy to share my opinions with no pressure, 98% of the people I encounter find it fascinating and want to discuss further to find out what I know and how I came to think the way I do.</p>

<p>I think where so many in the conspiracy community go wrong is they have this sense of urgency to convince others - to shove the red pill down their throat.  I have zero interest in that - I&#39;m happy to share what I know with those interested to perhaps ignite a spark on their end to jump down the conspiracy hole, but I&#39;m also cool being the butt of the joke, too.  As I often tell my friends - if a UFO lands tomorrow and Bigfoot walks out wearing a Masonic ring with an illuminati tattoo on his head, I won&#39;t be a bit surprised.  Y&#39;all on the other hand, will take days to recover from the mind-blowing. 
 Whatever, makes no difference to me.</p>

<p>That said, I&#39;ve had a couple of people look at me like I have two heads or something.  I&#39;m cool with that too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a friend that teaches a lot of autistic and special needs kids. I&#39;ve mentioned that there are problems with vaccines but I&#39;ve avoided going into too much detail because it&#39;s a really complex issue. It isn&#39;t as cut and dry as all vaccines are bad. I&#39;m not an anti-vaxxer. I&#39;m pro-science and anti-state. I don&#39;t believe in the state forcing vaccinations. Especially since vaccine manufacturers are exempt from liability.</p>

<p>She is actually my best friend&#39;s gf which is another reason I try not to get into discussions about this subject with her but she sometimes makes comments to try and goad me into an argument about it. Insinuating that I am an idiot or anti-science or some bullshit.</p>

<p>So the other day there was a news article about a HepA outbreak in San Diego that was spreading to LA and she says, &quot;Maybe they didn&#39;t get vaccinated.&quot; I just rolled my eyes so she goes on Facebook and posts, &quot;I can&#39;t be friends with someone who is anti vaccines and modern medicine. Pretty fucking rude for no reason.</p>

<p>The funny thing is if I ask her if she&#39;s cool with GMO&#39;s putting chemicals in her food she says, &quot;Fuck No!!! No GMO!!&quot;. So she&#39;s only selectively anti-science. She trusts vaccines but doesn&#39;t trust Frankenfood.</p>
