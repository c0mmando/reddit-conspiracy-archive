        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think from memory. In England the Pedo Info Exchange sort to gain mainstream validity &#39;on the back of&#39; homosexuality rights groups tryin to gain more rights. For example to be gay not to be a crime. </p>

<p>Today in some parts of the world transgender groups and others are having similar &#39;movements &#39;  where as the gay lobby is trying to gain legal status in some places - same sex marriage etc. in some cases western nations spending 100smillions of surveys...</p>

<p>Is the pedo lobby trying there tactics again? If you look over human known mainstream sex with the young happened a bit times. My personal view is its wrong and people should righty continue to fight against it. </p>

<p>Pizzag8 I think is real too</p>

<p>Peace </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didnt say pedo stuff wasnt an issue, its an evil crime with no excuse. No one is advocating for &quot;pedo rights&quot; nor is there a &quot;pedo lobby&quot; as commiting those acts by definition involves commiting a crime, as minors can not consent. This is not the same as gay or trans acceptance movements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What we will see is a gradual push to lower the consent age over time. In America, it will drop to 16 most likely, then possibly lower. Either people will have to admit kids are not able to consent to wanting gender changes at young ages, or lower the age of consent for sex to match it. But if the push continues that young kids can be put on hormones to change genders, then the age of consent will be eroded as well, and pedophilia will slowly creep in further. It&#39;s going to be an incredibly slow process, but I&#39;m worried that&#39;s the road we&#39;re going down. </p>

<p>For example, if a 16 year old male wants to be a female and start hormone therapy, then why can&#39;t they legally have sex with a 21 year old? They obviously know their body well enough and are mature enough to handle that change, so why not sex? Those two kind of go hand in hand to me. I hate it, but I&#39;m not sure what can be done to reverse that landslide. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m unaware of any push in the US to lower the age of consent - outside of states with romeo and juliet laws but that&#39;s not a push for adult/child relationships. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t necessarily agree with kids starting hormone therapy at a young age but there&#39;s a massive difference between that and adults fucking kids. The main one being that a 16 year old taking hormones effects one person, the people taking the hormone. A child and an adult involves two, one of which can&#39;t legal consent to a sexual relationship. If the two seem conflated in your mind I question your understanding of consent and the predatory nature of pedophilia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was if a child or teen is deemed mature enough to change genders, they can be deemed mature enough to consent to sex, so that&#39;s where I imagine the push from pedo&#39;s will come from. I&#39;m not actually aware of any efforts to lower consent age here in the stated yet either, I&#39;m just looking forward and making an educated guess. I didn&#39;t make my point very clearly though hahaha. That&#39;s what I get for late night redditing. </p>

<p>1.) What does this have to do with pedophilia?</p>

<p>2.)  Have you been to Mardi Gras or the Brazilian Carnival?  Has nothing to do with LGBT and they celebrate in a very similar way. </p>

<p>Most large celebratory events have what pearl-clutchers would consider &quot;inappropriate behavior&quot;.  Has nothing to do with the LGBT crowd and/or pushing pedophilia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We in the LGBT community have been used as fodder by the powerful for hundreds of years. We are either an easy bogeyman to dangle in front of certain demographics, or we act as a decoy group that the powerful try to use to scapegoat pedophilia. What do I mean by that? Check out this 1950&#39;s &quot;educational&quot; short called <em>Boys Beware</em>: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=17u01_sWjRE">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=17u01_sWjRE</a>. It basically is 10 minutes about how to avoid pedophiles but it keeps saying to &quot;beware the homosexual&quot; and that all homosexuals are pedophiles. </p>

<p>Its frustrating for me to see a lot of seemingly awakened souls recoil at the idea that a gay man can be aware of p-gate. The voat forum dedicated to p-gate research sure seems to think we &quot;fags&quot; are homogenous and we are all BFFs with a DC pizza shop owner whose name rhymes with Fames Falefantis. </p>
