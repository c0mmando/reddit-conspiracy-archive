       On it's face some of the facts don't really hold much water in my opinion.  Let me preference this by saying as a voter who votes based off foreign policy and integrity, I didn't vote of either Hillary or Trump.  I'm just skeptical of this news, and here's some of the issues I see with this story:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) According to FB and the reports I have read,
       <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-we-know-and-dont-know-about-facebook-trump-and-russia/">
        the majority of the propaganda was in 2015
       </a>
       , a full year before the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Why would Trump have Russia pay 100k to manipulate FB in 2015, when he
       <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-election-day/trump-campaign-pays-millions-overseas-big-data-firm-n677321">
        paid UK based Cambridge Analytics $5 million to target voters
       </a>
       ?  Also, does no one have issue with a foreign company influencing our elections?
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The media expects me to believe 100k in FB propaganda from Russia in 2015 had more of an impact than the
       <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?cycle=2016&amp;amp;strID=C00578997">
        $9 million to CTR
       </a>
       and the $5 million from Cambridge Analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) The main reason Hillary didn't win was because
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/technology/facebook-russian-ads.html?mcubz=1">
        she failed in large city's like Detroit, Cleveland, and Milwaukee that were in swing states
       </a>
       .  Was that propaganda in 2015 able to still have an influence on voters in those regions a year later?
      </p>
      <p>
       5) Lastly, I'd be interested in seeing the propaganda that was used.  Does anyone have examples of what was actually pushed, like screen shots so we can take a look?  I have seen it described, but have yet to see the actual posts that were used.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason I question this is because of the new McCarthyism I see everyday.  Like I said I don't like Trump, I think he's no better than Bush or Obama on foreign policy at this point.

       I would imagine they did, but to the extent the red scare made it out to be, I don't think so.  Just like this, I have no doubt Russia may have tried to influence the election in various ways.  If they did, I still don't think they had as big of a influence as everyone is trying to make it out to be.

       You said you have a hard time people are manipulated by Facebook, and peyote posted the same shit I saw on Facebook.  There is no rule A62 or A63 in the rulebook.  It's in the guidelines, not the rules.

       I don't disagree there is propaganda on facebook, propaganda is everywhere imo.  But to say that since there was some form of propaganda on FB, therefore Trump must have had Russia influence the election by pushing propaganda in 2015 doesn't seem to equate to me.

       1) Russia has been honing their information warfare ability since at least 2013. And for it to be effective, it has to be a continuous effort, during non-election years. 
2) Before last week, if you trusted Facebook on this Russia paid $0. This is just the tip of the iceberg. 
3) You seem very confused about how the propaganda campaign works. The $100K was to seed social media. From there, their army of bots and trolls amplified the message.

       Yes, a 100 in seeding propaganda a year prior doesn't seem like it would have that big of an impact.  Have you actually seen the propaganda that was pushed?  It would make things a lot easier to understand if I could see what was pushed.

       That was during 2016, the majority of it took place in 2015.  Also, as much as I hate the term "fake news" it was everywhere in the US media as well.  It's a rampant issue not with just RT &amp; Sputnik, but in all facets of today's journalism.

       This doesn't bother me that much, it happens.  I was a big Thom Hartmann fan and he's on RT.  Hell, RT's line up is pretty good.  They have

        Jesse Ventura, Ed Shultz, Mike Papantonio, Larry King
       </a>
       , so it doesn't bother me when reporters go over to another Russian state news.  I just assume the amount of propaganda I receive here in the states is just as much if not more than I would get from RT or Sputnik.

       Great article and Breitbart is horrible, I completely agree.  In fact I'm more than willing to say fake news as a whole had a large impact in general on this election. Groups like breitbart/infowars and the like all have there hands in this kind of stuff, and on the flip side, you had ton of stories made up about Trump as well. Although I think there are racists who support trump, most of the stories about trump supporters burning churches or attacking people turned out to be faked (maybe not all, but there was a large amount).  Even the story where they reported the Vermont Power grid was taken down by Russian hackers would be an example where I see this red scare tactic being used.  Fake news in the media isn't what I'm arguing, the Russia propaganda through social media and it's influence is what I'm doubting.  Just so we're clear, I'm not a fan of Russia at all, but I'm very skeptical of stories that affect our foreign policy, especially when it was so clear there were so many other influences besides Russian trolls.

       the thing is you dont actually have to be a full on racist to hear this made up stuff then support trumps stance
      </p>
      <p>
       if it was true that refugees were raping and pillaging and high fiving over the deed it would be reasonable to want to protect yourself. The thing is, breitbart types WANT that stuff to be true because it reinforces their preconceived notion that refugees just want to rape and pillage. its fan fiction

       Yes, of course, I agree.  This goes without saying, and if they can find or make up a story that helps them further their narrative they will jump at the chance.  I also feel the same way about the current red scare though.

       Your post goes off the rails as soon as you reach for "muh both sides".
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the news media is on the side of making a profit by selling advertising space to for profit businesses.  Not the side of liberals or right wingers or Republicans or Democrats but of making money by selling advertising space made valuable by drawing an audience.  Not directly targeting at a right wing audience doesn't make a media organization part of the "other side" except in so far as propagandists routinely see the truth and those who tell it as an enemy.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        you had ton of stories made up about Trump as well. Although I think there are racists who support trump, most of the stories about trump supporters burning churches or attacking people turned out to be faked

      <p>
       I don't believe you.  Or by made up do you mean the allegations were real and really made to police but the complainant (not the media) was lying and that some random person lying to police is equivalent to an entire propaganda industry publishing lies to millions of people every day?  Or do you mean real attacks that the media reported which the perpetrator tried to place blame on others for?  Are you trying to say criminals trying to make a crime look like it was committed by someone else is equivalent to an entire propaganda industry spewing out lies to millions of people every day?

       ?  It didn't have to do with his ratings, which were the highest on the station, it's was because he was anti-war.  Advertising and rating aren't everything, especially when it comes to foreign policy.

         There was no “penetration of the U.S. electricity grid.” The truth was undramatic and banal. Burlington Electric, after receiving a Homeland Security notice sent to all U.S. utility companies about the malware code found in the DNC system, searched all its computers and found the code in a single laptop that was not connected to the electric grid.

       Which was perceived as bad for the brand because MSNBC has more concerns than a single hour of television 5 days a week.  You're not making the point you hope to make here - you're just coming across as having never put much thought into the concerns of a content producer who has to produce content and pull an audience for many more hours than a mere one a day on merely 5 days of the week.

       I find arguing by links all too often is the first resort of someone who cannot make an argument so just hopes if they post enough links no one will notice they don't actually support what they're trying to say, but I'll give you enough benefit of the doubt to try the first one....
      </p>
      <p>
       And you didn't deserve that benefit because the first link is an instance of a "real attack that the media reported which the perpetrator tried to place blame on others for" exactly as I suspected and suggested in my earlier post.  I don't accept this is a competency thing.  No one is so stupid they cannot distinguish between the media not doing their job honestly or competently and the media not solving a crime between when they become aware of the police reports and getting the story published.  You are arguing in bad faith.  No one is so stupid they actually think the media is at fault for a criminal's attempts to frame others for their crime.  That's just fucking absurd.

      <p>
       And determining that is the job of those responsible for that and it's not the media.  Equally, issuing public statements on behalf of the entity responsible for monitoring access to the electricity is not the media's job.  Their job is to report on such statements.  You are trying to make a case that because some officials involved with the electricity grid don't know what the fuck they're talking about, therefore "something something media" which is absurd and frankly too stupid for me to believe an honest mistake is being made.  When someone makes a public statement, they're responsible for the content of that statement, not whoever reports that they said it.  This is taking shooting the messenger far too far for me to believe you really believe what you're what arguing.  Stretching doesn't even come into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And again, the equivalency you're trying to make is to someone literally and knowingly making up lies and publishing them as news.  That's beyond pathetic.

       Yes, really and if it were really otherwise why present these pathetic arguments that attempt to make that point by equating literally knowingly making up lies and publishing them as news with accurately reporting the police's currently publicly released information about unsolved crimes that the perpetrator was later found to have tried to pin on someone else?  There are not enough words for how fucking absurd it is to try to pretend those two things are remotely equivalent.  One of them is willfully dishonest and malicious and the other is honestly going about the job the way it's supposed to be done.   Seems you don't know where to look to find any actual substance for your argument either.

       You may want to look up journalism ethics and standards.  Click bate titles and the corporate interests that push specific perspectives and narratives is the death of journalism.  It's prevalent in the majority of the industry, hence them being the same in my eyes.  It's why I'm skeptical of this push to argue that Russia running propaganda on FB in 2015 doesn't make a lot sense.

       something about algorithms out there  that favored showing particular stuff to particular people, leading to people in power making a lot of money on ad money, leading to trump winning.

       Of course, there was an election, there was also tons of anti-trump and pro-clinton hype as well.  Is all pro-Trump rhetoric russian propaganda or was it his base?  During the 2012 campaign there were pro-Romney rhetoric on reddit as well, doesn't mean it was some foreign country influencing reddit.

       <p>
        One way to find out if the Trump campaign helped Internet Research Agency would be to compare the targeting criteria the campaign used on Facebook to the targeting criteria the Russian propagandists used. If both groups targeted the same audience, that's worth looking into. Investigators could do the same with any further suspicious accounts Facebook unearths.

       No, I don't see it as odd at all.  Russia, like other developed nations, seems to have been practicing cyber warfare for a while so why would it seem odd they'd attempt to use Facebook to sow discord among their rivals?  It's a smart move and it's likely going to be repeated in some form very soon because they know it works.

       <p>
        The short answer is we don’t know. There are suspicions that the Russians might have had help from the Trump campaign or its allies. But the Russians may not have needed more than the targeting tools Facebook offers to every advertiser."

      <p>
       makes it seem like they're not seriously entertaining the notion, but because it's likely a question some readers might ask about the article(which I'm guessing why those parts are bolded) they threw the hypothetical out there.  I admit I've only read a few articles on the subject, but the ones I've read don't link the two parties in a collusion aspect.  More like Russia was trying to exploit some weakness they discovered, or were just practicing.  Then again, we could easily be inferring different things from the same words so maybe I'm wrong.

       There is that as well.  I personally think the argument that Russia influence the election through FB is a hard pill to swallow.  I could be wrong, but it looks to me like an excuse for Hillary's lose and a witch hunt/red scare all over again.

       And that's where we disagree.  I see the argument that Russia would use a platform widely used by US citizens to spread discord to be very easy to understand and agree with.  Maybe they figured early on that Trump could help them in that regard, especially since he has literally(and admittedly arguably) run for president before in an attempt to undermine and ruin the trust of his supporters.

       I'm will to accept they may have even run propaganda, I'd like to see some evidence of what the propaganda was though.  Even so I still doubt it has the impact on the election as everyone is making it out to be, especially if it was in 2015.

       Yeah, I'm not here to defend Trump or his supporters.  I grew up out East and have known he's a shit bag since I was 10.  Regardless, this I'm still not buying this story without more concrete details.  I'll be honest though, as a longtime user of this sub, I'm skeptical of most news.

       And I agree.  I don't think they were specifically and only targeting Trump, but instead a certain kind of demographic.  Had Trump done poorly early on, they would've continued in a similar manner without his name but still targeting the same demographics.

       As you should with any story.  I'm skeptical of Trump campaign involvement in this, at least at the start, but I wouldn't be totally surprised that someone attached to the campaign(like Bannon) could have been involved quietly on their own.

       I definitely wouldn't put it past them at all, but in general from what I saw, this Russian propaganda story as being one of the main influences on the election seems ridiculous to me.  The idea that Hillary is saying she lost because of weaponize fake news by Russia seems like a stretch to me, then this FB story on top seem like it's all propaganda (modern day red scare).  I personally think the Anthony Weiner laptop causing Comey to re-open the investigation into Hillary did more damage than anything else.

       That one (October 2016) was simply strike three. The first strike was the revelation of classified emails on a private server in March 2015. The most damaging, imo, was the second strike, the release of the hacked DNC emails in July 2016 just days prior to the charade that was the DNC convention.

       I'd agree with that, although they were all self inflicted in the sense that Hillary (like Trump) shouldn't be running private servers, the DNC shouldn't be playing favorites, and they definitely shouldn't have allowed their emails on Weiners laptop.

       even if true, Zuckerberg wouldn't have been able to restrain those ads somehow? or re-direct them into less effective markets?  there's e-mails showing Zuck's interest in wielding or directing political power.

       Facebook Facebook admitted that some of a lot of those ads were pro-hillary ads and pro black lives matter. They weren't anything about Trump. They also failed to prove that any of those accounts were even links to the Russian  government
      </p>
      <p>
       For all you know a couple hundred or thousand Russian citizens decided to buy  ads on Facebook and that's why there are also many different types of  ads

       Right, it's called evidence, which we haven't seen ANY regarding Russia hacking, manipulation, or collusion...what we do get is more "theories" how Russia is messing with us...

       I would imagine they did, but to the extent the red scare made it out to be, I don't think so.  Just like this, I have no doubt Russia may have tried to influence the election in various ways.  If they did, I still don't think they had as big of a influence as everyone is trying to make it out to be.

       That one (October 2016) was simply strike three. The first strike was the revelation of classified emails on a private server in March 2015. The most damaging, imo, was the second strike, the release of the hacked DNC emails in July 2016 just days prior to the charade that was the DNC convention.
