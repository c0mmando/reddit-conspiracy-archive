       Is it just me or do the mods give zero fucks now? Something is wrong in the new section of this sub. Is it brigading? Upvote downvote bots? New accounts shilling for the msm narrative? New accounts mucking up discussions?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been seeing a lot of well thought out comments only to get downvoted to hell for expressing the very themes (occultism, tbtb, HRC corruption, 9/11, etc) this sub has become known to discuss. Is it TopMinds posting shit to get a response? Or have too many people migrated from other subs to muddy the community here. Whatever it is, this sub is divided and the mods have done nothing to help that.
      </p>
      <p>
       This used to be a place where partisan politics were understood to be a driving force for division; it was more or less understood. Now it is turning this place into a bitch fest with little to no constructive thought and a lot of skepticism towards actual conspiracy related content. Skepticism is good, I admit, but the downright dismissiveness of many of the new users is troubling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mods, what the fuck is going on?

       Yeah but this isnt a T_D vs conspiracy thing. It transcends that sub and defaulting to blaming them is just taking the easy way out of this discussion. Its your opinion that cool but its been parroted too much.

       It's a double standard for sure. And it doesn't even have to be Trump himself. There are some here that won't acknowledge that Manafort has done some really shady stuff. Nope, completely innocent; it's all Hillary and Podesta.

       A bunch of people  like yourself do not understand nuance. It is possible to not believe the official narrative and NOT be pro Trump. The standard line is that if you don't go along with everything establishment, you are a t_d shill. That is false and not what this sub is about.

       I'm on t_d.  This is nothing like it.  But it's convenient to call it t_d 2.0 when someone brings up deep state distrust or DNC crap.  It's just used as an excuse to disregard a whole swath of actual conspiracy talk.

       This right here is what the fuck Im talking about. You can thoroughly research something like 9/11 or the Rothchilds or you name it and there is no concrete "gotcha fact" that says 100% truth. You have to draw conclusions based on the events/facts and context; basically it comes down to reading between the lines.

       Its the implication. Users keep asking for proof (not saying that is you) and when given a push to look for themselves, said user will shoot it down and false because it is not concrete or from a source to their liking.

       I do ask for sourcing all the time, generally the claim breaks down due to lack of source quickly thereafter.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it goes the other way sometimes, I learn something I didn't know before and am more likely to consider more about the theory or tag a person as a reasonable, good faith CTer in RES. I don't have to agree with their conclusions, necessarily.

       Asking for sources should be the first question anyone asks, even if what is said fits your bias. There is so much lying on the internet that it is best to examine sources before drawing evidence from it. If that upsets you, I truly dont give a fuck.

       You can't make an assertion and expect it to be taken as gospel. This isn't r/Christianity.
If you say something, especially if presented as truth (which is prevalent in this sub), you should expect to back up your claim.

       Telling people to look for themselves is a cop out for a weak theory.

       The problem with asking for proof can be illustrated by a story....  this happened about 12 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       got into an argument over 9/11 being an inside job.  I start talking about how they used thermite to bring down the buildings.
       <br/>
       "bob" says "Thermite isn't an explosive, its an incendiary.  you can't use it to bring a building down".
       <br/>
       This is where my research started.  Found a patent for using thermate (a kind of thermite) in demolition cutter charges.
       <br/>
       Bob questions the authenticity of the document.  I point out that I hotlinked to the USPTO website.
Bob then says "That's just a patent.  there are millions of those for devices that never get built."
       <br/>
       So now, more research.  I found a video made by Controlled Demolition Inc.. (do not see this video up anymore, but probably still exists within 9/11 truth documentaries....  unless CDI DCMA'd them).  It was a marketing video, showing them bringing down a steel frame bridge using thermite cutters, exactly like the one I found a patent of.
       <br/>
       Bob says "that's just a marketing video, that doesn't mean anything."
       <br/>
       I point out that it's a marketing video in which they ACTUALLY TAKE DOWN A STEEL FRAMED STRUCTURE WITH THERMITE, proving that he is wrong in saying that thermite is not used in demolition.  I further point out that thermite cutters leave beams cut at 45 degree angles, and pools of molten metal, both of which were seen in the aftermath of the WTC attack.
       <br/>
       Bob says he's never seen any evidence of steel beams cut at 45 degree angles, or any pools of molten metal.
       <br/>
       time for some more research.
       <br/>
       Posted 2 pictures.  One of the immediate aftermath of the collapse, with many beams sticking out cut at 45 degree angles.  One of a backhoe pulling a beam out of smoking rubble, with globs of molten metal dripping off of its 45 degree cut end.
       <br/>
       Bob says "those could be pictures of anything.  You SAY they're of the world trade center, but I don't see anything identifiable in the background to determine what these are even pictures of".
       <br/>
       I point out that I hotlinked to FEMA's website.  I gave the link to the page in their 9/11 section that these pictures appeared in.
       <br/>
       Bob suggested that the pictures were probably from months later, when they started using torches to cut up the beams and haul them away.
       <br/>
       I pointed out that the pictures are dated on the FEMA page I linked.  I also pointed out that it wouldn't make sense to cut at 45 degrees, as that would be a longer length to cut.  You'd cut the shortest length, 90 degrees.  45 degree cut only makes sense in controlled demo, where the beams have to slide over and down, which a 90 degree cut would prevent.
       <br/>
       Bob asked me "How do you know, are you a welder?!"
      </p>
      <p>
       For a moment, I considered doing some more research to prove what seemed to me to be common sense...  But I realized the futility.  I don't even think his question made sense.  I had spent HOURS, across a few days, proving what seemed obvious, and this obnoxious twat had spent probably 30 seconds dismissively replying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I posted back "PROVE THE SKY IS BLUE, NIGGA!"
       <br/>
       He of course replied with a picture of the sky.  I said "How do I know that's Earth....  I don't see anything identifiable in the picture."
       <br/>
       From there of course, it was all insults.  I'm crazy.  I'm a conspiracy theorists.  Do I pick up the FBI's transmissions in my fillings?  I need to adjust my tinfoil hat.
       <br/>
       And as soon as the "debate" had been "won" by my opponent, everyone else had to pile on with the ridicule.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I say "FUCK YOU!" to anyone who asks me to provide proof.  It's there if you want to find it, but you don't.  You just want to waste my time until I get sick of your little game, then ridicule me for losing.  Fuck off.
      </p>
      <p>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       SIDE NOTE:  I spent a few minutes searching, and can't find either the patent, or video I mentioned above.  I guess google says they don't exist anymore.  Just like how google keeps telling me thermite doesn't exist when spellcheck keeps suggesting "termite".  Fuck you google.

       <strong>
        Look at the bright side, bro!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is full of people like your "Bob" - some of which are just assholes that are proud of their arrogant ignorance, and
       <strong>
        <em>
         others
        </em>
       </strong>
       who are on a MISSION - especially when it comes to certain topics that are of "INTEREST" to them. The latter will not only flatly deny and insult you, they will send you off on seeming "wild-goose chases", they will also LIE THEIR ASSES OFF - repeatedly regurgitating the same shit, even when they've had their faces rubbed in it multiple times.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the hard-core ideologues - they don't give a SHIT about what is true or false or "right" or "wrong",  - they tell lies as naturally as they breathe. All they care about is WINNING, and for them that means that THEIR perceived interests prevail over "the opposition", and there is ZERO moral compunction against "dirty pool" in their mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
       THE GOOD NEWS is that when these fuckers deny and lie and ask for "PROOF!!!", you start to
       <strong>
        <em>
         research
        </em>
       </strong>
       , and pretty soon you start to learn where to look (and where NOT to look), and you begin uncovering amazing facts about history and politics and
       <em>
        whatever
       </em>
       that you likely would have NEVER FOUND had it not been for these LYING ASSHOLES dismissing and challenging you at every point.
      </p>
      <p>
       So after a while, you begin to compile a stock of irrefutable information from impeccable sources, then the pieces start falling together... Amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here's the trick: DO NOT expect the assholes you have been debating to back down or to
       <em>
        accept
       </em>
       any information you've uncovered - that is NOT going to happen, because they aren't interested in facts or truth -
       <em>
        they never have been
       </em>
       . Their goal is to pimp
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       agenda to serve
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       interests, so in most cases, they will respond by simply dismissing or belittling your sources, no matter how original or authoritative, OR they will double-down by impugning your "motives" for researching such matters - launching ad hominem attacks, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       THAT, friend, is when you know you are moving in the right direction. Their level of anger and HATRED directed toward you is the best measure that you are moving in the right direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you write, answering these ideologically-driven ignoramuses, remember that you are NOT addressing THEM, but OTHERS who might be following the conversational debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       So your goal should NEVER be to convince the "Bobs" of the world, that isn't going to happen. Your goal should be to use the denial and the lies that the "Bobs" throw at you as springboards for further research, the fruits of which will not only enrich your own understanding, but educate, enlighten and edify the "silent readers" who lurk in the background.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TLDR
       </strong>
       : Don't take things personally, or let the ASSHOLES get under your skin. If you play it right, these caustic bastards can "help" you to get an education that NO amount of money could buy.

       You know that skeptic community folks suffer from an age old problem. It is the pride of the snobby egg head. Lots of us have been there before. I have been there. I mean no offense. It is really hard for very bright and very analytical people to call bullshit when they cannot cleanly follow through a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an issue though. Not everything can be easily deduced like a math equation or a physics theorem. Sometimes there are topics where many holes exist and there is very little evidence, and most of it is circumstantial. Often these topics deal heavily in psychology, and many times also deal in morals and ethics. Sometimes you have to infer things, and even make hunches. This is not the best way of analyzing a problem, but sadly this is all we have sometimes. Problem with some skeptic types is they take joy in shooting down topics they only know on a surface level. It makes sense, because it is fun to challenge yourself and prove somebody else wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Often though many skeptics think they have proven something false, or something patently silly, when they never even gave it a chance. When you ask them to have an open mind, they pull out and completely ruin that good Carl Sagan quote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Come on man. You know as well as I do that skeptic types carry their own baggage. You do not have to be so coy about it.

       Except this isn't an investigative body. It's a discussion forum for articles and ideas involving conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Debating theories is great. Shutting down conversations with constant demands of proof is not. Especially when by the nature of this sub, proof is unlikely. Often, tangible evidence is unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even your comment, 'instead of plainly accepting them,' is loaded. Often 'debate' of the topic itself never happens because too many people come in to 'debate' whether it's an allowable or legitimate topic to debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously there are a ton of hyper-partisan drones on this sub, but I'm not even just talking about them. Their bias is plain to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the idea that a theory must pass, as you said, 'due diligence and investigation' before it should be discussed further. We're not fucking publishing a newspaper here. It's a conspiracy board.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chill out and let people talk about the actual topics. Their merits will be apparent either way.

       Funny that my quote didn't say that asking for evidence is shutting people down. I'm surprised you still had the gall to pretend it did (jk I'm not surprised).

       You don't seem to want to address the things I'm saying about the difficulty of finding evidence about conspiracy theories. Further, what constitutes 'evidence' can mean different things to different people, especially on a sub such as this.
      </p>

       Do you not understand this, or is it just easier to repeat the same talking points by ignoring it?

      <p>
       It sure would be. Good thing I'm not advocating for that. I'm not sure that reductio ad absurdum works on straw man claims, but kudos to you for trying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I want you to read this slowly, because while I think it's a simple concept to understand, you seem to be (intentionally?) struggling with it:
      </p>
      <p>
       It is possible to entertain ideas or conspiracy theories without first being provided with proof. Sometimes, there's barely even going to be satisfying evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If that is a problem for you, save yourself some stress and stop reading up about this. Read more about cutting-edge science or geopolitical theory.

        What else could figuring out how a theory works be, if not trying to figure out if it has evidence and its moving parts are real?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Basically the same answer as above. Does needing to believe a conspiracy is real before discussing it not seem to be a bit of a convoluted approach to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could understand if we were publishing scientific papers, but we're not. My main point is that
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       need to believe something is 'real' enough to be worth discussing is not a perspective other people need to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Years ago this sub had tons of interesting conversations on topics both new to me and topics I
       <em>
        thought
       </em>
       I knew. Many of them involved accepting massive gaps in evidence and a total lack of proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, discussions of the substance are drowned out by ubiquitous demands for proof or hard evidence. What's the point of that?
      </p>
      <p>
       Each individual submission is not expected to fully solve whatever political/metaphysical/existential/historical issue it's discussing. We can't even do that for non-conspiracy things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before substance on this sub was overwhelmed by rigid demands of proof, you could read interesting morsels of information that would lead you to another. And then another. All of a sudden a few months later you realize that while all of the original claims may not have panned out, they led you to information you'd never have come across (or understood in context) without that path.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand your general desire to know if a topic is real enough based on existing (and more importantly, publicly accessible) evidence before discussing it further. But it's just not feasible for most
       <em>
        conspiracy theories.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       So there's a big difference between asking for tangible evidence and asking why someone believes or is interested in a theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love theories about the origins of humanity. Not only is there a lack of satisfying tangible evidence, but I also don't trust the honesty of many of the expert bodies that provide the evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just the nature of the conspiracy game. Being a critical thinker doesn't just mean believing scientifically approved ideas, it means making your own determinations about topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       For conspiracy theories, you'll always have to be willing to entertain ideas that have an unsatisfying amount of evidence or proof. That doesn't mean
       <em>
        believe
       </em>
       them, it means use your critical thinking skills to look for agendas, manipulation, omission, etc. Over time, we hone those skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we'll never hone these critical thinking skills if we only entertain or discuss topics based on a level of evidence that satisfies our need to know it's real enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially when the institutions and people who control and determine what counts as real evidence are often implicated in the conspiracies themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not 'trust, but verify' it's more like 'listen, verify where you can, seek out more, repeat.'
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't feel to me that you're interested in any sort of sincere discussion, but I'm trying to have one in case I'm wrong about that.

       While I agree with pretty much everything you said, my main issue with a lot of the posts here is they present their theory as known fact rather than a theory. I will admit I often am more willing to be an opposing voice when the OP starts spreading conjecture as fact. I’m not saying there’s not people that are too demanding of proof and that can stifle discussion, but I also think if the OP states something is a fact (Podesta IS a pedophile being an example I often see, versus Podesta is a suspected pedophile) then we do need to start talking about proof and hard evidence.

       This is a subreddit for skeptics.  If I make some wild claim like - I watched Donald Trump dress up as Pennywise and sacrifice children on an altar made of the bones of immigrants, I would expect someone to ask me for the information that was used to form the basis of my hypothesis.  If your idea cannot stand up to any intellectual rigor, then what's the point?  Would you rather this place become an echo chamber?

       Every single one your many comments in this thread proves the case against you. You're adding nothing, just arguing for the sake of it and wasting everybody's time. The genuine users of this sub come here because they want to talk about, and read about conspiracies, not to be harangued with naysayers, mockers and the terminally incredulous.

       Apparently saying "hey that's pretty outlandish, got anything that backs that up?" Isn't in the spirit of this subreddit. Question everything (except when it's a post on r/conspiracy because things can't be proven and you're shutting down conversation by asking questions).

       In other words, you're saying that anti-Trump posts don't get much traction. That's false.
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6xqt3e/dont_let_them_divide_us_brothers_sisters_of/dmizqfg/">
        Here are a bunch of examples
       </a>
       . Also, [the current top post on this sub is
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/72k3fe/a_handful_of_ultrarich_dynastic_families_are/">
        anti-Trump
       </a>
       . I've seen this talking point pushed around on this sub way too many times and it's usually not called out.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is full of many different groups. Some people here don't believe any conspiracy theories. Some people here support Hillary Clinton. Some believe Trump is just crazy enough to make waves. Some hate trump. Some believe the earth is flat. The list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you check political posts, it's usually the anti-Trump comments that are at the top of the thread, upvoted into the hundreds, occasionally gilded, and sometimes those top comments claim they will be downvoted for being anti-Trump, yet nobody figures it out.

       You have probably noticed that there are more Trump supporting posts than there are anti-Trump posts. That's obvious because conspiracy theorists tend to support politicians who market themselves as anti-establishment, such as Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Trey Gowdy, Bernie Sanders, etc. However, the actual number of anti Trump people in here is probably 50 percent at least because you have to account for anti-Trump comments hitting the top of those pro-Trump threads again and again. What we need to do is stop complaining about a non-issue. Anti-Trumpism usually dominates the comments in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       What actually doesn't make sense is the huge amount of people in this sub who apparently don't believe any conspiracy theories. Skepticism is fine and healthy, but what we have are borderline trolls who parrot the official story on numerous topics. If I wanted the official story to be parroted to me, I'd turn on Fox News or CNN.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There are lots of problems with the "discussions" that happen in here.  I personally am extremely skeptical of any conspiracy presented and typically ask for evidence or at least a location where I can learn more.  Unless I know the reddit user, I see no reason to trust them.  They could be anyone, and in order to verify for myself that the conspiracy isn't someone's agenda item, I need to know where it comes from.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, I have received quite a bit more condescending, dismissive rhetoric in response to reasonable requests for more information than I have ever dealt out.  People respond to requests for evidence or information with all sorts of accusations (like calling me various modfications of 'shill'), or with insults, or even more frequently with deflection.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think alot of skeptical people like me are also very frustrated when people post things in this forum that are demonstrably false.  Making claims about people and things that don't exist, or deliberately taking quotes or information out of context in order to paint those things as much more sinister than they actually are, that's the most frustrating thing, to a skeptic, and there's quite a bit of that going on in here as well.

       I see more that ANY mention of alternate theories is deemed outright belief by those who look to condescend and dismiss without any amount of thought. This quote has floated around so much in the last few days it's almost lost its meaning, but it wholly applies -

       The people that have been ruining this sub seem to not entertain the idea that ideas can be entertained without outright belief, and seek to demonize and mock anyone who does not keep their topics of discussion within a specified scope of acceptability.

       Occultism is polarizing, but religious stuff gets upvoted pretty regularly. HRC/Dem corruption and 9/11 are upvoted heavily too. I do think TMOR posts stuff like that obvious Hitler bait yesterday but that's a conspiracy in and of itself. The front page get brigaded (or just seen on r/all) pretty regularly.

       Call out people's humanity. Do what you can to open the eyes of these followers of a system they don't know is holding them back. Don't give into the angry words that are in here. Anger is their tactic, stay positive and stay informed. People on here with those intentions are going no where with their lives. Focus on yours and how you can continue to learn and grow everyday

       I really want to contribute something to this post but you've said just about everything I have to say on the matter, so let the comment be a vote of confidence (along with my upvote) that I see the exact same bullshit you are seeing. The point of the tactics being deployed is to muddy the waters and divert interest.

       I actually disagree. I think the sub has become less partisan since the shake up. The upvotes/downvotes on comments are weird, but the good content is there if you uncollapse comments and ignore people trying to stir up emotional responses. 9/11 articles, historical articles, power structure, wealth inequality, propaganda articles have been at the top. Much better.

       My first hypothesis is that this is partially the natural result of having fewer active moderators after removing Flytape, Drone_Puppet, and Sarah_Connor.  I didn't check the moderator log frequently, but Flytape in particular seemed really active.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thought is that the minority who made the discussions here so interesting decided to migrate to other communities, as many thought the admins getting involved to oust Flytape was a clear indication this community was now compromised.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new queue has a bunch more spam that doesn't belong in this sub than it seemed to, but that could just be that the same amount is sticking around longer.  Also bizarre, were during the few weeks after the mod shakeup, quite a few submissions were really exaggerated in which the OPs would, as a rule, respond hostilely to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coincidentally, the emphasis on TMoR seems new to me.  Either they've stepped up their activity towards this sub, or some group is utilizing them as a foil for this sub, attempting to waste our energy squabbling with them to no end.

       Yeah, there's a proven formula for controlling inconvenient communities.  And it's always getting more refined.  For example, before this happened I had no idea lesser mods could basically take a vote of no confidence to remove an active top mod.

       Hey there, this has been happening on multiple boards across the net over a good number of years... so much so that I personally think its a directed drive to distract and redirect away from the topics discussed, much like an act of desperation towards keeping the general readers who may not have entertained the subject matter, from ever being exposed to it rather than 'Trolling'... Keep up the good work, its very much appreciated.

       I've noticed an influx of newly created reddit accounts and they are deleted soon after they start new posts or play around in the comment section, but it's not only r/conspiracy it everywhere.

       This sub you always have to sift through the chaff to find the wheat so to speak.  Right now it's harder, but if you really want to find some clarity you should always check people's sources as well as your own and your sources' sources.

       Ohh look another post by a Trump supporter who's upset that they can't control this sub as easily as they have Wikileaks and other subs. I think there has been a marked improvement since a few of the Trump mods were given the boot. There is more actual conspiracy posts at the top of the sub and less right wing talking points. It's a step in the right direction.

       In other words, you're saying that anti-Trump posts don't get much traction. That's false.

        anti-Trump
       </a>
       . I've seen this talking point pushed around on this sub way too many times and it's usually not called out.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub is full of many different groups. Some people here don't believe any conspiracy theories. Some people here support Hillary Clinton. Some believe Trump is just crazy enough to make waves. Some hate trump. Some believe the earth is flat. The list goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you check political posts, it's usually the anti-Trump comments that are at the top of the thread, upvoted into the hundreds, occasionally gilded, and sometimes those top comments claim they will be downvoted for being anti-Trump, yet nobody figures it out.

       You have probably noticed that there are more Trump supporting posts than there are anti-Trump posts. That's obvious because conspiracy theorists tend to support politicians who market themselves as anti-establishment, such as Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Trey Gowdy, Bernie Sanders, etc. However, the actual number of anti Trump people in here is probably 50 percent at least because you have to account for anti-Trump comments hitting the top of those pro-Trump threads again and again. What we need to do is stop complaining about a non-issue. Anti-Trumpism usually dominates the comments in this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       What actually doesn't make sense is the huge amount of people in this sub who apparently don't believe any conspiracy theories. Skepticism is fine and healthy, but what we have are borderline trolls who parrot the official story on numerous topics. If I wanted the official story to be parroted to me, I'd turn on Fox News or CNN.

        Look at the bright side, bro!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is full of people like your "Bob" - some of which are just assholes that are proud of their arrogant ignorance, and
       <strong>
        <em>
         others
        </em>
       </strong>
       who are on a MISSION - especially when it comes to certain topics that are of "INTEREST" to them. The latter will not only flatly deny and insult you, they will send you off on seeming "wild-goose chases", they will also LIE THEIR ASSES OFF - repeatedly regurgitating the same shit, even when they've had their faces rubbed in it multiple times.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the hard-core ideologues - they don't give a SHIT about what is true or false or "right" or "wrong",  - they tell lies as naturally as they breathe. All they care about is WINNING, and for them that means that THEIR perceived interests prevail over "the opposition", and there is ZERO moral compunction against "dirty pool" in their mindset.
      </p>
      <p>
       THE GOOD NEWS is that when these fuckers deny and lie and ask for "PROOF!!!", you start to
       <strong>
        <em>
         research
        </em>
       </strong>
       , and pretty soon you start to learn where to look (and where NOT to look), and you begin uncovering amazing facts about history and politics and
       <em>
        whatever
       </em>
       that you likely would have NEVER FOUND had it not been for these LYING ASSHOLES dismissing and challenging you at every point.
      </p>
      <p>
       So after a while, you begin to compile a stock of irrefutable information from impeccable sources, then the pieces start falling together... Amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here's the trick: DO NOT expect the assholes you have been debating to back down or to
       <em>
        accept
       </em>
       any information you've uncovered - that is NOT going to happen, because they aren't interested in facts or truth -
       <em>
        they never have been
       </em>
       . Their goal is to pimp
       <em>
        their
       </em>
       agenda to serve
       <em>

       So your goal should NEVER be to convince the "Bobs" of the world, that isn't going to happen. Your goal should be to use the denial and the lies that the "Bobs" throw at you as springboards for further research, the fruits of which will not only enrich your own understanding, but educate, enlighten and edify the "silent readers" who lurk in the background.

       Something similar went on between my best friend and I. It is like they have an information deflector shield around their brain. Good on you for trying.
