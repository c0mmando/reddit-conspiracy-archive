       I asked them to stand with me against Apartheid Israel.  One of them was one of my very best friends, or at least I thought they were.  I refuse to associate with Jews who won't stand against Zionism, just as I wouldn't associate with Gentiles/Goyim who wouldn't stand against the KKK.  Not one of the Jewish friends I had would stand against racist Zionism.  They will not be missed.

       It definitely goes against what the majority of the conspiracy world says, but it makes more sense to me than 2% of the population controlling everything. Definitely check out that sub from time to time, even if you don't believe it it's always good to see someone else's view. If you have any lesser-known subs you like feel free to send them my way!

       Hostile means unfriendly, antagonistic. So yes, you are showing hostility towards my view. That's fine, I know how sensitive you are to Catholicism, and I'm sorry you're not willing to be open-minded about this. I do suggest watching the video, even if you don't believe it.

       I know how sensitive you are to owning up to Jewish wrongdoing.  I know you want to remain close-minded to how much Jewish antipathy has been brought on by Jews themselves; by their subversive and hostile behavior.

       It's all just deflection and victim card to you.  Jews never did anything wrong?

       Stop hating so much, you sound very angry. Maybe that's just because it's over the internet... I'm not interested in an argument, that gets nowhere. It's filled with emotion. I'm happy for a dialogue though, a discussion.

       It's a video of ONE individual from 6 years ago. I watched one of his other videos (his news show he tried starting) and he seems very radical. Again, it's one individual, that's it.

       I'm really hoping the Israel and Palestinian government can work out a two-state solution, which is what the majority of Israelis and Palestinians want. Unfortunately, Hamas and PLO do not want that, which is very unfortunate for all the people living in that region.

       No that was an illegal settlement.  He was just one of hundreds of thousands (millions perhaps) of illegal Zionist settlers who are driving the rightful owners in Palestine from their homes.

       You're coming off as very immature. Feel free to make your case, but posting like this makes it look like you're just wanting an echo chamber for the sake of your ego.

       You mean there's a person involved in the Israeli/Palestinian divide that wants to eradicate the other? Shocking. Global conspiracy confirmed. The jews did it. What, you ask? Everything. It couldn't be the

       Not at all. I'm just not shocked that there's a human being involved directly with the divide that doesn't want the other side eradicated. Hardly confirms evil Zionism, though. Groups of people have been taking the homes of other groups of people for as long as recorded history. I don't agree with bloodshed for any reason.

       I'm fairly certain your Jewish friends were entirely unaware of the happenings in the state of Israel (as are most Jewish people) and that they were just reacting to someone coming on too strong with rhetoric against their people. I have Jewish people in my group of friends; some support Israel, and some don't. I can't think of a single one that wouldn't take offense to someone who immediately equated being Jewish with being a Zionist however. The two aren't the same and by setting an ultimatum like you did just makes you seem ignorant in the eyes of those to whom the ultimatum was issued.

       It's a big topic, and it's a lot to ask to expect someone to immediately accept that everything they've been told their lives is a lie. Not saying I disagree with you in the least; just saying a change in mentality that great requires more time than that which is spent watching a YouTube video, however convincing it may be. If they changed their minds that easily, all they're proving is that they're easily manipulated. It takes a while for the truth to set in.

       I've come to the realization that the only people who have any hope of stopping the insanity is American Jews.  If they don't want to stop the insanity, then I want nothing to do with them and you shouldn't either.

       Hopefully, though my one recommendation would be increased patience, and an understanding of the massive paradigm shift inside their heads that's required for that awakening.

       Why? Why should they need any more time when they have had so many decades already? Either you fundamentally believe in Jewish supremacism [zionism] or you do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should we goy want to have friends who do not believe in equal rights for all people? I think that attitude is disgustingly racist.
      </p>
      <p>
       American Jews who support Israel's presumed right to crush Palestinians deserve to be challenged on this topic by all Americans no matter what race or religion. Our taxes are supporting Israel, that gives us the right to criticize racist Israeli policy and racist Israeli supporters.

       Yes it's been going on for decades, but a teen making his/her bar/bat mitzvah in the US is likely totally unaware of the situation. You not only need to tell them that their entire view is a lie, but also explain that those horrible things that happened to their people in WWII are actually being perpetrated by its victims against the state of Palestine. That's a lot to swallow, but time and patience will help more than anger.

       Omg mate. Too bad you dont have Russian sources of info about jews...
      </p>
      <p>
       Not counting the "1st" and the "2nd emmigration" of jews from Russia to Israel, USA;
In 1991 when the SU broke appart and opened its borders, the biggest amount ever before of worst of the worst and sickest (physicly+mentally) zionist jews immigrated to the USA and got instantely jobs atleast in the media.
95% of so called Russians in the USA are atleast mixed part-Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people wont go anywhere and will stay until they crush the country they live in atm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stalin removed nearly all of them (cynical, sabotaging criminal zionists) from the politics, they still managed to poison him and take over the SU after his death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Trump manage to remove even 1 of them from anywhere?
Sorry but i cant see any way the US could deal with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have the biggest amount of them and as everyone should know , they will "work" until your country disappear.
They want to put the blacks on whites right now + the blacks are that stupid and dont see theit known devide and conquer.

       Not at all. I'm just not shocked that there's a human being involved directly with the divide that doesn't want the other side eradicated. Hardly confirms evil Zionism, though. Groups of people have been taking the homes of other groups of people for as long as recorded history. I don't agree with bloodshed for any reason.
