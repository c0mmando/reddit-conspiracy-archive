What are some of the problems that people have with GMOs? I feel like a lot of the posts on here need context that I don&#39;t understand, or are based on American politics which don&#39;t concern me realistically. Are there any studies which showed problems with the GMOs? I read about the one with the rats, but read it was redacted?

    <div class="md"><p>Well Reddit LOVES GMOs, might not be the best place to ask but r/conspiracy is a good start. I have no idea about the health impacts of GMOs so can&#39;t really comment on that, except for the fact that people are trusting their food to be 100% safe by private companies. These companies then have a monopoly on the food industry in the field of that GMO such as corn or wheat. They can dominate it, charge whatever price they want for the seeds, make farmers pay to use their seeds, hostile takeovers of farmers crops/land, and more. </p>

<p>In a perfect world GMOs are great, we would be able to edit the actual food we eat to have various benefits but the fact that we live in the world we do...well we can&#39;t have nice things. They are not going to let us have GMOs for free, so GMOs are going to be fucked in some way. </p>

<p>It depends on how you define new. Genetically engineered plants first appeared in the lab about 30 years ago and became a commercial product in 1994. Since then, more than 1,700 peer-reviewed safety studies have been published, including five lengthy reports from the National Research Council, that focus on human health and the environment. The scientific consensus is that existing GMOs are no more or less risky than conventional crops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>This agenda of GMO is not about the health and safety; it’s not about increasing crop yields - that’s a lie that has been proven in repeated tests in North America and all around the world. Crop yields for farmers, using GMO plants, may increase slightly for the first 1-2 harvest years, but ultimately decline after 3-4 years. And not only that! We’ve been promised by Monsanto and other GMO giants that the use of chemicals will be less, because of these “wonderful” traits that GMO plants resist. In fact, the weeds become resistant and you have super weeds, which are 5-6 feet in a height and choke out everything. It’s a catastrophe. So, farmers end up using added weed killers to kill the super weeds. This whole mad playing around with the genetic makeup of nature is a disaster from the beginning.</em></p>

<p><em>The real agenda of GMO, which I have documented in great detail in my book “Seeds of Destruction”, comes from the Rockefeller Foundation. It comes out of the 1920s-1930s Eugenics movement. The Rockefeller Foundation during the 1930’s, right up to the outbreak of World War II when it became politically embracing too, financed the Nazi Eugenics experiments of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin and in Munich. Why did they do this? Their goal was the elimination of what they called “undesirable eaters”. That is called population reduction.</em></p>

<p><em>After the war, the head of the American Eugenic Society, who was a good friend of John D. Rockefeller, at the annual conference of the American Eugenic Society said: “From today, the new name of eugenics is genetics”. Moreover, if you keep that in mind – genetic engineering, the Human Genome Project and so forth – they all are scientific frauds. Russian scientists have proven that the entire Genome Project utterly disregarded 98% of the scientifically valuable data in favor of 2%  that was completely nonsense and a waste of billions of dollars.</em></p>

<p>I&#39;ve never understood this argument. So we now have Roundup resistant weeds because of Roundup overuse. Roundup resistant weeds are, well, weeds resistant to Roundup. They aren&#39;t magical or super, they can still be mitigated with any of the non-Roundup herbicides. I would think this would be a good thing for all the Roundup haters, as it means farmers are forced to go back to pre-Roundup herbicides.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rt.com/news/monsanto-rats-tumor-france-531/">https://www.rt.com/news/monsanto-rats-tumor-france-531/</a></p>

<p>French scientists have revealed that rats fed on GMO corn sold by American firm Monsanto, suffered tumors and other complications including kidney and liver damage. When testing the firm’s top brand weed killer the rats showed similar symptoms.</p>

<p>The French government has asked its health and safety agency to assess the study and had also sent it to the European Union&#39;s food safety agency, Reuters reports.</p>

<p>&quot;Based on the conclusion…, the government will ask the European authorities to take all necessary measures to protect human and animal health, measures that could go as far as an emergency suspension of imports of NK603 maize in the European Union,&quot; the French health, environment and farm ministries said in a joint statement.</p>

<p>Researchers from the University of Caen found that rats fed on a diet containing NK603 – a seed variety made tolerant to amounts of Monsanto&#39;s Roundup weedkiller – or given water mixed with the product, at levels permitted in the United States – died earlier than those on a standard diet.</p>

<p>The research conducted by Gilles-Eric Seralini and his colleagues, said the rats suffered mammary tumors, as well as severe liver and kidney damage. The study was published in the journal of Food and Chemical Toxicology and presented at a news conference in London.</p>

<p>Fifty percent of male and 70 percent of female rats died prematurely, compared with only 30 percent and 20 percent in the control group, said the researchers.</p>

<p>The GMO debate is over — again. Last week, the prestigious National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine issued what is probably the most far-reaching report ever produced by the scientific community on genetically engineered food and crops. The conclusion was unambiguous: Having examined hundreds of scientific papers written on the subject, sat through hours of live testimony from activists and considered hundreds more comments from the general public, the scientists wrote that they &quot;found no substantiated evidence that foods from GE crops were less safe than foods from non-GE crops.&quot;

<p>Chapela was co-author (with his graduate student, David Quist) of a controversial 2001 Nature paper about the flow of transgenes into wild Zea mays ssp. mexicana in mountains of Oaxaca in Southwestern Mexico -a culturally significant region known as the Mesoamerican center of origin for Zea mays L.[2][3] Controversy over the accuracy of the claims and methodological concerns about the paper led to an editor&#39;s note saying there was <strong>insufficient evidence to justify the original publication.</strong> </p>

<p>2nd link is news to me, and it seems fairly overblown.</p>

<p>3rd link is not a respectable source.  Dr. Vandana Shiva is a fraud and not an expert. Really reaching there.</p>

<p>You know why mutagenesis breeding isn&#39;t political? It&#39;s far less accurate, and far less studied than transgenic breeding, but ORGANIC farming grows these crops. That&#39;s why.</p>

<p>Anti-GMO groups are almost always funded by organic companies.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty sad people like you exist who only post in this sub when this topic comes up. GMO threads consistently have people outside the sub commenting on them. It&#39;s really hard to believe there are people who care this much about gmos <em>and think organic food is the problem</em>. Guess what, a few generations before &quot;organic&quot; was a thing, it was how <em>everyone</em> ate. </p>

<p>I have looked at the data plenty of times and what I find is not at all settled. Companies routinely fund studies and counterstudies, throw out things they don&#39;t like, manipulate the data and so on. Scientific research in this country is not done benevolently because they are more worried about funding and getting published than doing real science. There&#39;s PLENTY of independent data which questions whether gmos are safe, this is just not found on the pro-gmo side. </p>

<p>If you are an actual person, you&#39;ll be willing to challenge yourself, and ask why food sovereignty is an issue that you think is a scam. Do you want giant corporations controlling your food?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meanwhile, monsanto et al are trying to outlaw seed saving and seed libraries. Like monsanto gives a shit about its customers. They are one of the most litigious agricultural companies in existence. </p>

<p>Monocultures(which happen way more in non-organic settings) are the furthest thing from healthy. It stripmines soil and destroys biodiversity. I respect the hell out of small time, organic polyculture growers and support them by buying at the farmer&#39;s market. </p>

<p>You avoided the question though. These gmo companies are lobbying like crazy, is that really something you want? Do you really want an industrial food chain? With companies that have a legal and PR team bigger than your whole town? If you take climate change seriously, which you should since you&#39;re soooo into science, then you should understand how dangerous industrial agriculture is and how gmo companies are pushing that model. </p>

study committee found no substantiated evidence of a difference in risks
to human health between currently commercialized genetically engineered
