       My friend turned me onto
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yli-if4F0DY">
        this video
       </a>
       he knows I'm not a big conspiracy guy and for the longest time I truly believed that our government didn't have any involvement with the attack that happened on the Twin Towers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever since he has shown this footage to me though I have been questioning and researching everything. It took me awhile to find
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0FBIFAYRfo&amp;amp;t=577s">
        this video
       </a>
       but in it is a cop who tells a man filming the streets that building 7 was going to collapse next. Now I would like to say building 7 was not touched by a plane and the debris that did fall on it from the towers did not nearly do enough damage to make it collapse. And how did a city cop that is NOT a CIA or FBI agent know that it was going to come down?
      </p>
      <p>
       In this
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaKL15W_4og">
        eye witness video
       </a>
       two men who were in the towers a firemen and janitor describe a loud boom coming from the lowest part of the building. The janitor thought it might have been the generator that blew up, but to his account not even five seconds after experiencing the first explosion the plane hit the top of building. Many people that were interviewed after escaping the towers all said they felt a explosion first then heard the plane crash into the building.

       It's very eye opening and almost scary to think I was blind this long. I was fed a lie that could have easily been seen if only my eyes were open.... I mean the truth is right in front of my face, and I know I know I'm sure I left out a lot of other important stuff but I know this community here is well informed on this sort of thing. I posted here to maybe learn more or just create a discussion. I did also have a question for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think with the currents event going on between the US and North Korea that another false flag such a 9/11 could happen again or could we possible be seeing nuclear war in the coming years?

       Yeah, so in short the "aristocrats" control our tv, radio, music, education, churches, legal system, government, police, and military (and I probably missed a lot) to their own benefit. While that's horrifying, it's also liberating and empowering. Also, you're not alone. A LOT of people have figured this out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding another false flag, sure it's possible -- even likely, I'd say. Do what you like with that information.

       How about you keep your thoughts to yourself about what is right for me. I'll do me, you do you. The very notion that nuclear weapons are not a reality is a nice, safe falsehood to live in, but it is just that. I am very aware of the truth around me and what is bullshit and what isn't. I am very well aware of the lies and the coverups and I do question what I hear and see. But the simple fact is that some of these "conspiracy theories" go just a little too damn far. People have been lied to by their country and their historians for millenia, but that doesn't mean that absolutely everything is fake.

       Why though? In your own words- people have been lied to by their country and their historians for a millennia- why would proven liars have a line? Like false flags are acceptable but lying about their weapons capabilities is going too far?

       If there is a veil to be seen through here, its pretty clear youre going to have a hell of hard time seeing through it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, when one is led to critical examine the stories of military capability (nuclear warfare in this case) there are reasons to give credence to either:
       <br/>
       1) Exaggerated (slightly or gigantically) the destruction potential of nuclear weapons. 
2) Non existence of nuclear reaction as described in the physics books.  Theres some other occulted, valuable mechanism of destruction.
       <br/>
       3) Non existence of any technology so destructive
      </p>
      <p>
       Heres a start.  Ii really is not so hard to make the following connection:  that nuclear winter has and will be used as a sort of "glue" for a stable New World Order.

       You question everything then maybe question how all these people have kept totally silent since 2001. A cop knows about the controlled demo, then how many cops did? If this was a conspiracy kept for 16 years it cannot be a large one, so every cop on NYPD knowing is not possible. I am going to guess you are really a "question everything" person though. How have all these investigators, and demolition guys, and cops and everyone, how have they all maintained silence for 16 years? No death bed confessions, no anon whistleblowers, not one guilty conscience or person who decides to profit from their story. Complete and utter silence.

       William Rodriguez, the janitor I brought up in my post he never remained silent. His story doesn't line up with the "official" story and he was a person that was there. As soon as William's story didn't line up with MSM's bullshit they censored him. He's even publicly
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck3VBAKxznw">
        talked about it.
       </a>
       And in this same clip they state that the First Responders that survived were not invited to the 10th 9/11 anniversary due to there being no space. Which is HIGHLY disrespectful but also suspicious. Do they not want the firemen speaking about how the EPA told them it was okay to breathe the air? Or maybe they would talk about the explosion and how the whole first floor turnstiles, marble, 2 - 3 inch thick glass was just destroyed
      </p>
      <p>
       And we can't forget about the Pentagon.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk&amp;amp;t=137s">
        in this video
       </a>
       I can not make out the womans name since it's a little blurry but she worked at the Pentagon. She walked out of the hole that was created by the explosives, she told the media that a plane didn't hit it. A few days later in her hospital room men in suites visit her, weekly, continuously asking her about what she thinks happened. They even threatened her just to make her go along with the official story. She's still alive and you can hear her talk about the men in suites on the Alex Jones show.

       This is spot on. They don't question their narrative, only the mainstream's. They find one flaw in the MSM narrative and claim conspiracy but with dozens of flaws in their own narrative they just ignore them.

       Hello there friend. Did you know the project by the civil engineering department at the University of Alaska Fairbanks? The preliminary report was just released 2 weeks ago.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The research team studied the building’s response using two finite element programs, ABAQUS and SAP2000 version 18. At the micro level, three types of evaluations were performed. In plan-view, the research team evaluated: 1) the planar response of the structural elements to the fire(s) using wire elements; 2) the building’s response using the NIST’s approach with solid elements; and 3) the validity of NIST’s findings using solid elements. At the macro-level, progressive collapse, i.e., the structural system’s response to local failures, is being studied using SAP2000 with wire elements, as well as with ABAQUS, and it is near completion. The findings thus far are that fire did not bring down this building. Building failure simulations show that, to match observation, the entire inner core of this building failed nearly simultaneously.

       One anomaly that isn't well known is the speeds of the planes that hit the towers. The 767 has a maximum operating velocity of 360 knots and a maximum diving velocity of 410 knots - exceeding these will make the craft very hard to control and cause the wings to start of rip off.

       Congratulations! You've punctured through a thick layer of lies and deception, but it would be a mistake to believe that everything on the other side of that membrane is true. Just the opposite. Many if not most of the conspiracies we read about are either fake or filled with false leads and misdirection. Puncturing through consensus reality does not lead directly to the truth. Waiting for us on the other side of that membrane is a dizzying and disorienting fog of disinformation and misdirection. The mainstream lies are themselves wrapped inside of lies, inside of lies, inside of lies, inside of lies…
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of it is just another swarm of lies, another layer of fog. TPTB (The Powers That Be) do not want anyone to discover the truth about how this world works, and so they cover everything in a thick, suffocating layer of fog so it is nearly impossible for us to find our way to the truth. The vast majority of things you will read or watch on conspiracy sites (including Reddit) or conspiracy-related matters is disinfo and misdirection deliberately spread by TPTB.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disinfo can be defined as information about some conspiracy-related topic that TPTB disseminate that is not true at all. Misdirection is trickier, because it is information they disseminate that has some truth mixed in with lies. Or in some cases they tell the truth up to a certain point and then at the end they point you in the wrong direction, blaming the wrong people for what they've just revealed. (Some people use the terms disinfo and misdirection interchangeably--it's not really important.)
      </p>
      <p>
       It is extremely difficult to tease apart the truth from the lies. One reason is that the lies they tell about themselves are so bad that you can't imagine someone spreading such vile lies about themselves. If you've decided that TPTB are really truly evil and then you read something about them that confirms your suspicions and portrays them as really evil, it's hard to see why the source of that information would be coming from TPTB. You might conclude that such information is wrong, but you aren't likely to suspect that it is deliberately meant to mislead. But it is. Why would anyone say such bad things about themselves? And I'll repeat: virtually everything conspiracy-related that you will read or see is meant to mislead you. It might be straight-up disinfo or misdirection, but it is designed to keep you from really getting to the truth. And they are masters of deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you every heard the advice that you can use an embarrassing lie to get out of trouble? So for example say you're hung over and miss your alarm and arrive late to work. Instead of telling your boss the truth, you tell him that you had explosive diarrhea on the way in and had to go back home to change your clothes. He would never think you were lying, since why would anyone lie about that? So it's kind of like that but on a unimaginable scale.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are also good at giving things the appearance of truth by making it seem as if they are trying to suppress it. If it wasn't true, why would they (appear to be) trying to hide it? But the fact that you've heard of it in the first place is a good indication that they are not trying to hide it but deliberately planted it.
Another element of this is a specific form of misdirection known as a 'limited hangout.' A 'limited hangout' is misdirection that leads you part way to the truth but then stalls before getting there.
      </p>
      <p>
       To take an example, Wikileaks is a limited hangout. The first tip-off to that is that Assange has dismissed 9/11 conspiracy theories, saying: "I'm constantly annoyed that people are distracted by false conspiracies such as 9/11, when all around we provide evidence of real conspiracies, for war or mass financial fraud."
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, Assange wants us looking in the direction he's pointing to but ignoring things like 9/11. He's a very good disinfo agent, because much of the information he reveals is, indeed, really shocking regarding wars and financial fraud. And that stuff might very well be true. But the point is: as long as they keep people busy with that stuff, they aren't busy looking into allegedly "false" conspiracies (which are actually true). They also give Assange more credibility by making it appear as if they are trying to suppress Wikileaks and put him in jail, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying that the information he has revealed is a lie (though it may be); what I'm saying is that Wikileaks is a form of misdirection or limited hangout. If what you have to Wikileaks them is truly revolutionary, they will not touch it, because at the end of the day their job is to offer people a distraction or limited hangout. "Look here! (Not there!!)"
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks, like most of the information you will find on almost all conspiracy-oriented websites and youtube channels, is mostly a distraction. The information has some value, to be sure, but mostly it is there to keep you from looking elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another aspect of the conspiracy lies they spread is that they want us to be afraid, in general, and also afraid of them. You know that famous phrase from Dune, "Fear is the mind-killer." Well it's true. One of their ruling strategies is to keep us in a state of fear, especially afraid of one another. It's part of the divide-and-rule gambit, and I see that you've recognized that which is great. But beyond that they generally want us afraid since it makes us more suggestible. When you are off kilter you are also easier to (mis)lead. So in conspiracy circles there is a lot of fear-mongering that goes on. Whenever I see a conspiracy engaging in fear-mongering (Nuclear war with North Korea! Financial collapse coming! Doomsday weapon coming on line! Obama is going to grab our guns, declare martial law and round us up into FEMA camps!), my spidey sense starts tingling that I am dealing with disinfo. I acknowledge that I might be wrong in any given instance, but I will not give myself over to fear, because I believe it gives them an advantage or a minor victory. I also try not to spread a message to others that might induce fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another tactic TPTB use is called 'controlled opposition.' Basically, you create or co-opt opposing movements and points of view to ensure that there is no real opposition or that the real opposition ultimately fails. Lenin is famous for his quote on "creating the opposition in order to control it," but it wasn't just Lenin. This is a time-worn tactic of ruling powers everywhere. Sometimes the opposition appears very genuine so it's hard to discern that it's controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this tactic is hardly limited to LENR. It's everywhere. I can pretty much guarantee you that anything that might threaten or challenge the wealth and power of TPTB in any way is controlled. But more than that, most of the division we see in the world are fake. The whole Russia hacking thing is a myth, since Russia has been under control of TPTB at least since the Bolshevik Revolution. (And I'm not talking out of my ass here--there is a wealth of evidence of this and I'd be happy to give you more details if you're interested.) I would better dollars to donuts the same is true with North Korea. As I've mentioned, Assange is also controlled opposition (and Snowden, too). Chomsky is also obvious since he, too, dismisses 9/11 truth. Pretty much all the major conspiracy websites, including zerohedge, bibliotecapleyades, infowars, etc. etc. are all controlled opposition, disinformation, etc. Again, it doesn't mean everything they say is a lie, but it does mean that you should not trust them since it is often very difficult to discern what is true and what is not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll mention one more tactic: it's called blackwashing or 'discredit by association.' That's when they have someone tell some truth, but then act crazy or evil or espouse ludicrous ideas in order to discredit the truth. (Like promoting some actual conspiracy but then turning around and embracing Flat Earth nonsense.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So to summarize, there are many tactics the TPTB use to keep us from learning the truth: disinfo, misdirection, limited hangouts, fake suppression, controlling the opposition, fear mongering, telling us lies to make us afraid (of them, of each other, of whatever), and blackwashing to discredit truth-seekers.
      </p>
      <p>
       After much study, I’ve come to the conclusion that much of what we see on TV or read in the newspapers and history books is fake and phony. We’re being manipulated and duped on a grand, almost unimaginable scale. Our thoughts and passions are being molded and orchestrated. It’s sort of like in the Matrix movies, except that instead of a computer simulation, our Matrix has been created by a group of living, breathing human beings using mass media as their primary tool. Waking up to this realization was psychologically difficult at first.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've peeled back one layer of lies. It is probably the toughest layer to pierce through and keeps the vast majority of people in line. But there are many, many more layers of lies beyond that. There is a full on blizzard of lies to try to keep anyone who gets through the first layer in a booming, buzzing confusion, far away from the truth. Good luck to you on your journey! To aid you,

       I was the same way for years. The 9/11 conspiracy people seemed nuts. Then a few videos popped into my YouTube suggestions last year and now I believe 100% that the government is lying to us. About what exactly? That I don't know and probably never will. Or maybe we will find out 70 years later like jfk. The jfk files could be more of the same as well, more disinformation. Especially with the Oswald files destroyed and many eyewitnesses dead or killed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back to 9/11, my evidence is the shaking camera, the explosions heard before the fall,

       How about you keep your thoughts to yourself about what is right for me. I'll do me, you do you. The very notion that nuclear weapons are not a reality is a nice, safe falsehood to live in, but it is just that. I am very aware of the truth around me and what is bullshit and what isn't. I am very well aware of the lies and the coverups and I do question what I hear and see. But the simple fact is that some of these "conspiracy theories" go just a little too damn far. People have been lied to by their country and their historians for millenia, but that doesn't mean that absolutely everything is fake.
