       I am watching a Sumeria video right now and listening to some of the words be pronounced; It sounds exactly like the first noises that both of my nephews tried to make.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just wondering if this has ever been considered.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is posted in a conspiracy forum because the most intrusive thinkers are within these realms. If this ever turned out to be true; the conspiracy of sorts would be mans walking away from what is naturally given to us to be transformed into the slaves we are now.

       Some of my Jiu jitsu buddies have said that their kids are able to grapple naturally, using techniques that would have to be typically taught to someone, without any training. Most BJJ practitioners get addicted and end up training every other day for years and years. It's like all that training has encoded into their DNA and gets passed on.

       I've also heard this happens in musical families as well. 3rd or 4th generation musicians just 'have it'.

       My dad was a Dart champion in the 80s and 90s and i picked them up and had amazing accuracy without ever trying prior.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also ended up doing nearly the exact same things he did at the same ages in life without any premeditated thoughts or knowledge on it.

       <a href="https://www.sheldrake.org/research/morphic-resonance">
        Morphic resonance is a process whereby self-organising systems inherit a memory from previous similar systems. In its most general formulation, morphic resonance means that the so-called laws of nature are more like habits. The hypothesis of morphic resonance also leads to a radically new interpretation of memory storage in the brain and of biological inheritance. Memory need not be stored in material traces inside brains, which are more like TV receivers than video recorders, tuning into influences from the past. And biological inheritance need not all be coded in the genes, or in epigenetic modifications of the genes; much of it depends on morphic resonance from previous members of the species. Thus each individual inherits a collective memory from past members of the species, and also contributes to the collective memory, affecting other members of the species in the future.

       So the way you described that is like each particular species is in tune to its own radio signal and every species has access to a "cloud" server farm where they can access knowledge and data that is known throughout. ( Kinda close? )

       There is something of a universal grammar.  Ancient Egyptian is close to it.  As far as I know, Sumerian is very similar to Egyptian.  Their hieroglyphics are almost the same.  And there is strong evidence that language (from our environment) shapes cognitive development.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance, babies tend to say 'da' and 'ma' because they are two of the easiest sounds to make.  If you open your mouth and make sound, the difference between 'da' and 'ma' is just whether you regulate the sound with your lips or your tongue.  'Da' becomes 'dad' in English.  In Russian, 'da' is 'yes'.  In Latin, it is 'give'.  In Chinese, it is 'big' or 'strong'.  So they all have the same basic connotation, in a way.  Each language is built up from there, evolving in different ways based on the associations given to the basic sounds (and reinforced in the neural network of the brain).
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is whether there's a 'switch' in the brain capable of instantly converting one language to another.  Like, if the same neural network can be inverted or rotated or interpreted differently somehow in order to produce multiple languages.  Perhaps, even, as the result of a drug that dissolves weak connections, for instance.  I don't know enough about it to speculate, but I'm sure there are people working on this type of thing right now.  And, the odds are that if it exists, it's being weaponized.

       one of the most shocking things I have ever heard was that the English language was invented, and they even named the man who invented English.
      </p>
      <p>
       this was shocking because i had assumed that English had merely evolved over time like other languages
      </p>
      <p>
       couple this with the idea that language can be used to enslave the mind, because there simply are no adequate words in some languages to express certain ideas
      </p>
      <p>
       and then you wonder if this is by design that a language only has limited words, so as to limit your exposure to certain ideas
      </p>
      <p>
       this thread has some good comments in it, i hope it gets the attention it deserves.

       Well if you compare english to latin or any of the other romance languages, english was created so that law could become more powerful. The romance languages are quite simplistic compared to english.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have an entirely different language when you look at english from a legal stand point. The whole reason lawyers go to college is to understand the alternate version of the language they already know. Blacks Law Dictionary Version 7 is currently out.

       This isn't really surprising. Lots of disciplines have their own language within a language because when you're talking to someone who is also deep in the discipline, like in medicine, law or martial arts, it's easier to communicate ideas using conventions and words that seem hard to understand if you're not part of that world.

       Also, Romance languages are big on gendered words so the article like 'the' and 'a' changes depending on the gender of the next word. English doesn't have that and it's simpler because of it. I imagine there are many more examples of Romance language complexity and English language simplicity.

       The sex of the word is quite easy to remember. I would not say that by itself makes a romance language more difficult.  English has too many words.

       DNA contains info to make proteins. New proteins are not what result in new language, that's a processing mechanism within the brain, specifically the Wernicks and Brochas areas. Its a nice thought, but DNA probably has very little to,do with formulating langauge, at least directly (I.e., outside from allowing the mechanical creation of sound and protein pathways for processing, it doesn't constitute language itself). Language is taught and learned.

       Alan Watts posited that generally, a common first baby word is "Da". not because of 'dada', but because in some ancient language (possibly Sanscrit) Da translates as "that". sort of implying babies are pointing out the bizarreness of there being things, as opposed to their prior states of like, disembodied formlessness or something.
IDK that's hardcore paraphrasing. Alan Watts was all about enlightenment and being god. a very interesting guy for anyone interested in that stuff.

       As is best known, DNA does not store the ability to speak a language. Language is learned and stored as a series of neural connections between brain cells.

       Yes, as our brains have stored much of what we learned, even that Spanish 1 and 2 class from high school that we got a C in. Its the conscious recall that makes the use of that knowledge inefficient, but its storage is thought to be highly effificent. This is why minds like Einstein's exist. They are not bigger or have any new configurations, just increased neural synapses which increase recall ability and crosstalk between multiple parts of the brain...its a suped up suoer highway in a sense, no traffic jams.

       I have seen babies that seem to hold conversation using just babble talk. In fact it seems like every living thing has a basic method of communication it can refer to to talk to their own kind. I'm sure you've had an encounter talking to someone that didn't speak any English but you were still able to somewhat converse and/or ask a question. I think we are all born with some kind of built in language

       DNA transmits biological information only, not learned behavior. Instinctive behavior is not learned, it's biologically transmitted too. Languages have developed around human voice capabilities, but they are learned behaviors. Consider, for example, that a westerner raised in an Asian country since infancy learns the country's language as well as a native; there is no genetic advantage in learning any language.

       But that westerner having a child of western decent may more easily pick up on the language or may even know the language prior to birth. Whether that is it learning during gestation or not, i still feel there is something more to DNA than just biological traits and assets.

       This isn't really surprising. Lots of disciplines have their own language within a language because when you're talking to someone who is also deep in the discipline, like in medicine, law or martial arts, it's easier to communicate ideas using conventions and words that seem hard to understand if you're not part of that world.
