<p>Thanks for the reminder. Sometimes I get confused even though I know better. For example, I recently finished reading <em>Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</em> by Yuval Noah Harari. There was something in there about the WWW being the newest religion, but I can&#39;t recall exactly. However, in my old-timey brain, religion is always associated not only with spirituality, but also death. Please enlighten me, thanks in advance.</p>
