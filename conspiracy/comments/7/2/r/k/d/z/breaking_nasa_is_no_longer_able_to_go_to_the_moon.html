<p>What a fucking joke. They have the technology, so here is my thinking</p>

<p>1: they found something there that they don&#39;t want anyone seeing</p>

<p>2: somebody or something on the moon warned them to never return</p>

<p>3: they never landed on the moon</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>Edit: sorry for the format don&#39;t know how to space things out on here</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have any idea how much money it costs to rebuild an entire moon landing program from scratch?</p>

<p>Do you have any idea what it cost the first time? You guys are seriously underestimating the complexity involved here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, it probably costs a fifth of the black budget...</p>

<p>You can&#39;t tell me they could afford to do it in the 60&#39;s, and not today. I bet, they could do it more efficiently today, and better. It&#39;s just they can&#39;t, nor have they probably been ever able to do it. </p>

<p>They just feed bullshit to everyone - I&#39;m definitely not saying the originals were a fake ... but, in reality, with better engines, rockets, technology, you can most definitely capture the same result for much cheaper and easier. </p>

<p>The fact they&#39;re saying they retired the capabilities is hilarious, at best. </p>

<p>And if anyone accepts that as truth, they got you where they want you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to blacksmith as a hobby.  I had a coal and gas forge, a really nice anvil, six different kinds of hammers, and three kinds of tongs that were very specific to the shape of the material I was working with.  I could make railings, pot racks, and a million other wrought iron items - both functional and decorative.  I personally made one of the hammers and two of the sets of tongs because I needed them to do very specific things.  </p>

<p>Then I had kids and sold off all my stuff to make some money back and make room in my home.</p>

<p>Now I am no longer able to blacksmith.  The technology exists, but I no longer have my forge, anvil, hammers, or tongs.  I still know how to blacksmith, I have all the knowledge I need to be able to make all those decorative and functional items, and the custom tools, but I don&#39;t have the $7,000 I would need to completely rebuild my blacksmith shop back to the exact setup I had 15 years ago.  I also really don&#39;t have the passion or interest in doing it like I used to.  I&#39;ve moved on to other hobbies and I have other priorities so I&#39;ve moved on.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t still make things, and it&#39;s not like my creative side has been completely eliminated, but in terms of blacksmithing specifically, it&#39;s kind of like a &quot;been there, done that&quot; kind of thing. </p>
