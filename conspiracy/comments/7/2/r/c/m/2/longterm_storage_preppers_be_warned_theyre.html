        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There was a time when you could easily start up your 50-year-old convertible, after it had been standing still for over 20 years. Those days are about to become permanent history because provably the fuels of today are far less stable than they were before - even compared to the 1980s and mid 1990s. Big Oil knows this all too well and they&#39;re playing ball with Al Gore!</p>

<p>When you go to BP&#39;s website you can find storage guides pointing out that you shouldn&#39;t store gas or diesel for more than a year, in normal conditions (it is considered borderline terrorism apparently to want to be prepared and independent. This was also the case in the aftermath of hurricane Katrina in the US when authorities seized firearms from local citizens).</p>

<p>What are normal conditions today? Well, as how most people would store their fuel. In very limited quantities, above ground, in containers, (jerry) cans or small tanks. To use for their lawn mowers or so. Not to be prepared for any serious SHTF events that will eventually come. Be it war or anything else.</p>

<p>More professional approaches, or when you are a well-informed prepper, will have fuels like gas and diesel stored in tanks underground, where temperatures are far more stable than above ground. This too is admitted by BP and they even go as far as extending &#39;modern&#39; diesel&#39;s life to up to 10 to 15 years with proper storage and checks. But then again, in &quot;normal&quot; cases, Joe and Bob don&#39;t have underground storage so that leaves them with &quot;modern&quot; gas or diesel that will only run their car engines and backup generators for up to a few years, 5 at best.</p>

<p>Clearly we have been cheated into consuming crappy fuels that only support the green cult, the man-made climate change-friendly biofuels and blends that degrade super fast and that line the pockets of both Al Gore and Big Oil.</p>

<p>Let folks in the following decades of the 21st century know that this was possible in the past, but unheard of in their green &#39;new world&#39;:</p>

<p><strong>Message from 2016:</strong> <em>&quot;My dad&#39;s old Pontiac sat untouched for 20 years. After 20 years, he removed the stuff that had been piled up on the body and tried to crank the engine. With 20 year old gasoline in the tank, it cranked right up. We took it for a spin around the subdivision, spinning the old tires at every stop sign, using 20 year old gas. The shelf life of this ethanol tainted stuff doesn&#39;t sit well with me.&quot;</em></p>

<p><strong>Message from 2010:</strong> <em>&quot;Have a friend who had some [diesel] that he paid $.65 a gal for it and it&#39;s still good. Probably the old stuff though. ... [reply] ... Wow! If he only paid $0.65 per gallon for diesel fuel up there in Alaska, that fuel must be really old. I haven&#39;t seen diesel fuel prices that low around here for at least 10 years or more. Most definitely has to be the old high sulfur fuel, which is much more stable than this ULSD crap the EPA dictates we must burn now.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Obviously they don&#39;t want you to have a sizable supply of your own fuel and even if you do buy hundreds of gallons of the crappy substance today it won&#39;t even last as long you planned or hoped for. We&#39;re pretty much being checkmated. - KJ, intelsector.com</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answer is simple.  They&#39;re not tampering with the fuel.</p>

<p>Its government requirements that ethanol be added to fuel.</p>

<p>The ethanol causes the fuel to turn to lacquer.</p>

<p>Not a big conspiracy on the fuel manufacturers side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will mess up any engine stored with this fuel for a sustained period of time. Not just older engines. </p>

<p>The fuel with ethanol kills tons of lawn mowers and weed wackers every year after they are stored during the winter. Most people just end up buying new ones come spring. It&#39;s really sort of crazy.</p>

<p>But non-ethanol fuel can be bought and is becoming easier to find if you look for it. Where I am from, right after the my started adding ethanol to fuel, the non-ethanol stuff was only offered by a few places.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe there are still some marine fuels (gas and diesel) that don&#39;t contain ethanol. You&#39;d probably have to go to a marina to find it, but in my county there&#39;s one gas station that has a pump dedicated to marine gas (it&#39;s near a recreational lake).</p>
