       Trump definitely baited everyone into kneeling. Thing is, most Americans don't care if you're rebelling against trump or not. They do care if you kneel for the national anthem though.

       He is opposite of what you want out of a leader, and you love it. He made this an issue when it wasn't. He attacks people because it gets his base riled up when he does little that's positive.

       No, he baited idiots into protesting against their own country. That's how pathetic the "resistance" has become. Trump could say he likes puppies, and his opponents will sacrifice every dog they can to make a "point".

       So, basically, they were disrespecting the fans/country before Trump said anything, and now they're doubling down on it because Trump called out their bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people are siding with Trump on this issue, too, because it's like you said: this shouldn't have been an issue in the first place. Choosing to mock honoring our nation just to rebel against an intangible issue is retarded. Unfortunately, a few people have too much pride than to just agree with Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manipulated / baited -- doesn't matter. Country was already divided, and Trump took advantage of his opposition's idiocy.

       Lol. I honestly don't give a shit about the NFL, but this "protest" bullshit is bullshit. Not sure why I can't agree with the president that these over-paid prima donnas should be fired for shitting on the country for an effort to "protest" a convoluted problem without proposing

       How exactly are they shitting on our country? You are so offended but can't explain why. And they're raising awareness, but people don't want to hear that America has problems so they shift the goal posts to MUH FLAG, MUH COUNTRY

       Raising awareness on what? More conversation is being spent on their stupid stunt than whatever point they're trying to make. Wanna know why? It's because they have nothing to say or offer. Instead, they spend more time trying to plan a controversy than an actual solution to anything.

       I think it will backfire on Trump. He is telling a private business what to do. It will just be another example of his bullying, his ego and desire to distract. So many have spoken against him on this, veterans included. It does not make the opposition look as bad as it makes him look.

       I've spoken to 3 vets in my family who love football. They loved what Trump said and refuse to watch any NFL. Anecdotal evidence of course, but I think this is a lot bigger than people on the other end of the aisle realize.

       It's scary how some are pushing this uber patriotic agenda where it is no longer acceptable to protest in the land of the free. If you don't like protests in America then I suggest you move to North Korea.

       That's the part that gets to me. The flag means nothing if American's aren't free to take a knee if they wish. The militarization of police is real, and it will just keep growing if nothing is done to raise awareness of this issue.

       This is kinda irrelevant but an interesting fact, I was watching AHS S1 and Moira was talking about the history of hysteria. Hysteria comes from the Greek word of uterus and for hundreds maybe thousands of years Drs would diagnose (only) women with hysteria due to their uterus bouncing around their body and the cure was for the Drs to give the patient an orgasm called hysterical paroxysm. I looked it up and it actually happened. That was an interesting fact to share and that is a great show to watch if you haven't already. In S2 the talk about operation paperclip and other historical facts not mentioned often in mainstream shows

       Were they all protesting racism and police brutality? Well some claimed to be protesting Trumps tweet. I believe some did because their teammates did.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I see protesters, I hear chants, I see signs, I watch the people being interviewed. Their message is usually clear and they are all out for the same cause. I don't get that feeling from the NFL teams/players that knelt or linked arms or just didn't come out for the anthem.

       Divide society into two, and make them fight with each other. Always use a side to front an agenda. It's an old, dirty trick, of powerful groups throughout history. You're better off unplugged and learning with your own eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are trying to engineer society now more then ever. Trying to structure things to their thought forms. The old days of honor and simplicity are starting to pass, which to me, is a sign of death and chaos, for the cycle to begin anew.
