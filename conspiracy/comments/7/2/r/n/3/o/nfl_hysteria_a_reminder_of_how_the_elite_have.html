<p>He is opposite of what you want out of a leader, and you love it. He made this an issue when it wasn&#39;t. He attacks people because it gets his base riled up when he does little that&#39;s positive.</p>

<p>No, he baited idiots into protesting against their own country. That&#39;s how pathetic the &quot;resistance&quot; has become. Trump could say he likes puppies, and his opponents will sacrifice every dog they can to make a &quot;point&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, basically, they were disrespecting the fans/country before Trump said anything, and now they&#39;re doubling down on it because Trump called out their bullshit. </p>

<p>Most people are siding with Trump on this issue, too, because it&#39;s like you said: this shouldn&#39;t have been an issue in the first place. Choosing to mock honoring our nation just to rebel against an intangible issue is retarded. Unfortunately, a few people have too much pride than to just agree with Trump. </p>

<p>Manipulated / baited -- doesn&#39;t matter. Country was already divided, and Trump took advantage of his opposition&#39;s idiocy.</p>

<p>Lol. I honestly don&#39;t give a shit about the NFL, but this &quot;protest&quot; bullshit is bullshit. Not sure why I can&#39;t agree with the president that these over-paid prima donnas should be fired for shitting on the country for an effort to &quot;protest&quot; a convoluted problem without proposing <em>any</em> solution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is kinda irrelevant but an interesting fact, I was watching AHS S1 and Moira was talking about the history of hysteria. Hysteria comes from the Greek word of uterus and for hundreds maybe thousands of years Drs would diagnose (only) women with hysteria due to their uterus bouncing around their body and the cure was for the Drs to give the patient an orgasm called hysterical paroxysm. I looked it up and it actually happened. That was an interesting fact to share and that is a great show to watch if you haven&#39;t already. In S2 the talk about operation paperclip and other historical facts not mentioned often in mainstream shows </p>

<p>When I see protesters, I hear chants, I see signs, I watch the people being interviewed. Their message is usually clear and they are all out for the same cause. I don&#39;t get that feeling from the NFL teams/players that knelt or linked arms or just didn&#39;t come out for the anthem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Divide society into two, and make them fight with each other. Always use a side to front an agenda. It&#39;s an old, dirty trick, of powerful groups throughout history. You&#39;re better off unplugged and learning with your own eyes.</p>

<p>They are trying to engineer society now more then ever. Trying to structure things to their thought forms. The old days of honor and simplicity are starting to pass, which to me, is a sign of death and chaos, for the cycle to begin anew. </p>
