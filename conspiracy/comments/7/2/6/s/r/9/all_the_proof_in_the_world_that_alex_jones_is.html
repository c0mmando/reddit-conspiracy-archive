<p>There is an advantage to viewing user post histories to see where they are coming from especially when they are posting in subreddits like this.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;m on the same page.  He&#39;s a product of Project Mockingbird\CoIntelPro flat out. Bill Cooper called him out a long time ago and it fully defined Alex Jones&#39; persona and how it would progress incrementally especially when the &quot;truther&quot; movement started gaining traction around the early 2000&#39;s.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex jones is playing a separate role for another audience. His area is black propaganda.</p>

<p>First, I would like to direct you to this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6shdlr/psyops_need_to_be_discussed_more_openly/dlcs2yc/">comment</a> because its highly relevant to someone like Alex jones or any media organization.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Alex Jones is running a complex long term operation. He starts by saying the truth and attracts an audience. He keeps building this audience and his audience starts becoming loyal to him since hes saying the truth all the time. At a critical time in history(now probably), he starts his disinfo campaign to steer his audience in the wrong direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jones went from calling Putin a demon spearheading the NWO to praising him and saying he&#39;s just doing what&#39;s right for his country. He has Aleksandr Dugin appear on InfoWars to defend Russia and Putin. Dugin wrote <em>The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia</em>, which is pretty much about how Russia can control the world and is explicitly anti-American. Yes, Alex Jones, the great unsullied patriot, is rubbing ideological shoulders with a man who develops a strategy for the downfall of America and global supremacy of Russia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But people would be so much less aware had it not been for Jones. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. Maybe if he wasn&#39;t as extreme as he is...but hell, that Bohemian Grove video? No way they would have let that slide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Less aware of what? Jones didn&#39;t bring anything new to the table. He came onto the scene in 1996. Before that time, there were dozens of people talking about the same stuff and more. You think Jones was the first one because you never heard of the others. There is a reason for that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jones went from calling Putin a demon spearheading the NWO to praising him and saying he&#39;s just doing what&#39;s right for his country. He has Aleksandr Dugin appear on InfoWars to defend Russia and Putin. Dugin wrote <em>The Foundations of Geopolitics: The Geopolitical Future of Russia</em>, which is pretty much about how Russia can control the world and is explicitly anti-American. Yes, Alex Jones, the great unsullied patriot, is rubbing ideological shoulders with a man who develops a strategy for the downfall of America and global supremacy of Russia. </p>

<p>Something is obviously not right. </p>
