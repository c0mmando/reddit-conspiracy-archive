    <div class="md"><p>We will know for sure after the forthcoming monetary calamity; that&#39;s already baked in the cake, nobody can change that. Perhaps delay it a bit more, but it&#39;s inevitable. This current twilight-zone of ZIRP, NIRP and QE won&#39;t last much longer. It&#39;s complete madness.</p>

<p>When it happens, if he does pursue an &quot;America-first&quot; policy, abolishes the Fed, and acts in favor of an honest monetary reform, he&#39;s the real deal. If he attends an international summit and signs the US into a Bretton Woods 2.0 agreement, he&#39;s a traitor. </p>

<p>Keep one thing in mind: if the 2nd scenario is the plan, the planners would <em>need</em> a president who presents himself a nationalist. Otherwise the people would never accept it. Clinton (or another overt globalist) would be hanged if they tried, there would be a revolution (given the Weimar-like price inflation it will entail).</p>

<p>What I&#39;m wondering is, if he does that, and comes back saying &quot;I negotiated a great deal!&quot; how much of his base know enough about monetary history to turn against him.</p>

<p>But maybe you are correct, I wouldn&#39;t bet my right arm on any possibility. Time will tell, soon.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand, why would being a Nationalists be required for signing Bretton Woods 2.0? That&#39;s a Globalist action to take??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, absolutely. I mean someone who would do something so blatantly internationalist would have to be <em>perceived</em> as a nationalist.</p>

<p>For example, the planners <em>needed</em> someone that &quot;appeared&quot; pacifist as Obama, with the Nobel peace prize, etc., so that identity biases may undermine the outrage/revolt. Remember the demonstrations in America before the Bush/Cheney campaign in Irak; yet silence when Obama initiated violence against Sudan, Lybia, Pakistan (drones), Afghanistan (surge), Syria, Ukraine, etc. So why is it so? Because he was <em>perceived</em> as a pacifist my many, thus cognitive dissonance and identity biases prevented them from observing reality as it was.</p>

<p>To get the American south on board a morbid globalist monetary project, they would have to identify with the president doing it; all these ridiculous attacks on Trump are meant to enrage those (righteous) people, so that they may &quot;identify&quot; with him all that more, so they may ignore (legitimate) flaws, and so ultimately they may accept whatever is in store.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m talking about the inception of the EU, a multi-national trade agreement not all that different from Bretton-Woods.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to reconcile the Trump being the necessary Nationalist, with the Russia media barrage and Mueller investigation.</p>

<p>I tend to think that Bush/Cruz was supposed to be that character, but Trump usurped the role and caused chaos in the scheme.</p>

<p>GLADIO never ended, and spread to America. 911 and all subsequent &quot;Islamic&quot; terror attacks are part of it. Sibel Edmonds calls it GLADIO 2.</p>

<p>Cops are going to become worse and worse, they are trying to force martial law, which is going to happen, they want to create a war between civilians and Police, civilians don&#39;t care but many don&#39;t see it, at this point, enough of the apple trees are rotten that the entire orchard is tainted. </p>

<p>They are going to find a way of forcing martial law. It will likely start when people start defending themselves from police officers. </p>

<p>It seems like every blockbuster movie is about collapse, war, etc now.</p>

<p>So how does that work exactly? All the big movies are written by people who are &quot;in on it?&quot;  Or only movies that fit their narrative get approved for loans to start filming? </p>
