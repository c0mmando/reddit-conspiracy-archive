<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br/>
After reading this you&#39;ll NEVER EVER click again &quot;North Korea v USA&quot; type of illuminati propaganda or RT, CNN, FOX, BBC, etc. &quot;news&quot; sites ...<br/>
... unless you were already reduced to human cattle.</p>

<p><strong>Why &quot;NEVER EVER&quot; - the two KEY facts that even a child understands</strong><br/>
1. The list of illuminati TV stations includes ALL TV stations that you get on cable or only on satellite ... and beyond.<br/>
All controlled by one and the same secret society:<br/>
- from &quot;mainstream&quot;, such as BBC News and CNN, to &quot;alternative&quot; channels [starting with the global leader, Russia&#39;s RT];<br/>
- ... and beyond, such as North Korea&#39;s TV, which plays a special &quot;alternative news&quot; role, casted as &quot;<em>mouthpiece of a rogue state</em>&quot; ever since the illuminati got control of its government.</p>

<p>2&amp;#46; GLOBAL HEADLINES - ALL ACTORS used to mock human cattle and reduce the rest to the same condition.<br/>
Anyone or any event making global headlines is a psy-op advancing the illuminati agendas, with a few, very few exceptions, in areas such as natural catastrophes.<br/>
In other words: headlines are part of the foundations of the matrix created by the illuminati for you to live in.<br/>
In this simulation the link to reality ranges from diversion to rewriting it in black is white.</p>

<p><strong>More basic facts - implied in the two KEY facts</strong><br/>
3&amp;#46; What goes for TV stations is also valid for any other mass media and beyond: ALL TOTALLY controlled by the illuminati.<br/>
What beyond in this case means: any outlet mentioned by mass media [such as AleCIA Jones&#39;s Prison Planet &amp; Co.].<br/>
That&#39;s why NONE of these outlets will question let alone contradict ANY of the core lies propagated by ALL TV stations.</p>

<p>4&amp;#46; Everyone &quot;reporting&quot; or &quot;commenting&quot; national or international politics is an illuminati agent, who knows exactly what lines in script he&#39;s supposed to tell.<br/>
The list includes about anyone else appearing regularly in the media, with a few, very few exceptions, in areas such as weather forecast or cooking.</p>

<p>5&amp;#46;  There&#39;s NO such thing as LIVE TV.<br/>
In other words: it&#39;s impossible for a truther to unexpectedly expose any illuminati core lies because the broadcast would be interrupted during the time gap, the buffer of a few seconds delay used to prevent it.</p>

<p><strong>STOP clicking &quot;North Korea v USA&quot; theater</strong><br/>
August 9, 2017 - illuminati staged the act <em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6umdlq/illuminati_theater_the_pentagon_prepares/">The Pentagon Prepares Pre-Emptive Strike Plan for North Korea</a></em>.<br/>
The agenda was exposed worldwide first long ago by one and only TRUE Prophet.  </p>

<p>September 23, 2017 - Kim-Jung Un on stage again to repeat additional superfluous theater acts in the ongoing &quot;nuclear rogue state&quot; series.<br/>
As expected, nothing new in the script, from advancing general and specific agendas to the recurring cast of actors.</p>

<p><strong>Fear of nukes? Then you&#39;ve been reduced to a specimen of human cattle that will swallow ANYTHING, each time it&#39;s fed with &quot;science&quot; to &quot;news&quot;.</strong><br/>
Only human cattle brainwashed by the illuminati click &quot;North Korea v USA&quot; articles and threads (or naive children).<br/>
Human cattle are identifiable by their inability to compute 1+1 sums upon facts, real or true, even when presented in the same article, which also means: almost no limits for serving any script as &quot;news&quot;.<br/>
Scripts without limits are responsible for extending the nuclear weapons hoax  from &quot;<em>if you have it then you have it all</em>&quot; to &quot;<em>nuclear deterrence / mutual assured destruction</em>&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1+1 equation:</strong><br/>
- illuminati suggest &quot;<em>the total destruction of the city of Hiroshima, Japan</em>&quot; with a nuclear weapon, supposedly able to wipe out anything in a mile radius from the epicenter;<br/>
- buildings still standing near Hiroshima&#39;s ground zero and no aerial footage documenting the level of destruction;<br/>
- the sum of these two facts reveals this was one of the core [ _ _ _ _ _ s ] used to brainwash the global audience ever since.<br/>
Try to solve the riddle, the 5 missing characters.</p>

<p><strong>CONTEXT</strong><br/>
What type theater is being served by the illuminati actor playing &quot;N Korea great leader&quot; cast for 9/23?<br/>
Answer: Fake Armageddon.<br/>
After reading this, anyone not reduced to a beast should know what the nuclear illuminati theater &quot;North Korea v USA&quot; is about:<br/>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/721nn0/illuminati_actor_playing_n_korea_great_leader/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/721nn0/illuminati_actor_playing_n_korea_great_leader/</a></p>

<p>COMING SOON: theater act &quot;Obama arrested &amp;#42;&amp;#42;LIVE&amp;#42;&amp;#42; on TV with senate and congress members as background&quot;, a remake of the N Korea theater.<br/>

<p>From having hundreds of thousands hysterically scream &quot;Heil Fuhrer&quot; in Korean to staging the &quot;lover Dennis Rodman&quot; script.<br/>
All part of the same gang of illuminazi puppets executing orders from one and the same:<br/>
- 28 governors of EU states who are still called prime-ministers or presidents, BushClinton since 1988 including Hitlery since 2008 (&quot;Hussein Obama&quot; will now be stripped);<br/>
- BRICS (fake Putin, China, India, South Africa), &quot;enemies&quot; from Iran&#39;s Ayatollahs to Cuba and North Korea and the ISIS caliphate alias the Raqqa mini-state; fake Sunnis of Turkey, Saudi and Egypt gov.<br/>

<p>Correct, a consequence of the Laws of End Times Reductionism, which were formulated first time by Matt Marriott, in Illuminati End Times.<br/>
The OP article is already written in it&#39;s most concise form. It cannot be reduced any further while still remaining as comprehensive in scope.<br/>

<p>The article&#39;s title is obviously self-explanatory, but I will humor your &quot;question&quot;.<br/>
My comments are noted after the  bolded title sections. </p>

<p><strong>Children:</strong><br/>
Children not yet totally brainwashed are the intended audience for which this article was primarily authored, although it&#39;s recommended for everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Read this to &amp;#42;&amp;#42;&amp;#42; STOP &amp;#42;&amp;#42;&amp;#42; clicking illuminazi theater &quot;North Korea v USA&quot;.</strong><br/>
Specifically explained in the article&#39;s &quot;Introduction&quot; section.<br/>
Extended Introduction:<br/>
After reading this, you will know not only everything about the staged &quot;North Korea v USA&quot;  hoax but also the complete list of &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;alternative&quot;  illuminati TV &quot;news&quot; stations, part of the matrix created for you to live in.<br/>
Consequently, you will also now be aware of the illuminazi theater and media in its entirety.<br/>
You will then &quot;NEVER EVER&quot;  waste your time again by clicking any of the millions of pages propagating the &quot;North Korea v USA&quot; hoax ... unless you were already reduced to totally brainwashed human cattle.</p>

<p><strong>Script: Marketing the &quot;nuclear weapons capability of annihilating the enemy&quot; HOAX.</strong><br/>
This line of the article&#39;s title identifies that the &quot;North Korea v USA&quot; hoax is entirely scripted, i.e. there will be NO attack to North Korea, and that one of the main goals to stage this theater is to market yet another hoax:  &quot;Nuclear weapons capabability of wiping out the enemy&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I shouldn&#39;t need to explain how poorly this is written ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, you do need to explain exactly what&#39;s supposedly &quot;poorly&quot; written because your only statement you quoted does NOT support your &quot;argument&quot;.<br/>
I just demonstrated that the article&#39;s title CANNOT be written anymore concise.<br/>
Beyond that, it appears you&#39;re the only poster who cannot understand that which everyone else can.<br/>
So, what&#39;s that say about you? I don&#39;t think Last Prophet&#39;s words are the problem.</p>

If &quot;Yes&quot;, then present the audience with the best &quot;supported&quot; evidence that you believe debunks any of the five facts.</p>

<p>Then you&#39;re desperately holding on to a weak assertion that only a very few (compared to the volume of thread traffic) are willing to assert.<br/>
You also &quot;conveniently&quot; ignore that other posters have vouched for Last Prophet&#39;s writing readability, which contradicts the &quot;inarticulate&quot; narrative you&#39;ve been attempting to convince the audience of.  </p>

<p>Talk about &quot;vague&quot;: it perfectly describes your baseless &quot;argument&quot;.<br/>
Starting with your refusal (or inability, what&#39;s more probable) to cite even one specific example that&#39;s supposedly &quot;inarticulate&quot;, much less offer an explanation of in what way.<br/>
Falsely alleging &quot;everything&quot; in OP is incomprehensible is not only a lie but also attempts the disguise of your complete lack of any valid logical argument based on evidence.<br/>
So, how much longer are you going to play &quot;ignorant&quot;?</p>

<p><strong>As far as &quot;why riddles?&quot; ...</strong><br/>
No, it&#39;s not to &quot;<em>sway anyone to your way of thinking</em>&quot;, what logically makes NO sense.</p>

<p>The simple TRUTH:<br/>
1) - One of the basic laws of End Times Reductionism: exposing basic conspiracies resumes to add 1 + 1.<br/>
2) - Another basic law of End Times Reductionism: the capacity of the masses to perform this computation has been reduced to the utter limits, aka total brainwash.</p>

<p>My &quot;Egg of Columbus&quot; approach is a consequence of these two laws.
It is the last chance for the brainwashed masses to use their brain to realize to what lengths they were deceived. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for <strong>YOU</strong>, it seems there&#39;s nothing left to use for that realization.</p>

<p>You must first successfully convey what your ideas are before anyone can consider them obvious in hindsight. My point is you&#39;re incompetent as expressing your ideas coherently.

<p>Your mention of the Egg of Columbus is irrelevant. Your ideas cannot be evaluated because of how inept you are at expressing them.</p>

<p>&quot;Dehumanizing&quot; is an illuminati commandment, not mine.  </p>

He uses several fake identities, two of them as &quot;British Sir&quot; and one as &quot;American patriot&quot;.<br/>
