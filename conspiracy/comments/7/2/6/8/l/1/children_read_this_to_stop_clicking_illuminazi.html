      </h1>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Introduction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       After reading this you'll NEVER EVER click again "North Korea v USA" type of illuminati propaganda or RT, CNN, FOX, BBC, etc. "news" sites ...
       <br/>
       ... unless you were already reduced to human cattle.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Why "NEVER EVER" - the two KEY facts that even a child understands
       </strong>
       <br/>
       1. The list of illuminati TV stations includes ALL TV stations that you get on cable or only on satellite ... and beyond.
       <br/>
       All controlled by one and the same secret society:
       <br/>
       - from "mainstream", such as BBC News and CNN, to "alternative" channels [starting with the global leader, Russia's RT];
       <br/>
       - ... and beyond, such as North Korea's TV, which plays a special "alternative news" role, casted as "
       <em>
        mouthpiece of a rogue state
       </em>
       " ever since the illuminati got control of its government.
      </p>
      <p>
       2&amp;#46; GLOBAL HEADLINES - ALL ACTORS used to mock human cattle and reduce the rest to the same condition.
       <br/>
       Anyone or any event making global headlines is a psy-op advancing the illuminati agendas, with a few, very few exceptions, in areas such as natural catastrophes.
       <br/>
       In other words: headlines are part of the foundations of the matrix created by the illuminati for you to live in.
       <br/>
       In this simulation the link to reality ranges from diversion to rewriting it in black is white.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        More basic facts - implied in the two KEY facts
       </strong>
       <br/>
       3&amp;#46; What goes for TV stations is also valid for any other mass media and beyond: ALL TOTALLY controlled by the illuminati.
       <br/>
       What beyond in this case means: any outlet mentioned by mass media [such as AleCIA Jones's Prison Planet &amp; Co.].
       <br/>
       That's why NONE of these outlets will question let alone contradict ANY of the core lies propagated by ALL TV stations.
      </p>
      <p>
       4&amp;#46; Everyone "reporting" or "commenting" national or international politics is an illuminati agent, who knows exactly what lines in script he's supposed to tell.
       <br/>
       The list includes about anyone else appearing regularly in the media, with a few, very few exceptions, in areas such as weather forecast or cooking.
      </p>
      <p>
       5&amp;#46;  There's NO such thing as LIVE TV.
       <br/>
       In other words: it's impossible for a truther to unexpectedly expose any illuminati core lies because the broadcast would be interrupted during the time gap, the buffer of a few seconds delay used to prevent it.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        STOP clicking "North Korea v USA" theater
       </strong>
       <br/>
       August 9, 2017 - illuminati staged the act
       <em>
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6umdlq/illuminati_theater_the_pentagon_prepares/">
         The Pentagon Prepares Pre-Emptive Strike Plan for North Korea
        </a>
       </em>
       .
       <br/>
       The agenda was exposed worldwide first long ago by one and only TRUE Prophet.
      </p>
      <p>
       September 23, 2017 - Kim-Jung Un on stage again to repeat additional superfluous theater acts in the ongoing "nuclear rogue state" series.
       <br/>
       As expected, nothing new in the script, from advancing general and specific agendas to the recurring cast of actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Fear of nukes? Then you've been reduced to a specimen of human cattle that will swallow ANYTHING, each time it's fed with "science" to "news".
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Only human cattle brainwashed by the illuminati click "North Korea v USA" articles and threads (or naive children).
       <br/>
       Human cattle are identifiable by their inability to compute 1+1 sums upon facts, real or true, even when presented in the same article, which also means: almost no limits for serving any script as "news".
       <br/>
       Scripts without limits are responsible for extending the nuclear weapons hoax  from "
       <em>
        if you have it then you have it all
       </em>
       " to "
       <em>
        nuclear deterrence / mutual assured destruction
       </em>
       ".
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Example 1+1 equation:
       </strong>
       <br/>
       - illuminati suggest "
       <em>
        the total destruction of the city of Hiroshima, Japan
       </em>
       " with a nuclear weapon, supposedly able to wipe out anything in a mile radius from the epicenter;
       <br/>
       - buildings still standing near Hiroshima's ground zero and no aerial footage documenting the level of destruction;
       <br/>
       - the sum of these two facts reveals this was one of the core [ _ _ _ _ _ s ] used to brainwash the global audience ever since.
       <br/>
       Try to solve the riddle, the 5 missing characters.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        CONTEXT
       </strong>
       <br/>
       What type theater is being served by the illuminati actor playing "N Korea great leader" cast for 9/23?
       <br/>
       Answer: Fake Armageddon.
       <br/>
       After reading this, anyone not reduced to a beast should know what the nuclear illuminati theater "North Korea v USA" is about:

       From having hundreds of thousands hysterically scream "Heil Fuhrer" in Korean to staging the "lover Dennis Rodman" script.
       <br/>
       All part of the same gang of illuminazi puppets executing orders from one and the same:
       <br/>
       - 28 governors of EU states who are still called prime-ministers or presidents, BushClinton since 1988 including Hitlery since 2008 ("Hussein Obama" will now be stripped);
       <br/>
       - BRICS (fake Putin, China, India, South Africa), "enemies" from Iran's Ayatollahs to Cuba and North Korea and the ISIS caliphate alias the Raqqa mini-state; fake Sunnis of Turkey, Saudi and Egypt gov.

       Correct, a consequence of the Laws of End Times Reductionism, which were formulated first time by Matt Marriott, in Illuminati End Times.
       <br/>
       The OP article is already written in it's most concise form. It cannot be reduced any further while still remaining as comprehensive in scope.

       The article's title is obviously self-explanatory, but I will humor your "question".
       <br/>
       My comments are noted after the  bolded title sections.

       <strong>
        Children:
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Children not yet totally brainwashed are the intended audience for which this article was primarily authored, although it's recommended for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Read this to &amp;#42;&amp;#42;&amp;#42; STOP &amp;#42;&amp;#42;&amp;#42; clicking illuminazi theater "North Korea v USA".
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Specifically explained in the article's "Introduction" section.
       <br/>
       Extended Introduction:
       <br/>
       After reading this, you will know not only everything about the staged "North Korea v USA"  hoax but also the complete list of "serious" and "alternative"  illuminati TV "news" stations, part of the matrix created for you to live in.
       <br/>
       Consequently, you will also now be aware of the illuminazi theater and media in its entirety.
       <br/>
       You will then "NEVER EVER"  waste your time again by clicking any of the millions of pages propagating the "North Korea v USA" hoax ... unless you were already reduced to totally brainwashed human cattle.

        Script: Marketing the "nuclear weapons capability of annihilating the enemy" HOAX.
       </strong>
       <br/>
       This line of the article's title identifies that the "North Korea v USA" hoax is entirely scripted, i.e. there will be NO attack to North Korea, and that one of the main goals to stage this theater is to market yet another hoax:  "Nuclear weapons capabability of wiping out the enemy".

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, you do need to explain exactly what's supposedly "poorly" written because your only statement you quoted does NOT support your "argument".
       <br/>
       I just demonstrated that the article's title CANNOT be written anymore concise.
       <br/>
       Beyond that, it appears you're the only poster who cannot understand that which everyone else can.
       <br/>
       So, what's that say about you? I don't think Last Prophet's words are the problem.

       I'd suggest you proofread your own posts, as they all exemplify the criticism I'm offering, but I fear you lack the language skills to understand just how inarticulate you are. You have successfully applied the Dunning-Kruger effect to basic communication.

       Then you're desperately holding on to a weak assertion that only a very few (compared to the volume of thread traffic) are willing to assert.
       <br/>
       You also "conveniently" ignore that other posters have vouched for Last Prophet's writing readability, which contradicts the "inarticulate" narrative you've been attempting to convince the audience of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talk about "vague": it perfectly describes your baseless "argument".
       <br/>
       Starting with your refusal (or inability, what's more probable) to cite even one specific example that's supposedly "inarticulate", much less offer an explanation of in what way.
       <br/>
       Falsely alleging "everything" in OP is incomprehensible is not only a lie but also attempts the disguise of your complete lack of any valid logical argument based on evidence.
       <br/>
       So, how much longer are you going to play "ignorant"?

       The odds of two different people managing to come up with nearly identical illiterate drivel so similar in structure is slim. If you aren't the same person, then one of you is so completely submissive to the other as to have completely suppressed all independent thought, having become an intellectual slave to the other. That, or you're blatantly plagiarizing Matt Marriott in many of your posts.

       Last Prophet and I are the only two members of the smallest organization in the Universe, the Web of TRUTH.

       TRUTH is revealed (WHAT happened and what is
       <strong>
        going to happen
       </strong>
       ; WHY it happened or will happen) by the last End Times Prophet and echoed by Kyoon. The Laws of End Times Reductionism are found at the basic layer of the TRUTH.

      <p>
       The simple TRUTH:
       <br/>
       1) - One of the basic laws of End Times Reductionism: exposing basic conspiracies resumes to add 1 + 1.
       <br/>
       2) - Another basic law of End Times Reductionism: the capacity of the masses to perform this computation has been reduced to the utter limits, aka total brainwash.
      </p>
      <p>
       My "Egg of Columbus" approach is a consequence of these two laws.
It is the last chance for the brainwashed masses to use their brain to realize to what lengths they were deceived.

       You must first successfully convey what your ideas are before anyone can consider them obvious in hindsight. My point is you're incompetent as expressing your ideas coherently. Written onanism about how brilliant you think your ideas are does NOTHING to address the fact that you are incapable of expressing them intelligibly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your mention of the Egg of Columbus is irrelevant. Your ideas cannot be evaluated because of how inept you are at expressing them.

        dehumanizing your critics

      <p>
       "Dehumanizing" is an illuminati commandment, not mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make no mistake:
       <br/>
       The illuminati refer to their slaves as human cattle, humans totally reduced to beasts (subhuman or untermensch).
       <br/>
       The first commandment of the illuminati religion states that almost everyone is part of the human cattle, good for nothing but to be
       <strong>
        mocked, humiliated, enslaved and slaughtered
       </strong>

       First off, Why do you call yourself a prophet?...
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, I've been reading and trying to make sense of all your posts, but you really need a better way of explaining things other than just linking to your articles/blog posts (which are written the same way). I mean some of it makes sense, but then you throw in riddles (wtf?) and try to hint at things instead of just straight up saying them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't it be easier to spread the truth by simply saying it? Instead of making riddles and linking a bunch of blog posts?

       Last Prophet's "Egg of Columbus" approach is a consequence of these two laws. It is the last chance for the brainwashed masses to use their brain to realize to what lengths they were deceived.

       Modern History's most bombastic revelation by Last Prophet, March 2013
       <br/>
       Name of current Illuminati LEADER: Alexander Adolf Hitler is the current Grand Master of the Ordo Illuminatus.
       <br/>
       He uses several fake identities, two of them as "British Sir" and one as "American patriot".

       The OP article is already written in it's most concise form. It cannot be reduced any further while still remaining as comprehensive in scope.
