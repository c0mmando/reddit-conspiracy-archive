       Do you think people would slow their roll on breeding if they realized they were living under a firmament, and that, presumably, every possibility that humankind could create was limited to that particular space, forever and ever amen?  Would this psychologically create the drive to chill out?  Or would it create the drive to make sure your line continued for however long this particular experiment was in play?  Or, would a philosophy of balance find a foothold in the population because it's the only way to make things tolerable for everyone in a lasting way?

      <p>
       yeah that's what i've heard too.
      </p>
      <p>
       another correlate with similar trends is urban/rural.  i think a sustainable family unit size depends on the burden required to operate it.  if your family is too big it's much harder to sustain.  the tendency has been that urban/developed living drops family sizes, and that rural living increases them.  not sure what that says about the burden modern society carries with it, as you'd expect with more free time people might want to be more invested in their kids lives.  also this urban/rural difference is a trend that isn't just local to the west.
      </p>
      <p>
       re: intelligence.  i've noticed that what we take for intelligence is often not real true independent thinking but conformity to external standards, and this is usually accompanied by corresponding amounts of douchiness.  real independent thinkers tend to be more non-conformist, and because of this, more cool in general as they've had to deal with the naysayers.  this also drives towards being nicer.  i'd rather select for nice than what we think of as intelligence as a general rule.   and i think you can reason with nice people more easily than you can with people who are always seeking advantage.   even with the higher birth rate trends.

       can you prove the world is overpopulated? a member here came up with a theory i had never thought of before. we're told there is 7.5 billion people on earth........but is there really?

       i'd say saturn/set.  why?  we were created by it.  why are we in a petri dish we can't escape?  looking at how humans deal with things they're very selfish, and aren't easy with the exchange of energies.  this would be hella annoying to any sufficiently advanced culture, having to deal with a cohort of douchebags let loose on everyone.  we have no concept of infinities as a general class of people and this makes us very very short-sighted.  almost intolerably so.

       still..let's say we can't leave, and there's only so much room.  population would trend up if it didn't have natural limits, just based on geometric growth.  this assumes 2.1 kids on average.  if we don't hit that we're good.  anyway, if the population increase numbers are to be believed, we're seeing geometric growth.

       I think we have very little influence over population growth of our own species.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overpopulation is NOT a myth. Space does not equal arable land.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans are animals with the same instincts as all other animals. We don't have to contemplate the pros and cons of procreation, it just happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a society called the Koreshans who did not believe in procreation and successfully controlled that aspect of their culture. They're all dead - not surprisingly. With no progeny to carry on, the entire culture died out - and it was a lovely little society!
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't slow down the world population at all!
      </p>
      <p>
       While it slows down in one area, it will bloom in another until it is no longer supportable and then it will crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no reason to believe that our species will survive much beyond any other species tends to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       99% of all species that have ever existed are now extinct.

        What we should be aiming for is limiting the amount of suffering and promoting the greatest happiness and comfort - that means fewer people and sharing resources between those fewer people.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       hypothetically if we come up with a standard for what everyone gets in terms of resources, shared or otherwise, and this standard has a predictable consumption, then by definition you could define a steady state.  now whether you get compliance is another thing.  but the achievement of steady state is possible if it can be conceived of.  it's an arrangement problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       the compliance thing - ok that's more problematic.  but you can demonstrate and convince people of why these standards exists - if they are written clearly and the intent is clear.  there are other devices to get compliance that are not violent or particularly coercive - such as showing what compliance provides.  the proverbial carrot.  so i'm not sure that we can't get this thing to work.  it just requires everybody to be on the same page.  yes that's globalness of some sort, but so what.  global is just a label.  communication has brought us much closer together.  we're global now, already.  the people who aren't playing well with everyone else - nobody will want to play with them.  that can be achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
       it's the fear of the out of control population that makes us to stupid things.  it's a fear of ourselves.  i don't think we need to be afraid of ourselves.  we just need to understand ourselves and how we should interact with each other.  we're smart enough to make it work, because we're smart enough to see the consequences of not making it work.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you look at most of the examples of people acting badly, there's almost always a causality to it.  there are triggers and circumstances.  we can remove those bad modes.  we have absurdly stupid policy that causes totally avoidable problems.  but we perpetuate it and don't fix it.  but we can fix them.  that is our problem.  our leadership is the problem.  get rid of all the instances of people throwing roadblocks in the way of real constructive dialogue amongst stakeholders, and people will come to consensus.  people are sick of the constant division that our leaders perpetuate.  this is not helpful.  it's not helpful to stifle the process of people finding consensus with one another.  get rid of that and we don't even know what's achievable.  we're being hamstrung by our own heroes because they can't conceive of a better reality, or because they themselves are constrained by the dirt they had to be laden with to get that power.  so it's perpetuates.  it doesn't have to.

       it's possible for people to disagree and to still cooperate.  this happens all the time.  the only thing that cooperation requires is agreement on language (which funnily enough is a form of cooperation itself, but i digress).  do that and you can define and put boxes around the things you do agree on.  arrange these consensus points out and what the gaps are (and they'll always exist) become opportunities for different models to compete against one another.  this is all doable.  a process can be agreed upon even if the outcome of that process cannot be agreed upon.  i'm not giving up on it.  what other choice do we have?
      </p>
      <p>
       i don't accept that people can't work together and find large consensus because i see it happen.  it's fractal.  the earth is just on a larger scale, but it's the same phenomenon.  people have agreed to drive opposite direction on different sides of the road.  yeah they may not agree on everything but they can agree on that, because they see the benefit of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       we may not be able to control all the variables true, but we only need to control ourselves, and that's well within our capacity.
