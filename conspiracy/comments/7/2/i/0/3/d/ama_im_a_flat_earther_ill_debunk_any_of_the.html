<p>The Earth is a strong electromagnetic field; the sun and moon are examples of perpetual motion and divine brilliance.  Compasses only work properly when they are flat and level. Planes always fly parallel to the horizon; the horizon always rises to eye level of the observer.</p>

<p>Gravity is just a theory... and it&#39;s a poor one. This supposed force of gravity is so strong it holds all of the oceans to the earth, while it spins at ridiculously high velocities, IN THE VACUUM OF INFINITE SPACE? Why can birds, bees, and butterflies so easily overcome this magical force of gravity? </p>

<p>Why? Because gravity isn&#39;t a force. Relativity is absolutely ridiculous. Einstein was not a very bright man...Physicists always need to correct and fabricate their equations/formulas in order to fit their needs. If a substance is lighter than the standard in which it&#39;s immersed (like air or water) then it will rise, if it is denser it will fall; it&#39;s that simple. </p>

<p>The Freemasons/founding fathers of fallacious fairy tale physics : 
Copernicus, Newton, Kepler, Einstein, Planck, and more...</p>

<p>All of the math can be proven wrong once you start realizing the speed of light isn&#39;t always constant, the formulas and constants are flawed, and the distances/methodologies used for deriving such constructs have been fabricated to fit the heliocentric hypothesis. </p>

<p>Ask me anything, I&#39;m an undergraduate student and I&#39;m passionate about the flat earth! :)</p>

<p>Makes no sense if you are hypothesizing gravity doesn&#39;t exist then to suggest that an object is being effected by gravity. </p>

<p>If they are dense they fall, if they are buoyant they sink much more slowly, float or rise. What you expect to happen in a vacuum or in &quot;the vacuum of space&quot; are both byproducts of your belief in GRAVITY and the very particular choices it makes.</p>

<p>Dense relative to what? If we put something in a vacuum, it has nothing to sink into. That&#39;s the point. Buoyancy has the gravitational constant in its calculation..</p>

<p>I&#39;m using the term &quot;zero-g&quot; for lack of a better one. The point was if gravity doesn&#39;t exist, anything in a vacuum should display weightlessness, because buoyant force does not apply in a vacuum. </p>

<p>Why would something appear weightless in a vacuum? The object still has weight.

The only proof or evidence of &quot;objects showing weightlessness&quot; are so called &quot;<em>space footage</em>&quot; or zero-g planes that &quot;simulate weightlessness&quot; by the using of extreme up-and-down flight paths. These people are not actually weightless, they are in fact falling, but are in an enclosed environment allowing them to SIMULATE what it would be like.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Buoyancy does not have the gravitational constant in it&#39;s calculation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>buoyancy force on an object is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object, or the density of the fluid multiplied by the submerged volume times gravitational acceleration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Objects &quot;in a vacuum&quot; do not just float and display weightlessness because that is &quot;ANTI-GRAVITY&quot; nonsense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is exactly what I&#39;m trying to tell you. The exact reason they <em>do not</em> do this is because of gravity. The <em>only</em> force acting upon an object in a vacuum assuming the vacuum on an object with significant mass (Earth) is gravity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Objects in a vacuum fall at the same speed because there is not atmospheric conditions within the vacuum to slow the descent of something less dense than the other, example a rock and a feather in a vacuum tube.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, exactly, there is no air resistance. They fall at the same rate, due to <em>gravity</em>. This is why objects of different densities fall at the same rate in a vacuum, and not at differing rates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is not &quot;the gravitational constant&quot; this is yet again the magical force of gravity having something attributed to it that doesn&#39;t require it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What force is acting upon the object then? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would something appear weightless in a vacuum? The object still has weight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Weight is the force of gravity on an object with mass, not sure how weight holds any sort of argument here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The idea you are presenting is ASSUMING gravity exists still.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not at all. If gravity doesn&#39;t exist, and there is absolutely nothing for a denser object to sink in to, or a buoyant object to rise through, what force is being applied to the object? This is why a helium filled balloon sinks in a vacuum, which is what I was talking about earlier. Helium is less dense than air, correct? why would it not still float? It sinks because the gravitational force is now overcoming the buoyant force that was once relevant due to the air around it being gone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on google right now. I see no ice walls at all that you speak of, only ice burgs and sheets of ice... No ice walls holding in literal oceans. If there were ice walls they would have to be pretty hefty to hold in all that ocean water.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not my job to prove the earth is round, you&#39;re making claims the earth is flat so that&#39;s on you to prove your position, so far I have seen no evidence whatsoever.</p>

<p>Also it wasn&#39;t 1961, it was 1959. And I see nothing about paid soldiers, patrols of ice walls, or anything similar.</p>

<p>&quot;The Antarctic Treaty was signed in Washington on 1 December 1959 by the twelve countries whose scientists had been active in and around Antarctica during the International Geophysical Year (IGY) of 1957-58. It entered into force in 1961 and has since been acceded to by many other nations.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ats.aq/e/ats.htm">http://www.ats.aq/e/ats.htm</a></p>

<p>Surely we would have heard from actual people patrolling this supposed ice wall? We&#39;ve heard nothing.</p>

<p>I ask you what makes you a firm believer in flat earth because everything points to it being a total hoax and something used to just discredit the conspiracy community. It&#39;s too easy to disprove flat earth. </p>

<p>Again, if you can link to actual photos of these ice walls, or link me to some form of evidence instead of trying to get me to google something, you&#39;d do yourself a favor.</p>

<p>All fluff, no substance. Please link us something otherwise this is just an opinion of yours.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And this is why your theory fails.</p>

<p>Because if there was a massive ice wall that is much larger than the land mass and there was a small sun above circling there is nonway it could warm the oceans as it does. The ice would creep and the ocean would freeze.</p>

<p>Second if the sun is traveling over a flat earth it would shrink and get smaller in the sky as opposed to dipping below the horizon and staying the same size throughout the day.</p>

<p>Lastly you have children can do experiments that give them evidence of the earths roundness.
What shape does a water droplet take in zero or lesser gravity? It is rounded or ovoid. As the earth was in it&#39;s liquid state. Though it is shaped more like a lumpy egg.</p>

<p>The flat earth re emergence is likely just a fun experiment for facebook and or the government to see how psuedo science spreads on the net. Very useful information.
So I hope you arent serious, you have provided nothing of substance here, your models are absurd, and I can only hope you are part of the spreading of the idea of research reasons.</p>

<p>I sure as hell can&#39;t do the science or math.  This is where trust has to come in.  I trust the majority and consensus of experts who have dedicated their lives to the study of math and science.  As opposed to some blogger that works at Walmart (or whatever).</p>

<p>On a related note, this is the same issue with news/fake news.  I trust reputable sources that have a history of integrity with fact checking.  As opposed to some Twitter/4chan poster claiming to be &quot;in the know&quot; - you just have to stay tuned for the next 28 days.</p>

<p>I am not smart enough to know math, science, geo-politics, geography, psychology, sociology and all the other host of subjects to be a well-rounded informed member of society - so I gotta trust someone or trust noone.  And if I chose to trust noone, I&#39;d have to check out of society and be a farmer.  And I can&#39;t keep shit alive, so that isn&#39;t an option.  Thus, trust in the majority and consensus of experts.</p>

<p>It was the initial point in fact.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[–]KarmicEnigma - 
That&#39;s a whole lot of maybe&#39;s vs. the provable theories of math and science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To prove a theory it needs to reflect reality. Science is experiment then observation. If observation doesn&#39;t fit the model the model is wrong, no matter the axioms or logic used to create the mathematical model. Use of logic limits error. It can still be applied incorrectly.</p>

<p>If the mathematical logic denotes something that isn&#39;t observable or it doesn&#39;t represent reality it simply doesn&#39;t represent reality. Math is a language with its own logical axioms (assigned by humans - balancing equations).</p>

<p>Verbal language is a language with its own logical axioms (assigned by humans - philosophy). Both are used to visualize and describe the world around us. As easy as it is for a mathematician to visualize real world descriptions using numbers, with logical axioms to facilitate or aid in the end result, a philosopher uses the same thing to describe the phenomena in spoken language - using logical axioms the same way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another flat argument that provides no proof to support the claims. Is this the most elaborate troll campaign in the history of the internet? So all of the math can be proven wrong and Einstein wasn&#39;t a very bright man? Say, mr. undergrad flat earth sage, can you prove the math wrong or provide any actual evidence that Einstein is incorrect? Can you give examples of how chemistry, math, physics, astronomy or actually anything prove flat earth theory to be correct? You have a baseless argument with no evidence to support your claims. If you want to be taken remotely seriously you have to come better than that. Or was this just for attention?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read two points that are patently false so I can not take this guy for anything. I don&#39;t have answers for every question he posed, however I will look into them. The two that stood out are 1: He asked *&quot;How do flat earthers scientifically predict upcoming solar and lunar eclipses?&quot; *</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;They don’t! There is no scientific data which shows what causes the eclipses (many flat earthers say that the moon doesn’t cause the solar eclipse), and when they will happen.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The truth of this however, is that ancient civilizations were predicting solar and lunar eclipses VERY PRECISELY thousands of years prior to the invention of the Globe Model, long predating Copernicus.</p>

<p>2: &quot;<em>Flat earthers say that water doesn’t curve around the globe earth, but this video proves that wrong.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Literally the first 4 seconeds of that video show you exactly what is happening. You can clearly see the atmospheric conditions at the surface of the water creating the same illusion we can observe happening on a hot day along a road ahead. </p>

<p><a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/06/29/article-2350736-1A9161B2000005DC-111_634x286.jpg">example 1</a></p>

<p><em>is this plane disappearing over the curvature?</em></p>

<p><a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Akip2Ev_N8/maxresdefault.jpg">example 3 w/ ship</a></p>

<p><em>is this ship disappearing over the curvature?</em></p>

<p>The answer is no, they are not. Atmospheric conditions at the surface of the roads/water cause this illusion to occur. There is also <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/C1BEYUZ7Ypw/maxresdefault.jpg">many pictures</a> showing this EXACT SAME PHENOMENON occurring AT THIS LOCATION from another angle.</p>

<p>Light is capable of performing many optical illusions. The speed of light is arbitrary and depends on many factors. I also believe the wave/particle duality of photons isn&#39;t an adequate representation of light behavior.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The speed of light is not constant, not in our observations. It can be slowed down or speed up depending on medium and temperature.</p>

<p>Even vacuum experiments vary by +/-5% (10%) [no perfect manmade vacuum exists and cannot be created]</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unKWYk_tIwU">Speed of light slowed down</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/4BA.html">Cherenkov radiation - moving faster than &#39;the speed of light&#39;</a></p>

<p>Claiming the speed of light is constant is arbitrary. To say light moves at a constant is an interesting thought experiment but it does not by our own observations. Establishing this <em>a priori</em> means that a medium where it slows down means either time is slowing down, or space is expanding. Density would then be a measure of the &quot;space&quot; in the system. Which actually is a worthwhile theory and goes back to Mach&#39;s &#39;Relativity&#39; which was based on much more observable phenomena than Einstein&#39;s later iteration,  it should be noted up front the change in perspective (the <em>a priori</em> determination).</p>

<p>The claim is about free space but there&#39;s no experiment which ever proved anything such as &#39;free space&#39; exists. A vacuum [even the highest vacuums] can and do have matter in them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is an attempt to control you from every angle, every day, by the mainstream media, the government, TPTB, etc. They want your mind. They want you dumbed down, apathetic, ignorant, docile. 1 person being taught their entire life that life is insignificant, they are a speck of organic matter on a speck of dust, stuck in an insignificant solar system, traveling through a vast, endless void of space is FAR easier to control than someone who has come to realize they live in an enclosed system and their life has true meaning.</p>

<p>The Flat Earth theory seems to imply a closed-system, thus, intelligent design. If intelligent design is true, and we live within this intelligently designed enclosed-system, we are much closer to our creator than they would have us believe.</p>

<p>Now, who do you think is going to take orders and CHOOSE to be a slave to the system? Someone who believes in nothing essentially, and that we are all here and gone in a blink of an eye and it doesn&#39;t really matter? or someone who believes we&#39;ve been lied to and had our meaning and significance hidden from us for the better part of a millennia? </p>

<p>i really dont know what schools you attended, or what your parents tried to teach you, but i had none of those things happen to me.</p>

<p>nobody has ever tried to &quot;teach&quot; me that my entire life is insignificant.  </p>

<p>gotta say you lost me on that one.  if anything i would say you have it backwards, and if we truly are living on a flat earth then the lie about it being a sphere flying through space is to make us think we are MORE than just an enclosed ecosystem controlled by somebody.  </p>

<p>i love a good conspiracy, but this one just seems too out there and nonsensical to me.</p>

<p>Also it was never shoved in your face that blatantly, it is about implications and principals. You are groomed from birth to be an employee upon reaching working age. We are all groomed for slavery mentally, and willingly partake so we can buy material things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>gotta say i just disagree with you here.  im not a mental slave now, never have been, never will be.  and yes i work so i can buy things and live my life.... so what?  what other choice is there if you want a good life?  i am not a slave though.  i choose to work, i enjoy my work and i am paid well for it.  </p>

<p>i was groomed by my parents to work hard for what i want and appreciate what i have, especially if i worked hard for it.  i feel bad for you if you truly feel everything is so worthless and your life so controlled by others.  it doesnt even matter if we are all some computer simulation or whatever, im happy in it just the way things are and you dont sound like you are. </p>

<p>and i dont necessarily think our lives mean more or less in either scenario.  i just really cant hash out how hiding the truth of a flat earth from people does anything at all.  it is illogical to &quot;hide that truth&quot; when it really wouldnt have made much of an impact at all.  we would still have the same &quot;what all is out there&quot; questions, we would still try to go beyond our earth to explore.  it would just be done in a different way.   unless there are just all these alien civilizations just across that giant ice wall that we are not allowed to interact with for whatever reason, who cares?  and to me, even if there are aliens outside the wall or outside our galaxy, who really cares?  if we dont even know of their existence why should i care or worry about it?  </p>

<p>im just living my life best i can. not really concerned with a bunch of what if&#39;s that you cant prove one way or the other. thats part of why im a terrible christian.  i have some faith but otherwise am just really not big on the whole thing. if there is more after i die, great, if there isnt, well, why would i care now if death is the very end for me?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ignorance is bliss, they say.</p>

<p>I have not stated I am unhappy with my life once, nor have I stated I don&#39;t understand a hard days work and the rewards that comes with. Being productive should be a goal for everyone, it is fulfilling to do so. This doesn&#39;t change the fact that our world is not as simple as you&#39;ve made it sound. There is strife, suffering, loss, famine, death every single day. Our world is in shambles socially, the world itself is beautiful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>im happy in it just the way things are and you dont sound like you are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is kind of exactly what I&#39;m saying. YOU are happy in it, yet there is an entire world out there oppressed, suffering, hurting, living in poverty or danger at every corner. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>i feel bad for you if you truly feel everything is so worthless and your life so controlled by others</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t feel controlled, but the world is 100% controlled. You were GROOMED by your parents because they were groomed by their parents. It&#39;s one thing to appreciate what you have, it&#39;s another to literally choose to be blind and deaf to the signs of the times.</p>

<p>Hiding the truth is deceptive, how you can ask &quot;what is the point&quot; and then, when the point is explained, dismiss it is beyond me.</p>

<p>There are many ways to have a good life, material possessions is not the only way, and this is where you&#39;ve been deceived.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>but you dont even know if it is ignorance here.  where is the solid proof you are correct?  you dont have any, or we wouldnt be debating whether the earth is flat or not.</p>

<p>thats my point.  and you seem unhappy with how you view the world.  you didnt say you were unhappy, but you sure dont speak like a happy person lol  you speak like you believe the whole world is here to control you and everything is just grooming you for this or that and nothing you do matters anyways.  just doesnt sound too happy to me. </p>

<p>and again, i have not been groomed for or deceived by a damn thing.  i make my own decisions based on what i want, need or feel. and yeah, i like material possessions because they are things i enjoy for all sorts of reasons.  i like cars so i have several, they make me happy to own and to drive.  i like riding bikes so i bought a nice mountainbike.  i like playing video games so i bought a computer i can game on.  you may find happiness in non material things and thats fine, but just because i like material things doesnt mean ive been duped, deceived or groomed for it somehow.  i like things because i like them, not because somebody is deceiving me somehow.  i think for myself, i dont give a shit what others like or think i should like. </p>

<p>and what truth have you presented any evidence for?  your opinion that we are being lied to is not a truth just because you say it is?  show me actual evidence of this giant ice wall.  you cant just say you explained everything and say im dismissing it.  youve explained nothing in regards to hard facts and proof of anything.  </p>

<p>You believe gravity allows birds/bugs to fly and satellites to stay in geosynchronous orbit, yet it also keeps the moon from hurdling off into space.

    <div class="md"><p>Your statements are false and full of logical fallacies. Obviously buoyancy can exist without gravity. You are just spewing nonsense at this point. </p>

<p>Also, there&#39;s no reason a flat earth can&#39;t have forces acting upon it without gravity. You are suffering from a conformation bias, appealing to authority figures, slippery slope reasoning, and ad hominem attacks because the truth enrages you. </p>

<p>All truth passes through three stages; first, it is ridiculed; second, it is violently opposed; third, it&#39;s accepted as being self evident. </p>

<p>THERE IS NO WAY TO EXPLAIN, MEASURE OR QUANTIFY BOUYANCY WITHOUT GRAVITY. IT IS A MEASURE OF GRAVITATIONAL EFFECTS.</p>

<p>Take a look at the definition, or the formula. You don&#39;t even know what bouyancy is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re an idiot. There&#39;s no hope for you. Certain terms have different definitions when it comes to the application: a scientific definition can vary from a literal definition. </p>

<p>Buoyancy and density work without gravity. Take a look at chemistry formulas; you don&#39;t NEED gravity for them. Gravity is CONFUSED with density, buoyancy, and electromagnetism. </p>

<p>Electromagnetism is a prevalent factor on our earth. </p>

<p>Seriously? I just want everyone to see the truth because the world would be a much better place. NASA lies about everything; NASA is the most successful propaganda organization is history. </p>

<p>I strongly urge you to read the works of William Carpenter, Thomas Winship, Dr. Samuel Rowbotham, Eric Dubay, Rob Skiba, and many others...</p>

<p>I like using astronomy to prove the flat earth. Polaris is the North Star and always remains fixed directly above the North Pole. Ursa Major is very close to Polaris and can be seen from 30 degrees south latitude to the North Pole! </p>

<p>Orion can be seen from 85 degrees North all the way to 75 degrees South latitude! This is impossible on a globe. You can&#39;t see through Earth. </p>

<p>The South Pole doesn&#39;t really exist and Sigma Octantis and the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; sweep over a southern arc, which is why they are not visible to observers North latitude. </p>

<p>There is no curvature of the earth; stars aren&#39;t &quot;light years&#39; away. </p>

<p>The Hubble Telescope doesn&#39;t exist, the Mars Rover doesn&#39;t exist, Satellites don&#39;t exist, and other &#39;galaxies&#39; don&#39;t exist. </p>

Or is the earth the center of the universe too? Do celestial objects move in your world?

<p>we hav e many earths , we can track a flight from country over the Atlantic . over Russia . over China and onto the US but it just keeps going . we follow it .. we see there is more than one China , more than 1 Russia . more than one US wtf ?? </p>

<p>why didnt you flat earthers tell us about the number of Chinas ?? the Russias .. the OTHER U.S ??????????</p>

<p>flight tracker is a great way to see where a plain is and where its going from to where its going to ..</p>

<p>flight tracker is a great option to be able to click on a plain and watch it in 3d . flying from country to country all around the planet .. i mean from one China to the other China we didnt know existed..</p>

<p>Gravity is just a theory... and it&#39;s a poor one. This supposed force of gravity is so strong it holds all of the oceans to the earth, while it spins at ridiculously high velocities</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Acceleration due to gravity is <em>massive</em>! You are dealing with an entire world! Of course it&#39;s very strong. In fact, the acceleration due to Earth&#39;s rotation is approximately 0.35% as strong as Earth&#39;s gravity (0.0035 g&#39;s). So, if you weigh 300 pounds in Ecuador you&#39;ll find that you weigh almost 301 pounds at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. (<a href="http://www.askamathematician.com/2013/01/q-if-the-world-were-to-stop-spinning-would-the-people-and-everything-on-it-be-considered-lighter-or-heavier-would-any-change-take-place-and-does-centrifugal-force-have-an-effect-on-gravity/">source</a>)</p>

<p>The Earth is so massive, in fact, that there are <a href="https://www.space.com/30302-lagrange-points.html">points</a> in the Earth&#39;s orbit where the forces of attraction to the Sun and Earth cancel out and asteroids actually &quot;orbit&quot; these empty points in space, trailing or leading the Earth&#39;s orbit around the Sun.</p>

<p>But you can find much smaller examples. In freefall (e.g. in orbit), even a person has a measurable gravitational field that will cause things to &quot;fall&quot; toward them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Buoyancy does not have the gravitational constant in it&#39;s calculation. Objects &quot;in a vacuum&quot; do not just float and display weightlessness because that is &quot;ANTI-GRAVITY&quot; nonsense. Objects in a vacuum fall at the same speed because there is not <em>atmospheric conditions</em> within the vacuum to slow the descent of something less dense than the other, example a rock and a feather in a vacuum tube.</p>

<p>They fall at the same speed because of the lack of atmospheric conditions effecting the objects, thus they fall at the same speed. This is not &quot;the gravitational constant&quot; this is yet again the magical force of gravity having something attributed to it that doesn&#39;t require it.</p>

<p>Why would something appear weightless in a vacuum? The object still has weight. The idea you are presenting is ASSUMING gravity exists still. &quot;Well without gravity, everything would just float away because gravity is what keeps us grounded.&quot; Do you not see how indoctrinated this line of thinking is? The only proof or evidence of &quot;objects showing weightlessness&quot; are so called &quot;<em>space footage</em>&quot; or zero-g planes that &quot;simulate weightlessness&quot; by the using of extreme up-and-down flight paths. These people are not actually weightless, they are in fact falling, but are in an enclosed environment allowing them to SIMULATE what it would be like.</p>
