        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>** I am reposting because I fucked up the title lol.  Other thread was deleted.</p>

<p>I was hit with the thought that someone could be infiltrating and dismantling every aspect of American life that used to be iconic (Hollywood, Football, Holidays such as Christmas) just so that we as Americans lose our identity and become more susceptible to globalism. </p>

<p>In the case of Hollywood (I am talking movies and TV), there has been a large increase in pushing SJW narratives, which lessens quality in exchange for pleasing the loud minority (See: The new Ghostbusters, numerous talk shows, etc. Too many to list). Many directors, producers, and actors seem like they are either getting paid to shill, or are walking in eggshells to preserve their careers by going with a set narrative. I used to love going to the movies, but lately the waters have been muddied with incredibly disappointing films that always feel the need to garnish their product with SJW commentary. </p>

<p>Football, as we know, is taking a huge hit right now with this stupid kneeling-for-the-anthem protesting, and I swear to god that this is coordinated to get Americans to tune out of the NFL and kill one of our great pastimes. </p>

<p>Holidays have been neutered too, with the heavy push to have people say &quot;Season&#39;s Greetings&quot; or &quot;Happy Holidays&quot; instead of &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; in fear of offending other cultures. </p>

<p>So what am I getting at? Even though my examples are pretty minor in the grand scheme of things, it seems as though we Americans are truly getting our culture stripped away piece by piece just to accomodate a globalist adgenda. All these tiny changes are adding up, like a crab that sits in a pot as it slowly rolls to a boil, only to try and escape when it is far too late. </p>

<p>Has anyone else noticed this, or have more examples? I am trying my best to make sense but i am really tired and on mobile lol. I could use some help, actually. Perhaps a wordsmith who could better state what I am trying to get at. I would also appreciate any remarks or criticism you guys have. Thank you!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a push to be more PC, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s exactly an attack on America. The NFL protest is all a distraction, they have been doing that shit since last year. It&#39;s only a thing now because they want to distract from the extended travel ban, Venezuela, maybe Weiner&#39;s sentencing.</p>

<p>People have been pushing the Season&#39;s Greetings stuff for over a decade. It hasn&#39;t stopped anyone I know from hanging Christmas lights or caroling.</p>

<p>Hollywood has always been full of uncreative hacks who want to push agendas. Let&#39;s just hope they run out of reboots and comic books. They did make a movie with Tom Cruise to normalize CIA drug running, though.</p>

<p>The PC push is causing things like people protesting Civil War statues. It does seem like it&#39;s erasing history if they just straight up remove them. Let them replace them with statues of rappers or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guess what? American culture includes people from all political persuasions and belief systems, as well as facets like peaceful protest, speaking your mind, and calling out injustices, systemic or otherwise. That&#39;s actually what&#39;s great about this country.</p>

<p>The NFL has had one of the most toxic cultures the country has produced-- beyond the Roman coliseum-esque bloodlust, nightmare consumerism, scores of domestic abusers, higher-ups who always side with the owners over the people who make it all work, the players (the vast majority of which get wasted up by the league in less than five seasons). Decades of not giving a shit about concussions, the general grit your teeth and bare it nonsense. Being an NFL vet resembling being an Army vet, sometimes with a full life of physical/mental problems in consequence. And their contracts aren&#39;t even guaranteed.   </p>

<p>I think people were already getting wise to the league being an overly exploitative cash cow industry, social protests bleeding into things was not unexpected. </p>

<p>I say all this as someone who played in high school and love the game BTW. I think the league has long been an icon of some pretty shitty US attitudes, though. </p>

<p>You just answered your own question. Cultural Marxism, AKA political correctness/SJWs, is the main attack on American/Western traditional values.</p>

<p>What&#39;s wrong with traditional values? Not perfect, but represents a time tested way of having a stable society. PC is all about turning things upside down and setting different groups of people against each other. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for giving people rights and letting them enjoy life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. But I&#39;m also strongly in favor of social movements that bring people together.</p>

<p>Anyone who takes a quick look at political correctness and SJWs can see how this &quot;new value system&quot; really works. It does bring groups of people together, but in a way based on very narrow self interest. At a wider level it drives people apart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion shouldn&#39;t be tolerated in the school or workplace, holidays are mostly religion based and I don&#39;t want you brainwashing my children.</p>

<p>Football is gladiatorial in nature and causes brain damage in our youth not to mention the corruption that goes on at the college level and the tax dollars that are put into building stadiums rather than roads.</p>

<p>Movies haven&#39;t changed though and I suggest you broaden your horizons and seek out more independent films, for instance The Big Sick was a great look into healthcare and diversity.</p>

<p>Maybe people need to look into the unintended consequences of what they deem &quot;American culture.&quot;</p>

<p>People not wanting players to protest during their national anthem, maybe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You understand those players are all citizens, right? Every one of them has the right to vote. Every one of them has the right to exercise their freedom of expression. It is <strong>their national anthem as well</strong>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a disabled combat veteran. My opinion is now, and always has been that the greatest honor any American can do for the Armed Forces, Veterans, and the Constitution is to vigorously and aggressively exercise the rights that so many have fought and died to secure since the 18th Century. There is no activity more patriotic in the United States than peacefully exercising your <strong>God-given, unalienable rights</strong>. This was quite literally written into the Proclamation of Treason Against the Crown known as the <em>Declaration of Independence</em>: <strong>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.</strong></p>

<p>It is offensive to me that anyone in the United States has the audacity to believe the Founding Fathers would scorn a vigorous expression of the rights they enshrined in the Constitution. It is an affront to their memories as patriots, and to the memories of all those Americans since who have shed blood and not returned home to secure liberty.</p>

<p>As Americans, and as patriots, all of these athletes have the right to do exactly what they are doing, and anyone who tries to use Veterans or the Armed Forces as a political weapon against them is bereft of any moral character.</p>

<p>However, one side decided to stir shit first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t that be the part of the government/majority that spent decades pushing a justice system rife with classist and racial disparities?  For example, the sentencing guidelines for crack and cocaine, despite being quite literally the exact same drug, being vastly different?  Or racially-motivated policies such as stop-and-frisk, which when conducted in NYC, resulted in black men being almost 30 times more likely as white men to be stopped and searched?  Or racially-motivated policies, such as Joe Arpaiao&#39;s illegal racial profiling?  Or to go beyond the direct racism of the justice system to other institutionalized racism, such as housing discrimination by government-secured lenders like Fannie Mae?  Or racially discriminatory housing practices, such as those embraced by Donald Trump in the 80s when he lost 2 lawsuits for refusing to rent to black people?  If we&#39;re gonna talk about &quot;one side decided to stir shit first&quot;, then we need to actually go back to &quot;first&quot; and not just &quot;when u/jsstealthss became aware of it&quot;, and talk about laws and policies designed to disenfranchise black voters (which is <em>still</em> happening in various states today, as evidenced by North Carolina GOP members acknowledging that they deliberately tried to disenfranchise black and other minority voters?  ANd we can go back further to Jim Crow and even further back to fucking enslaving a race of people, if you want to talk about who &quot;decided to stir shit first.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The people are voting with their dollars, and the NFL is rapidly feeling the effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After Trump said they should be fired, there was a 69% increase in NFL viewership.  If the NFL is &quot;rapidly feeling the effect&quot;, that effect is a huge and rapid increase in viewership.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lets see who wins this dispute, eh?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given that NFL owners, the commissioner, coaches, and apparently the majority of the American people (as evidenced by the aforementioned <em>increase</em> in viewership) all approve of these actions, I would say that the &quot;winner&quot; seems pretty obvious at this point.  </p>

<p>Rampant consumerism.  Billions of taxpayer dollars going to build stadiums for the profit of the already rich owners.  Hoards of people who tie their personal identities to some giant corporation the media refers to as &quot;teams&quot; (you do know that all NFL teams are corporations, right?)  Most of the owners aren&#39;t even from the same town as the team they own, they&#39;re just some rich asshole who wants rubes cheer for him while he rakes in money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>American culture is doing well despite subversion efforts. Many norms are being naturally rejected simply because of changing society. </p>

<p>American culture cannot be defined as lacking separate, distinguishable parts; America is comprised of many different emerging, growing, and dying cultural movements and trends. Webster definition for culture: &quot;the integrated pattern of human knowledge, belief, and behavior that depends upon the capacity for learning and transmitting knowledge to succeeding generations.&quot; In short, contributions to society, made from shared information and knowledge, that influences consumers and future contributors.</p>

<p>There are the traditional elements of society who are out of touch and no longer positively contributing to American culture, like most Hollywood productions; but television, for example, with new productions coming from Netflix, Amazon, independents from Youtube, and even forward thinking traditional production centers, are doing better than ever. You can always label TV as propaganda, but it still shapes parts of our culture, and TV, especially, continues to evolve daily. Short video content as seen on Youtube and Snapchat are equally gaining in popularity.</p>

<p>Video games are more popular than ever, from advanced systems, to smartphone games, to those who are nostalgic and play older consoles. America leads the development of popular modern games, but many game designs have come from Asia and other areas of the world, and at this point the video game culture is global.</p>

<p>Not often discussed are the cultural movements in the technology communities. With access to infinite information and instant global communication capabilities, it&#39;s easier than ever for ideas and insights to be shared across the entire research, development, and commercial communities developing new technologies. There may be a shortage of &quot;STEM&quot; graduates and software and hardware developers, but there&#39;s still more contributors in these fields than ever before. One could argue that we are living in the best of times in several technology industries, each going through its own revolution, and each integrating with the all others and coming together to drive a higher level revolution. Software, Hardware -- chips, computers, 3d printing / additive manufacturing, Biological (genetic engineering), biomedical (robots for surgery), nanotechnology, aerospace, etc...the list goes on.</p>

<p>Fashion is more limitless than ever. Before the internet, shoppers, especially the youth, were restricted to local stores and local styles. Now, shopping for new fashion online and at a more affordable costs, allows anyone to have their own individual style, and anyone to shape their own fashion trends. International corporations have benefitted from these developments -- you can see Nike, Adidas, and Jordan more prevalent than ever -- but cultural contributions are real even if many times its top down.</p>

<p>As a fan of hip hop, 2017 has been one of the best years for music, and the billboard charts prove this. There&#39;s some poor quality music, as there&#39;s always been, but there&#39;s high quality conscious music mixed in.</p>

<p>Comedy and content that induces laughing out loud is better than ever. Again, there are comedic cultural trends that are growing, and others that are dying. Comedy produced by hollywood and late night TV is worse than ever, but the democratic, decentralized comments posted under Youtube videos are funnier than ever! Alongside youtube, organic postings by Snapchat users, for example, are increasingly funny. It&#39;s harder for corporations to capitalize on these trends, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;re upset, but American comedy is doing well.</p>

<p>I can go on with the positive, growing cultural trends, but it&#39;s important to highlight the dying, stagnant, and decadent cultural trends. As stated, most of Hollywood is trash, which is sad given their tremendous contributions of the 80s, 90s and early 2000s. The Christian churches, which, as a detriment to society, pay no property taxes, have made 0 contributions to American culture in the previous 40 years (at least). At this point, they&#39;re delusional fantasies are holding all cultural trends back. The NFL has been on the decline for a few years now, despite reaching its peak in revenues just a few years back. The new rules have ruined the game, the corporate takeover of game has ruined TV with commercials every few minutes, the hypocrisy of the players and owners is ridiculous. New equipment has made the game more dangerous because players lead with their helmets at high speed. Madden Football has sucked for several years after being one of the best video games of the early 21st century.</p>

<p>What other country has such a dynamic culture? Many global trends start in America.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea my post is biased. Hollywood doesn&#39;t lack creators, but their stagnant distribution model has forced producers to focus on spectacle to attract consumers. What happens when most spectacles have been played out? TV shows are engaging, so why aren&#39;t movies doing the same? TV shows are shorter, but many binge watch shows for longer time periods than standard movies. </p>

<p>Most movie theaters are overpriced. I&#39;m avoiding them mainly because I&#39;m insulted by the idea they think they can gouge me on popcorn, like I&#39;m that stupid to buy an overpriced food. I was told I couldn&#39;t bring my $.25 water bottle last time I went and that was the last straw.</p>

<p>Speaking of overpriced foods, tax payers need to be given ownership of all Pro Sports stadiums. We paid for them, therefore, ownership should be in the hands of the people. It should be illegal to overcharge for beer and hot dogs. Not only do we pay for stadiums that create billionaires, but we allow the billionaires to overcharge us for basic foods being served. American culture will improve when corporate welfare is decreased.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last contribution: food culture. It&#39;s a running joke to say American food is categorized by cheeseburgers and twinkies, but consumers in America can find a restaurant representing any foreign culture, and the food centers carry all vegetables and fruits no matter the season, all at affordable costs. It&#39;s easier than ever to cook exotic foods in the home, and meal prep delivered to the home is popular. American food culture can be described as an environment where all &quot;foreign&quot; foods can coexist and satisfy the diverse consumers. Organic and natural, wholistic lifestyles were pioneered in America, even though the meat production system with antibiotics and GMOS with chemical additives were also developed here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;our&quot; culture or &quot;your&quot; culture?</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t this the same Hollywood that pushed war bonds in WW2?  Isn&#39;t this the same Hollywood that cranked our pro-war/pro-US movies when President Eisenhower was warning us about the growing power of the military-industrial complex?  Isn&#39;t this the same Hollywood that is coming under fire for remaking films and using minorities instead of white actors who played them originally?  Hollywood has always been a mouthpiece for an agenda, it just may no longer be your agenda.</p>

<p>Up until the last 2 decades, college football in the US dwarfed the NFL - and still does with a great many people in some areas.  Prior to the creation of the Super Bowl in the mid-60&#39;s, the NFL was a flea on the big dog of major league baseball.  If the NFL folded tomorrow, would it really impact the life of an average American in any meaningful way?  Beer and pharma companies will somewhere else to advertise, people will find another sports team to root for, and some people may even find something more rewarding than sitting in front a TV for hours on end.</p>

<p>IMHO, the American culture begins and ends with the Constitution and its Bill of Rights.  The spirit of America is about the freedom of the individual - nothing more and nothing less.  You mention Christmas, so I assume that you are Christian.  If that is so, and you practice Christian values with your family and within your community, why does it matter what Starbucks puts on its cups?  Don&#39;t buy the coffee.  Why does it matter if Walmart hangs up &quot;Seasons Greetings&quot; banners?  Don&#39;t shop there.  Corporations are in business to make money and, believe it or not, your money is not worth any more than the next person&#39;s, so they will always do things that they believe will maximize there profit.</p>

<p>Nobody is &quot;attacking&quot; you - you are just no longer the only demographic that matters to the power that be.  You are free to watch want you want to watch, shop where you want to shop, and practice your religion how you wish to practice.  You are free to stand up for all of your rights. You are just not free to do so while standing on the necks&#39; of others.</p>

<p>Paranoid that there&#39;s some great conspiracy to dismantle the great American institution of the NFL, which has had tax payers build their stadiums while raking in massive profits and actively fought to hide evidence that many players are suffering severe health issues such as CTE. A player kneels and people get upset. Welcome to America where people are more upset at a guy kneeling for the national anthem than they are a broken and corrupt criminal justice system that has disproportionately affected minorities.</p>

<p>Hollywood has a million and one problems, but we are literally in a golden age of quality television. Please tell me how the new Ghostbusters film is pushing a SJW narrative? Because there are women in it? The film is garbage and not funny, but just because they decided to flip the gender of the cast doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s some SJW narrative or commentary being pushed. Yea, you are seeing a lot more minority and female voices in media, turns out that America is made of of all sorts of different people and now more of them are getting the chance to share their perspective.</p>

<p>The only people I see get offended when it comes to merry christmas/happy holidays, are the people who get offended when people say &quot;Happy Holidays&quot; - if I say Happy Holidays to someone, it&#39;s not because I&#39;m afraid of offending another culture, I&#39;m just not assuming they celebrate Christmas. Maybe instead of being offended by happy holidays, people should be offended that their holiday just because a gross celebration of materialism. </p>
