       There it is, Agenda 21.
      </p>
      <p>
       More accurately Agenda 2021, January 20th 2021 or 1-20-2021.
      </p>
      <p>
       The epicenter of the event will be in the United States so the date format is important 1202021, the same number forwards and backwards making it a palindrome date.  It is also the exact day that the POTUS of election 2020 will take office, january 20th, 2021.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will it be a 2nd term for Trump?  Will Trump lead us into total implementation of Agenda 21? Will someone else win in 2020?
      </p>
      <p>
       What we know about Agenda 21 is that most of it seems to be right on track.

      <p>
       We are totally fucked here aren't we?
      </p>
      <p>
       The good news is that you have 3 Years
3 Months
22 Days and
23 Hours left to ready yourself and your family.  That is no small amount of time if invested properly.  Only those who can survive a nomadic lifestyle will be able to hack it in the wilds of the nature preserves.  They will be frequently flushed of people "No Human Access Allowed" zones will cover the majority of the land mass of the world with forced settlements being restricted to about 25% of the land mass.  Prison Cities, Impossible to traverse distances separating them without the use of trains (the main mode of authorized transportation to be used) Absolute rationing of every resource, forced labor.. hell forced labor would be nice compared to what they have planned for us.  Our children will be raised like cattle away from their parents.  Ear marked for specific training from an early age, their whole lives carefully planned for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Genocide will be common place for any group that resists too much and requires too much effort to normalize.  Eugenics will be the dating app of the future.  You'll have zero choice in any matter of life.  Most of us won't be here, if you're a US citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before all of this takes place the population will be drastically reduced.  Their "ideal" population seems to be around half a billion people so its likely that only the young and fertile, labor ready among us will survive at all.  And by us I mean the the global us.  They will probably only spare the easiest to control, probably from 3rd world countries because they are more resistant to bad water and poverty related diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out the middle class is too soft, too educated and too independent to make good slaves, but not regal enough to be included in the 40,000 or so elites that have selected themselves to be the curators of Garden Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how will it all start? With some sort of mass kill, some poison in the food supply (probably already there now) that will be activated by some sudden additive.  Or maybe a nuclear disaster, series of bombs or some space weather hoax that we haven't even imagined yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       What we do know is that most everyone is going to be fooled (as usual) and they will go along with whatever the government says is best for everyone.  Most will never understand that the officials posing as heros trying to save them are really just leading them to the slaughter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the people leading the slaughter will probably be just as ignorant of the true nature of what they are doing.  Free Humanity will be reduced to a psycho ward of raving lunatics half dead and dying still, those who aren't poisoned, are immune or saved will be ready for order.  They will be ready for the government to save them from the chaos and they will enjoy the security provided by the designated human habitation zones.
      </p>
      <p>
       People who venture into the forbidden areas will get sick and it will be proof that the scourge is still out there.  Their wills will be broken in every way imaginable.  Breeding programs to promote children resistant to the scourge will be welcomed.  A cashless society where food is tightly controlled will be a blessing compared to starving to death out there.  People will be rewarded for policing each other and their children will never even know about the world that existed before.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how do you prepare for that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I know this sounds like a fantastic paranoid fever dream but they have published their plans, we have watched most of it being rolled out right before our eyes and they have announced their end game.  A new world order.  A globe without states, without borders and without property.

       It's the new end of days thing. The whole Nibiru thing fell out last week so this is the new 'end of days'. At least they got smart and put the date way out this time. So they can milk it.

       Oh I see, you're one of those.
      </p>
      <p>
       2021 is a repeating theme being rolled out through a multitude of global initiatives mostly headed up by individuals with undeniable links to the club of Rome, the bilderberg group, Bohemia society etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess you could say that the specific date of January 20th 2021 is a rarified interpretation of decades of my following these individuals and their deeds in the world we share.  Are you going to find a source to cite?  No you're not.  They also specifically refuse to mention the horrors of forced resettlement and what methods they plan to use in their mass depopulation agenda.  They will only ever provide vague dates (like how they have extended agenda 2021 to 2030) they don't want useless eaters to know their exact timelines and 2030 only exist because people get less anxious when dates are far down the road.  2021 was getting too close to keep publishing but 2021 is still on track.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can satisfy your desire to "debunk" any of this or all of this by showing that a search function on clubofrome.org doesn't return any results.  That's fine by me, if you're not willing to read the decades of literature produced and published by the very same people planning to enslave your children then you're certainly not going to take my word for it.  And I forgive you for that, it's definitely not your fault.
      </p>
      <p>
       However if you can get beyond your desire (seemingly) to debunk me, or show that this date hasn't been confirmed by Snopes or w/e, I suggest that you start reading.  I don't want to brainwash anyone like a professor and claim that my opinions are the only possible explanation for all of this.  I do however desire to inspire individuals who are free of mental chains to start reading and stop promoting these causes being forced on us by people who only desire to control us.

       I am fully onboard with your thesis mate. I was just asking you where you got the date from. You could have honestly answered that the date is the result of your personal judgement from the beginning and saved us both the bother.
      </p>
      <p>
       My efforts are not to debunk but to clarify. I don't need convincing but others do. I get laughed at when I make claims irl and then have to cite my source as 'some guy on the internet'. If you don't want to help me out with something more definitive then so be it.

       I think its even worse.  I think TPTB (which basically means the Freemasons and their partner secret societies) intend to bring about a manufactured end times.  I think we will see this play out over the next 3.5 years.  My guess based on my research and intuition is that the whole Niburu or planet X thing is actually real....I didnt think so even a month ago but the more I contemplated it the more sense it made.  When it passes by Earth, it will cause an enormous wave due to ots gravitation, and coastal cities will be completely wiped out.  I think this is the biggest secret of these secret societies.  The Vatican with their LUCIFER telescope would have been able to spot it and get a precise calculation of exactly when it will come.  The Great Pyramid was built to warn us as it has encoded in its dimensions celestial information to do with this.  Also the 'great year' of the Mayans is based on the same thing....they thought it would come in 2012 but their calculations were slightly off IMO based on it only coming around every 3-4000 years or however long it might take.  The secret societies I think will use this event in combination with multiple other man made horrors including a manufactured alien invasion utilizing extremely advanced technology like we have never seen.  Man made earthquakes, hurricanes you name it....They will unleash genetically new creatures like massive locusts to attack us....things like in the Bible since thats their blueprint.  Thats my basic theory Im thinking about....time to start calling out the Masons IMO.  Oh and there is a good side within the masons and a bad side but the bad side has consolidated more power....the sooner we expose them the more of a chance we might have though IMO.

       The killer insects and other horrors that John described in revelation were his attempt to describe futuristic technologies using things that were familiar to him. How else would a person from 2000 years in the past describe things like drones, helicopters, missiles, airplanes and guns?

       Yeah but this discussion of climate change has been around for over a decade. I'm probably a lot older than you are and I remember conversations about climate change, course we didn't call it that, we called it global warming, for more than 30 years. None of this is new it's just that now with the always on media and the internet there are more ways to talk about it, but it's not new.

       The world doesn't operate on citations when the movers want something.

      <p>
       The very people sitting on panels and heading up initiatives have published many books on agenda 21.  They are their own citation, they have publicly stated that they want to do these things.  Maybe you could read their books?

       This is hands down the closest I've ever come to just buying someone's doomsday theory at face value, it's simply makes more sense. However, I think they're running out of time. 3 years from now they won't be able to pull it off. I think things are moving quicker now.

       Hmmm... I have something interest to share which is along the same lines. Now this is, of course if you believe the Bible otherwise this won't matter to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believed that 09/23/17 was NOT the end nor the rapture but rather a sign. Anyone who was rational and actually listened to someone explain it without the fear of doom would've recognized this. Technically speaking, what was supposed to happen on 09/23 did happen which was the "galactic alignment". But those who claimed it was the end really soured the truth behind it. That it was a sign to pay attention to the fulfillment of prophecy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the 09/23 theory comes from Revelation 12. But after the 09/23 theory it also says:
"And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days"
So according to this, assuming 09/23 is in fact revelation 12, which I think it is, then 1260 days from 09/23/2017 is 03/05/2021
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just something I noticed and I don't make any claim nor am I any sort of specialized. I like trying to put together puzzles and find these sorts of things interesting

       Rev 12 is half way though Jacob's trouble and after the rapture.  John saw a literal woman with a literal crown of stars, not a constellation.  The stuff happening during that seven year period will be supernatural unlike anything since the apostles walked the earth with their apostolic signs (healing, tongues, etc).  A good bit of predictive programming for this is Game of Thrones.  A world that has forgotten dragons and magic but it all springs back into existance and everyone is blown away by it.  That's what Jacob's trouble will be to this world.  Everyone will think they are tripping and the NWO will have full lock-down.  The Antichrist will be killed and then resurrected and claim to be everyone's god.  People won't be able to buy or sell without his mark IN (get a KJV) their right hand or forehead.  All this Rev 12 stuff is a deception but Jacob's trouble is coming.  Conspiracy types like this sub can see it coming.  Many see it coming in their own way, they just don't know that it was predicted long ago in the writings of John.  The biggest conspiracy of all is the world system's efforts to hide the fact that there is a God, he came to earth as a human in the form of Jesus Christ and died for our sins so that we can avoid the punishment for sin.  All we need to do is accept that he died, and rose again and paid for our salvation with his blood.  Repent to God in prayer asking to be saved and he will do it.  That is what the elite don't want you to know because they work for the god of this fallen realm who is Satan.  Their goal is to drag as many souls to the lake of fire as they can.  They know they already lost, they can only take as many people with them as possible and it will be many unfortunately.

       Why is it that specific date? Because it's the date of the election and because it's a palindrome? Or does the club have a meeting or something scheduled that day?

       Scary map! How dare all those countries agree to help the disabled in an agreement that has no possibility of enforcement.

       Snarkiness aside, the only conspiratorial part of the CRPD is allowing disabled folks to leave their country of residence if they choose. But that would be a whole other program thats not in place and wholly unenforceable as is.
