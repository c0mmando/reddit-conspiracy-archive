<p>But as an atheist, I personally don&#39;t believe in the more spiritually oriented conspiracies. Many of the posts I see here use religious text, numerology, etc. as evidence to back up their claims.</p>

<p>I know there are also many &quot;anti-science&quot; people here. As an academic researcher myself I understand many of the concerns with the state of academia. But that doesn&#39;t change my stance that &quot;rational&quot; approaches like the scientific method are the best way to approach the formation of any new belief. </p>

<p>I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a sub out there for those of us who are interested in conspiracies, but who also care significantly about the approach by which we arrive at our conclusions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have a lot in common in both respects here. I consider it some kinda sign of personal growth that I have learned how to coexist with the religious people around here, and even entertain their ideas far enough to understand their points most of the time. It doesn&#39;t cost me anything.</p>

<p>Thing is, the deeper you get into conspiracies, the more intertwined they get with spirituality. And ultimately it doesn&#39;t matter what we believe, it matters what the bad guys believe, because that is the context from which they act. And the bad guys believe in some sick shit.</p>

<p>I know of no other secular version of what we have here. All I can say is I do not find it hard to leave alone the parts I don&#39;t really jive with anymore. I quit taking any of the discussions around here personally. No one is obligated to believe anything.</p>

<p>Good luck man</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what throws me the most being an atheist.  I look at all the spiritual bullshit that elites supposedly do, and I second-guess myself.  I can write off the layman who believes in Jesus because he&#39;s just a normal dude, but we&#39;re talking about high-level people in restricted parts of our highest levels of governments.  Didn&#39;t the SK gov&#39;t just get outted as some cult worshipers?  Like what the fuck?  Am I the one who&#39;s wrong?  How can elites be fooled by the spiritual stuff as easily as a layman?  Them participating in it weirdly gives it more validity in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have those same thoughts from time to time. And I&#39;m not truly atheist any more largely because of that. I think maybe there is something going on beyond the veil that religions have been inaccurately capturing since the beginning.

<p>You are in a way already limiting your view as to what you are willing to accept as fact by taking this approach. </p>

<p>However I do understand why you would want to start out like this. By researching conspiracy theories you are <em>always</em> going to run into dis-info and half-truths (interests groups who want to derail your information gathering or use the poisoning-the-well tactic). Thus a need to look at things more rationally, which is ultimately a reductionist technique that will only disqualify theories <em>you yourself</em> already aren&#39;t willing to accept.</p>

<p>By starting your research with certain preconceived notions you have already decided not to accept certain ideas, regardless of what you find. You have already put yourself into a position where you will only find what you want to see or already believe.</p>

<p>I started looking into conspiracies about a decade ago and the only advice I can share is to understand; Who doesn&#39;t want you to know, Why they don&#39;t want you to know, What they&#39;re willing to do to stop you from knowing/believing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because you&#39;re confusing faith with religion. And don&#39;t get me wrong, you&#39;re by no means the only one, almost everyone makes that mistake, myself included for the longest time.</p>

<p>But truly there is a world of a difference between the two. Religion is a framework for control, both in moral, as well as in hierarchical terms, but faith can be something altogether different. The thing is, religions don&#39;t have to be true, they just have to be enforced. Faith can only be found in either Truth or in self-deception. While there is certainly a fair amount of the latter, there is also the former.</p>

<p>The capital T Truth relates to consequence, the idea that if I behave in a certain way, the consequences of my actions will ultimately be good because they&#39;re &quot;in-line&quot; with the laws and aspects of the Universe. That&#39;s belief in God(Good) right there. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say you can&#39;t be &quot;successful&quot; in choosing to go against God(Good), but you better well prepare yourself for the Universe to strike back at some point.</p>

<p>But I understand that I won&#39;t be able to convince you or anyone of the &quot;benefits&quot; of &quot;Faith&quot; because it can only ever be grasped through direct experience. In some vague terms, you can perhaps relate to it more when we speak of confidence, self-assurance, wisdom, and the study of cause and effect. Understanding those aspects and their effects can lead to profound spiritual understandings (which I&#39;m far from having fully grasped at this point).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>very few who even advertise themselves as Christian are Christian according to the Bible. Biblical Christianity is completely incompatible with present day society and I promise it is not advantageous to the elite in any way that the population maintain biblical Christian beliefs. As such, it shows. The state of things is such that even Christian churches are working hard toward the agenda of sabotaging those who wish to actually live and believe as Christians. It&#39;s more accurate to say TPTB are more than happy when we call ourselves Christians, assuming we&#39;re Christians, but don&#39;t actually believe as Christians or live as Christians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really?  You don&#39;t think a book which tells people:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ.&quot; Ephesians 6:5-9</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could in any way be beneficial to the ruling elite?</p>

<p>You think a book which glorifies the story of Isaac being willing to <strong>murder his own son</strong> at Gods command, is designed for free thinkers?  I mean, that&#39;s literally mafia-level shit.  Which isn&#39;t even that bad compared to the genocides that happen a few chapters later.</p>

<p>Or how about when Jesus defiantly tells people to pay their taxes (give unto Caesar what is Caesar&#39;s)?  Yeah, I&#39;m sure TPTB really hate that part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, that&#39;s really admirable cherry picking behavior, similar to the behavior of all the make-believe Christians in the American population. Good job. However if you actually looked at the Gospels, actually looked at the person and the teaching of Jesus, and observed what Scripture says about how Scripture is meant to be received and interpreted, you would see that you&#39;re only describing an extremely small and selective element of what it means to be a Christian, and what Christian behavior is supposed to look like.</p>

<p>do you have a sense of what is truly good? The goal of Christian teaching is to produce a sincerely loving person who chooses to do good not by compulsion, but from his own nature. It&#39;s true, when you are this loving person, it is good to be obedient if you are a slave, instead of being rebellious. This is because truly loving is seeking the greater good, not just your own good when you want to be free, but a larger good, a good that promotes order, and that also cares about the welfare of the slave master. </p>

<p>however, evil is harmful. For this reason it is harmful to approve of evil, since that grants more strength to evil and allows it to do greater harm. It is harmful to prefer evil, and to be incentivized by evil, since this permits more evil to be overlooked and permits more evil to be more persuasive. It is the duty of a loving person not to do this, not to grant opportunity to evil, and indeed to do everything possible to expose evil and minimize evil, so long as the approach is truly consistent with love, and is not doing more harm in the process.</p>

<p>if we were all slaves, then in that case, it might be very convenient for our masters that we were all truly Christians. But I can tell you this for sure. If we were all truly Christians, businesses would not bother advertising the products they advertise. Legislators would not bother drafting the rules and regulations they draft and submitting them for approval. TV networks and film companies would not bother introducing the themes they introduce or promoting the behavior they promote. Banks would not bother devoting resources to their predatory business model. Crooked politicians would not bother campaigning for their own cause and presenting themselves as trustworthy to us. None of these things would be viable things to do, because <strong>truly loving people would not approve such things and would not buy into such things.</strong> Instead they would be watchful and they would resist the things that harmed their neighbors and their society, and they would keep control of themselves, so that their decision making abilities were not compromised and their appetites for selfish things did not tempt them into unwieldy behavior. This is the obligation of the truly loving person, to behave optimally at all times for the sake of his peers, to prepare himself for action at all times and negate the possibility that evil can prosper unchallenged. And this is what the Christian will work toward at all times if he is truly Christian. <strong>Christ likeness.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it would look more like mainstream atheism. They literally refer to themselves as &quot;free thinkers&quot; and pride themselves on an &quot;evidence-based&quot; worldview while they actually just accept pretty much whatever the Democrats, the media and the scientific establishment tell them. If you dare question 9/11 they&#39;ll shun you from the Free Thinkers club. They&#39;re close-minded and authoritarian while believing they&#39;re the complete opposite. Not only that, they spend much of their time acting as thought police, harassing and ridiculing anyone who questions their group&#39;s sacred beliefs. It&#39;s a brilliant mechanism of control, and I would be surprised if TPTB are not already consciously exploiting it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have my own subreddit and I admit some of the posts do lean on the more religious/spiritual side. However, as the sub grows, I can see it shifting to a more balanced view which is good.</p>

<p>With that being said, many of these conspiries <em>are</em> related to the religious and spiritual.</p>

<p>First there are claims that these elite pedophiles worship Lucifer. Maybe that sounds outrageous at first glance, but when you continue to dig, it gets more and more disturbing.</p>

<p>Further, isn&#39;t the question of why we exist in the first place ultimately a spiritual concept...even a conspiracy?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know how you can completely separate conspiracies with the spiritual...just like I don&#39;t know how you can separate conspiracies from politics.</p>

<p>If you go in with a completely open mind, you&#39;ll be shocked at what you find.</p>

<p>In the same way, what if I made a post saying the opposite? Does anybody have a sub that only talks about religious conspiracies? Wouldn&#39;t I be missing out?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.  Unfortunately, the conspiracy community seems to be inextricably linked with ridiculous superstitions, religion, and numerology.  It really turned me off at first, but after a while you learn to just ignore the b.s. and focus on actual conspiracies.</p>

<p>numerology, etc. as evidence to back up their claims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You don&#39;t need to believe in numerology to realize the central planners do. They are superstitious freaks indeed. As a (very) small intro <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUXTzVj5-uE#t=07m11s">here is a crash course from Christine Lagarde</a> (starts at 7:11).</p>

<p>Many people here I think have become interested in this when they realized 911 was not only an inside job, it was a hermetic ritual.</p>

<p>Also realize the materialist hypothesis has, for all intents and purposes, been falsified by science. I suggest <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=VqULEE7eY8M">this excellent documentary</a> on the simulation hypothesis. And finally, a quote by Max Planck:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clearheaded science, to the study of matter, I can tell you as a result of my research about the atoms this much: There is no matter as such! All matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together [...] We must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Spirit. This Spirit is the matrix of all matter. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Max Planck, <em>Das Wesen der Materie [The Nature of Matter]</em>, 1944)</p>

<p>...which is somewhat science centric in ye olde Skeptical Inquirer kinda way.</p>

<p>But honestly when I think of &quot;secular conspiracy&quot; my first thoughts go to that vast project of 17th century enlightenment to &quot;secularize religion&quot; for the masses via science and humanities.  From Hume to Maxwell to Hubble, it has fascinating archeology, to borrow Foucault&#39;s term for it.  And yesteryear&#39;s battle against so-called witches continues today under the new guise.  It&#39;s shocking how science graduates are trained with limited critical thinking skills and unknowingly conspire with this agenda.   In my experience that&#39;s part of the reason mysticism/juju can be so reviled by many science minded folks, because it speaks towards that selfsame gaping hole in a logos-centric concept of reality shared by fundamentalist religious nutcases.  </p>
