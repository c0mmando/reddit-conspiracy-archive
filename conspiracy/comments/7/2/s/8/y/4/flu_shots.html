Whats to stop an agency thats employing anyone ( health, construction or retail) to start placing thing in your body weather or not you aprove. Shit it might not even be for public health. What if starbucks wanted to chip all there employees to see if there calling in sick for legitimate purposes. And find out they wanted a day off instead or had a sick relative to care for. Do they get fired for that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you eat in the cafeteria? Do you have contact with people that are in direct care? Do you use the same bathrooms, touch the same door handles? It&#39;s all about refusing risk of infection. Just like requiring tb tests and immunisations.</p>

<p>Hospitals are accredited and graded on things like nosocomial infections. Anything they can do to reduce risk like mandating hand washing, glove wearing, viral vaccinations all reduce the risk of patients that have compromised immune systems becoming sick or sicker because of things they catch while in the hospital.</p>

<p>If the flu vaccine is effective of course they will require it. Hospitals are probably the one place that should be able to manatee required vaccinations because of so much contact with people that can easily contact illnesses that can be fatal due to their conditions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. People forget to wash their hands all the time. I&#39;ve worked in hospitals. It is so fast paced that it gets missed. Also some people don&#39;t because it chaps their hands. People cough and touch their faces without thinking. </p>

<p>Healthcare withers aren&#39;t immune to making mistakes. The rate of nosocomial infections in hospitals is tremendous because mistakes get made in sterile and aseptic technique, and because people are filthy in general.</p>

<p>Hospitals are going to do whatever they can to minimize that risk. I guarantee that it you are in the hospital getting chemo you are going to hope that everyone is up to date on all vaccines and flu shots. Your immune system will be shit and you will need every advantage you can get.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to vax, that&#39;s your business. It&#39;s unfortunate, because of herd immunity. But antivaxxers have no business working in hospitals. It&#39;s unethical, dangerous, and write possibly would open the hospital up to liability if they knew and allowed someone to continue working.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When a patient walks into a modern hospital, they should be able to trust that the people working there believe in modern medicine and are using it to make the hospital a safe and healthy environment.  That includes keeping the employees vaccinated to prevent the outbreak of easily preventable diseases.  If you want to risk your own health by dismissing science in favor of your misguided conspiracy theories, that is your right.  But you do not have that right when acting as a health care professional in charge of vulnerable patients, many of whom do not have the option to be vaccinated because their immune systems are already compromised.  If you don&#39;t trust the medical establishment, don&#39;t be a part of it.  Unilaterally dismissing accepted medical practices makes you a danger to everyone who walks into your hospital.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Immunization against disease has been in use for at the very least centuries. And the vaccine doesn&#39;t fight one Syrian it fights several. I do not know but if I want to find out I can either ask the person administering the vaccine, check the label of the vaccine, ask my doctor or check the CDC, WHO or other health organization websites.</p>

<p>After checking I found the WHO recommendation to the FDA for 2016-2017 was H1N1, H3N2 and the B/Victoria lineage flu strains for the trivalent flu shot. For quadrivalent vaccines here are other recommendations but I think you understand, the data is readily available to see which flu strains are being prepared for. You can also find the data which causes those strains to be chosen from the websites of the different organizations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think I can school in vaccines, you seem very uneducated on the topic. Antibiotics are for bacteria, not viruses, they are unrelated to vaccines. The development of super bacteria is unfortunate but has nothing to do with antibiotics being overused but more to do with there being many people who would be dead today if they weren&#39;t treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics are not prescribed for a sniffly nose, they are used to combat diseases which need antibiotics. If they weren&#39;t dead then more people would die from diseases, or just wouldn&#39;t be possible for them to one day die of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Antibiotics have saved infinitely more lives than they have ever or at risk.</p>

<p>Vaccines and antibiotics are unrelated, they are also actually studied by different doctors in different medical fields.</p>

<p>Vaccines cannot cause a virus to mutate any more than you being sick and getting better could cause one to mutate. Vaccines do not cause mutation, to suggest otherwise shows blatant ignorance on the subject of the development of diseases. </p>

<p>The flu virus does not mutate a new strain which becomes widespread ever year, new strains take a long time to propagate throughout a population. </p>

<p>Flu shots are administered based on the current worst flu viruses, not on the virus of the year prior. </p>

<p>Vaccines cannot prevent your immune system from preparing for the flu, they do the utter and complete opposite. You don&#39;t seem to know how vaccination works, I recommend you speak to your doctor or another medical professional or perhaps do some research yourself to learn how they function.</p>

<p>The immune system does not prepare for diseases on its own, it manufactures countermeasures against a virus when it is infected with said virus. This is why vaccination is vital to keep people alive and prepared for viruses.</p>

<p>Millions of people would die of diseases every year which don&#39;t already if it weren&#39;t for vaccination. Many still do because others refuse vaccination and put them at risk. One of my siblings was immunocompromised as a teenager. An unvaccinated person would have likely caused his death if he had met them at that time. Please remember, your life is yours to waste but you are also causing the deaths of others if you do not  vaccinate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I actually didn&#39;t read any of that on Wikipedia or the CDC, I typed it all myself :)</p>

<p>The medical doctors who study antibiotics are not the ones who study vaccines. Since you do not trust researchers and doctors on antibiotics, the people who actually discovered antibiotic-resistant bacteria, shouldn&#39;t you refuse to accept super bacteria exist before you disbelieve in vaccines? Vaccines are handled by completely different researchers after all.</p>

<p>You also seem to think antibiotics are bad for some reason. Antibiotics were not a mistake, they are highly necessary to save millions of lives every year. Super bacteria have not made antibiotics obsolete, they are still used and are still important.</p>

<p>Considering the entire medical community has saved more lives than you or I can imagine, I will trust their recommendation on vaccines rather than think a bacteria which has failed to affect even a fraction of the people regular bacterial diseases have  has any bearing on whether or not vaccines work.</p>

<p>You say you don&#39;t trust doctors at all, but why specifically vaccines? Why are you so against vaccines specifically when there isn&#39;t any research or history to show them being dangerous?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a somewhat better chance, it&#39;s the difference between some diseases being able to propagate at all. Look at measles which was almost wiped out, just like polio. Consider it like this. You and a friend have a one in one hundred chance of getting the flu from each other. You decide to get vaccinated and now have a one in ten thousand chance of getting the flu from each other. Your friend later also decided to get the flu vaccine, you both now have a one in one million chance of getting the flu from each other. </p>

<p>Flu vaccines do not cover a single strain of the flu virus either, they are designed to protect against the most common flu strains of each year.</p>

<p>A 1956 study saw no effect on reproduction in rats during their lifetime at up to 5% of their diet being polysorbate 80. Reproduction decreased at 20% of their diet.

<p>I can&#39;t find any results for human testing (for both Polysorbate 80 and Triton X-100) AND the only sources that speak on this are holistic medicine websites that are also trying to sell product and re-link to each other in endless source loops.

    <div class="md"><p>Vaccines are a growth sector, they are preferred to drugs because only minimal testing is required, saving money, the pharmaceuticals don&#39;t have to payout for vaccine injuries, not much marketing is required as they can simply lobby the jab into the schedule. Paul Offit became a multi millionaire by getting the vaccine he holds a patent for into the schedule, he recently admitted that he lies to the public about vaccine safety, he recommended that other doctors do the same.</p>

<p>The biggest money maker of all with vaccines is the lifelong diseases and allergies they induce, leaving millions dependent on expensive drugs for vaccine damage such as epilepsy, asthma, ms etc. That is the big reason why real testing will not be permitted with vaccines and why the witch hunts are started. Without vaccines the pharmaceuticals would have a much smaller number of sick people to sell drugs to, their profits would be less than half of what they are now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of it along the lines of what a gardener does in the garden, pulling out weeds, trimming the hedges, cutting branches and cutting the grass.  He/she still wants most of the plants to be there, but it&#39;s about cutting them down to the size he wants, allowing him/her to keep control of the garden.</p>

<p>Of course, the flu jab is nothing about flu, it&#39;s an injection with substances which will help to socially engineer society e.g. reducing fertility levels, inducing lifelong and highly profitable diseases (making us a profitable plant in the garden).  The flu vaccine will not benefit the individual, it benefits only those at the top of the pyramid, the gardener who sees us as plants and weeds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your first video is rather pointless, thiomersal is not in any vaccines for infants or pregnant mothers. There have also been numerous studies on the effects of thiomersal (thiermosal for americans) demonstrating there is absolutely correlation between thiomersal or autism. There is also conclusive evidence that thiomersal is harmless to humans, having a significantly shorter half life than methylmercury. Ethylmercury is both safe for infants and is not an ingredient in vaccines for any child. There are also vaccines which do not contain thiomersal available to people of all ages, it is their choice if they wish to have a vaccine without ethylmercury as an ingredient. Once again, studies have shown overwhelmingly that thiomersal is safe and has no ill effects when used in vaccines and once again it is not used in vaccines unless for an adult patient, where the adult has the choice of receiving a different vaccine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your second video talks about how a certain vaccine is ineffective in children but is still recommended for adults and the elderly. Still recommended. There are now multiple effective vaccines for children for influenza so I&#39;m not sure what that&#39;s meant to prove. There is also no cited source for the study showing ineffectiveness that was apparently created by the four scientists. In fact there&#39;s zero source for any of the claims in this video.</p>

<p>Second of all, even the video that this anonymous YouTuber is using as his basis says that the cancer found in lab animals was caused by a contaminant and that the vaccine was removed immediately from use. So a contaminant is first of all something that isn&#39;t supposed to be in the vaccine and second of all the contaminated vaccine was removed from use. How does this prove anything? Please use your own words in your response, neither of these videos were anything but completely idiocy.</p>

<p>Ultimately it comes down to what you want to do. If you think it works, get it. Just know the side effects beforehand. A lot of people get the flu right after getting the shot.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also full of heavy metals that can build up in the brain and other organs and eventually cause cancer.</p>

<p>I for one, have never gotten, and never will get the flu shot and only had the flu 3 times in my life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>depends on what youre referring to for &quot;heavy metals&quot; in the flu shot. Many people fear over some chemicals added, which act as preservatives. Other things pointed to are added to act as a way to induce the immune response by creating an irritation within the region. Foreign protein particles, like what come in the flu vaccine, can induce an immune reaction from the human body. But combine that with irritation, it induces a much more effective response and creates a secondary immune reaction readiness, so if you get the same flu strain as what was predicted in the vaccine, your body will be prepared to fight it quickly</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mercury is not just shoved in a vaccine, vaccines contain thiomersal, a mercury-based preservative. There is no obligation to receive a vaccine containing thiomersal (thiermosal if you&#39;re American) and you can request one without he preservative from your doctor, despite the extensive testing showing that thiomersal in vaccines has no negative effects on humans if you&#39;re uncomfortable with it alternative vaccines are always and easily available. </p>

<p>Formaldehyde is a chemical your body produces on its own and is only considered carcinogenic in high doses, the kinds of doses that a vaccine is nowhere near equalling. The reason for formaldehyde being included in the vaccine is to keep the virus in the vaccine inactive, otherwise anyone who got a vaccine would just be getting an injection of the live unweakened virus. You&#39;ll receive a higher dose of formaldehyde from walking on a sidewalk for thirty seconds than from a vaccine. It&#39;s found in car exhaust, but again don&#39;t be afraid to walk outside, it&#39;s still in such low doses that it will never have an adverse effect on the human body.</p>

<p>Lead and barium are not ingredients in vaccines, it is absurd to say so when they aren&#39;t even used. You should speak to your doctor about vaccines and see if maybe the other beliefs you hold about them are myths as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are no heavy metals in vaccines that build up in the brain, that&#39;s absurd and ignores simple biology. </p>

<p>You having the flu three times in your life does not change the fact that vaccines lower flu infection rates, based on statistics you would have likely had the flu two or less times in your life if you had been vaccinated.</p>

<p>People cannot get the flu from a vaccine, vaccines cause an immune response in the body by placing inactivated or in patients with weakened immune systems dead viruses in the human body. The immune system produces a response to the weakened virus and destroys it. Many symptoms of the flu are caused by the immune response to having the flu, such as having a runny nose and upset stomach. The immune response can cause these symptoms for a short time after the vaccine, but in the vast, vast, vast majority of cases these symptoms are unnoticeable. After the immune response the immune system is better prepared for if it receives the virus again, meaning your body is now trained to kill the virus if you become infected with the real thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The metals contained in vaccines are not damaging to humans, if you want me to explain why that is I can though I explained it in an earlier response to someone who responded to you. Vaccines are overwhelmingly a positive thing that have a large effect on people being protected from disease. Talk with your doctor about receiving a vaccine and definitely don&#39;t have one at work if you&#39;re immunocompromised. </p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t immunocompromised getting the flu shot from your work sounds like a good idea. Thiomersal is the mercury based preservative in multi vial vaccines, if you don&#39;t want to have a vaccine containing any mercury compound you can request it from you doctor and it&#39;s possible your work also offers them. This does not mean that thiomersal is dangerous, hundreds of studies have found no adverse effects from the doses placed in vaccines. If you don&#39;t want it though you can request a vaccine without it. Overall I would recommend very strongly that you get the vaccine to better protect yourself and others from disease.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got the flu shot a couple times. Each time, a week later I was so sick that I couldn&#39;t fucking move for a month. Two years ago I got the flu after about 5 years of not getting a shot and not getting sick and was sick for four days tops. The same goes for almost everyone I know who got the flu shot. Deathly sick a week after, sometimes lasting longer than 3 months. I don&#39;t know what to believe when it comes to the flu vaccine, but what I do know is that I&#39;ve had bad experiences with it. I won&#39;t get the shot again.</p>

<p>The last time I went to my family doctor she got very belligerent with me about not getting the shot. I told her what I wrote above. &quot;it&#39;s all in your head,&quot; she said. Yeah. OK. Just as I was about to leave, my favorite nurse came in with a syringe ready and when I asked what the fuck she was doing, she told me that the doctor told her I wanted the shot. She apologized profusely. My doctor did not. Bitch.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh because tens of thousands of people needlessly die from Flu every year...</p>

<p>It&#39;s not rocket science.  Also the populations most prone to Flu are children and the elderly, i.e. Those with weaker immune systems, not people who are exactly reproducing too often, so the infertility argument doesn&#39;t hold much water </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have never had a flu shot in my life, I get a cold once a year when the weather transitions from hot to cold and it lasts about 2-3 days max and isnt anything worse then a runny nose and slight cough.</p>

<p>This flu shot stuff is just a way for big pharma to make cash. And who knows what else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get the flu shot every year (plus pneumonia shot every couple of years). I was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis and an immune disorder when I was 14, I used to get pneumonia and bad flu&#39;s all the time, and each time it was detrimental for my health. Ever since receiving flu shots I may get a cold every now and then, but nothing severe, and not one case of pneumonia, and since then my lungs have not produced any more fibrosis.</p>

<p>So I have to say, I do appreciate the flu shot, as well as others who get the flu shot, you may be preventing the spread to someone with serious immune disorders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t <em>gotta</em> work at a hospital, but since you do, you <em>gotta</em> get a flu shot.  The hospital exists to heal the sick and suffering, not to employ you.  If you want to make a living off of it, you do it by their rules.  That&#39;s capitalism, and also really just basic decency and common sense.  There&#39;s nothing fucked up about it.</p>
