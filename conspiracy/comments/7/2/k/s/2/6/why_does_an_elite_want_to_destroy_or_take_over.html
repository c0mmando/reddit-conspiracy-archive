       You're making the assumption that "Satan" literally exists. There's zero proof of that. Ideology, sure. But not his physical existence.

       No.  There is ample proof that he exists.  For example, demons and fallen angels have appeared to people -- including the likes of Aleister Crowley and other "high priests" of the Satanic NWO agenda.

       That's still not proof. I really hope you understand that. I could tell people I hear God's voice, that doesn't make me a prophet. I could tell people I saw a demon, that still doesn't make it true. Hell, if anything that could just mean I'm schizophrenic.

       The spiritual realm must exist.  The physical universe is finite in both space and time.  It had a beginning.  It cannot have existed forever, or else it would be in a state of infinite disorder, per the 2nd law of thermodynamics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, some "entity" that is separate from the physical universe must have caused the universe to come into existence.  That "entity" is the Creator or "God".

You're not getting the point?

       This is not a "fairy tale".  The ruling elites literally worship Satan. 
 Research the Illuminati, Freemasonry (worship of Lucifer), the Bohemian Grove, etc.  They think that there is a "spiritual" realm, and that they are literally in contact with intelligent beings in another dimension.

       It's part of their religion. In their own words, they worship Lucifer. You (not you specifically but people in general) not believing in anything not physical doesn't mean they don't.  Your thinking it's all Hocus pocus works to their advantage.

       The higher up you get on the food chain the more and more you run into Luciferianism, and this has been well-documented by thousands of people throughout history.  Don't be dense, it's completely irrelevant whether you believe this or not, what's relevant is that the most powerful people on the planet do.  Denial of the spiritual aspects of reality is only seeing a very tiny piece of the picture.

       First understand your enemy. The Jesuits, The Rothschilds, Black nobility, Free Masons, Zionist Israel, they are all spiritual. However, they take the Luciferian path, the Dark path. TPTB want you to not believing spiritual things, thus not investigating what they are truly doing.

       Sounds like you envision them having normal human minds and a conscience. They don't. They have been groomed since birth to believe    in their superiority to the common man. In fact, they don't even see the two as the same species. Believing the populace is, at best, expendable is as natural to them as the average person believing in the mainstream ideology they were raised in.

       You're right, we should be trying to take over the world. We start small, stop voting and participating in the charade. We are idiots if we don't try to escape. Complicit in our destruction.

       Most people think our rulers are decent because most people are decent. Some people are not decent. But to engage them in their game is to sink to their level and go down with them. I think individually we have to detach from their systems and encourage the others we know to disengage. Strengthen our hearts and steady our nerves and build our own world.

       They want to be kings again.

       Have you ever visited one of the old palaces in Europe? Those rulers lived lavishly. They had all the power they could want. The biggest issue that they had was that the poor people knew who they were and where they lived.

       They've been educated into believing that they are participating in the greater good. Many people believe in overpopulation. If that is true, then some of us have got to go. This gives people an incentive not to fix certain things in society.

       Not only do some of them do satanic shit,
but they also spread "sex, money, drugs" propaganda
in the music industry, TV, hollywood, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oversexualization (more promoted unprotected sex = more children) and extreme consumerism culture (wasting resources through product planned obsolescence, unremovable phone batteries, fracking to damage the envrionment, etc.).

       The elites are really bad eggs.
Psychotic morons. Either that or the "archons control them" theory....which is pretty out there.
I don't know their motivations but they're sick, and their way of life is extremely illogical.
Parasitic just for the sake of it.

       I think "the plan" is laid out in the U.N.'s Agendas. The goal of the elites is to actually save the world from destruction while at the same time securing their positions to always be in charge. The planet needs depopulated of humans and we should be keeping large areas of land uncorrupted. I've been saying for awhile now that I agree with the end game, just not how it'll be achieved.

       All these religious nut nubs are going to be the last straw for me. What's equal as bad as a corporate/political shill? A religious one. The Bible and religion is a fucking tool to enslave the masses. You can't be anti government, anti TPTB, anti corruption and pro-church. They're all in the same category and your favorite institution that's been brainwashed into you isn't somehow exempt.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP, the sole reason is POWER, and greed. Our economy is a power structure, religion is a power structure, every institution has a power structure all the way to the top.

       You don't have to be the slightest bit religious or even spiritual to understand that the very top of society are Luciferians and this has been documented by thousands of people throughout history.  They engage in dark rituals and black magic because they believe it confers power to their deeds, and this affects you and your life on a subtle level without you even knowing it whether you like it or not.

       Ancient civilisations were a lot more connected than people think and maybe came from a "World Order" or something like that. A lot of the 'elites' want to return to what they think is a Golden Age, Atlantis basically, and the less bad ones are led along and believe you can tell 'Noble Lies' to the 'masses' for the 'Greater Good'. They have a belief that most people do not have souls and are simply there to be used to benefit those that do, kind of like how most if you view animals really. They also believe that if you don't take responsiblity to not be ignorant then it's your fault that you don't survive. Their secret societies are run like that, they tell half-truths and you're expected to learn the 'real truth'/progress the greater good to move up. They believe they should bring order and stability to their livestocks lives, again most of you believe that about other animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, they're born into cults and compartmentalised. This is based on Luciferianism/Freemasonry (not really evil, just pagan so therefore evil in the eyes of members of an opposite cult), which is based on older pagan religions, but they're all basically the same. Some might worship Satan in a symbolic sense but i don't think they really believe in demons or anything like that, it's just a confusion tactic to scare the peasants. There are contradictory rumours that they believe in a karma less reincarnation and that they believe in 'natural law', the idea that you have to consent and be a 'willing fool' or they will suffer bad universe points.

       If you look at a human from Cradle to grave, you can put a price tag on a human life and decide how to profit from that existence. Once you are done factoring in variables, you do your best to create events that will maximize your profit over the life of that individual.

       They are Luciferians who believe it is their religious duty to destroy 'God' and his 'Creation', namely, us.  At the lower levels they, like us, 'know not what they do' and are still blinded by 'the veil'.  They have hatred for the monotheistic religions and are completely absorbed in their philosophies, believing the Game to be real.  At the highest Bloodline levels, they understand that they (like all of us) are playing a role within The Great Game, can recall their 'true memory' as higher ascended lifeforms, and are providing the Catalyst for negativity to create the conditions necessary to force choice - service to others (which is positive service to the self) or service to the self (negativity and selfishness).
