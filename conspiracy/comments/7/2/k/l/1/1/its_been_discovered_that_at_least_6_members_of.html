    <div class="md"><p>Not even close to the same thing. Trump&#39;s family has actually released their emails and why they used them. None were acting Secretary of State and had a private email server in their home. They also didn&#39;t have any top secret information. Nor did they delete half of them after sopena. Lie to the American public about it and somehow not ever get charged with a crime. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to defend the Trump&#39;s, but to call it outright hypocrisy is bullshit since you are leaving out most of the crimes she committed. Hillary really needs to shut the fuck up and go away. The Dems are never going to get independent voters like me if they continue to defend a criminal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, there are about 1000 articles over at <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> about every detail, try reading some. But let&#39;s get back to the secretary of state, not an aid or family member, top secret information, private home server, deleting emails after sopena and not even charged. Are you accusing Trump&#39;s family of any of that? Now you have a few instances of private email use by people who haven&#39;t spent over a decade either loving in our working directly for the White House. I&#39;m not saying that they should have used a private server, but the details and crimes committed are vastly different. </p>

I&#39;ll supply with every answer you need to point to Trump and I&#39;ll ask for any real shred of evidence that their was actual Russian collision. In the end you&#39;ll spin in circles. Did the FBI or any intelligence agency inspect the DNC servers? His did they come up with the conclusion of Russia if the DNC denied the FBI access (how that&#39;s possible I have no idea), any explanation on that? Snowflake.</p>

<p>And he did have other valid points. If there subpoena these folks, would the turn over the emails or would they try and destroy the evidence?</p>

<p>I do recall some emails coming out during the whole met with that Russian lawyer (who was let in by the previous administration none the less.)</p>

<p>This means you definitely haven&#39;t exercised in who knows how long, are mad as hell often, get sugar crashes from the bad food you scarf down, smell like a mix of stale cum and Doritos, and haven&#39;t enjoyed the company of a woman in years (ever?).   You also aren&#39;t too handy in any kind of physical altercation, or have any actual athleticism in general...so this whole Reddit warrior thing means A LOT to you. </p>

<p>Whatever disease is brewing in you as a result of this lifestyle will be a real bitch dude.  So is that depression you&#39;re  battling.

<p>have reportedly used private email accounts </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No proof from a known-to-be-liars media outlet is so damning! You master sleuth you!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There have been numerous controversies surrounding Post:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On September 21, 1979, a large page one headline read, &quot;THE BEATLES ARE BACK,&quot; with the subheadline &#39;Fab Four reunited for big UN concert in New York.&#39; The Beatles never reunited, and no retraction, apology, or acknowledgment of incorrect information was published.[40]
In 1997, a national news story concerning Rebecca Sealfon&#39;s victory in the Scripps National Spelling Bee circulated. Sealfon was sponsored by the Daily News, a direct in-market competitor. Post published a picture of her but altered the photograph to remove the name of the Daily News as printed on a placard she was wearing.[41]
On November 8, 2000, Post printed &quot;BUSH WINS!&quot; in a huge headline,[42] although the presidential election remained in doubt because of the recount needed in Florida. Like Post, many other newspapers around the country published a similar headline after the four major TV networks called the election for George W. Bush.
On March 10, 2004, Post re-ran, as a full-color page one photograph,[43] a photograph that had already been run three days earlier in black and white on page 9, showing the 24-story suicide plunge of a New York University student, who had since been identified as 19-year-old Diana Chien, daughter of a prominent Silicon Valley businessman. Among criticisms leveled at Post[44] was their addition of a tightly cropped inset photograph of Chien, a former high-school track athlete, depicting her in mid-jump from an athletic meet, giving the false impression that it was taken during her fatal act, despite the fact that she had fallen face up.
On July 6, 2004, Post ran an article claiming to have learned exclusively that Senator John Kerry, the Democratic Party&#39;s Presidential nominee-in-waiting, had selected former House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt to be the party&#39;s Vice Presidential nominee. The article, under the headline &quot;KERRY&#39;S CHOICE&quot;, ran without a byline.[45] The next day, Post had to print a new story, &quot;KERRY&#39;S REAL CHOICE&quot;, reporting Kerry&#39;s actual selection of Senator John Edwards of North Carolina as his running mate.
On April 21, 2006, several Asian-American advocacy groups protested the use of the headline &quot;Wok This Way&quot; for a Post article about Bush&#39;s meeting with the Hu Jintao, President of the People&#39;s Republic of China.[46]
On September 29, 2006, Post editor Sarah Polonsky was fired abruptly for accepting gifts.[47][48]
On September 27, 2006, Post published an article called &quot;Powder Puff Spooks Keith&quot; that made fun of Countdown host Keith Olbermann receiving an anthrax threat from an unknown terrorist.[49]
On December 7, 2006, Post doctored a front-page photograph to depict the co-chairmen of the Iraq Study Group—James Baker and Lee Hamilton—in primate fur, under the headline &quot;SURRENDER MONKEYS&quot;, inspired by a once-used line from The Simpsons. In defense of the &quot;Surrender Monkeys&quot; headline, media contributor Simon Dumenco wrote an Ad Age article about his love for Post.[50]
On February 18, 2009, Post ran a cartoon by Sean Delonas that depicted a white police officer saying to another white police officer who has just shot a chimpanzee on the street: &quot;They&#39;ll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill.&quot; The cartoon dually referred to President Obama and to the recent rampage of Travis, a former chimpanzee actor; it was criticized as being in bad taste, primarily by making a reference to the racist stereotype of African-Americans being portrayed as apes.[51] Civil rights activist Al Sharpton called the cartoon &quot;troubling at best given the historic racist attacks of African-Americans as being synonymous with monkeys.&quot;[52] Post has defended itself by stating that the cartoon was deliberately misinterpreted by its critics.[53]
On December 4, 2012, Post used a picture taken by a freelance photographer, R. Umar Abbasi, of a 58-year-old man identified as Ki Suk Han struggling to climb back up onto the platform of the 49th Street station as a subway train approached. The caption on the front read, &quot;Pushed on the subway track, this man is about to die&quot; on top, and &quot;DOOMED&quot; in large, boldface print on the bottom. The image caused outrage among many, as its use was viewed as exploiting a tragedy for commercial gain., though Abbasi stated that since he was not strong enough to pull the man up, he had attempted to use the flash on his camera to alert the driver of the oncoming train.[54]
Aspects of Post&#39;s coverage of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing were criticized. Post reported in several stories on the day of the attack that the death toll was 12, while most organizations reported two and then three fatalities. In addition, they reported that a Saudi national was being held as a suspect, but Boston Police denied this and said they had no suspects in custody.[55] Additionally, the April 18 cover of Post featured a full-page photo of two young men the paper described as being sought by law enforcement in possible connection with the attack. CBS News reporter John Miller reported that the two men are not considered suspects by the FBI. The apparent insinuation by Post that they were suspects was denounced by media critics.[56] In June 2013, the two men, Salaheddin Barhoum and Yassine Zaimi, sued Post for libel over the story.[57] In 2014, the suit was settled.[58][59]
On January 5, 2014, following the abduction and murder of Brooklyn businessman Menachem Stark,[60] Post cover story featured a picture of the victim dressed in his traditional Hasidic garb accompanied by the headline asking &quot;Who didn&#39;t want him dead?&quot;[61] That front page sparked outrage for its insinuation that the murder was justified vigilantism.[62][63][64][65][66] On that same day, some New York City elected officials condemned Post&#39;s cover story. In a press conference led by Brooklyn borough president Eric Adams,[67] New York City Public Advocate Letitia James declared, &quot;Today [New York Post has] given license to murder!&quot; James then asked that &quot;every government official should refrain from advertising in the New York Post, every government official should withdraw any governmental notice from the New York Post, and everyone should condemn the New York Post.&quot;[68]
Post and the Daily News often take potshots at each other&#39;s work and accuracy, particularly in their respective gossip-page items.</p>

<p>In certain editions of the February 14, 2007, newspaper, an article referring to then-Senator Hillary Clinton&#39;s support base for her 2008 presidential run referred to then-Senator Barack Obama as &quot;Osama&quot;;[69] the paper realized its error and corrected it for the later editions and the website.[70] Post noted the error and apologized in the February 15, 2007, edition.[71] Earlier, on January 20, 2007, Post received some criticism[72] for running a potentially misleading headline, &quot;&#39;Osama&#39; Mud Flies at Obama&quot;,[73] for a story that discussed rumors that Obama had been raised as a Muslim and concealed it.</p>

<p>Hillary&#39;s case is not the same thing.  To pretend otherwise is incredibly dishonest and only makes you and your party look ignorant.</p>
