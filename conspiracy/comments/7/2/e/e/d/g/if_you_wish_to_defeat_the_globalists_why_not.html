        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Victory attained by violence is tantamount to a defeat, for it is momentary.</p>

<p>Hate the sin, love the sinner.</p>

<p>To lose patience is to lose the battle.</p>

<p>Nonviolence is a weapon of the strong.</p>

<p>The future depends on what you do today.</p>

<p>An ounce of practice is worth a thousand words.</p>

<p>Civilization is the encouragement of differences.</p>

<p>No culture can live, if it attempts to be exclusive.</p>

<p>If you want real peace in the world, start with children.</p>

<p>The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.</p>

<p>Distinguish between real needs and artificial wants and control the latter.</p>

<p>Satisfaction lies in the effort, not in the attainment. Full effort is full victory.</p>

<p>First they ignore you, then laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.</p>

<p>Love is the strongest force the world possesses, yet it is the humblest imaginable.</p>

<p>You may never know what results come of your actions, but if you do nothing, there will be no results.</p>

<p>Have faith in humanity. Humanity is like an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the whole ocean doesn’t become dirty.</p>

<p>– Mohandas Gandhi</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Technically/partially. However, we are a part of a physical universe, at this level of perception. To say empirically that the earth is flat, after thinking this in early humanity, after the church burned people alive and excommunicated them for believing otherwise. Then finally, were able to prove the earth is round in a heliocentric system on paper. We go into space. So much video footage of launches, without edit from ground to space... to the point where you can see the curvature. </p>

<p>Hell, you have to calculate the curvature of the earth (sometimes it&#39;s rotation, too) to say, land a long distance sniper shot, amongst other fields where precision at a distance is required. I just don&#39;t get the flat earth thing. What is the flat earth resting in? Can we dig deep enough through the crust to the bottom? What happens if the ice caps melt, does all the water go spilling out into the void? Is it a void? How do we explain craters? Other planets and stars in the sky? All of recorded history mentions the sun, the moon and the stars. There was no tech for a hologram then. If it were technology that was creating these images, then it&#39;d have to malfunction at some point. Something has to power it.</p>

<p>Too many questions. Not enough answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gandhi offered a very appealing philosophy. Unfortunately it was all just talk. He was an agent or asset of British intelligence whose job was to control the opposition. Many historians agree that the British would have relinquished direct control of India anyway (of course they maintained indirect control). In fact, it&#39;s quite possible that Gandhi&#39;s (in)actions actually delayed the handing over of power. If you look carefully at what he actually accomplished, it&#39;s hard to see how it could have led to the overthrow of the British. </p>

<p>Think about it for a second: wouldn&#39;t TPTB <em>want</em> to convince us that nonviolence is the way to achieve change? I mean, what a great ploy: set up your man Gandhi to lead a campaign of non-violence, then after a couple of decades hand over power and give him all the credit, making it seem as if his nonviolent philosophy was the most effective way to make things happen. </p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/fakir.pdf">here is a link to a paper I wrote exposing the Gandhi psyop</a>, if you&#39;re interested.  </p>
