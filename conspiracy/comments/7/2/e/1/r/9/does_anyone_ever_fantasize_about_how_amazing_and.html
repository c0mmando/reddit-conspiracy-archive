    <div class="md"><p>Please name one system that actually exists that has improved the standard of living and even the standard of being poor, more than capitalism has.</p>

<p>What system are you comparing capitalism to?  I&#39;m tired of college kid communists constantly harping against capitalism while it has been demonstrated over and over again that communism makes EVERYONE poor.  Socialism takes a little bit longer but also makes everyone poor.</p>

<p>Capitalism works because our human instincts are compatible with it, capitalism plays on the natural strengths and desires of the human mind.  Socialism and communism fail because they try to litigate away our natural competitive drives, Ultima leading to a world where anyone who follows their instincts are being criminal and it becomes a mafia like power grab of who can secure the power to not participate in the communist dream while enforcing it on everyone without power with an iron fist.</p>

<p>So what system is better than capitalism?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flytape, you have this all ass backwards and unintentionally siding with the elites who are extreme capitalists.
People like me who advocate for restraining capitalism, don&#39;t necessarily want to get rid of capitalism.
A lot of people get anxiety in these topics but there&#39;s no need, as long as people
understand the real situation and don&#39;t do anything too drastic in economics.</p>

<p>Before I continue my comment, understand that
being a &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot; is ideological nonsense
and corporate marketting to get people to be loyal to
Dems/Repubs which are almost identical in economics.
The corporate media wants you to think Dem/liberals = left but
that&#39;s extremely far from the truth.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/jLNnO7O.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/jLNnO7O.jpg</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/hdh0EEf.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/hdh0EEf.jpg</a></p>

<p>Back to economics:
Long story short, most cultures have a mixed economics
system of socialism and capitalism.
Shills will keep pushing &quot;choose socialism or capitalism, I&#39;ll wait&quot;
but the truth is we have both and that&#39;s normal, we don&#39;t have to choose between them.</p>

<p>If you had full socialism or full capitalism, it would likely be hellish and retarded. (Full socialism might make people too complacent, full capitalism is corporate tyranny/fascism literally, allowing corps to run around doing whatever the hell they want).
Libertarian or authoritarian models of each vary considerably but you get my general point
that extremes usually suck.
Dems/Repubs are both EXTREME dressed up as normal.</p>

<p>The problem is it&#39;s crony capitalism (favoritism to corporations and other elites) AND that it&#39;s extreme capitalism (too far right).
We have too much capitalism and not enough socialism (bear with me here).
I just want the socialism-capitalism ratio to improve.
That&#39;s a much faster &quot;fix&quot; for poverty and other issues across the board
than trying to formulate a whole new system (whether it be communism, full socialism or whatever alternatives).</p>

<p>Some people are confused in this way:
they look at Obamacare and call it socialistic when it&#39;s really nowhere near. 
State control to artificially increase corporate profits is not socialism.
That&#39;s &quot;socialism inverted&quot; aka crony capitalism (favoritist corporate capitalism).</p>

<p>Crony capitalism = &quot;socialism for the super rich, rough capitalism for everyone else&quot;.</p>

<p>NEOliberalism (far right trickle down scam economics)
is what the vast majority of Democrats, Republicans
and Libertarian party puppets push.</p>

<p>Two flavors of NEOliberalism: authoritarian crony capitalism (state control to favor corps)
and far right libertarianism (free market shit....no regulations, therefore corps are free to do what they want).</p>

<p>I know &quot;free market&quot; sounds good on the surface but it&#39;s a massive establishment trap.
When you drop the whole &quot;I&#39;m a conservative so I have to believe in the free market&quot;
brainwashing, you will see the elites want you to think that way.
We&#39;re currently in extremely NEOliberal crony capitalistic economics.
Conservativism is just a form of NEOliberalism (liberty for corporate economics/full corporate domination of the market).</p>

<p>Who currently controls the gov? Corporations who lobby/bribe/blackmail politicians (hence we need to get
money out of politics).</p>

<p>Now take away the middle man: (the government/ALL regulations).
What&#39;s left behind?
Full corporate domination free for all, exploiting anything and everything for profit.
Am I fearmongering or exaggerating?
Hell no. They are absolutely capable of wiping the floor
with workers, small/medium businesses if the law doesn&#39;t restrain them.</p>

<p>The super rich (not talking rich, I mean SUPER rich/elite) tend to be both
extremely powerful (in terms of connections, wealth, resources, etc.)
as well as sociopathic and prepared to do anything to make
more money, no matter the consequences, morality not involved.
Hence corporations used to hire mafia thugs
to intimidate worker unions (in some countries this still happens unfortunately).</p>

<p>That&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg.
Corporations are vile.
That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m anti-business though.
I support small/medium businesses that are ethical,
but not corps.</p>

<p>Improving the socialism-capitalism ratio
would provide a balance between allowing ambition
for small/medium businesses (within ethical parameters), as well as protections
against worker exploitation, unethical business practices, 
legal/illegal corruption, etc.
and safety nets for workers/small/medium businesses.</p>

<p>Democratic socialism (center left, moderate left libertarian) is completely compatible with these ideals.
Although Bernie was more of a social democrat (don&#39;t confuse with Democrat party corporate brand)
which is almost American centrist.
Swap crony capitalism (free shit for corporations who are already insanely successful,
dishonest/corrupt, dodge tax, rip off workers by paying very low wages, pollute the environment, etc.)</p>

<p>There is full socialism, and then there&#39;s authoritarian socialism,
democratic socialism, social democracy, centrism, etc.
We just need a less extreme mix of socialism-capitalism.
We&#39;re currently in extremely authoritarian, extremely right wing economics.
Extremes are extreme because they benefit only a few people
(i.e. the elite central bankers/corporations/wallstreet).</p>

<p>Nah, I&#39;m 100% with you on this.  However I want to be clear that an intelligently regulated capitalist economy is what I&#39;m in favor of because there is no such thing as an intelligently capitalist socialist economy.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries, democratic socialism is still capitalistic (it&#39;s completely different to full socialism).</p>

<p>Full socialism : workers (or gov on their behalf) controlling the means of production of many or most markets.</p>

<p>Democratic socialism (generally center left) : only the essentials are controlled or at least regulated more
tightly against unethical conduct (all other market regulations would just be basic ethical ones).</p>

<p>By essentials, I mean things that the people would not want in corporate control:
healthcare, transport, education, energy and science/medical research.</p>

<p>Social democracy (Bernie&#39;s policies) is just a weaker form of democratic socialism
(somewhat more deregulated but still protecting the workers via social programs to some extent)</p>

<p>Check his tax plan to see how moderate his social democracy was.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/bNz2DHP.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/bNz2DHP.jpg</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m not advocating for full socialism, just mixed economics
democratic socialism (center left), social democracy or centrism.
That range on the spectrum seems to be the sweet spot
balance between business ambition and worker protections/safety nets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all about finding that perfect balance between capitalism and socialism. The scales need adjusted, and the rich do not want that. They use tactics to convince people that any shift in the system, is borderline communism. This is far from the truth. We have been having record level wealth redistribution to the top, and any discussion of trying to fix that is met with most extreme view of that scenario. We have no party that represents an economic left viewpoint. Bernie is the only major politician out there fighting for this currently. His message is popular, and I think the change will happen. I just hope it isn&#39;t too late.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely correct. Although you probably mean super rich/elites rather than rich (even &quot;rich&quot; is fairly subjective, and can cause division/confusion for some people who think they&#39;re rich in an arbitrary way, so sometimes get offended somehow).
But yeah Bernie was almost centrist, yet the corporate media screamed him down as a crazy full socialist or dictator or something.</p>

<p>The corporate media (including even the lesser evil RT/Russia Today)
pretends &quot;far right&quot; means authoritarian social issues (xenophobic stuff and all that).</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a deflection of the fact the Germany election was full of economically far right NEOliberals
but the media ignores that and keeps obsessing about social issues
that don&#39;t really affect the elites that much (like immigration, xenophobic rhetoric, LGBT stuff, etc.).
Economics is the number one thing to address that could improve everything across the board
even immigration if there was a non-corrupt global effort to stop corporate corruption....which won&#39;t happen
if we keep electing NEOliberal parties.</p>

<p>I clearly am saying if you can&#39;t balance the business you run by making your product/service affordable, while paying your employees a reasonable living wage, your business is a failure.</p>

<p>Wages are not where corners should be cut, since employees already often only end up enjoying a fraction of what their labor produces.</p>

<p>I did not say anything about rich or poor.</p>

You aren&#39;t going to make 70k a year unless you work towards it, make a plan and put the time in.  Go to a fucking trade school and learn to plumb. You might play with shit all day but you&#39;ll never be poor again.  And you won&#39;t get good tips if you suck at your job and don&#39;t provide any appreciable service.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tips aren&#39;t just a scam perpetrated by evil employers.</p>

<p>For that matter there are laws that if a server isn&#39;t at least making minimum wage after tips that they can&#39;t just pay them 2.25/hour.</p>

<p>Tips create a service motivation in nicer restaurants so you don&#39;t have shitty wait staff.  It&#39;s good for the customer, it&#39;s good for the employee, and it&#39;s good for the server (if they don&#39;t suck at service).</p>

<p>If I get good service I happily tip 20%, my servers recognize me when I return and provide top notch service.  My favorite sushi bar always sends me free hot sake because their staff likes me and they also like their staff.</p>

<p>If every job you&#39;ve ever worked feels like a predatory relationship to you, eventually you need to ask yourself if maybe YOU are the problem.  Maybe it feels predatory because you can&#39;t be relied upon to just do good work and your boss is forced to resort to some discipline matrix BS.  Maybe you would be rewarded if you put your time in and proved that you don&#39;t have to be hand held on a daily basis.  And yes many of us have encountered a shitty work place where hard work isn&#39;t rewarded and that should be the queue to move on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Wars to gain power, territory, stability and security etc. But the world is not an unknown place anymore and there is enough resources to sustain planet. The question is: why isn&#39;t every life worth the same? The difference is unbelievable. When people don&#39;t have to fight for their survival while others have so much they&#39;ll never be able to spend it before they pass away, there shouldn&#39;t be a need for war. Debt is slavery and it&#39;s gone completely out of hand.</p>

<p>I hope people will try to come up with ideas on how we could build societies around the well being of all. If we don&#39;t, then it&#39;s not going to get any better. Every civilisation before us is nothing but stories and ruins.</p>

<p>Bull. Fucking. Shit. &quot;America is responsible for everyone&#39;s failures!!&quot; Fuck off Howard Zinn. If Communism is so great, why don&#39;t a bunch of you get together and form a commune and prove to everyone how it works. And then your numbers will just grow and grow that way. As Socrates said, &quot;Change comes from building the new, not tearing down the old&quot;.</p>

<p>In Capitalism, every single idea has to have a prototype and there has to be an initial sale and people have to buy your product. Otherwise you fail. You have the opportunity to build your commie paradise, commie. Right now. Get you and your commie friends together, pool your money, and show me what the perfect society looks like. If you can&#39;t do it in a 6 loser commie house, then it won&#39;t work at 350 mil, get it? Please for the love of god read &quot;The Fatal Conceit&quot; by Hayek.</p>

<p>What&#39;s a natural leader? Based on the actual workings of nature, a natural leader is whoever can take the reigns. Nature is brutal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine if they didn&#39;t own our currency as a privatized commodity, but instead managed it as a public good.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our currency being managed as a privatized commodity is what allowed for the continuous growth of the American Empire, and the amount of prosperity that we have here. If it were managed as a public good, we would not have had the massive economic growth we had over the past ~70 years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine if technology was utilized to serve us rather than enslave and militarize us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How much of it comes down to individual choice and responsibility? Don&#39;t you think that people have some say in how technology is implemented in their life? You&#39;ve got to buy the technology and put your information into it/turn it on/pay attention to it in order for it to enslave/militarize you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine if the schools and TV networks were educating us instead of brainwashing and misleading us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The schools thing I have no rebuttal for - it&#39;s a legal requirement to send your kid to school, and they are aimed to train us to be obedient citizens. But, they also provide all (most) children with literacy on multiple levels, which unlocks the ability to self-educate. TV, like technology above, is up to us - we choose to watch what we watch.</p>

<p>Those in power want to stay in power, and if you were in power you&#39;d want to stay in power too. Compared to slavery, serfdom, and caste systems, we&#39;re living in a pretty good time as non-elites. I&#39;m not saying it couldn&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t get better, but pie-in-the-sky thinking and dreaming of an idealized future without taking the tangible steps to begin putting it in place (which would almost certainly take longer than your or my lifetime, meaning that we would never see the fruits of our labor) is just as wasteful and enslaving as the other forms of technology you&#39;re decrying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Power, not money, is the root of all motivation; altruistic or self-serving.</p>

<p>Money simply provides a means toward either end.</p>

<p>You&#39;re calling them evil for doing the very same thing you would do if you had that power; responding to the fear of losing that power.
As long you have the power, you decide how that power is used. The moment you relinquish that power, you run the risk of having that power subjugated to an end that you disagree with. Giving the power back to the people means nothing; most of us have no idea the minutiae of how the system actually works. We can broad stroke it all day long, but the intricacies of its inner workings require specialized individuals set to the task. In short, you need to be the creator of the system or impart power to those that can.</p>

<p>As long as there is power, there will always be a corruption of that power. You, intending to protect how that power is used, will secure that power for yourself under the belief that you are the only one capable of managing it correctly. You might dole out some measures of power to those capable of handling things you are either incapable or unwilling to manage but ultimately the final word will always fall upon you.</p>

<p>If you need more proof of this; look at any subreddit. They start out with a particular goal in mind; representing the subject. Over time, that subject invariably adapts, adopting the nuances of those who hold the most power as to shape the rules of the subreddit to maintain specific concepts and narratives. Even r/conspiracy is guilty of this. I guarantee you the power the mods hold, they would be unwilling to part with because they believe they have the best methods and measures in mind to keep the subreddit true to the spirit they believe fits their perceptions, because if it didn&#39;t, <em>they&#39;d simply abandon this one and form one more conducive to their worldviews</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always about power, OP. Always. Doesn&#39;t matter if that power is influence of thought, money, threat of violence, or simple domination by strength; power is power. You will fight to keep what little you get.</p>

<p>So imagine a world where the pursuit of the self were the driving motivation in life, not the dominion over others, the subjugation of freedom in others.</p>

<p>Start there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like so much of this &quot;being woke&quot; mentality falls victim to solutions that take easier outs than people are willing to consider. Sure we could eliminate the Fed, prosecute every politician for various scandals, and even eliminate the .1% among other topics, but does that really solve what we seek? I probably didn&#39;t list something someone may consider a slightly more important topic (like disclosure, HAARP, Seth Rich, and the list goes on and on) so we get stuck on this or that. We as a community can&#39;t say we have solved anything as far as how to move forward out of the broken world we live in, but we certainly have gotten good at pointing and saying we don&#39;t like x. We have also gotten good at throwing opinions around from sources, claiming those sources are fraudulent or weak, or altogether ignoring the simple fact that people are inherently like this.</p>

<p>Everyone wants to be a hero, everyone wants to be the leader, but no one really wants to consider standpoints of those that are already there. This system we live in is designed to make us, as people, think we don&#39;t need to think. This system tells us &quot;Hey, you are making more than Bob over there, but not as much as Fred, so you decide what makes you content.&quot; Then people spend their lives considering this the thing they chase. Everyone is guilty of it, whether it&#39;s knowledge, fame, fortune, it is that human nature that we need to learn to change.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Everyone wants to be a hero, everyone wants to be the leader</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m glad you said this.</p>

<p>A lot of what I read on reddit is one step below modern fairy tales; armchair psychology meets monday morning quarterbacking with a dash of utopian idealism. So much is being said about how we should bring down the 1%, right the government, and end the corruption, but consider this:</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason fairy tales end with happily ever afters; its all pretty dull and mundane ever after. No one ever reads about how the good guys had to rebuild the world after they defeated the bad guys. No one ever reads about how they had to settle trade disputes between farmers who wanted to charge more because the fertilizer guys were charging more. </p>

<p>It&#39;s fun being the hero and hearing about the heroic things that change will bring, but honestly, not a single one of us has any practical experience in doing anything like that because no one has done it on a major scale since 1776. Sure the signing of the Declaration was pretty awesome, but everything afterward has been history lessons in a cheaply funded public school setting that was less engaging than a day at bible camp.</p>

<p>In short; the work that comes after the hero saves the day, that part no one thinks about.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh someone will take care of that.&quot;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with that top 1%; the business moguls, the oil barons, the software gurus, the financial elite. Let&#39;s say we &quot;take them down&quot;. Got anyone in mind who&#39;s willing to take up the reins of the country to pick up the pieces after the economy comes to a grinding halt? Or how about the banking system? What will serve as a reasonable form of compensation to people during that transitional period between taking down the central banking system and establishing...a different but same central banking system? Who do you trust to hand over the power to and manage the system of finance and economy that will invariably be needed to support this new society?</p>

<p>&quot;Oh someone will take care of that!&quot;</p>

<p>And the moment they do..we come back to the power that we so blindly give away.</p>

<p>And yes, you&#39;re right; we have gotten good at pointing out the things we don&#39;t like and the inequities of life. We&#39;ve gotten so good at it that we&#39;re desperate to find validation in it, i.e. the social justice movement. However, we can only point so many fingers at things along the highway of life before we see the next thing to point a finger at and in doing so, forget the last thing we pointed a finger at. </p>

<p>I could say a great deal more, but I think after a while, it&#39;d simply begin to reiterate what I&#39;ve already said.</p>

<p>In the end, we have the power, but unfortunately, we lack the experience and the will to use it. Just as the average person has become a slave to the comfort zone life&#39;s circumstances has put them into, so have we. We fear the unknown. We see the risk of losing everything to pursue a notion, an idealistic view of <em>what could be</em>, and all that it could become, but we are afraid of failure.</p>

<p>More importantly, we are afraid of failing alone. Of being the one to stand up, to speak with a voice, to challenge the system only to realize that we are the only one standing; and whatever message we might have had gets lost in the white noise of life.</p>

<p>If you want to know what&#39;s keeping us from change, it&#39;s that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is exactly my point, we as people get caught up in correcting one another instead of looking at deeper meanings. I did not mean everyone wants to be a hero/leader literally, but everyone considers themselves to be right, or more right than what is spoken.</p>

<p>it&#39;s just words, and at best they don&#39;t get to the crux of experience. Instead words are used to convey symbols that we loosely agree on. In this fashion law is constructed and argued upon, same as moral principles, same as our constitution. I can speak at lengths about things I know little about, and maybe even convince you that I&#39;m correct, sway your opinion, but in the end you write the better reality in your mind than I can convey to you through language.</p>

<p>I think magikarp is explaining what I am implying better than I am. My point is that we have that idea of utopia in our minds, and we would like to be there, but everyone has different ideas of what that utopia is. We truly can never agree with things being perfect because they can always be subject to a better way of being done.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not condoning being complacent about the corruption going on in today&#39;s world. We need people to identify and discuss what is wrong with certain actions and bring light to others to see for themselves. This does not mean we have the resolution to said corruption, simply the means of identifying it. To come up with a solution we would have to consider everyone&#39;s stance, both those we agree and disagree with, to really make a change. The problem with this then becomes what we agree on, as there will then be dissent for the chosen course of action naturally because, well, people want to be hero&#39;s and leaders.</p>

<p>Which is why globalism is and will never be nothing more than a dream. Put aside the daunting mathematics needed to provide a suitable economy or even considerations for climate differences; just consider the barebone differences between people, cultures, and societies as a whole.</p>

<p>Would China be willing to relinquish its power over its citizenry to belong to a global government if that meant no filtering the internet to push its narrative of control?</p>

<p>Would North Korea be willing to stop being North Korea?</p>

<p>Would Islam, or religion as a whole, agree to be a matter of family and private unto the individual, having no place in defining social or political policy?</p>

<p>Once you consider these things, you begin to see why power is so important and why it is our greatest roadblock.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are welcome to disagree, but I would ask you this; how important to you is it that you have control over your own life?</p>

<p>I&#39;d say, even without knowing you, that its pretty important. Your will and your destiny are your own. Would you abide someone coming into your home and telling you how to cook your eggs? Or what kind of shampoo you can use? They may be the small details, but they are pieces to a much larger image.</p>

<p>The glass of ceiling of power; a self-imposed minimum level of control that we, the average people, require in order to feel <em>in control</em> of our own lives. Everything above that are things we are either unwilling or unable to manage and thus we hand that power over to those that can.</p>

<p>Think of it like this:</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know how to fish, you can either learn how or pay someone for the fish they worked to get. If you learn to do it yourself, you maintain a form of power few possess; self-sustainment. In doing so, you sacrifice your own time to see that it happens. Or, you can sacrifice the power that comes from being able to do it yourself and pay someone to do it for you. Yes, you now have the time to pursue other endeavors BUT you are now under the control of the individual who provides your fish. It may sound silly, but if he or she chooses to raise the price of the fish you want, you have to consider either paying that price, finding another provider, or learning to do it yourself.</p>

<p>The glass ceiling of power. You may not desire to be a leader or a hero, but you do decide how much the world controls you.</p>

<p>So, parasites deceive others into being parasites too, to be managers for their parasitic agendas. Then they don&#39;t have to work as hard. That&#39;s what they are all about, masters of moochery.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then read the Republic, where one of Socrates&#39;  &quot;imaginary&quot; cities was set up like that, but ended up failing when people want more variety, such as onions back when this was written. In order to get the onion, they would need to seize land that was not theirs. </p>

<p>That would then cause the another city to fight back, or to balance the justice again. That original city, relying on your what you described, would then have to build an army to fight for protecting their new land, to grow onions. By doing that, you have to take people that were normally producing items, to fight. So less production. </p>

<p>But that city would need to feed this army to fight that city started for the desire of something different, the onion. By feeding this army, the city already lost productions when sending producers off, then the city loses more productions.  </p>

<p>There is a lot more to this. But the general idea. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is exactly my point, we as people get caught up in correcting one another instead of looking at deeper meanings. I did not mean everyone wants to be a hero/leader literally, but everyone considers themselves to be right, or more right than what is spoken.</p>

<p>it&#39;s just words, and at best they don&#39;t get to the crux of experience. Instead words are used to convey symbols that we loosely agree on. In this fashion law is constructed and argued upon, same as moral principles, same as our constitution. I can speak at lengths about things I know little about, and maybe even convince you that I&#39;m correct, sway your opinion, but in the end you write the better reality in your mind than I can convey to you through language.</p>

<p>I think magikarp is explaining what I am implying better than I am. My point is that we have that idea of utopia in our minds, and we would like to be there, but everyone has different ideas of what that utopia is. We truly can never agree with things being perfect because they can always be subject to a better way of being done.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not condoning being complacent about the corruption going on in today&#39;s world. We need people to identify and discuss what is wrong with certain actions and bring light to others to see for themselves. This does not mean we have the resolution to said corruption, simply the means of identifying it. To come up with a solution we would have to consider everyone&#39;s stance, both those we agree and disagree with, to really make a change. The problem with this then becomes what we agree on, as there will then be dissent for the chosen course of action naturally because, well, people want to be hero&#39;s and leaders.</p>
