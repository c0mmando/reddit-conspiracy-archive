       And fuck Trump. You think a billionaire sitting on his golden throne actually gives a shit about the country? What has he done to unify the country?
      </p>
      <p>
       He has been dividing this country like crazy, exactly what TPTB want.
      </p>
      <p>
       To quote Clooney:
      </p>
      <p>
       Here’s the thing: I grew up in Kentucky. I sold insurance door-to-door. I sold ladies’ shoes. I worked at an all-night liquor store. I would buy suits that were too big and too long and cut the bottom of the pants off to make ties so I’d have a tie to go on job interviews. I grew up understanding what it was like to not have health insurance for eight years. So this idea that I’m somehow the “Hollywood elite” and this guy who takes a shit in a gold toilet is somehow the man of the people is laughable. People in Hollywood, for the most part, are people from the Midwest who moved to Hollywood to have a career. So this idea of “coastal elites” living in a bubble is ridiculous. Who lives in a bigger bubble? He lives in a gold tower and has twelve people in his company. He doesn’t run a corporation of hundreds of thousands of people he employs and takes care of. He ran a company of twelve people! When you direct a film you have seven different unions all wanting different things, you have to find consensus with all of them, and you have to get them moving in the same direction. He’s never had to do any of that kind of stuff. I just look at it and I laugh when I see him say “Hollywood elite.” Hollywood elite? I don’t have a star on Hollywood Boulevard, Donald Trump has a star on Hollywood Boulevard! Fuck you!

       As an obviously uneducated person, you clearly dont understand that "Trump people" despise dictators. Must be a sad life living in mom and pops basement, watching CNN, and autisticly screeching all day. People like you are nothing but parrots. Get a job, be a taxpayer, and your mind will change. Again, if you don't like America, feel free to leave it, or hold your breathe until President Trump is gone.

       Respect for the flag was a device used by the government as anti-Communist propaganda. The Department of Homeland security PAID THE NFL to have teams on the field during the anthem and promote the armed forces.

       The NFL rule book addresses the anthem, and so too does US Code 36, section 301. The NFL is one of the same kinds of govt welfare corporations that you clowns cry about. It’s their own rules kid.

       You say the same exact thing the MSM narrative commands of you and then top it off with a quote by a multi-millionaire hollywood elite who actually gets paid to make you believe something that is not true. The only way to top this is to post a link from shareblue, vox, dailykos, etc. ad nauseum. You couldn't have thought this would go far in this sub.
