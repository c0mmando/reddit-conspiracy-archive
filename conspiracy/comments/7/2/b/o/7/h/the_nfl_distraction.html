       Always keep in the back of your mind that when the media continuously talks about a particular news story like the players sitting down during the national anthem in the NFL that they may be trying to distract us from something else. Something might be happening, and it's always good to keep your head up and look for them. Don't let the media distract us using their stupid and pointless news stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: Many people have stated it's more of a Trump centered issue rather than the media, but I personally view Trump as a part of media since the media is how he voices his grievances and concerns. As well, the media is what took Trump's statement and ran with it. Trump was the 'powder keg', I think someone in the comments referred to him as, but the media networks are the ones who are like stupid and annoyingly loud monkeys chattering.

       The real distraction is framing the conversation around it in the light of respecting the flag or whatever. The players are doing it to get people to talk about inequality in the justice system, but those invested in the inequality want to keep the conversation at bay

       exactly! The man took a knee as a statement and rather than focus on the statement itself, MSM and TPTB are focused on the actions being "unpatriotic" to divert attention away from why he was doing it in the first place.

       Absolutely.  It became even more blatantly obvious when Trump stated as much himself, it's a conversation he is incapable of having, so he panders to his ever-shrinking base of supporters by dumbing it down to buzzwords like "unpatriotic" and "disrespectful".

       States rights to own people as property. I have looked up, you're the one ignorant of the cause of secession. Go read the declarations of secessions of the states. They state they declared secession from the union for slavery.

       Real talk. The 'states rights' shit was cooked up almost 50 years later as part of historical revision of the 'great lost cause' of the Civil War.

       Trade was part of it, but it was mostly that the aristocratic class didn't want to lose their cheap labor or valuable property (this property being other people).

       Apparently you need to look it up, because slavery, "radical" abolitionists, laws like the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, slaveocracy fears, etc. all significantly contributed to heightened tensions between Northern and Southern states.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outbreak of the Civil War was the result of a culmination of events and laws. It turns out many of these events and laws were related to SLAVERY.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying that states seceding from the Union had nothing to do with preserving the institution of slavery is incredibly dishonest.

       I am always wary when someone of authority says someone isn't patriotic enough.  We heard it ad nauseum in 9/11 when the narrative was questioned.

       It should be an American right to forgo being patriotic.  It isn't like the guys are burning and shitting on flags, they are opting to not salute.

       It should be an American ideal to constantly inspect one's system of government, periodically doing away with the bits that seek to exert undue influence or control. Rather, we drifted into the exact system from which we originally declared independence.

       Apart from the secrecy angle, this is harmful because it allows for the establishment of parallel functions in those departments and agencies, which will inevitably lead to arguments over jurisdiction, and who is allowed to perform what roles.

       To be fair, Trump lit the fuse on this powder keg by stating those who exercise their rights to non violently protest are sons of bitches who should be fired, which was stronger condemnation than anything he said for the neo nazis and white supremacists at charlottesville.
      </p>
      <p>
       So rather than what's the media covering up, the question that should be asked is what's Trump trying to deflect?

       Healthcare fiasco?
No commitment to Puerto Rico?
Manafort indictment?
North Korea threatening an above ground hydrogen bomb test?

       Yeah, the reason this is such a huge story is because of Trump's comment. The kneeling has been going on for what, a year now? It's mostly just been a background story that gets talked about occasionally but never really a huge deal. But now that the president weighed in on it, everyone suddenly needs to pick a side and argue about it constantly. He even managed to drag other sports franchises into this stupid debate that they originally had no part of. And what is the end result? More needless division.

       I voted for Trump and even bought a MAGA hat but I made a post negative to Trump on T_D. It was downvoted instantly and I was given a temp ban. I thought maybe that sub could have grown into a positive movement but they see Trump as their God and he can do no wrong. They are blindly doing his bidding like the Emperor's Storm Troopers. Its honestly quite frightening.

       is exactly the same.  They've been screaming about football and pretty much ban any mention of Trump.  They're both in love with him and trying to distance themselves from him.  It's so bizzare.

       You are siding with N Korea over a US President.  This is how loyal you are to the establishment.  Everyone in the world can see you for who you are.  Yet you persist.  The best part about it is you defeated yourselves, it just took one man to expose you for who you are.  And he's your president for the next 7 years.

       Is it really so impossible to understand that just maybe "millionaire athletes" aren't protesting their own oppression but on behalf of others who do not have as large of a platform athletes have to spread awareness?

       I mean seriously is it really that hard to understand that? Not trying to be rude or confrontational, it's just so obvious to me. Curious why it's not for you.

       I'm looking at it like this.  If they want to carry signs, havr oress interviews, make thier case during half time, take out full page ads, all good with me.

       They are staging it during the national anthem.  Key word being national.  If your protest targets a thing specifically, you have to understand what that thibg is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Police aren't mentioned once.  What part of the national anthem do they have a problem with?

      <p>
       That's mu question on all this.  Why the national anthem?

       Well that's easy, they already protested in other forms and nothing changed. In fact people and police were critical of players in almost the exact same way. Which is what makes me realize it's not about the anthem at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about a refusal to even acknowledge that there is an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not remember black athletes wore shirts that were critical of police shootings. What happened there? They were called cop haters, ridiculed in basically the same way they are now. Only difference is now it's under the guise of faux patriotism. Or I should really say nationalism.

       Yes it is.  They aren't taking a knee for the coin toss, not halftime, not during pre or post game shows, they are taking a knee during the National Anthem, when the US flag gets raised.

       I can say that it's not about the anthem because we saw the the same exact faux outrage towards blacks and black athletes when they tried other forms of protest.

      <p>
       I'm saying the outrage is a fake(faux) outrage about the anthem.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conservative media expressed the same outrage when black athletes wore SHIRTS that addressed police brutality. Called them cop haters, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       So after awhile athletes started protesting by kneeling during the anthem. Now all the outrage is about kneeling during the anthem.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying is the outrage changes every time while the issue(police brutality) is never addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which that is the point of the faux outrage, to distract from anyone talking about the actual issue.

       Man so close, it's actually not to piss people off, even though it's understood that it may in fact piss some people off.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue of police brutality was so important to someone that they were actually willing to take a knee during an event that we all would traditionally stand for out of respect. Just to bring awareness to the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I completely understand it's upsetting to watch someone take a knee during a time you may consider to be really sacred. But that's the point, this issue of police brutality is so important that people are willing to upset some because primarily blacks are being murdered by cops and they're getting away with it at an alarming rate.

       The cause is worthy but the actions are counter productive.

       It makes it difficult for me (and millions of other people) to support a cause by making me hate the activists.

       Dude I am telling you why it's the national anthem right now, I am NOT dodging the question in any sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The national anthem was chosen because of its significance. Not to say fck America or
       <em>
        directly
       </em>
       disrespect our Veterans, but because other avenues had already been attempted and the issue was ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I suspect the same thing will happen with this National Anthem protesting just like last time. Everyone on the right is going to call the athletes unpatriotic, ridicule them, label as cop haters, etc just like they did w/ the shirts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the right will never actually discuss the issue of police brutality, and by then another innocent black man has already been shot/killed for no reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless we try to understand both sides of the issue and not just your own, the issues we face today will remain well into the future.

       I don't accept the premise.  I don't see it ignored at all.   I'll go one step further and say this is hurting the cause.
       <br/>
       50 people trying to get home from a long day of work, freeway shut down by black lives matter.  Help or hurt the cause?
       <br/>
       Choosing to disrespect the American Flag and the National Anthem, help or hurt the cause?
       <br/>
       I don't see how pissing people off "brings attention", any positive attention anyway.

       But the conversation isn't about police brutality is it?  It's about the national anthem and the players.

       Everything you mention is a problem created by the right wing. Not the protestors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I wish I had some perfect fucking answer where I'm like hey black athletes go protest here and everyone will listen and be respectful and we'll all talk about it afterwards with solutions?!?
      </p>
      <p>
       Of fucking course, but that's not reality. So if, at the very minimum, protesting is going to piss some people off just to at least make the issue relevant, then I say fuckin do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason why the conversation isn't primarily about police brutality is again because of the right wing changing the narrative calling them unpatriotic, cop haters, etc. which admittedly works really well too. That's why we're here rn.

       Sports themselves are a distraction, let alone now in the post-modern world where organizations like the NFL are spinning off more and more content to cover the same things 100 times. We get 24/7 coverage of Football now with more people giving their two cents on every issue in the game big or small. This is all a distraction, everyone loves how much we consume this garbage, especially advertisers and those trying to hide the real atrocities from us.

       Many different psyops are happening with this NFL thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, ratings ARE down, the game IS softer, and penalties do make the games unwatchable at times.
      </p>
      <p>
       All major social institutions are beginning to wobble at the knees. Silicon Valley with the "diversity" blowback, finance with the massive bubble, Washington with the Awan scandal, Hollywood box office way down, etc. We're 2-3 years away from many institutions collapsing. Currently everything is in decline. All foundations will give out at the same time when the entire structure collapses (sound familiar?).
      </p>
      <p>
       I see this as the beginning of the end for the power of sports in the USA. It is also the beginning of the end for the brainwashing of the flag on the US public. It's an attack on patriotism, and it's about damn time.

       Me too!. My guess is: TPTB don't want domestic audience paying too much attention to what is happening in Syria.
       <br/>
       The years-long western action(s) aimed at toppling Assad are FAILing, bigtime.
       <br/>
       There could be multiple revelations of horribly sordid, awful things the world is going to discover about those 'actions'.   Could be very damaging to our national reputation.

       This "controversy" is merely a vehicle to get 'sympathy' for the NFL, whose only other news is concussions, empty seats, and felony arrests. Trump is willingly playing the villain to help juice the publicity.

       I can't stand this, man. I don't even watch the news and I still have to deal with this stupid situation. Immediately, when I saw this, I just thought "what a distraction," I mean, It's obviously right out of the divide and conquer handbook. TPTB pick a sensitive subject, present a  narrative, and then you either agree with it and are "supporting basic freedoms and rights," or you disagree and are a "fascist, nazi, or suppressor of freedom." Can't I just believe something without having repercussions anymore? People are so ready to support something without even knowing what they are supporting. This is 100% a ploy to keep us separated and a majority of us are falling for it. BTW, don't mention that to anyone because then, you're not a Nazi, it's worse, you're a
       <strong>
        conspiracy theorist

       . Shakin' my head, boys.

       Big part of that NFL audience is rednecks who haven't figured out that watching a bunch of victim-complex ridden black millionaires chase a ball around, with every game a virtual re-run of all the others except minor changes in the score and the uniforms, ain't all that entertaining.
