       Janet Yellen “lied” when she spoke last week about the “mystery” of not hitting the Fed’s inflation targets. Mannarino explains, “It’s no mystery.
      </p>
      <p>
       She can perpetuate the lie because she has managed to inflate the stock market.  The average person looks at the stock market and says the stock market is going up.  So, that means our economy is doing well.  It’s an incredible thing, but it’s just not the truth.  This is how they can twist people’s minds.  By keeping the market elevated, it is an illusion.  The illusion becomes real to the uninformed.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Mannarino says rates are going higher, and that will be bad for house prices. Mannarino explains, “If Yellen is successful and the yield curve starts to normalize, because right now it’s flat, that would put pressure on housing, and cash would come out of housing.  You would lose the wealth effect...
      </p>
      <p>
       Mannarino also warns that bills for storm damage and bankrupt states are piling up. U.S. territory Puerto Rico was destroyed by a hurricane and is bankrupt. States like Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio are also having debt problems.  Mannarino contends, “This is how they are going to kill the currency.  The Fed is going to be forced to print more cash out of thin air and loan them money, whatever it’s going to be, and then the currency dissolves.  We’ve seen this before. . . . At some point, we are going to face an absolute and complete meltdown of the system.  The debt based economic model is fraudulent.  It’s a Ponzi scheme. The federal government is going to be asked to do something, and that will kill the currency, and we are going to get hyperinflation.  That’s when the cash is going to start to move.”

       Put it all together: Why they are obstructing repeal and replace Obamacare? Why countries are abandoning the Dollar? Why they are annihilating US with recent hurricanes? Why states are bankrupting? Why retailers are closing stores across the country? 
The Cabal is desperately trying to collapse the US economy. Don't succumb to the distraction of the divisive news. They count on people being ignorant of what's actually going on. They have made millions of Americans enemies of their own country with propaganda, psyops, and fake news. Stop falling for it.

       You sounded a bit like a doubting Thomas so the first thing to do would be to read about the concept, verify its feasibility and see that it has been possible to construct for decades using existing materials and technology. Do you want sources?
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, start thinking what the world will look like when we have vast amounts of space-based solar power almost for free. Start imagining.

       sadly, I know you're serious. Take a look around you and tell me that ''everything's ok'' so 'let's spend all this time and energy making a useless device ... I mean, wtf do you want one for? I'm aware of what it's capabilities are

       go find 'somewhere else to mismanage'?!
      </p>
      <p>
       like I said, go google 'electrogravitics' and realise All such technology has been superseded by other methods of space travel and 'we' don't need another LEO 'space station' do we?

       On the ground? Nah. There are much better conditions in space... no intermittency, increased luminosity etc.

       A space elevator is needed to send it all up, it would be too expensive to use rockets.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 2012 Dr. Mankins, by then a private consultant, led a new NASA-financed study of space solar power rooted in many of the ideas that Dr. Glaser had proposed, though far more modest in scope and cost. The government has so far declined to adopt the idea.
       </p>
       <p>
        “The hurdle is not a technical one but one of perception,” Dr. Mankins said.
       </p>
       <p>
        He noted that more than 40 years had passed since Dr. Glaser first proposed space solar power, and that climate change had made the need to find clean sources of energy only more urgent.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         “If we’d pursued space solar power in the 1980s,” Dr. Mankins said of Dr. Glaser’s early ideas, “the platforms would be operational today.”

       Cay you see the conspiracy? Why is space based solar power not on the agenda? Also, why is the idea of an orbital ring space elevator concept
       <em>
        suppressed
       </em>
       ?

        Better than Paris: space solar power
       </a>
       , by Lt. Col. Peter Garretson
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "A national program in space-based solar power (SBSP) could do more for solving climate change than the Paris Accord ever could. SBSP is the advanced energy source that “shovel ready,” is fully renewable, produces no greenhouse gasses, is not intermittent, has 24-hour availability, could be made-in-America and could scale to all global demand six times over. Within a generation, we could transform our society to abundant clean energy, enable a $300-trillion global economy, create five million new jobs, drive all carbon emissions to zero, and then have spare energy to suck carbon out of the air.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now if that’s technically feasible—and a lot of credible institutions have said that it is, including NASA, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defense, the International Academy of Astronautics, and the National Academies—then why isn’t this on the agenda? Maybe because our national space program has been run by public servants who think about flags and footprints to show off national plumage, and not businesspeople looking for new markets and competitive advantage."

       and watch the map.

       Even if you don't know how to interpret these maps, even of so, tell me you don't see anything weird here at all.

       I skipped through looking at the sections with maps, and I've seen the shorter videos talking about this. But no, I don't see anything strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Storms build, and they build quickly. I've watched perfect examples of just how fast you can go from clear skies to a full on raging storm in minutes while doing storm photography when I was younger. One of my favorite photos (for it's rarity, not it's quality) is of an intense lightning storm building on a clear, starry night in a matter of minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it makes sense that you'll have sudden, intense areas of localized build. You can watch this any spring in Oklahoma and Kansas with tornado producing thunderstorms.

       It's because capitalism is in crisis. It has been at leat since the 08 financial crisis.

      <p>
       The owners of capital are pulling every string that their money can reach, desperately trying to resist any social momentum torwards better conditions for the working class.

      <p>
       The owners of massive corporations are seeing the rate of profit fall (as Marx predicted) and they can't abide the fact that the only solution is to restructure society to be sustainable and to restructure enterprise to serve the working class

       Optimistic. The last two cockroaches on Earth would still be trying to sell each other stuff. Trade isn't going to disappear just because civilisation collapsed. There will still be people with more things than they need who are willing to exchange them for other things or a nice fungible commodity like gold so it's stupid to suggest gold wouldn't still be useful in that scenario.

       See the thing is movies have paved the way for the future in so many ways so I don't see how cryptocurrency has no future. There have been so many movies involving cryptocurrency, futuristic dystopia that I imagine this is where we are headed. I'm not saying be prepared for the worst but I don't see crypto currency becoming completely decimated.

       Blockchain only works for decentralization. I wouldn't trust a coin that had a central body that just hyperinflate their currency. It's just another form of USD at that point.

       I mean, technically, decentralization is not necessary with a blockchain. You can invent various things with one, the other, both, or neither.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you are right that decentralization / trust in
       <em>
        the network
       </em>
       (and not in an institution) is what Bitcoin has, and what JP Morgan's version of digital currency won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm afraid it will not be enough. They (the OG bankers and governments) will have everything to be gained by destroying things like Bitcoin, and destroy they will.

       thats why we need to make sure to only invest in decentralized cryptos.  Their control relies a lot on the money they syphon off the people through interest, taxes, and fractional reserve banking.  They couldn't keep their power without centralization.

       You guys aren't getting how centralization works. You're not going to have a choice. You think they'll ask for a vote on it lol?
      </p>
      <p>
       How are you going to invest in another digotal currency once the global currency is in effect? You won't be able to, that's the entire point of a GLOBAL currency. Notice the word globe in there. As in the entire planet. The currency of the whole world.  And yes they will centralize it. Why? Because like you said it's their power structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't buy or sell anything globally without their currency, what good is any other? It becomes worthless.
      </p>
      <p>
       To preempt your next statement "But we'll just use our own anyway"
      </p>
      <p>
       No you won't. It simply won't be allowed. Every transaction is traceable after going digital. Meaning any purchase of another currency will lead the authorities right to where to destroy it.

       Yes all the problems we have in the world are due to this fucking cabal. They are a criminal organisation that have basically taken over everything, they've perverted the whole course of our development as a species. They've suppressed amazing tech that would provide us with free energy and optimal health, they've created wars for no genuine reason, they've murdered, maimed, infected, raped, trashed the environment and somehow managed to brainwash people into thinking that the way things are is 'normal' or 'part of human nature.' These creatures need to go.

       Tools can be used to good and bad ends. I would not trade the ability to look things up at a moment's notice for anything or anybody. I can totally relate to your sentiment, I wish the people I try to interact with didn't have their noses to their phones when I'm standing in front of them, I wish every ignorant son of a bitch didn't think they have an obligation to stand on a soap box posting 160 characters of vile every two seconds. I wish the people didn't willfully hand over their closets with skeletons to the government or that they wouldn't spy.

       But the internet has so much potential. It's already brought us so much. I don't have to have invested years learning a particular tradeskill to be able to do things. The most obscure and specific tasks all have detailed instructions
       <em>
        somewhere.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       How do I turn off the water of this burst pipe? Is it okay to drive on a tire with a big bump on the side? What should I do if my chest and my arm suddenly stopped hurting? How can you substitute baking soda and baking powder? Should I be worried about the weird smell coming from my outlet?
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to KNOW everything in advance. The access we have to information is like magic. It's not the tool that needs fixing, it's the people that misuse and abuse it.

       Even if they don't collapse it purposely, eventually just trying to pay the interest on our debt will take up enough of the budget to cripple the government. We all know what will be the first things they cut will be the services many people rely on, especially with the fed printing money making inflation worse, more and more people will be suffering. It's pretty much a double whammy.

       What logic? That's how Medicare essentially works, which Single Payer == Medicare for All.

       Ok, so you want to compare health care to policing? These are very different scenarios and I don't see the correlation. The police issue we've been dealing with here the US isn't because they are paid with my taxes or because they are government entities. There is a toxic culture and a serious lack of adequate de-escalation training (especially for those with disabilities).
      </p>
      <p>
       Health professionals spend YEARS in school to learn how to do what they do. How does paying them through the government and letting the government handle the paperwork instead of some middle-man insurance company make them any less qualified or able to do their job? In fact, insurance and pharmaceutical company incentives offered to health professionals (the current state of the health industry) would seem more likely to cause inadequate health care imo.

       Police aren't accountable to the public because they are employed by the government. There are other countless examples of this lack of government accountability, yet somehow doctors will be immune?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are college students going to flood medical schools and take on hundreds of thousands of dollars of education debt so they can work for a system which destroys their ability to earn money and provide care how they see fit?
      </p>
      <p>
       So pharmaceutical companies are influencing doctors  which is leading to inadequate care, but government influence won't?
      </p>

       What happens when you, at 70 years old, want a surgery that will only give you two extra years but is very expensive. Suddenly your medical decision is factored into 300 million other peoples' health care decision. You become a number, cease to be an individual.

       People have been saying that the dollar will collapse for atleast 40 years now. I think it will inevitably happen, but I doubt it'll be a singular explosive event. It'll be more of a smooth transition into the one world currency beta version.

       Fuck this parasite cabal, their taxes, and their debts. We are free human beings are we not? Stop paying taxes and debts. Keep the money in the economy where it's most needed and by doing so, the economy will improve. The power is in our own hands.

       Ah, the economy will improve, health will improve, and mental health will improve for us all.

       When we pay tax or Rothschild debt (the 2 often overlap), the economy weakens because we are giving away our money to the people who need it least.

       How? People in this sub 'know' about the Fed, but they still work, still buy weed and alcohol with money, most of them still buy processed foods, etc. How will more people 'knowing' but living their lives in the system somehow 'change' the system?

       Ok so imagine the 99% pot and the 1% pot. When the 1% steal to much, the 99% suffer. The 1% isn't interested in giving any of our money back so we can go back to the 1950 roaring economic levels BUT we can TAKE it back because we have the power in our very hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       We would still use money for now but we would have more of it. This would be a chess move by the people. The government can't arrest us all and if it tried, the people would revolt against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be a double middle finger fuck you to the Federal Reserve and the deep state. We would be very proud of ourselves for making our first baby step as a collective hive mind concience. The good thing is that future moves will be easier because active as a hive mind is like riding a bike. Once we learn the first time, it sticks with is forever.

       There is a limit. Once the limit is passed with the people, they will start rampaging against the cabal hopefully peacefully but they have to be awake and aware. If they think this government is full of angelic heroes that are protecting us from ISIS, they will blindly follow it but if the masses build enough outrage, they will snap.

       It's like the "firing nueron" effect. The neurons in our brain fire a small electric jolt and if the jolt is powerful enough, it crosses a limit. Once the limit is passes, some action is made.

       Everyone is pissed off right now. We are closer to our limit but not quite there yet. It can happen any day now or months. It depends on how much redpilling people do and how much they suffer. (Suffering also pushes the people towards action.)

       I told you. Redpilling increases outrage. If people know the Fed is norhing more than a parasite that has caused every recession we ever had, they will wonder why the gov allows this and then they will realize the gov is in on it. Then they will realize that the only people who can fix this are the people. This outrage combined with other things such as financial suffering, debts, knowledge of a corrupt government, and so on all add up and once the people are finally fed up, they will make some kind of move but I don't know what that move will be.

       Say monero gets popular how do they handle the amount of memory being added to the blockchain.  When I used it last year I needed to download the whole blockchain to use it properly, and on top of that they have flexible blocksize.  So if they're getting an enormous amount of transactions or a lot of spam the cost to run a node or use the chain will be higher than what the average user can afford.  I like monero and its built in security, but I don't see how they can solve the blockchain size problem. Where bitcoin has linear growth 1mb cap to keep node cost down, they have lightweight wallets and mobile wallets, and have optional security services.

       1) Monero already has a dynamic block size so that it won't be negatively affected in the event of a sporadic transaction window, as we saw with Bitcoin. You speak of the 1MB hard cap as a positive thing, but it's the sole reason the hard for into Bitcoin Cash happened, along with people getting hit with $20-100 fees to send even $10 of coin.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) lightweight, hardware wallets are both nearing end of their development, reducing the need for a full blockchain download. You must not forget that bitcoin's official core wallet requires the whole blockchain, too. This isn't a flawed approach. It just paves the way for light wallets similar to Electrum to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any other questions? I'm very passionate about Monero and I sincerely believe it's undervalued for many more reasons!
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope you're having a great day today my friend~

       My point is the dynamic block size will bloat the chain if monero is used a lot.  How can someone run a node with 16mb blocks or more?  It might be a ways away but can a blockchain survive with huge blocks?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also will the lightweight wallets haves all the privacy features that a normal monero wallet offers?

       I agree, time will tell whether big blocks are worthwhile or not. But Monero hard forks frequently, and I'm confident that if big blocks turned out to be the bad choice, the community would react appropriately.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for light wallet privacy features: I do not know.

       yeah monero has a great community, I just got into it when the wallet was command prompt and let it go after a couple days of playing around.  Thanks for the heads up on lightweight wallets, I'm going to revisit xmr and buy a few.

       Realize that hating Monero because of fluffy is like hating Bitcoin because of Jamie Dimon: at the end of the day, neither of them own the project and although they affected price, crypto marches onwards.

       The Fed has been killing the dollar since 1913 as they have used their position to create money out of thin air to reduce the dollar's value by 99%. They systematically looted the country for their benefit and to turn us into serfs and slaves. If people truly understood what the Fed has done to America there would revolution in the streets and the ruling class would be hung from lamp posts.

       So can the average person do to prepare for something like this? Im reading a lot of stuff here about buying bitcoin and crypto currencies but is that really it? Im sure bitcoin is going to help but it seems like fools gold to me, what good would bitcoins be if I cant access them through the internet. Are there other suggestions to get ahead of this?

       I was in a used book store and I found a book published in the 80's saying basically the same shit they're saying today. Hyperinflation, doom, buy precious metals. It's all just a racket. Whatever happens will happen, and nobody will have predicted it unless they called a specific time period. I'm quite sure they can keep the game going for as long as they want.

       Fuck housing prices.  They are too high.  We really were better off in the days of 7% rates because everyone could afford a house then as the Fed wasn't throwing money at banks to suck us all into debt slavery.

       You guys aren't getting how centralization works. You're not going to have a choice. You think they'll ask for a vote on it lol?
      </p>
      <p>
       How are you going to invest in another digotal currency once the global currency is in effect? You won't be able to, that's the entire point of a GLOBAL currency. Notice the word globe in there. As in the entire planet. The currency of the whole world.  And yes they will centralize it. Why? Because like you said it's their power structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't buy or sell anything globally without their currency, what good is any other? It becomes worthless.
      </p>
      <p>
       To preempt your next statement "But we'll just use our own anyway"
      </p>
      <p>
       No you won't. It simply won't be allowed. Every transaction is traceable after going digital. Meaning any purchase of another currency will lead the authorities right to where to destroy it.
