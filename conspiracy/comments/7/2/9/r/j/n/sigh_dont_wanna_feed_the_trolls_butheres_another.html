       they never have a live feed of the actual planet. there is always either  bits of machinery in the way or its zoomed in, or its a fisheye lens. why not just have a flat window with a normal view and we could all put this to bed...but they never do, and thats whats strange.

       How do you "detect" you're moving if you are in a vehicle? Don't you see that everything is moving around you? That's how people realize that they are moving.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the sky it moves right? The sun moves, the moon moves and the stars move. Isn't that the same thing? Shouldn't you realize that you are moving along with the planet (vehicle) you're standing on?
      </p>
      <p>
       Where does the Sun go when it's dark?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the World is flat wouldn't it be somewhere above the Earth? Wouldn't it still be within your line of sight?

       That's not the curvature of the planet though [it's a 360 degree horizon]. The curvature would or could only be seen from the nadir point to the horizon (directly down, to the edge of the horizon).

       So you’re saying that the camera is actually just at the edge of a big, flat disk which is planet Earth, and that’s the curvature it’s capturing…the curvature of a flat disk planet - not the curvature of a spherical Earth.

       No, there's no claims being made, only explaining the model that is used and the observation. But yes it could also be modelled as is, or that it's a giant flat plane with a vanishing point.

       Were you under the impression the whole Earth was visible? It seems both believers in round or flat Earth's mistakenly assume this.

       It might not be a psyop for
       <em>
        some

       who entertain it enough to ask questions.  Many are indeed very much trapped in the psyop, however.

      <p>
       Sure - for those intelligent enough to entertain it as only that.  Too many don’t seem to be intelligent enough to do such, however, and are simply falling for the psyop hook, line, and sinker.

      <p>
       Some who show flat Earth to be the falsity it is develop superiority complexes.  Sure.

      <p>
       Most certainly not all, however.

       It certainly can be that.  Understood.

       Almost any and every side

       be a psyop if it comports itself unintelligently.

      <p>
       Again, for those who comport themselves in a holier than thou manner, perhaps it’s a psyop on them.  Many who understand that the planets are most definitely
       <em>
        not

       flat can refute and do away with flat Earthers without having to have any type of superiority complex, however.

       That’s certainly the case with some people - in any subject really.  Most definitely not all, however.

      <p>
       The real psyop is TPTB’s ensnaring of impressionable minds with false paradigms and incorrect information.  The impressionable minds themselves aren’t the psyop.  Those who
       <em>
        manipulate
       </em>
       those minds with false information are the psyop.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       More than semantics. The geoid within each geodetic frame is flat. So perceivably, to the observer within the frame (260km2 is the upper limit for plane surveying), everything is flat and it's a flat earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you combine the geodesy which is explained by gravity potential, and the curvature of space time (which is the definition of gravity) there is no real measurement of curvature or the sphere except on the macroscopic scale, measuring difference in gravity which is said to be bending of space time.
      </p>
      <p>
       E.g. the earth is flat when you are on it, and space-time bends to produce what is said to be the sphere on the macro scale. But the sphere isn't measurable in the traditional sense (which explains why pythagorean models do not mirror observations).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not semantics because it uses the official explanations but gives an answer which does not allow the hegelian dialectic. It states by deduction either claim [as an absolute] is false.

       The sphere side of it is as much of a psyop as the flat side, yet it was engrained over generations - it's taught in absolute form to children. It promotes a belief system stored as knowledge without discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       This thread was created claiming "don't wanna feed the trolls" yet in action it's merely trolling those who believe in a flat earth.

      <p>
       If one believes in either without experimenting or seeking some means of measuring it, both are based in belief, no different than a belief in religion or ghosts or anything. Because of it's size it's nearly impossible to directly measure it, so even a somewhat concrete answer will always be limited to 'the evidence suggests' - though the spherical triangle measurement would be probably the best method with very limited falsifiability - it has never been done, except the rumoured case by Gauss in 1855, which is declared 'myth' today even though it was cited in textbooks for ~150 years..
      </p>
      <p>
       The best means of discovery tends to be attempting to falsify [by unbiased experimentation] the obvious or perceived results of whatever conclusions are made. So in a sense, if 'flat earthers' are actually measuring something or trying to falsify the globe model they're at least engaging in an attempt to discover.

       Seems unlikely that Randy Cramer, Corey Goode, Kevan Trimmel, Alana Kapulnik, and Andrew Basiago are all psyops, and they all attest to having personally experienced a spherical planetary system first hand.  I’d sooner go w/their data than others’.

       What was the intent of the post? Did you expect a full-fledged 'flat earther' to arrive and realize they were wrong, or come in and contest the footage (only to incite a verbal sparring match). How many options are available in the framing of the post?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a weakness in the premise. The footage was assuredly edited in a video editor / ps/ae. We see that with the names chicago/milwakee overlaid. Nothing proves the voice audio was made with the footage. It could be dubbed later.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact there's a moon video floating around on the moon missions where they are rehearsing and
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCHG6uJH5L8">
        staging their record of distance and communications
       </a>
       - no claim being made about the overall mission or exactly what they were doing, but it shows another side to finished video.
      </p>
      <p>
       What about the OP video provides any concrete evidence of anything? It doesn't because it's not an hard analysis determining anything. Simply a claim or challenge to others who believe
       <em>
        other things
       </em>
       .
