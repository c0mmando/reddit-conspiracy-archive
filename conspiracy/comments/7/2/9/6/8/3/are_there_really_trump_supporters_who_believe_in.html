       Yes, there are indeed still folks who believe the billionaire businessman with tons of foreign ties around the world and who has lined his cabinet with bankers and other exploitative profiteers is somehow an extreme outsider who is for the people over anyone else.

       Billionaires are mere pawns.  The people that rule the world are trillionaires.

       It is interesting that people believe that Trump is an uncouth moron, yet they still believe he hobnobs with the rulers of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump lined his cabinet with bankers?  Are you sure?  When Obama first entered the White House, he was given a list of bankers to appoint to his administration.  The list was given to him by Citibank.  Why would it be any different with Trump?

       No ones been able to answer you yet. Interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       No matter if trump is part of the illuminati or not, it should be no surprise he has connections with bankers. It could be argued that it would be stupid NOT to take some of them on his team.
      </p>
      <p>
       It just seems very immature whenever people try to discredit trump based on huge generalizations like "ALL bankers are pure evil." If, for the sake of argument, you assume that Trump is genuinely trying to do what's best for the country, then it makes sense that he would reach out to the banks for the dual purpose of keeping your enemies close, and making friends in high places. If Trump is on "our" side, it's possible there are other influential people out there he could ally with. However, if you assume Trump is "in on it" with TPTB, then literally nothing we discuss matters because it's all lost already. I'd rather bet we still have a chance, so here we are.

       Exactly this. It's a thread of cynicism that runs through the conspiracy community. Not only is it unrealistic, and overly simplistic- it also robs you of any hope that positive things could happen.
      </p>

       TPTB are not a single, omnipotent, omniscient entity. That is their goal, but if you are convinced that they're already there, you're buying into the gameplan.

       You also understand.  I think it will take time to make the changes that need to be made.  The corruption and the degeneracy in DC has been there a long time.   Even Trump did not realize how bad it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing Trump can do is to start talking about how it all works.   Obama kept quiet about it, but it needs to be exposed to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why they have secret societies and groups, like Freemasonry and Bilderberg.  They do not want the mob to interfere in their schemes.  That is exactly what we need to do.

       I would never make a generalization such as all bankers are evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surely their are very good people who are bankers, people who love their families and pursue their passions. There are plenty of investment bankers who are humanitarians and philanthropist.

       Here is how I see it, and I could be missing something.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a normal election, both candidates are chosen and both are controlled.  We have the illusion of choice.  it is the Bilderberg Group that does the controlling, I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       This last election, only Hillary was,controlled.  Trump was not given a chance of winning.  They misjudged the American voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are puppet masters, but they make mistakes.  I think they just got arrogant and misjudged their ability to manipulate the American voters.  They think we are idiots, but we saw through their bullshit.

       There's a theory that TPTB let Trump gain traction over the other Republican candidates early on because they thought that would make it even easier for Hillary to win, since Trump is so ridiculous, but then The Trump Train just got completely out of control and he got a lot of real genuine support from the American people. They underestimated him from the start.

       Basically, Hillary was so unpopular that there was a real chance that she could lose the election to another "real" politician on the republican side, so TPTB let trump get ahead so she could go up against him rather than Ted Cruz, etc. but in the end Trump ended up being far more popular (with his base) than Cruz could ever be.

       No, that is a false dichotomy. Even if they are very good puppet masters (they are), there is no reason to assume they are infallible. In fact, we can be very nearly sure that they are not. It is possible that they lost control of this election and now something different is happening. I didn't say good (could be), just different. Most of us have seen nothing but sanitized PR talk from the White House for our entire lives. The current situation is at the very least exciting, and many are still cautiously optimistic that Trump is playing power games with the dark side.

       I agree that seems like black and white thinking but for shadow groups to control so much yet let the white house slip through their fingers just seems unimaginable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there are competing factions within the shadow organizations and we see this spill out, just as an example how there is supposedly a rivalry between the CIA and FBI and every now and again the public gets a glimpse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe they want controversial figures to rule. Its great fodder for the media to keep the working class distracted. But also i think there is something else going on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me Trump and Obama basically have the same function.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their supporters both take a blind almost religious like faith in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And their opponents see them as the anti-christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ruling class wants to keep the working class infighting. They want citizens to distrust each other and the police. They want families to stop talking to each other because of political debates.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is just the two party system working exactly as intended. They are playing us like a fiddle.

       Nazis vs communist American citizens fighting in the streets makes the shadow rulers super horny.

       My opinion is that, if Trump was Illuminati, then they would have him on tape doing something horrible.  Trump never acted like he can be blackmailed.  In fact, Trump has always acted like he does not give a flying fuck, which is why he won.  I could be wrong, of course, but his attitude is why he won.

       Not sure why you got so many downvotes. Makes a lot of sense actually. People seem to think that TRUMP is like, doing fucking everything on his own accord lol. Bill Gates seems like he's getting pawned, too. "So what do you want to do with all your billions Bill?" "Help make the world a better place." "Okay, we have a greeeat project in Africa we'd like you to... check out."

       My comment does not fit with their reality.  They don't want to accept the fact that every President since JFK has been a tool.  Trump is the only one that has resisted, which is why he is crucified in the media.  The people that rule the world own and control the media, so they use it to force people to comply.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not that I am a huge Trump fan.  My position is that the people in power who are against Trump are way worse for humanity.

       I supported Bernie, but I am glad that Trump won.  They would have walked all over Bernie if he had won.  We are not in a good position to have someone like Bernie as President.  We need a hardass instead.

       I can see videos of Trump hobnobbing all day long. And another day just reading his moronic tweets. So put those two together. Maybe he plays a part for the rubes, like his wrestling persona, or maybe you don't understand high society and power.

       I think he is right, trump isn't a moron, he is senile. He seems very unintelligent now but in the past he was at the least of average intelligence but now at 70 he acts like a nut. My guess is he is developing Alzheimer's or something, would explain so much.

       Of course not. The problem is the Trump stuff is mostly made up, especially the Russian "collusion" story. You can trace its origins to the HRC campaign. The dossier, if it was used to obtain warrants, has been thoroughly debunked, and is full of lies. I dont care if people like Trump or not... disagree with his policies? Ok. But stop trying to convince people that our POTUS is a Russian puppet. He is either a globalist puppet or not, that is the only debate with actual merit.

       Trump is not a puppet of Russia.  I am not referring to Russia.  I am referring to the New World Order globalists, and their one world government agenda.  Trump is a Nationalist, so he should be against them.  People like McCain, Pence, Schumer, etc. are all New World Order globalists, which is why they are against Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you say "globalist", I take that to mean New World Order globalists, like the Bilderberg Group and the Council on Foreign Relations.  They are the people responsible for screwing up the world and decimating the middle class.

       We don't need a pissing contest. Obama is a warmongering crook like every President. Actually I am studying the esoteric mystery schools.

       Bill Cooper is great, haven't heard of Veith.

       Jesuits are near the top of the pyramid. I suspect they control the Freemasons and Zionists and CIA. But it's mixed together and complex.

       Putin is a gangster oligarch, one of the richest men on Earth and thoroughly​ corrupt. He kills journalists and rivals and activists. I have no problem believing a former spy and mafia boss is playing games to undermine the US and the EU.

       In this case, yes. At least partly. I'm under no illusions that Trump's administration can or will make significant changes to the financial power structures. I think that is in their cards, but far from realistically achievable. Anyone who tried before him was killed, so I'm not convinced he's bold enough to risk what's most dear to him, namely his own life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do think that his election has opened the floodgates to profound changes in public understanding. It has moved our Overton window from a delusion that "everything is fine" to "everything is wildly fucked up and I don't understand the world anymore". It's a tough reality for those who haven't been paying attention before this time, but it strikes me as a necessary step in collective self-realization.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are beginning to realize how fragile and broken our systems actually are. The media tries to white-wash the past by blaming much of that instability on a very recently elected president, but I've had countless discussions in recent months in which otherwise politically naive people began to see it all for the game that it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are beginning to see that it's really those who make the money who call the shots. They're beginning to see how different countries present differing narratives of the same events. None of that has to be purposefully provoked by Trump and his actions, but he seems to be a catalyst for this unveiling. And in that role, I do support the man. As much as I wish we could have just let the banks fail years ago, and put the worst offenders behind bars, enacted reasonable and comprehensive lobbying and campaign finance restrictions, I'll take this chaos over another 4-8 years of stagnation or regression.

       He wasn't a reform party reject, depending on who you talk to.  Some would say he was a reform party candidate brought in specifically to ruin the reform party's chances at getting a president.  Even before the 2016 election he was rumored to be interested in running for president, heck Seth MacFarlane even said he'd vote for him during his roast.  I disagree he was at a zero, politically, any time in the last decade or so.

       His puppet master was Roger Stone, and Roger has been his friend for a long time.  He's actually had multiple insider friends/advisors with him, and claims he's been bribing politicians for years.  We could probably quibble for hours over what is and is not considered political experience, but in my opinion he's had quite a bit of it over the last couple decades.

       What does zero even mean in your example? Are you real equating "zero" with one of the most famous real estate billionaires in the world, also a huge figure in American politics who has been talking about running for president for more than 25 years?

       He did run.  He ran under the reform party in 2000 and lost to Pat Buchanan (who only got .5% of the popular vote in the general election).  To go from third party reject to GOP president with no political experience in between?  I'd consider that zero to president.

       Trump has certainly openly spoken glowingly about some of those powers.

       That IS a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I still see Trump as a more complicated figure than he has been given credit for (to wit: his complete framing of this weekend's news-cycle and baiting of NFL to cause NFL ratings to drop further).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of that, I'm not sure if his maneuvers are to eventually gut the globalists or if he is in genuine alignment.  All the talk of national pride doesn't seem to jive with those hiring choices.

       Think about it.  Trump has spent 95% of his campaign and presidency dominating the news cycle with ridiculous garbage.  All while his globalist, elitest, establishment appointees are given room to operate under the radar.

       You're right, he works the media well, but he isn't doing it because it helps him.  It helps the people he works for.

       Let's start with his cabinet, chock full of Goldman Sachs executives. Or how about the healthcare bill that cuts insurance for 30+ million people and stuffs the wallets of the big healthcare/pharma CEO's? Or maybe his tax plan that will only widen the economic divide between the richest and the rest of us? Also, isn't he doubling down on the tough talk with Iran? One more thing too, he cuts environmental protections on polluting to help energy companies do whatever the fuck they want.

       I agree with you that that is troubling.

       But what I'm not convinced of one way or another is whether he is 'keeping his friends close, and his enemies closer' or whether he is in genuine alignment with those folks.

       As for healthcare -- that was a problem he's inherited; obamacare was a disaster for the most vulnerable.  Trump's trying to fix that as best he can under the circumstances of a rogue Congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know enough about his tax plan...care to share some facts or sources which validate that it will only benefit the rich?
      </p>
      <p>
       Iran I see as problematic...he is doing the bidding of tptb as far as his rhetoric is concerned.  But as of yet, no action.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "*INTRODUCTION Presidential candidate Donald Trump has proposed tax reforms that would significantly reduce marginal tax rates for both individuals and businesses, increase standard deduction amounts to nearly four times current levels, limit or repeal some tax expenditures,repeal the individual and corporate alternative minimum taxes and the estate and gift taxes,and tax the profits of foreign subsidiaries of US companies in the year they are earned. The Tax Policy Center estimates the proposal would reduce federal revenue by $9.5trillion over its first decade and an additional $15.0trillion over the subsequent 10 years,before accounting for added interest costs or considering macroeconomic feedback effects.1 Most of the revenue loss would come from individual income tax cuts, but about a third would be from the reduction in the corporate income tax rate and the introduction of special rates on pass-through businesses.The proposal would cut taxes at every income level, but high-income taxpayers would receive the biggest cuts, both in dollar terms and as a percentage of income. Overall, the plan would cut taxes by an average of about $5,100, or about 7 percent of after-tax income. However, the highest-income 0.1 percent of taxpayers (those with incomes over $3.7million in 2015 dollars) would experience an average tax cut of more than $1.3 millionin 2017, nearly 19percent of after-tax income. Middle-income households would receive an average tax cut of $2,700, or 4.9percent of after-tax income.
       </p>
       <p>
        The significant marginal tax rate cuts would boost incentives to work, save, and invest if interest rates do not change."*

       The Hill article you posted would not load.  Usually bills are loaded down with multiple items, however, and it is possible that the other items in the bill were the actual target of Trump's rollback; while the dumping was collateral damage.   I don't know without reading it though, since it wouldn't load.

       Well for one, the estimates are for ten years now. And two, the rapid change of healthcare systems wouldn't give states enough time to set up insurance plans and would leave wholesale groups uninsured. Do you think the Graham plan is a good idea?

       The NWO has been trying to take over the world even before the American Revolution. Do you genuinely believe they're going to let Donald Trump stop it? Look who he has in his cabinets right now. Look at the money he has been given Isreal like all the other presidents. He is just another corrupt president like every other.

       There are different levels of corrupt politicians.  There is one type who is completely treasonous and opens up the gates while people are sleeping for a bribe and another which skims from the public coffers.  Nations can stagger through the later form of corruption but not the former.  As far as a better sort of corrupt politician goes it is like someone asking the cashier for a discount since it does work sometimes.  I think that Trump is the type of president who tries to get a better deal for the country and then he will skim it.  When it comes to something like the TPP he was just listening to a very large insider base who knew that they were going to be absolutely killed by it and also it was just too gross for sane sensibilities.  We can do a lot better than Trump but at this point in time we just don't deserve anyone better than Trump and Hillary would have been too cruel.  We are almost so fucked up that she got in there.  We aren't half good enough for someone like Ron Paul.  I think that in general we are getting what we deserve both good and bad and so we get a real mixed bag like Trump instead of a complete demon.

       I was giving Trump the benefit of the doubt until he filled his cabinet with shit. (Goldman Sachs people, Sessions, etc...) In the words of Obi-Wan: "You were suppose to drain the swamp, not fill it." Where he went wrong, when he officially became the Republican candidate he stopped paying attention to the moderates, independents, and libertarians.

       I think he's outside those power structures, but is so powerless compared to them that he still has to pay fealty to them and often be subservient to their interests. Trump's a piece of shit like the rest of 'em, but it seems clear that they don't want Trump in their shit club.

       I know this is awful, but the Kanye video that showed illuminati clones in bed next to each other breathing included Donald Trump. It was enough to make me believe he's in bed with the rest of them. (and this was the video Kanye released before releasing the one of the waxworks)

       Trump is a lower echelon agent (permanent apprentice) for the Illuminati, their idea of putting him out to pasture is making him lead the world's most brainwashed 'First World' country. The jokes on the people for voting in a walking-talking cliche for Illuminati porn jokes: he's the pimp who thinks he's classy because after marrying his own product he starts referring to her as 'princess.'

       Rothschilds and Illuminati are two different factions who are rivals and allies at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rothchilds are mainly Bankers/Financiers and Decedents of European Monarchs among others who's objective is to limit and consolidate their power and wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Illuminati are "New Money" types who's objective is to grow their ranks and help to gain power and wealth for their friends.  Their wealth is dependent on people consuming their goods and services.  The Rockefellers, Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Military Industrial Complex types are more of their demographic.

       Yes.  If Trump was part of the "Rothschild Illuminati" as you put it, the media would be riding his dick just like they did with Obama.  The Republicans wouldn't be opposing him over everything.  The Democrats would publicly oppose him, but there would always be enough Dems crossing over to pass whatever he wants, just like during Bush's presidency.  The Russia bullshit and calling for his impeachment since the very second that Hillary lost would not be going on if he was part of the "Rothschild Illuminati".
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, Trump is not in with the Uniparty, and if he's not in with the Uniparty, then he is certainly not in with the Illuminati or the Rothschild's or whatever shady big money groups comprise the shadow government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary was the Rothschild's candidate.  We've got emails between her and Lynn Forester de Rothschild.

       You probably don't ever even check Fox News, it's just trendy to jerk against the LITERALLY ONLY mainstream news that
       <em>
        sometimes
       </em>
       doesn't spend the whole day frothing about how evil Drumpf is. It's not some sort of "alt right haven" that worships Trump. It's unbelievable how eager you are for the entire media to be unified in their propaganda. How
       <em>
        dare
       </em>
       one single outlet go against the narrative!!? They must be silenced, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Left-wing media (AKA MSM) is so insanely hypocritical it blows my mind. Since Trump, each of those networks is acting just like they accuse Fox of acting during Obama. Constant whining and complaining and conspiracies (Russia instead of Kenya!!) except it's WORSE now because it's all of them doing it instead of just Fox.

       A study confirmed Fox News coverage of him is 52% negative. Hardly Dick riding.  Don't get me wrong, Trump personifies the elite and most definitely belongs so some secret society that backs him and controls him to some degree (Mercer etc), but he's not Rothschild. Soros has been throwing a lot of cash to oppose him.

       I can't even wrap my mind around how stupid that train of thought is.
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, Fox News doesn't suck his dick as much as they could (see: literally every other network during Obama). Secondly, OF COURSE they have to give Trump
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       slack on their channel, because nearly their
       <strong>
        entire audience
       </strong>
       voted for Trump. It doesn't matter if you personally think Russia haxxed the election....lots of people still voted for Trump and they're not going to watch Fox if it doesn't at least pretend to support the
       <em>
        Republican
       </em>
       president. Fox has its hands tied. They don't want to lose their entire freaking audience. For you to say Fox supporting Trump is evidence of muh illuminati, just doesn't make any sense and is such a knee jerk reaction.

       As for people who say he's put ex financiers in his cabinet so he must be in with tptb, if you were president and not a politican before hand, wouldn't you pick some people who already knows the system?

       -_- are all his appointments from various financial organisations? No.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the whole point is picking someone who knows it, tells you how it works so you can figure out a way to fix it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were to become president, you'd most likely fuck it up Even more for not having the knowledge on how the system has been played for a long time now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said how are you supposed to fix something if you don't know exactly how it works. You can't. You're guessing at how to fix it and with it being the economy of a whole country, would you take the risk of fucking things up Even more? Think logically for a second.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example, your car breaks down in the middle of the night, you have some but little knowledge of how engines work, what do you do? Guess at how to fix it? Or call some one who's been doing it Their whole life? Well if you were to pick the first option you would never get your car started, starve to death all because you didn't have enough knowledge around you to fix the problem.

       I would say he's influenced by it by existing in the same sphere as them, but that doesn't mean he's necessarily directly working for them. There's not one singular conspiracy controlling everything from the top down, there are various competing groups of people all jockeying for personal power. Trump is just one of the asshole players in the game, just because there are other players who've been playing longer and have amassed more power doesn't mean that there's one group singularly controlling everything from the top down or something.

       All the media attacks.  All the celebrity nonsense.  All the bills that RINOs keep shutting down.  All of this is an act.  Everyone is in on it.  All the hatred for Trump is faux.  Everyone is just pretending to hate him to convince you he's not the establishment.

       It is very dependent on what you believe is the end game.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe the end game is to divide and conquer, to bring the US into a Civil war and bring about a police state then its quite obvious Trump is part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you believe the CIA is a reckless arm of the deep state continuing to push its agenda of war thats controlled by bankers who have key pedophiles in key areas to make sure everything runs smooth then you are probably on the fence about Trump because frankly .... they could of just put Hillary in and we could of done with all this bullshit. We would of had an empowerment of women in society much faster and we would of all been cucked into oblivion far quicker.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im just trying to get my head around how long TPTB have things planned and when I see these long term plans that span decades upon decades into the future then yeah ... Trump is almost certainly one of them.

       The NWO has been trying to take over the world even before the American Revolution. Do you genuinely believe they're going to let Donald Trump stop it? Look who he has in his cabinets right now. Look at the money he has been given Isreal like all the other presidents. He is just another corrupt president like every other.

       I was giving Trump the benefit of the doubt until he filled his cabinet with shit. (Goldman Sachs people, Sessions, etc...) In the words of Obi-Wan: "You were suppose to drain the swamp, not fill it." Where he went wrong, when he officially became the Republican candidate he stopped paying attention to the moderates, independents, and libertarians.

        Trump has certainly openly spoken glowingly about some of those powers.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think he's outside those power structures, but is so powerless compared to them that he still has to pay fealty to them and often be subservient to their interests. Trump's a piece of shit like the rest of 'em, but it seems clear that they don't want Trump in their shit club.

       I thought so.  No, the Russian narrative is because they did not expect Hillary to lose.  They will blame everyone but themselves for that loss.

       I agree that seems like black and white thinking but for shadow groups to control so much yet let the white house slip through their fingers just seems unimaginable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there are competing factions within the shadow organizations and we see this spill out, just as an example how there is supposedly a rivalry between the CIA and FBI and every now and again the public gets a glimpse.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe they want controversial figures to rule. Its great fodder for the media to keep the working class distracted. But also i think there is something else going on here.

       To me Trump and Obama basically have the same function.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their supporters both take a blind almost religious like faith in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And their opponents see them as the anti-christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ruling class wants to keep the working class infighting. They want citizens to distrust each other and the police. They want families to stop talking to each other because of political debates.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is just the two party system working exactly as intended. They are playing us like a fiddle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nazis vs communist American citizens fighting in the streets makes the shadow rulers super horny.

       Jesuits are near the top of the pyramid. I suspect they control the Freemasons and Zionists and CIA. But it's mixed together and complex.

       Putin is a gangster oligarch, one of the richest men on Earth and thoroughly​ corrupt. He kills journalists and rivals and activists. I have no problem believing a former spy and mafia boss is playing games to undermine the US and the EU.
