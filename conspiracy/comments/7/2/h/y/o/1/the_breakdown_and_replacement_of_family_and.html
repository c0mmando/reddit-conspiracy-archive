        Introduction: The Influence of Celebrities
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost every time I write something about celebrities, I get a comment along the lines of, “Who cares? Why give them the time of day?” While I think that view is correct on some levels, I also think that most forget who is truly impacted by celebrities: our youth (For the purpose of this post, to me, youth is K-18, and I might say kids, children, teens, etc. interchangeably)
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, it is not solely our youth that looks up to celebrities, as there are many adults that worship the ground they walk on. Still, as our youth shape their world views, they look to these celebrities as their guides. Studies show that more and more children lack role models because of decline of traditional families:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8207735/Children-growing-up-with-lack-of-role-models-says-head.html">
        http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8207735/Children-growing-up-with-lack-of-role-models-says-head.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Children need role models. Parents, grandparents, extended family, and even teachers serve as role models for most; however, there is no denying that traditional structures of family are breaking down, and even schools are struggling as more and more teachers are leaving the profession (I’m sure I could tell you a million reasons why, but that’s another post). The point is that many seek role models in alternative settings, especially when they come from broken homes. I’m sure you have heard, for example, that many troubled youth are drawn to gangs simply because it emulates the family structure (besides other reasons of course!):

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This post is going to explore why our youth look up to celebrities, and why that is ultimately dangerous. Further, I am going to explore what celebrities actually promote, and the possible reasons for promoting certain ideologies.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Family/Community
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       My bias may come in here because I always wanted to have a family. Growing up, I was abused on many levels, and my family was spotty at best. All of my grandparents died before I was probably 5. On top of having a severely rocky relationship with my father, my mother never hugged me or even told me she loved me my entire life. When I was old enough, I spent all of my time at my friends’ houses, and I often became the “adopted daughter.” I longed for the family environment, and I never really understood that until I was older. In my 20s (so now), I had to come to terms with the fact that I would probably never have the type of family I longed for (until I created my own, of course), and it was something that took me years to accept. Of course, I am not trying to get anyone to pity me. I know my blessings in life, and I am thankful for them, but I just wanted you all to know why this concept of family always appealed to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, as always, I know I cannot be the only person who relates to this. Even if you did grow up in a good family, I’m sure you might see how society is shifting. First, traditional families are no longer the norm:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/24/traditional-families-pew-report_n_6377136.html">
        http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/24/traditional-families-pew-report_n_6377136.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Before anybody calls me a bigot, I wanted to discuss why this might be an issue. Of course, there are families that are not traditional that are still ‘good’ families. However, it is no surprise the family structure has been broken down, and there are profound effects to this.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as the media tries to glorify single parent homes, there is no doubt that there are harmful consequences for children raised in these homes. Please note that I am not vilifying any single parents. I completely understand that there are some amazing single parents who do everything they can for their children. However, I am trying to explain the situation is not ideal:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://prospect.org/article/consequences-single-motherhood">
        http://prospect.org/article/consequences-single-motherhood
       </a>
       On top of that, many of these single parents are working two or more jobs, trying to support their children. Unfortunately, that means that they have less time to spend with them, but they really have no choice.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember when I was in my teens, I was watching an interview with George W. Bush and a woman who worked three jobs. He commended her, but deep down, I knew something was wrong with the picture. Why should anybody in the United States have to work three jobs to survive?
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s just a side note, but it leads me to think even more deeply. Not only are our youth lacking solid family structure and time with family in general, but there is a breakdown of community. I’m not even sure if
       <em>
        communities
       </em>
       really exist anymore. I have spent years in my neighborhood, never actually getting to know any of my neighbors. Perhaps that is my fault, but it seems most people want to be left alone. In pop culture, it is
       <em>
        cool
       </em>
       to hate other people, and now the internet has become the community for most of our youth. But can the internet really replace the connections we need to feel in real life? Quite simply, Americans have become more socially isolated, and the internet is a big reason for this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2009/11/04/social-isolation-and-new-technology/">
        http://www.pewinternet.org/2009/11/04/social-isolation-and-new-technology/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if our youth are raised with both parents, many come from dysfunctional families (like my own). Or, maybe parents are just overworked, and they do all they can for their children, but there is only so much they have time for. The point is that children are coming from more and more ‘dysfunctional’ families, and in the past, communities may have still helped the children rise above, but these communities are fading away. Many live in cities, surrounded by people, more lonely than ever:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/01/future-of-loneliness-internet-isolation">
        https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/01/future-of-loneliness-internet-isolation
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the article,
      </p>
      <p>
       "As with the city itself, the promise of the internet is contact. It seems to offer an antidote to loneliness, trumping even the most utopian urban environment by enabling strangers to develop relationships along shared lines of interest, no matter how shy or isolated they might be in their own physical lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       But proximity, as city dwellers know, does not necessarily mean intimacy. Access to other people is not by itself enough to dispel the gloom of internal isolation. Loneliness can be most acute in a crowd.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Where do our youth turn? As noted earlier, gangs can become like families to many. Some get lost and escape in drugs. I grew up in the Midwest, and many of my friends became heroin addicts. They had great lives, so it seemed, so why did so many turn to drugs? More than ever, heroin addiction is on the rise in the Midwest (and across the country), specifically among teens:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.wxyz.com/tv-20-detroit/heroin-addiction-on-the-rise-in-the-midwest-local-mom-searches-for-answers-in-sons-death">
        http://www.wxyz.com/tv-20-detroit/heroin-addiction-on-the-rise-in-the-midwest-local-mom-searches-for-answers-in-sons-death
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I do not have any solid proof that all of these teens who end up on heroin had dysfunctional families, but in a vapid world or materialism, I am not surprised that many of my teenage friends turned toward that path.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that something is not right. Our youth need structure, role models, and hell, even tradition, but their worlds seem to be more isolated, dysfunctional, and unstructured than ever. I know I am making many points here, and I am not trying to provide any conclusions. Rather, I am saying that I can understand why our youth turn out the way they do. It takes a village to raise a child, so to speak, but what happens when that village is completely dysfunctional? I remember growing up, viewing the closed-off, gated communities, and I was envious. Now, I’m not so sure. Now, I feel that there is this illusion of community of structure, but in reality, the illusion is bursting at the seams, contributing to the downfall of many as adults.
I can keep going with this, and trust me, I understand that many do end up successful despite their circumstances. Still, there is something else alarming to me…
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Worship of Celebrities
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is clear that children need to slowly evolve and mature, and as that happens, they become more independent. However, as more parents are working full-time, many children are being left alone, unsupervised, and many are simply alone with the internet:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2225579/microsoft-subnet/most-parents-allow-unsupervised-internet-access-to-children-at-age-8.html">
        https://www.csoonline.com/article/2225579/microsoft-subnet/most-parents-allow-unsupervised-internet-access-to-children-at-age-8.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, please know that I am not trying to be some type of ‘alarmist’ or ‘puritan’. However, I wonder if parents really understand what children are exposed to online. For example, younger and younger children are being exposed to porn, and they are not prepared:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/real-healing/201208/overexposed-and-under-prepared-the-effects-early-exposure-sexual-content">
        https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/real-healing/201208/overexposed-and-under-prepared-the-effects-early-exposure-sexual-content
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I would even argue that there is something more alarming. In the absence of role models or parental figures, many are finding family online: celebrities. I’m not just talking about Kim Kardashian. There are ‘internet’ celebrities that have seemed to replace families for many, and I am not kidding.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years ago, I had a student who had a pretty dysfunctional family. As her escape, she would watch a YouTube family, and she would immerse herself in these videos. Whether she understood it or not, she wanted that family to be hers. Of course, what she did not realize is that that family was not likely real, but she longed for it so badly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it really that shocking that teens are referring to their favorite celebrities as mom and dad?
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristinharris/teens-calling-celebs-mom">
        https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristinharris/teens-calling-celebs-mom
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of my students call me ‘mom’, and many are shocked by that. However, I know that they lack that mother figure at home, and maybe I am the closest they get to that. In the same way, these celebrities become a replacement for a family that our children may never have.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way, this is not all conjecture. There are thousands of studies of the psychological, biological, and evolutionary importance of family and community:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep03608">
        https://www.nature.com/articles/srep03608

        http://www.frbsf.org/community-development/files/syme_ritterman.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be impossible to link them all here, but the fact is, family matters. More than anything (race, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, etc.), parent involvement is linked to success in a student’s life:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3020099/">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3020099/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that family does not matter, and if our youth do not grow up with structured families, they may find alternative, and even dangerous replacements.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Celebrities Can Replace Families
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I can write about this because I kind of did this. I sought the validation of my parents, but I never seemed to receive that.
      </p>
      <p>
       At times, I would escape into a fantasy world, viewing the ‘perfect’ lives of those around me. Luckily, I gave up on celebrity culture when I realized it was all a façade. Still, many do not. On top of that, our society generally worships celebrities in general, and what they promote is often seen as fact. Let’s look at a few examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Oprah is one of the most influential celebrities in the world. Many have looked to Oprah for advice on just about everything:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2012/02/21/the-most-influential-celebrities/&amp;amp;refURL=https://www.google.com/&amp;amp;referrer=https://www.google.com/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       *Lately, Jim Carrey has been in the news a lot. He seems to promote some pretty interesting ‘truths’ that many seem excited about:
      </p>

        http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/jim-carreys-were-nothing-rant
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       *Others look to celebrities like Neil Degrasse Tyson, who seem to have all the answers to the universal questions:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2017/05/01/neil-degrasse-tyson-without-saying-atheist-told-cbs-why-he-doesnt-believe-in-a-creator/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       *Or maybe many look to people like Stephen Hawking, who also seem to have all the answers:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://owlcation.com/humanities/Stephen-Hawking-Says-There-Is-No-God-Heres-Why">
        https://owlcation.com/humanities/Stephen-Hawking-Says-There-Is-No-God-Heres-Why
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Of course, there are just the traditional celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Beyonce, and *insert name here.
       </em>
       I could do this for hours. The celebrities promote materialism, fame, and fortune, but there is almost never, ever anything to be said about the purpose of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you may claim that all of these celebrities give back, and they are really good people, but let me caution you there. Many celebrities can set up foundations for example, without even giving any of their own money:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2008/11/24/oprah-philanthropy-celebrity-biz-media-cz_dkr_1124charitycelebs.html">
        https://www.forbes.com/2008/11/24/oprah-philanthropy-celebrity-biz-media-cz_dkr_1124charitycelebs.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that many of these celebrities are worshipped, and believe it or not, they all seem to have a similar worldview on life. What is this worldview?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Celebrity Ideology
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can probably see where I was getting at, but if not, these celebrities all seem to promote the following concepts to youth consistently (there are always exceptions, but I am focusing on the majority here):
      </p>
      <p>
       *Immense Wealth: We have heard time and time again that money cannot buy happiness, but Oprah seems shocked that material wealth is not a focus of spirituality. Why wouldn’t God want her to be materialistically prosperous? Further, she invites many on her tv show, such as ‘Pastor’ Joel Olsteen that have no qualms with their immense wealth:

       </a>
       (seriously watch this).
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s not forget the thousands of popular songs about making money (not even going link). This worldview is in direct contrast to what most of the religions preach:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you say that money really does buy happiness, that really is kind of a misconception. Ever heard of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs?
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, of course, we do need the basic elements of survival, but after that, our needs become increasingly spiritual (or existential). By the way, the lottery effect is real:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, that yes, we do need basic human needs for happiness likely, but we do not need immense wealth that is promoted in celebrity culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       *Fame: Most of us will never reach the fame of mega-celebrities, but the internet has made it possible to feel like we are celebrities in our realities. Everything that is done now seems to be done for likes, views, comments, upvotes, etc. We have all become tiny celebrities in a way, and we can all seek the vapid validation of people we do not even know. When community and family no longer exist, many look for validation on the internet, and this validation comes in the form of ‘likes’:

       <em>
        YOLO/Forever Young: Maybe this phrase is not as popular anymore, but so much pop culture is centered around living in the moment (which might be okay), but not ever really thinking about the future. Further, celebrity culture promotes this concept that we can be ‘forever young’, and that is what *really
       </em>
       matters. Age and wisdom are scorned (our poor grandparents), and the younger, more beautiful celebrities are always envied, no matter what comes out of the mouth.
      </p>

       Did you ever hear about the celebrity who tweeted ‘YOLO’ before his drunken car crash?

       Further, more and more teens are obsessed with beauty, and body dysmorphia is becoming more common than ever:

      <p>
       The point is that celebrities seem to be pushing living in the now, not thinking about the future, and doing whatever it takes to stay young and beautiful. They rarely impart wisdom on their fans, but rather, they show our youth that their validation can be sought through fame and beauty, and nothing more.

       <strong>
        Nothing Really Matters
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I had to create an entirely different section for this. I have written about this before, and I’ll likely write about this again. Nihilism seems to be the stance of most celebrities, whether or not they know they are really promoting nihilism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Earlier, I linked to Jim Carrey’s latest interview, where he claims  that “We’re nothing.” Of course, that sounds really amazing, and even inspirational at first, but then it start to makes me realize that something is off.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I agree with Jim Carrey that reality is likely illusion, to say we are nothing is essentially promoting nihilism. And further, if our youth, who likely look up to Jim Carrey, conclude that we really are nothing, are they really going to value life in anyway?
I have written much about nihilism, and this post is already long enough:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6tzseg/societal_promotion_of_godlessness_an_analysis_of/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6tzseg/societal_promotion_of_godlessness_an_analysis_of/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In that post, I mention popular shows like Family Guy, Rick and Morty the Simpsons, and more, and how there is this great promotion of nihilism in our culture. Please read that post before you claim nihilism is not really being promoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, do any celebrities ever actual promote life as meaningful? Perhaps Oprah does, but her life seems to be meaningful because she is rich and famous, and Joel Olsteen agrees that nobody wants to be ‘depressed and poor.’ More and more celebrities have endorsed atheism, and even if they had not done that, they promote the worldview that Jim Carrey does – we are nothing, and everything is an illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, many seem to be saying that the goal of life is ‘just to be happy’ and everything is about ‘happiness.’ I call this Oprah morality, when the end goal seems to be just happiness and nothing else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, I dare you to find a
       <em>
        prominent
       </em>
       celebrity that promotes something beyond the concepts discussed, and even if they do, aren’t they hypocrites? As many celebrities preach to find a deeper meaning, many still succumb to a vapid lifestyle. I find it hilarious that Jim Carrey is criticizing the celebrities at the party he is attending, yet he is wearing an expensive suit, and he is still attending the party – and even the interviewer notes that! Yet, I see so many posts glorifying his ‘awakening.’ Quite honestly, I call bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Serving Others
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Jim Carrey can complain all he wants about the vapid culture of celebrities, but is really doing anything to change anything? Perhaps his view that “nothing is real” is impeding his efforts that could really change the world and humanity. Maybe Oprah helps others, but she sure is not ever going to give up her billions upon billions of dollars of wealth to make the world a better place. The point is, despite what celebrities promote, studies show that real happiness comes from the very opposite:
      </p>
      <p>
       *The secret of happiness is helping others:

      <p>
       *Humility increases happiness:
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       And did you know that studies show you are going to die, and all the wealth, fame, and fortune you gather on earth cannot be taken with you? As my mom always said, “Can’t take it with you.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conclusion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not surprised nihilism is on the rise in a society that is more vapid than ever. Less and less believe in anything outside of themselves, and if that’s the case, they really have nothing to lose, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to argue that these celebrities are leading many on a path to destruction. As many reach the conclusion that “I am not real” and “nothing really matters”, they might be missing out on some other, ultimate truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sure if you read my post history, you can find out what I believe, but I’m not really here to preach to anyone. Rather, I am so tired of celebrities being worshipped, and I am tired of nihilism being promoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s funny that so many critique the worship of God, but they have no problem worshipping celebrities, scientists, money, and even themselves.  I’m not even sure believe atheism is real because there is something or somebody to worship.
      </p>
      <p>
       As somebody who works with teens daily, I am seeing the direct effects. These teens are seeking validation from empty sources, and they will never feel fulfilled. The family and community that should be validating them are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       there anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to argue, ultimately, that life has meaning, and that’s what
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       are hiding from you. I’m not sure who said this but:
““Glory of the world makes life meaningless. Glory of God fulfills it.”
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you worship?
      </p>
      <p>
       FINALLY, there is nothing new under the sun. There are thousands of themes, archetypes, stories, etc. that express that the meaning of life is not wealth, fame, beauty, etc., but as our youth lose their families, will these lessons and traditions be passed on?
      </p>
      <p>
       PS: Rick and Morty is in the background, and Rick just told me nothing matters. Hmmm.....

       I want to read your post, I really do, but it's 10 past midnight in Tx right now.
However, I do believe that morals on a whole have slipped and I do think TV has had a large part to play in it. Especially SOAP operas.

       Every week/month some family is being torn apart through sex/drugs/violence and it's always portrayed as being exciting. Something to talk about etc. People want this in there lives so try to emulate what they see on screen. Like kids watching power rangers or Teenage girls following Kardashian trends. It's all going to hell in a handbasket because people want more exciting/meaningful lives and don't know where to look for it.

       You are articulating concerns that many critics of modernity expressed.   It is a mistake to locate its cause in the cultural realm, and it's solution as a cultural refocusing.  The problem is to be located in the very social relations we enter into as we produce our world, and I want to emphasize the production part.  Unless we alter our social relations, alienation  will not be overcome; furthermore, we are rapidly destroying the very conditions which make a society possible.

       I think the prevalence of social media as the primary form of social activity for teens and tweens can be to blame.

       This would miss-locate blame, as  the trajectory was present before social media.  Concerning adult isolation for example, research has been clear that we have been getting progressively more isolated and lonely way before social media.

       As for adults, I agree that it started a long time ago, but that could be the result of a number of things....moving to the burbs, texting, extended families no longer living together, etc.

       All those things contribute, but the changing form of life that you describe is because of the changing relations of production ( in a broad sense, not narrow).

      <p>
       This absolutely doesn't apply internationally, hardly anybody knows who Oprah is outside of North America, and people outside of North America certainly wouldn't turn to her for any kind of advice.  This is purely an American symptom.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The point is that celebrities seem to be pushing living in the now, not thinking about the future, and doing whatever it takes to stay young and beautiful.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Atheism has nothing to do with worshiping celebrities or scientists, it's about a lack of belief in deities ... celebrities and scientists aren't deities, therefore worshiping them has nothing to do with atheism.  Furthermore, it could be argued that atheists actually are more considerate in their place in the universe than those that simply believe words from a book written thousands of years ago and rewritten numerous times since:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Three-in-ten (atheists) (31%) say they feel a deep sense of spiritual peace and well-being at least weekly. A similar share (35%) often thinks about the meaning and purpose of life. And roughly half of all atheists (54%) frequently feel a deep sense of wonder about the universe.
        <strong>
         In fact, atheists are more likely than U.S. Christians to say they often feel a sense of wonder about the universe (54% vs. 45%).
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The bigger problem than people "critiquing the worship of God" is that Christianity has infiltrated the politics of America.  It makes society inherently divisive and unwelcoming to those with other beliefs.  This is supported by additional statistics:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Only about one-in-ten atheists (9%) say they do at least weekly, while roughly two-thirds (65%) say they seldom or never discuss their views on religion with religious people. By comparison, 26% of those who have a religious affiliation share their views at least once a week with those who have other beliefs; 43% say they seldom or never do.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Incredibly ironic for a country that was partially founded upon the idea of separating church and state ...

       Read through your post and couldn't agree more. As someone who grew up in a bad home situation (bio patents divorced before I was 2, mom remarried to officer in the marine corps by 3, 5 my sister the golden child was born, starting at 7 being abused by said step father, moved every 1.5-2 years, not allowed friends who weren't approved, etc) the family coming apart has been a big issue, and for some time. Listening to my Mom and step-dad complain about their childhoods, I was a recipient of their trauma (I like to call it the Bojack syndrome). when family members who I had no idea about died, I was the rock for my mom since my step-dad couldn't be bothered.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying this to garner sympathy, or attention, our what have you. Rather I want to toss my anecdote out there showing how things can go bad fast for kids who are at the mercy of incredibly broken people being parents. The more our society pushes adults to work themselves harder for less money to put scraps falling from the mega-rich table,  the further they are pushing them away from the family.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another problem that I have noticed is lack of responsibility. If you run with your idea of celebrities being worshipped, it's not a surprise to find them being emulated in unpredictable ways, to include illegal activities with real consequences. When music videos or whatever media portrays these people doing illegal activities, either it works out in 22 minutes, or no real consequences are shown. Then go to YouTube and watch some hugely followed, and highly paid, individual espouse love for Nazis, or how someone should be killed (casual public death threats!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Couple all this with how we treat kids (give them a gender/orientation identities before they can walk, sexualize incredibly young girls, teach boys that your lusts are normal and forcing them upon others aren't met with real punishments, etc.) It's no wonder that children are growing up more broken than ever. I made it out because I had a community at school and college that helped me grow out of being a scared little boy that grew up a red headed step child. These kids don't have that luxury, and even worse don't seem to be developing the depth of social skills to give them the ability to form satisfying, lasting relationships. I genuinely worry that one day instead of prostitution, we will have friends for sale.
