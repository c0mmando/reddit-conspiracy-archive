<p>I didn&#39;t. That clip was shot on the morning of September 11, 2001, at Dulles airport. What sense does it make to think it was from September 10? <em>They weren&#39;t there that day.</em></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well yes, when it&#39;s an incredibly well known piece of video that you could verify yourself with like five minutes on Google.</p>

<p>Let me see if I get this straight. Guy says there&#39;s no footage of the hijackers and that they weren&#39;t on the manifests — both things false, by the way — and you take that as gospel, but when somebody shows you the <em>actual things the guy said don&#39;t exist</em> you&#39;re all &quot;Oh, that&#39;s not really what it is. That&#39;s really something else.&quot;</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason the world has collectively stopped engaging with people like that.</p>

<p>But where is the proof of that?</p>

<p>I mean the top comment on your video already shows that it is full of shit.</p>

<p>Wrong, not dulles airport, all airport footage has timestamps and dates. Since this was not on 9/11 or in dulles, they removed AND cropped the footage to hide the real time and location. </p>

<p>No Planes doesn&#39;t mean nothing. Have you watched the live footage feom that day? Its a joke.</p>

<p>To say no flying vessel hit the trade centers is nonsense. I am inclined to believe military planes were swapped in but we can never be certain...</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ll set the record straight, these devices are always ENGAGED and can be enabled with two minutes notice. This means either the government (and therefore Boeing) were complicit in the attacks OR the planes were controlled remotely by a third party (therefore blocking the governments ability to remotely connect to the device.) </p>

<p>People have speculated that the idea for the device was conceived in 1970 and in use by 1995. Boeing only publicly admitted to having the devices installed on their planes in 2007 - as the airline was cautious of lawsuits, or deterring passengers who might not feel safe flying in what could be a remote controlled vehicle.</p>

<p>You can find information on this all over - you can find a thousand people for and against the whole idea. It is a cluster fuck of information but i do believe the technology was most in use pre 9/11. If you care to look into this i suggest you use a search engine other than google, and take everything you read with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Ok?  That&#39;s totally irrelevant.  I am not debating about what these aircraft contained in regards to people or even explosives.  I don&#39;t disagree it could be a conspiracy but <strong>your</strong> point was that &quot;You know all the networks cut out at impact, right?&quot; which is patently false as i show below using your links.<br/>
And the other point was that NO planes flew into the towers which again is just incorrect but way of your own links.</p>

<p>What?  It was LIVE coverage seen by news cameras and amateur video cameras all over the new york area!  We are talking private citizens with eyewitness reports all seeing the same thing.  Sure, some were on the other side of the building and didnt see a plane hit while people on the other side did, which only makes sense.  </p>

<blockquote>

No, you didn&#39;t.  There is nothing about these that even HINTS at being manipulated.</p>

<p>I was on my phone at the time which made it difficult to jump around.  I went to my desktop PC instead.  </p>

<p><strong>ABC</strong>:  second plane at 31:43, no cut away.   </p>

<p><strong>NBC</strong>: Second plane at 31:51, you can see the plane and they do a totally normal cut.  To a close up of the first tower.   This seemed like a totally normal cut for a newsroom to do.  Its not like they knew another plane was going to hit.  </p>

<p><strong>CBS</strong>: Second plane at 31:49 you can see the wingtip at the bottom right of the screen, no cut away.  </p>

<p><strong>CNN</strong>:  Second plane at 14:55 you can see the plane and they do a totally normal cut.  It&#39;s like you expected every news station to never cut away for different shots.  </p>

<p>Are you suggesting ALL of the people in these videos are actors or shills who were standing in public with other people who all agreed to lie for the government?  All the people in apartments are in on a massive conspiracy to say that it was airplanes that hit even though it wasnt?  Dude, again, the tower 7 falling, the fact the towers fell at all IS weird.  But to suggest that planes didnt hit the towers is just goofy talk.

<p>Anyone who is from New York or has friends or family there or even has ever visited knows this is true. </p>

<p>I think the one thing that no YouTube conspiracy expert realizes is that after the 1st tower was hit everyone in Brooklyn, Jersey City, Hoboken, Staten Island and lots of manhattan all rushed to see the first tower burning. Millions of people watched the 2nd plane hit. You can&#39;t fake that. </p>

<p>In regards to what?  The nose part coming out or the plane hitting the tower in general?   </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah but they didn&#39;t.  I posted links down on another post of a ton of different perspectives.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The handheld videos look like an explosion.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course they do.  A aircraft hit a skyscraper at highspeed.  What do you expect?  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many people there neither heard nor saw airplanes.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And many people did.  As i stated in another post, i was a Jehovahs Witness at the time (thus my username) and had a lot of friends located at Watchtower (JW) Headquarters in newyork who saw the actual planes hit the towers.  They called us in a panic because they thought it was the end times.   </p>

<blockquote>

That depends on location of the person relative to the plane.  Ever been to an airshow?  Airplanes can be silent while coming at you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I watched your video.  All it shows with regards to the CGI thing is that explosions and airplanes can be replicated with computers.  We know that, that was never a question.  It doesn&#39;t demonstrate that this was CGI.  </p>

<p>Look, Building 7, the falling of the towers in the way they did is ABSOLUTELY suspicious.  I think there is a lot we don&#39;t know.  But to say the planes werent there is asinine based on the anecdotes from my old friends who were were watching the entire thing from brooklyn, from amature and MSM video and survivor experiences.<br/>
Could the planes have been a cover for a controlled demolition?  Sure!  We&#39;d need more evidence to confirm it but its not out of the question.  But saying the planes didn&#39;t exist on that day is something i cannot buy. </p>

<p>around here we all know that the official story doesn&#39;t add up...but all of the intelligent, rational people here also know that <em>SOME SORT OF PLANES</em> hit WTC 1 and 2. people saw them and no - every eye-witness in New York that day isnt a fucking paid crisis actor. whether they were commercial planes fitted with flight termination systems or military planes dressed up as commercial jets with the tags switched...thats another question. but please - no planes / hologram planes is as much of a bullshit disinfo planted misinfo conspiracy as flath earth. </p>

If you mean a generic airliner in fight, probably not - Boeing have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Honeywell_Uninterruptible_Autopilot">patent on a system that could be used</a>, but it wasn&#39;t granted until 2006 AND there&#39;s nothing to suggest it was ever rolled out.

According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_175">this</a> wikipedia article, there were 5 Hijackers on United 175. Their names were Marawan al-Shehhi, Fayez Banihammad, Hamza al-Gamdi, Ahmed al-Ghamdi, and Mohand al-Sheri. Four of those are on the manifest with no alias of any kind. The al-Ghamdi brothers are number 2 and 3 on that list. al-Shehhi is number 4, al-Shehri is number 5. Banihammad is not on the list. However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayez_Banihammad">this</a> wikipedia article says </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both Banihammad and the media would often refer to him by one of his aliases, including &quot;Fayez Ahmad&quot;, &quot;Banihammad Fayez Abu Dhabi Banihammad&quot;, <strong>&quot;Fayez Rashid Ahmed&quot;</strong>, &quot;Rasid Ahmed Hassen Alqadi&quot;, &quot;Abu Dhabi Banihammad Ahmed Fayez&quot;, and others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39; have a source, but I would bet that he travelled under an alias, and he is Ahmed F on the passenger manifest. Number 1.</p>
