        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Watching the National <del>news</del> nightly propaganda report (which had the professional athletes  as their lead story tonight) and the local news, where they blathered on for a combined 20 minutes talking about the player &quot;protests&quot;, I did not hear the words police shootings or police violence (or anything like that). </p>

<p>The whole thing seems to have morphed in to TRUMP CAN&#39;T TELL US WHAT WE CAN DO OR SAY!&quot; ( personally I do not want to talk about Trump, I do not want to get political. He is not the issue, or at least he wasn&#39;t until now) WTF? </p>

<p>The protest  started with Kapernic (for some reason) using the National Anthem to protest police killing too many people.  But now it seems to be about a whole another thing. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/sports/football/cowboys-cardinals-anthem-protest.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss">Jerry Jones protested tonight on MNF? Was he protesting the police killing too many people or was he just posing for the cameras?</a></p>

<p>I would love to see some serious work done to hold cops accountable for the too many people they murder too often, but these protests and people talking about them are seemingly no longer about that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously the right doesn&#39;t want to mention the reasons for the protest, so its easier for them to frame it as just America-hatred for their drones.  What&#39;s interesting is that the center-right (Democrats) also wants to ignore the actual reasons.  When they frame things purely around Trump it means they don&#39;t have to address any of the underlying substance, and can prod those who listen to them away from focusing on the actuality of the police state.</p>

<p>When I see this BS I wonder how everyone does not see it.

I did not watch the game tonight but I would bet they did not say the word police either.</p>

But, the majority of happenstance encounters, I was greeted with &quot;cracker ass bitch&quot; or &quot;white mother fucker&quot;, along with other ridiculously racist monikers.  In my experience, and I&#39;ve lived all over the East coast, low income/educated predominantly black areas are more apt to be racist towards whites than low income/educated rural areas to be racist towards blacks.  Hell, all of the hayseeds around here try their damnedest at idolizing black pop culture.  So yeah, I don&#39;t see it.  Maybe there&#39;s a few lurkers around here but they certainly don&#39;t make any noise or advertise their hatred.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just a dumb way to protest. If they want to protest why not do it during interviews,refuse to talk about anything other than your &quot;cause&quot; ala marshawn lynch. Or wear BLM cleats/jerseys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suggest they go out for the National Anthem and stand... while holding up an 8x10 picture of someone who was killed by a police officer in questionable circumstances. Then there would be no doubt about what these protests are about.</p>

<p>Think Jerry Jones would do that? </p>

<p>I understand the logistics of which pictures they might hold up... who and under what circumstances someone was killed by the police... but if not an actual picture, then at least hold up a sign that says THE POLICE NEED TO STOP KILLING SO MANY PEOPLE!</p>

<p>If they are going to protest then they need to make the cause known. </p>

<p>The ball is in Kaepernick&#39;s  court right now, or maybe I should say he has the ball on the 1 yard yard line and if he wants to really do some good, then right now is the time while all of the media is in a frenzy.</p>

<p>Take this protest spot light off of Trump and put it where it belongs, on the police. </p>

<p>Seriously, the police in this country need to be held accountable when they kill someone and it looks more like murder than protecting the public.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good observation. None of it is surprising though, the same responses and arguments were levied at Kapaernick when he started the whole thing, and back then we were actually in the midst of multiple police killings of unarmed men and nobody being held accountable. Sad to see things get even further divorced from their source and the actual beliefs underpinning all of this. </p>

<p>Trump just continues to weaponize divisive issues. You think he really gives two shits about some NFL players taking a knee during the anthem? He brought this up as base-fuel, knowing the big reactions he&#39;ll get from all parties. He tells his supporters what they want to hear, doubling down at times. This is a campaign, those rallies are campaign rallies, lest we forget. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. Media turned it into a black lives matter thing but it originally started out as a protest to the whole us government. Drone policy. Spying. Endless war. Inequality. Military policing. Some how the whole thing turned into a blm thing about race...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kaepernick was the first to sit/kneel during the anthem (that I&#39;m aware of).<br/>
<a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem">
His reasoning was</a>:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,&quot; Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game. &quot;To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It wasn&#39;t the media that turned it to BLM - that was the original intent of Kap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/25/us/nfl-trump-take-knee-protests-cowboys-cardinals/index.html">The Cowboys, coaches and players alike, all locked arms and knelt together during the performance of the star spangled banner, right before but not during the anthem</a>.</p>

<p>They protested the efforts to silence the speech of others&#39; protests during this time.</p>

<p>At this point in time the protesting in and of itself has become a hot button issue. Funny how activism and protest in this country has been demonized. Self appointed guardians of the status quo and useful idiots &quot;defending national pride&quot;.</p>
