<p>Think of the apparatus capable of killing Hastings, Horner, Thompson, MacFadyen, Rich, Peter Smith, David Crowley (his little kid and wife with him)...the level of effort they&#39;ve put into maintaining this machine and promoting it&#39;s power, inciting from us panic, division, fear. </p>

<p>They&#39;d rather bring the world to the brink of global war than expel the handful of traitors who have seized control of their operations. If we haven&#39;t already,  we&#39;re soon going to reach a tipping point where these ideas won&#39;t simply earn rented downvotes, these ideas will lead to jail or worse. </p>

<p>They want to fucking criminalize WikiLeaks. Let that sink into your fucking head.</p>

<p>Closing my rant by saying this isn&#39;t new. This is how it&#39;s been. If you haven&#39;t, read The Hollow Men. Here&#39;s a snippet:</p>

<pre><code>                   I

We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!
Our dried voices, when
We whisper together
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass
Or rats&#39; feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar

Shape without form, shade without colour,
Paralysed force, gesture without motion;

Those who have crossed
With direct eyes, to death&#39;s other Kingdom
Remember us - if at all - not as lost
Violent souls, but only
As the hollow men
The stuffed men...

    <div class="md"><p>the narrative that Seth Rich being the whistleblower somehow &quot;destroys the Russia narrative&quot; as if the DNC hacking is the only thing in the &quot;Russia Narrative&quot;.</p>

<p>Even if Russia had nothing to do with the DNC, there are still an incredible amount of ties between Trump associates (Trump Jr., Flynn, Kushner, Manafort, Sater, Carter Page, Rick Gates, Corey Lewandowski, etc.) and Russian oligarchs/people with ties to the Russian power structure (Deripaska, Agalarov, Akhmetshin, Veselnitskaya, Kislyak, Lavrov) that doesn&#39;t just go away if Seth Rich really was the whistleblower (which we&#39;ve seen no proof that there is)</p>

<p>The entire Russia conspiracy theory was predicated on the DNC servers and the Steele dossier.  We all know the DNC wasn&#39;t hacked and the Steele dossier has been thoroughly debunked.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the fake news was dropping these nothingburgers about Trump associates and blowing them up.  So when the basis for the investigation is discovered to be lies you still have something to fall back on.</p>

<p>What&#39;s really sad is everyone knows for a fact how fake our media is.  Yet here&#39;s people, on the conspiracy sub, siting them as &quot;facts&quot; for the Russia conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Whether it&#39;s the only part is irrelevant. If it&#39;s true, which no one really knows, then it shows that the DNC lied about it. There is no way they could have possibly gotten this wrong and not knowingly lied about it. That&#39;s how the narrative would be destroyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hard Truth:</p>

<p>It was and is part for the course, everyone meddles in everyone&#39;s elections and have been since before it was elections.  They were meddling in who inherited the throne, in who won between brothers that had a claim on the throne and they will always meddle no matter what form the government is.  It&#39;s called geopolitics, it&#39;s nothing original or new.</p>

<p>What is happening with Trump is that he wasn&#39;t supposed to win.  Don&#39;t know how exactly it happened, memes, voting machine hacks failing, Social media being used differently... Who knows.  What we know is that it happened and they don&#39;t like it at all.</p>

<p>Like him or hate him, Trump is not deep state.  He isn&#39;t Ron Paul but he is the best chance we have.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s why this sub, Google, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, the MSM and everything that was used in any way to expose Hillary or promote Trump is being scorched Earth to remove whatever little sliver of actual power we found in it.  They don&#39;t know what happened, we don&#39;t know what happened so everything must go.  </p>

<p>There was no media bias toward Hillary Clinton in 2016.  I don&#39;t understand this meme.  The media made her emails by far the #1 story of the race, more than literally every policy issue combined! Christ, how much more &quot;scandal&quot; framing did the Clinton Foundation get than the Trump Foundation, considering the former actually does charity work and the latter was basically a tax scam?  How much more &quot;potential conflict of interest&quot; coverage did the Clinton Foundation get than the Trump Organization, given the latter&#39;s far greater potential for direct bribery and Trump&#39;s confirmation he wouldn&#39;t sever his relationship to it at all. The media held Clinton to the standard of a sitting president, and held Trump to the standard of a reality show character.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>She was the epitome of the corporate candidate. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which baffles me, because her advisory core was made up of policy experts and academics, while her opponent&#39;s was packed with sitting corporate executives.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So I don&#39;t think we just ignore this influence if we can prove it conclusively, but I guess I just think people need to realize that this kinda shit is happening constantly all around the world. I gurantee the CIA was helping out Macroon over in France after our election. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guarantee you the CIA didn&#39;t, because I&#39;m certain they value their relationship with European intelligence agencies (and the information it yields) far more than they care about who the president of France is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I guess most importantly,  I think his is probably not worth starting World War III or some sort of civil war over. </p>

I don&#39;t think what the MSM tells us is the whole truth. It is the version of the truth that helps the corporations the most, since that is who owns them.

<p>I&#39;m not sure how any of what I said leads to this comment -- the largest paragraph I wrote was about the media&#39;s poor editorial choices. </p>

<p>I think a lot of people here, though, have a simplistic and incorrect view of the mainstream media.  They think the mainstream media is controlled by &quot;them,&quot; and therefore <em>a priori</em> wrong, and anything that counters the mainstream media is presumed to be right.  This leads people to be credulous of ridiculously unreliable sources.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the real media bias: viewers.  Of course the mainstream media -- in particular cable news -- is problematic.  But their major bias is towards sensationalism and simplistic stories that are easy to grasp.  &quot;If it bleeds it leads,&quot; but jacked up into hyperdrive by a 24-hour news cycle. To the extent that corporate America controls reporting, it&#39;s not that it&#39;s directly trying to brainwash the public, it&#39;s because newsrooms have shifted from public-service cost centers to infotainment profit centers. This has in turn shifted television news into basically <em>Sportscenter</em>, increasingly focused on interpersonal dramas and narratives rather than the underlying facts themselves -- &quot;How does will the Puerto Rico crisis affect Trump&#39;s approval ratings?&quot;</p>

<p>What you&#39;re calling &quot;the media&quot; is a narrow set of left-leaning political analysts and commentators who make up a relatively small percentage of actual airtime, but get frequently posted on Twitter and Reddit. You only believe that the media had a pro-Clinton bias because you&#39;re spending a ton of time in small communities that amplify pro-Clinton commentary.</p>

<p>They, of course, chose to cover the email scandal predominately over emphasizing her many other qualities of leadership and experience.  This is because they felt they needed to address Hillary&#39;s trustworthiness, thanks to Trump&#39;s childish moniker, &quot;Crooked Hillary.&quot;  Because they lack basic understanding of actual persuasion, they thought addressing the emails head-on was the way to do it.  While I can&#39;t fault them for trying, I am also super happy it failed.</p>

It would prove that Wikileaks is honest (not a threat) that Trump isn&#39;t colluding with Russia, that there are actually millions and millions of people who aren&#39;t racist assholes who wanted Trump.. that the DNC in fact colluded to screw Bernie and subvert democracy in an election.. and I would essentially make every Trump hater have to look themselves in the mirror and say, &quot;wow I was lied to by my entire government that I thought cared about me.&quot;</p>

<p>It means all of the Russian hearings and the money wasted on the investigation was wasted on the Taxpayers dime JUST SO THEY COULD PROTECT ABOUT 10 PEOPLE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good questions. </p>

<p>First, if Trump&#39;s campaign did anything whatsoever to coordinate political attacks with Russia, pretty sure that&#39;s illegal. If a place like Breitbart worked with Russia or Russian media to coordinate attacks, that&#39;s not illegal, just a little shameful.</p>

<p>As for previous elections, I don&#39;t know if they would have even had the ability to work this way back in 2012 or if Putin had created his cyberwarfare team. Though they would have been on the side of Democrats at that time, since the Republican party were the ones demonizing Russia at the time, and even that was really only about their actions in Georgia and the Ukraine.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very unlikely that he was because the last dated emails in the archive are dated after Seth Rich died.</p>

<p>It is not impossible that Seth was one of several and the task was completed after his death, and still likely enough that it was an inside leak not a hack, but not conclusive either way, yet. Remember that only Crowdstrike has ever examined the server in the original to see what might have happened.</p>

<p>And after, according to the narrative, Crowdstrike detected the intrusion emails continue to be exfiltrated for about a month. Makes me suspicious of the timeline and the narratyive, but nothing more than suspicious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually probably the Russian intent was simply to sow dissension and discord regardless of who won; would suit their desires best. So their campaign has succeeded beyond their wildest dreams because of the desperate need of the Dems to explain their bad showing.</p>

<p>This fits the facts pretty well. The meeting with Trump Jr is a pretty obvious blind alley. He was tempted to attend by promises of evidence of actual crimes committed by the Clinton campaign - he almost has an obligation to hear these - those who claim to have the info won&#39;t say anything to the FBI or law enforcement and without some evidence any complaint isn&#39;t going anywhere. So Trump attends, and instead gets a lobbying plea for something completely different, with no Clinton tidbits at all. So it&#39;s a meeting sought by the Russians with a motive entirely disconnected from the election - just plain old grubby lobbying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All the Russian collusian stuff is all based on nothing but speculation, there is exactly zero corroborating evidence that they were involved in anything in regard to the DNC leaks. All we know is that a mildly politically connected guy got murdered in a city full of poltically connected people while walking around one of the most crime ridden cities in America at 3 a.m. and was supposedly shot during a robbery, yet the robbers did not steal a single item off his person. He was transported to a hospital while reportedly still conscious, and died sometime later while in the hospital. His personal laptop was later inexplicably confiscated by the DC police, and despite the use of body camps by police, no footage of the crime scene investigation has been made available to the public. Many high ranking DNC-connected persons have expressed outrage at public inquiry into Seth Rich&#39;s murder, including Donna Brazile who publicly demanded to know why a PI was &quot;snooping&quot; into the incident. Julian Assange and wikileaks have repeatedly denied that the Russians were the source of DNC emails, and have numerous times insinuated that an insider was their source. Stop pretending like you know it was the Russians because you don&#39;t have any clue what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Until I got much older the stories about the drug dealing, political murders etc where too bizarre to believe.</p>

<p>then I read about Malcolm Wallace who was LBJ&#39;s assassin.</p>

<p>Then there was Barry Seal.</p>

<p>then there was 911.</p>

<p>I once thought that this John Lennon quote was simply hyperbole &quot;Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. I think we&#39;re being run by maniacs for maniacal ends and I think I&#39;m liable to be put away as insane for expressing that. That&#39;s what&#39;s insane about it.&quot;  Now I know he meant this very literally.  He knew these people and they had him killed.  Probably by a controlled assassin.</p>

I’m not one to call people on stuff like this because I think people do it to often, but you really annoyed me this time. I don’t think you’re a “shill” or paid poster, anything like that.
