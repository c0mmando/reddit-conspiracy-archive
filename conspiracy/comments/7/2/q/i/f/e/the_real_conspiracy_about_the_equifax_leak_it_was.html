       Take a look for yourself, after submitting to see if you were affected by the leak they offer their fucking ID protection program! This is absolutely insultive beyond any means that they would even do this to us after having a data beach and leads me to believe it was all a setup just to make more profits and that none of our data is actually truly leaked out to anyone.

       If you sign up for Equifaxâ€™s offer of free protection(only for 1 year), you may be limiting your rights to sue and be forced to take disputes to arbitration. Bastards!

       Arbitration clauses are enforced much more often than they are thrown out. But this one only applies to issues arising from the new product, not anything from the original leak.

       U/Kolyin is right. I actually published an article about it. You have to basically prove that the arbitration clause was unconscionable, which is a heavy burden. Because they are usually used in consumer products, they're seldom necessities, at least as far as the court sees it.

       So wait, you expect them to have a massive data breach, and NOT provide people with some sort of means to protect themselves?

       I mean I woudn't go anywhere near their TrustedID service, but them offering that up for free doesn't automatically mean that this was all a set up. I imagine that setting up a relationship with another Identity protection company so that they could give away someone elses service for free would have been expensive and time consuming.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear, I do not support Equifax or the service they are offering, but I also do not believe that is definitive proof that this was an "inside job" to sell their own Identity protection.

      <p>
       The conspiracy about them offering their Identity protection to me, is that by agreeing to the terms of service to sign up for it, you are waiving your right to be part of legal action against them for the breach. In my opinion this is a much bigger issue that many people do not realize. I have read that it likely wouldn't stand up in court, but it at least proves that they are concerned about the recourse of what happened. A massive lawsuit will likely end up costing them a more than what they would bring in, in new TrustedID subscriptions AFTER the free year is up.

       TLDR. Dont fucking sign up for TrustedID.

       They also acquired an Identity Protection firm prior to announcing the breach to the public.

       So they planned to have the data leak, then after buy their ID protection program? Wouldn't you think they would purchase the ID protection program first to make sure they actually have one ready to go for the leak?

       lol, they wiped out billions worth of stock, there will likely be a forced take over from one of the other big players and it was all to sell a subscription service at a few dollars a month?

       that's utterly retarded whichever way you look at it.
