      <p>
       Well that's the question, isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two basic points of view. One says that health is not guaranteed. Sometimes people get sick; sometimes they get
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       sick. That's just how it is. Medical care is not free. I don't mean it's not free-of-charge, I mean it's not free of
       <em>
        cost.
       </em>
       It takes resources (ingenuity and time) to provide medical care, which means it has to be paid for somehow. Doctors gotta eat, etc. Therefore it's an unfortunate fact that some people are more equipped to pay for medical care than others. Fundamentally this is no different from some people being more able to pay for nice clothes than others. We all need clothes, but you still gotta buy em. That's just life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The opposing point of view starts with the premise that human suffering is to be minimized; that's a moral imperative. Therefore it's morally wrong to deny medical care to a person who's suffering solely and for no other reason than because that person cannot pay. Yes, medical care has a cost, but it's immoral to use that fact to separate people who are suffering from the help they need. Therefore we should establish some system — charity, subsidies, debt forgiveness, whatever — in which suffering people always have access to that which would alleviate their suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no objective right or wrong on this. This isn't a question of fact. It's a question of choice. Do we
       <em>
        choose
       </em>
       to put medical care behind a money gate? Or do we
       <em>
        choose
       </em>
       to find some way of providing it to everybody regardless of ability to pay? Whichever side you come down on, there are a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of practical details to work out. It's a problem nobody's ever fully solved.

       Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is quite impossible, when you're I'll, unemployably injured, or dying of disease.  Just because good medical care wasn't always available during our founding days, doesn't mean that it isn't a natural and obvious extension of basic human rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's not like we can't afford it.  We
       <em>
        won't
       </em>
       afford it, because we're too busy pouring trillions into a wasteful empire's military, and a whole host of other black projects, with evil intent.

       Yeah, that's what some people say, all right. Like I said, though, the devil is in the details. If you take the need for economic efficiency out of the system, the system tends to bog down and become highly
       <em>
        in
       </em>
       efficient, as we've seen with much smaller-scale attempts like the UK's NHS.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tricky part isn't providing medical care to all who need it. The tricky part is providing
       <em>
        the best possible
       </em>
       medical care to all who need it. When somebody figures out how to do that, they'll have won the battle.

       I don't trust our current government with much of anything.  It's completely and utterly corrupted, even completely captured, by greedy, evil, profiteering goons.  But that doesn't change the notion that good health should be
       <em>
        available
       </em>
       to every single person.  Not mandated, but easily accessible.

       Without health, and life, all other "liberties" are impossible.

       And who said anything about "forced"?  Are police forced to police?  Firemen forced to put out fires?  Farmers forced to farm?  No, they're paid for their service, just like any other worker would be.

       You've been conned into thinking we can't provide medical care to everybody, by people who profit greatly from that horribly wrong assumption.  Sure, there are administrative challenges that arise, but it
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be done.  But it won't.  Our corpitalist tyranny won't allow it.

       Well, if you're going to disagree with the most iconic and important quote of the declaration of Independence, I don't even know what to say to you.  If the three unalienable rights aren't worth defending, we might as well live on different planets.

       Governments are supposed to preserve the rights and freedoms of its people, to live as they wish, without harming others.  Life.  Liberty.  Pursuit of happiness.  ALl that nonsense.  Ours has hopelessly lost its way, but so have you.

       It is like defense contractors charging $40 for a screw or $1000 for a hammer, buying stuff they don't need or throwing away things that can be repaired. It is all meant to funnel tax dollars into a few peoples pockets.

       As far as accounting goes, everything that taxpayer money is spent on should be accessible via online records, down to the penny. They need to implement blockchain accounting practices.

       I worked at a hospital during summers while in college. Just because it is non-profit doesn’t mean it isn’t wasteful. It s quite wasteful. Where I worked, they built a $100m parking garage. That wasn’t really needed. The front lawn gets new sod. It’s 10 acres. All to keep getting grants. Spend it all to get more. They have enough left over to spend hundreds of millions. To get more in grants. So they overcharge, waste the money, get more tax dollars because you know... non-profit....

       To what extent is the government responsible is the question? They have no problem throwing trillions down to kill, but take care of our own citizens? Not so much. Looks like they pulled the wool over the citizens eyes when they got us fighting each other about pulling our own weight. The weight has been pulled plenty, only to be mishandled by D.C.

       Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is quite impossible, when you're I'll, unemployably injured, or dying of disease.  Just because good medical care wasn't always available during our founding days, doesn't mean that it isn't a natural and obvious extension of basic human rights.
      </p>

       And it's not like we can't afford it.  We
       <em>
        won't
       </em>
       afford it, because we're too busy pouring trillions into a wasteful empire's military, and a whole host of other black projects, with evil intent.
