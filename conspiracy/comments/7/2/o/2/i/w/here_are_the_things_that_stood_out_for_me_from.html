        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>edit: I want to be clear that none of this should be taken as a justification for harassing anyone. Not only is that unnecessary, but it&#39;s counterproductive in that it creates a negative stereotype that further stifles discussion. Moreover, it is terribly wrong in the case that we are wrong-- we should never presume to have certainty that we are right, and from there reason that the ends justify the means, because the downside is that we are missing something and we end up doing serious harm; and there are alternative ways with a much smaller potential for downside ( in this case, reasonable discourse with emphasis on facts and logic) of arriving at the intended goal. That has to be the path for something like this.</p>

<hr/>

<h1></h1>

<p>I thought the Sandy Hook conspiracy was an absolutely absurd theory developed by people motivated to disarm the gun violence and need for gun control narrative. But it&#39;s never fair to completely dismiss a theory without hearing it; you have to take an impartial look at the evidence and form your opinion after that, trying to approach all new evidence without bias and leaving your opinion perpetually open to revision. </p>

<h1></h1>

<p>While you can&#39;t and wouldn&#39;t want to entertain every single theory because there just isn&#39;t enough time and many theories are bad, you don&#39;t want to prematurely separate out viable theories. So you have to come up with some way of deciding among the theories you know little about which you want to investigate and which you don&#39;t. </p>

<h1></h1>

<p>I have found one generally useful criteria is that a theory is worth investigating if there is absolutely stifling social stigma around so much as discussing it. This usually at minimum indicates that the issue hasn&#39;t received the usual level of scrutiny, and someone could be trying to use that feature to pass one over on the population. This criteria clearly applies with Sandy Hook.</p>

<h1></h1>

<p>Here are the things that stood out to me the most from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t922i3bDHXw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">Dear Wolfgang</a> (edit: to be clear, most of this needs to be fact checked (except for a few points for which sufficient evidence is provided in the documentary):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>incident report doesn&#39;t mention shooting, only &quot;unwanted person&quot;-- compare that to the purported audio of the 911 calls</p></li>
<li><p>everyone declared dead within 10 mins of shooting (by who?); EMT not allowed to enter building; no trauma helicopters called; ambulances not near entrance of school</p></li>
<li><p>why weren&#39;t the parents allowed to see their dead children? why did the parents agree to this? can you imagine a single set of parents doing this, much less all of them?</p></li>
<li><p>Wolfgang told by police he&#39;d be arrested for calling port-a-potty company again after calling to ask who ordered port-a-potties.</p></li>
<li><p>Adam Lanza, the attacker, was a 112 lb kid who supposedly carried several guns and 50 lbs of ammunition, and shot and killed ~25 people in less than 10 minutes</p></li>
<li><p>Why were people going in circles around the firehouse to make themselves appear to look busy?</p></li>
<li><p>Lack on maintenance on the school obvious from pictures-- was it even a functioning school?</p></li>
<li><p>Refusal to give information about who was the incident commander</p></li>
<li><p>None of the parents who lost a child still live in Newtown (compare to Columbine, where half still lived in the area after losing a child)</p></li>
<li><p>Newtown has received over $200 million dollars from the federal government since the shooting; each parent got $281,000, and complained in a letter to the Connecticut AG when they didn&#39;t get more (not standard practice)</p></li>
<li><p>not a single parent has filed a lawsuit connecting to the shooting</p></li>
<li><p>three days <em>before</em> the shooting, the United Way already had a donation fund for the victims of Sandy Hook</p></li>
<li><p>Governor Malloy denies he said that someone had spoken to him and the Lt Governor about something like Sandy Hook happening despite video recording of him saying so in a televised announcement.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ndaa-legalizes-propaganda-2012-5">Executive order (National Defense Authorization Act) allows the news media to use propaganda on the american public</a></p></li>
<li><p>Crisis actors: Nancy and David Wheeler (allegedly actual actors); Dr. H Wayne Carver, allegedly involved in two different crisis events; Nick Phelps (he was also unconvincing in his statement) and Laura Phelps (allegedly actual actors)</p></li>
<li><p>Very odd reactions by families: one example: on day of event, walking away &quot;It was awful, it was awful [laughs]&quot; reporter asks child if she&#39;s okay and child gives cheery &quot;mhmm&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>No mention of field trip to Superbowl on School Board&#39;s Consent Agenda, which because it&#39;s an out-of-state field trip needs to be signed off by the principal, superintendent, and school board.</p></li>
<li><p>Resemblance of child in Sandy Hook choir who performed at superbowl with victims; NFL issues gag order to these children not to speak to anyone, and has yet to release the names of the children who performed; school board does not so much as mention performance in meeting that occurred within a day of the performance (performance occurred Feb 3rd 2013 and he says school board meeting was Feb 2nd 2013)</p></li>
<li><p>Wolfgang received threats to stop looking into Sandy Hook, including threats to his wife and sons&#39; jobs</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Will need to keep looking into it before developing a strong opinion about it, but certainly hard to square all of this with the official narrative. What do you all make of these points? Counter points encouraged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there&#39;s a documentary about Lanza that I forget the name of, never actually watched it, but I&#39;ve seen people link to it here a few times, which basically questions his existence.</p>

<p>The shill rebuttal to this clip is that the kid was nervous and/or he was comparing the emergency scenario with a drill. If you want to believe that, sure I guess. But it&#39;s obvious that the women next to him and Dr. Oz are both not keen on letting him finish that thought.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what Wolfgang says about this. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true, needs more research. But there&#39;s also the gun control angle-- that it was intended to shift public opinion to help gun control measures to pass.</p>

Indeed the number of conspirators necessary for any given conspiracy is always exaggerated by people who don&#39;t believe in conspiracies. </p>

<p>Anyway, the money-making aspect of Sandy Hoax was a definite side effect, but not the primary goal. It was a FEMA Capstone event and Obama signed over twenty executive orders involving gun control as a direct result. Also as this video is illustrating it is a sort of social experiment that is still being studied by the perpetrators.</p>

<p>You&#39;re better served looking at the evidence. It may seem unlikely that such a scam is possible, but undeniable after even a modest amount of honest research and critical thinking. Put it this way, I&#39;m not 99.9% sure it was a hoax, that&#39;s too low. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point. I&#39;d imagine that to be for simplicity&#39;s sake.

<p>Or good old Gene Rosen, who reports that a school bus dropped kids off at his house AFTER the shooting and said that the kids were crying that their teacher was just killed. Why were kids on a bus, weren&#39;t they at the firehouse? (just go to YouTube, tons of his videos on there)</p>

<p>There&#39;s tons more... I don&#39;t know what happened, but it was so screwed up (their false flag) and poorly planned, you know SOMETHING was fishy. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what Wolfgang says about this. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true, needs more research. But there&#39;s also the gun control angle-- that it was intended to shift public opinion to help gun control measures to pass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>$$$$$$$. They got a ludicrous sum to rebuild the school, which apparently now has low enrollment trouble, not to mention the countless millions of donations from gullible and shaken Americans. </p>

<p>and each one of these events steers the conversation in the direction the government wants. I can no longer say to a normal person that video games don&#39;t cause violence because they can say Adam Lanza played video games and I am expected to take for granted that Sandy Hook was a real shooting. </p>
