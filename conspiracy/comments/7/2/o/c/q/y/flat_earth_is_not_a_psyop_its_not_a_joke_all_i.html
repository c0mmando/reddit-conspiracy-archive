        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The facts are simple. NASA faked 6 moon landings. The earth has no measurable curvature. The horizon is always flat and rises to eye level. Water always finds its level and has never been shown to curve. There should be no way we can see any of the same stars 6 months apart because our nighttime would be facing 180 degrees in the opposite direction. The moon only casts a 70 mile shadow on the earth even though it is over 2000 miles wide. Shadows never get smaller than the object they come off of. You can call me an idiot. You can call me a moron. But the facts speak for themselves. Research flat earth</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This question will never be answered, just like OP&#39;s post.  Your question begs that the Psyop itself is calling fe-conspiracy a Psyop - as if there was nothing to be gained there would be no cause for a Psyop.  Only answer I have ever heard is something along the lines of that it slanders conspiracy theorists and therefore makes &quot;real&quot; conspiracies less attractive.  That&#39;s pretty weak and sounds exactly like something a Psyopper would say as a Psyop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Demanding evidence is not trying to censor anything.  It&#39;s fair.  It&#39;s a claim that goes completely against what we&#39;ve been told our whole lives.  We&#39;ve been prevented with what we&#39;ve been told is irrefutable science according to such.  </p>

<p>So, when someone comes along against the grain of what we&#39;ve all been told for generations, it&#39;s fair to ask for something meatier than just a shaky hypothesis with no data to back it up.</p>

<p>We want data.  Are you against data?  Are you trying to imply that it&#39;s okay to post stuff without being able to back up what you say?  Do you want a page full of nonsense with nothing to support it?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t.  Most don&#39;t either.  So, asking for data is fair.  We live in a universe with math and science.  Surely SOMEONE has something with more substance than they vague attempt at a theory posted by OP.</p>

<p>Lookup videos on YouTube of <em>TheMorgile</em> and. <em>Jeranism</em>. FlatEarthAsshole is very funny though a bit less scientific he has good debunks of famous scientists.
There is also a 24h livestream of flat earth stuff,  oddtv I think is the channel name.  These channels have hundreds of thousands of subscribers,  this is picking up traction over the years.  Avoid the flatearthsociety it is a government operated pay-op</p>

<p>Keep an open mind,  remember the masses (including me) were all brainwashed from that first day inkindergarten when we saw the globe on our teacher&#39;s desk. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are sincere here&#39;s a simple test you can do:</p>

<p>Put your car so your headlights shine on a flat surface at night maybe 20 or thirty feet away. Turn on your headlights. Cover one of the headlights with a towel or shirt or something. Stand in front of the uncovered light. It makes a complete shadow. Now put your fist in front of the light. Now move your fist away from the light up to the surface while watching it&#39;s shadow. Now put your finger in front of the light. Watch the shadow as you move your finger away from the light up to the flat surface.</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s pretty easy to do to see how shadows work. This simple experiment proves the fallacy of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon only casts a 70 mile shadow on the earth even though it is over 2000 miles wide. Shadows never get smaller than the object they come off of.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore henceforth you all need to stop using this statement in your arguments.</p>

<p>Do you agree to stop using this argument? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Because of the vast, VAST, differences in size of the Moon and the Sun, it totally makes sense that the shadow of the moon would be smaller than the actual moon. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s use a rough example of headlight, but instead of a fist we&#39;re using a peanut for the Earth and a Pea for the Moon (remember, we&#39;re talking Moon being smaller than Sun by 400x). The headlight is so much wider than the pea that instead of light only coming perpendicular to the circumference of the pea, it&#39;s actually at a very acute angle. Thus, the shadow is smaller than the actual moon. </p>

<p>If you are sincere here&#39;s a simple test you can do:</p>

<p>Put your car so your headlights shine on a flat surface at night maybe 20 or thirty feet away. Turn on your headlights. Cover one of the headlights with a towel or shirt or something. Stand in front of the uncovered light. It makes a complete shadow. Now put your fist in front of the light. Now move your fist away from the light up to the surface while watching it&#39;s shadow. Now put your finger in front of the light. Watch the shadow as you move your finger away from the light up to the flat surface.</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s pretty easy to do to see how shadows work. This simple experiment proves the fallacy of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon only casts a 70 mile shadow on the earth even though it is over 2000 miles wide. Shadows never get smaller than the object they come off of.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore henceforth you all need to stop using this statement in your arguments.</p>

<p>Do you agree to stop using this argument? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I&#39;ll respond to one of OP&#39;s points. The one being that the horizon rises to &quot;eye level&quot; claim.</p>

<p>Put simply, it&#39;s a lie. You can measure the drop of the horizon using a theodolite. An example being <a href="http://m.imgur.com/iB89TnJ">here</a>, or from a stabilized drone like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXdDXou4XXM">here.</a> Another one being from a plane like <a href="http://m.imgur.com/cBrTtzR">here.</a></p>

<p>If you, for some reason, don&#39;t trust theodolites then there are other proofs. Such as both the Moon and the horizon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ha6PeAVLpNo">being below the eye level of an obersver in a plane.</a> Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFj7gNh3yOM">another one.</a></p>

<p>The only &quot;proof&quot; that I&#39;ve seen that the horizon rises to eye level are by those who go for the &quot;feels over reals&quot; route. Without a frame of reference, your eyes won&#39;t be able to tell if it drops or not so use a theodolite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good comment.  Taking the advocate position, I could think of some things to bounce back off of that.  Not trusting the theodolite as you mentioned, for whatever reason.  And for the guy who used his electronics, he had to way to measure that the angle of the wingtip itself - his relative point of reference, remained exactly consistent through all altitudes.</p>

<p>More than 17 times. You will not address that obvious proof that the statement is false.</p>

<p>What happens is your fist&#39;s shadow will be big at first, but at a certain small distance from the surface a second much darker shadow will appear, much smaller than your fist. At first a very small sliver then becomes the same size of your fist as you almost reach the surface.</p>

<p>If you are sincere you will do this experiment and see for yourself.</p>

<p>Look at this <a href="https://c.tadst.com/gfx/750x500/total-solar-eclipse-com.png?1">image</a>.</p>

<p>Now imagine moving the moon closer to the earth. The dark shadow gets bigger.
Now imagine moving the moon farther from the Earth. The dark shadow becomes smaller.</p>

<p>You can figure this out, it really is simple.</p>

<p>This is absolute undeniable proof if you do the experiment.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t do the experiment you are being disingenuous.</p>

<p>also worth considering - is that sometimes the very act of discussion itself, the journey, is more important than determining who is right or wrong at the destination.  be mindful of the process - that we are all humans - do not forget to travel well.</p>

<p>But will you answer a direct question?</p>

<p>Do you agree that the moon can cast a shadow on the Erth that is smaller than the moon?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I understand - Maybe there is a problem with language here where one is using the generic word &quot;shadow&quot; when the discussion requires a distinction between the umbra and penumbra as shadow.</p>

<p>The penumbra shadow of an object should be at least the same as or bigger than it&#39;s object, assuming straight trajectory of light - even in motion from light source it would only fade in intensity but not size.  But the penumbra shadow would always be smaller than it&#39;s object - and increases or decreases in size with the motion from light source.</p>

<p>There is also the extra variable of gravity itself warping light around an object - in astronomy this can happen so severely that one can see &quot;through&quot; objects to the light source behind them, or even see an illusion of two light sources where there is only one.</p>

<p>So ... you&#39;re both right - in a certain way of looking at it.  What do you think about that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are sincere here&#39;s a simple test you can do:</p>

<p>Put your car so your headlights shine on a flat surface at night maybe 20 or thirty feet away. Turn on your headlights. Cover one of the headlights with a towel or shirt or something. Stand in front of the uncovered light. It makes a complete shadow. Now put your fist in front of the light. Now move your fist away from the light up to the surface while watching it&#39;s shadow.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I totally get that.  But it&#39;s like the freedom of speech thing designed to protect the worst speech.  I don&#39;t think it is morally correct to participate in the flying-monkey zerg at the fe&#39;r.  It is good to see if they have things to say about it though - and not to assume you can heard it all before, etc.  Everyone is different and really at the end of the day people don&#39;t want to be ostracized from their &quot;tribe&quot; - they probably already feel alienated on many levels, in real life.  Gotta have that compassion and understanding even for the fool on the hill.  Hear him out.  There is beauty in ugly things too.  It&#39;s about perception.  I would take 1,000 fe&#39;rs in this sub, if they were respectful, resourceful - participated in good faith, over 10,000 partisan political-hacks who are here but really aren&#39;t interested in conspiracies.  The fe&#39;er is more than likely going to be a more interesting person in general to talk to, and is more likely to have bleed-over into other conspiracies or have an open-mind to them.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;During the naval engagement near the Falkland Islands which occurred early in World War I, the British gunners were surprised to see their accurately aimed salvos falling 100 yards to the left of the German ships. The designers of the sighting mechanisms were well aware of the Coriolis deflection and had carefully taken this into account, but they apparently were under the impression that all sea battles took place near 50 degrees N latitude and never near 50 degrees S latitude. The British shots, therefore, fell at a distance from the targets equal to twice the Coriolis deflection.&quot; (Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems, Second Edition — by Jerry B. Marion, Academic Press, Inc., 1970, p.346 fn.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>**I heard an account of the battle of the Falkland Islands (early in the 1914 war) from an officer who was there. The German ships were destroyed at extreme range, but it took a long time and salvos were continually falling 100 yards to the left. The effect of the rotation of the earth is similar to &#39; drift &#39; and was similarly incorporated in the gun-sights. But this involved the tacit assumption that Naval battles take place round about latitude 50 N. The double difference for 50 S. and extreme range is of the order of 100 yards.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are sincere here&#39;s a simple test you can do:</p>

<p>Put your car so your headlights shine on a flat surface at night maybe 20 or thirty feet away. Turn on your headlights. Cover one of the headlights with a towel or shirt or something. Stand in front of the uncovered light. It makes a complete shadow. Now put your fist in front of the light. Now move your fist away from the light up to the surface while watching it&#39;s shadow. Now put your finger in front of the light. Watch the shadow as you move your finger away from the light up to the flat surface.</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s pretty easy to do to see how shadows work. This simple experiment proves the fallacy of:</p>

<p>The moon only casts a 70 mile shadow on the earth even though it is over 2000 miles wide. Shadows never get smaller than the object they come off of.  </p>

OP cant say his beliefs are fact without providing some proof. I saw your erroneous demands for refutation, and conceded by providing it via a single link that covers his proposed opinions and it is scientifically sound and sourced. If you choose not to view it, then we can assume you aren&#39;t interested in any discussion, you&#39;re simply attacking. Demanding opposing viewpoints are only acceptable if they are original thoughts and not based on the preponderance of already gathered and condensed fact is ludicrous. Especially considering you have provided nothing to the post. It&#39;s curious why you are so adamant demanding everyone to meet your specific demands, but don&#39;t  request the OP to at least provide sources. Apparently you pushed my buttons enough to give further concessions, so here you go:</p>

<p>(1) The Moon
The moon provides a 70 mile wide shadow during an eclipse, because it is 240k miles away from Earth and because the sun is much larger than the moon, the outer Ray&#39;s if the sun hits the moon at an angle, which reduces the diameter of the shadow of the moon on the earth <a href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/sites/default/files/SolarEclipse.jpg">https://www.exploratorium.edu/sites/default/files/SolarEclipse.jpg</a>. Notice that eclipses are not viewable everywhere on the Earth, because it is a spheroid. If it were flat, we&#39;d all see the &quot;moon shadow&quot; during an eclipse.</p>

<p>Since the earth is rotating (see the “Foucault Pendulum” experiment for a definite proof, if you are doubtful <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault_pendulum</a>), the consistent oval-shadow it produces in each and every lunar eclipse proves that the earth is not only round but spherical – absolutely, utterly, beyond a shadow of a doubt not flat.</p>

<p>(2) Horizon
Visual- Approaching ships do not just “appear” out of the horizon (like they should have if the world was flat), but rather emerge from beneath the sea.</p>

<p>But – you say – ships do not submerge and rise up again as they approach our view. The reason ships appear as if they “emerge from the waves” is because the world is not flat: it’s round.</p>

<p>Imagine an ant walking along the surface of an orange, into your field of view. If you look at the orange “head on”, you will see the ant’s body slowly rising up from the “horizon”, because of the curvature of the Orange. If you would do that experiment with a long road, the effect would have changed: The ant would have slowly ‘materialized’ into view, depending on how sharp your vision is.</p>

<p>How to calculate ground distance to the horizon: d = R cos-1(R/(R+h))</p>

<p>d = distance to horizon
R = radius of earth
h = height above the earth</p>

<p>The horizon does not rise to eye level, you have to tilt your head. But it&#39;s relatively close, which  I is why we perceive it does. Here&#39;salculation to determine head tilt:tilt downward = d/R
* answer given in radians. to get degrees, multiply by 180/pi. Using a cruising altitude of 45,000 feet, the tilt downward to the horizon would be 3.7 degrees. There&#39;s also refraction to contend with...

<p>(3) Varying Star Constellations
This observation was originally made by Aristotle (384-322 BCE), who declared the Earth was round judging from the different constellations one sees in different parts of the world.  Aristotle noted that “there are stars seen in Egypt and […] Cyprus which are not seen in the northerly regions.” This phenomenon can only be explained with a round surface, and Aristotle continued and claimed that the sphere of the Earth is “of no great size, for otherwise the effect of so slight a change of place would not be quickly apparent.” (De caelo, 298a2-10)
<a href="http://www.smarterthanthat.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/fieldofview12.jpg">http://www.smarterthanthat.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/fieldofview12.jpg</a></p>

<p>The farther you go from the equator, the farther the ‘known’ constellations go towards the horizon, and are replaced by different stars. This would not have happened if the world was flat:

<p>(4) Shadows
If you stick a stick in the ground, it will produce a shadow. The shadow moves as time passes (which is the principle for ancient Shadow Clocks). If the world had been flat, then two sticks in different locations would produce the same shadow. But they don’t. This is because the earth is round, and not flat.</p>

<p>Eratosthenes (276-194 BCE) used this principle to calculate the circumference of the Earth quite accurately.</p>

<p>(5) Look at Other Planets
Why are all other planets, which are observable via a telescope spheroid but not Earth? We know that because we see different sides of them through time (example Jupiter, Mars). We also see the equatorial bulges of the larger gas planets, which goes back to our understandings of spin and gravity.

<p>(6) Images from space
I believe we have satellites, since they are observable via naked eye and telescopes and I&#39;ve used them for cable back in the day and for GPS. Since satellites probably won&#39;t be accepted, how about unmanned rockets. Here’s a list of some of the pictures we’ve seen from space throughout the years:</p>

<p>October 24, 1946: A group of scientists in the New Mexico desert saw the first grainy photo of the Earth. The photograph was taken from a height of 65 miles (104.6 kilometers) by a 35-millimeter motion picture camera riding on a V-2 missile. <a href="http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/FEATURE-FirstPhoto.html">http://www.airspacemag.com/space-exploration/FEATURE-FirstPhoto.html</a></p>

<p>August 14, 1959: First crude photo of the Earth from the Explorer VI satellite. The photo showed a sun-lit area of the Pacific ocean and cloud coverage. It was taken from about 17,000 miles (27,350 kilometers) above the surface. <a href="http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2002-000200.html">http://grin.hq.nasa.gov/ABSTRACTS/GPN-2002-000200.html</a></p>

<p>(7) Water and curvature
Water finds a level due to gravity. Although one could point to a miniscus to show water does curve. Water follows the curvature of the earth due to the same gravity principles, it&#39;s pulled toward the approximate center of Earth. The curvature of Earth is gradual, you don&#39;t feel it, so water seems &quot;flat&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, Foucault&#39;s pendulum is a complete myth. According to science the earth and atmosphere are spinning together, so it would be impossible for a pendulum to move because the building would be spinning as well. Foucaults pendulums around the world move at completely random speeds and some even move in the wrong direction. Your explained about the shadows and sticks doesnt prove anything. If the sun is moving and the eartg is motionless then it would also cause the shadows to be different. And last but not least please go look at that picture taken by the V2 rocket in 1946. The picture doesnt show any curvature!!! Its flat</p>

However, if I post &quot;JFK was assassinated by aliens. There was no gun, it was lasers. Jackie was a lizard, because women don&#39;t exist. Go research it yourself.&quot; I expect people to come and refute what I say, others ask for some level of insight into where my claims are coming from, some providing a link to a source that refutes my claims and others who provide scientific explanations with sources of why I&#39;m incorrect. The whole purpose is to discuss. OP didn&#39;t reply to anyone for over 4 hours, has not provided any form of sources or data behind all of their claims and doesn&#39;t propose an idea he states it&#39;s all fact. If my original reply with a link backing up inconsistencies in OPs hypotheses didn&#39;t suffice for you, fine. But OP never responded and it&#39;s his thread not yours. He can tell me what he would like to see for additional discussion, I&#39;m not sure what value you are adding.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough, and I have enjoyed the spirit and content of your replies - and see where you are coming from. His post would have been higher quality if he had not just listed the statements, but provided evidence.  This made the onus of the presentation of his own evidence for his statements to fall on us.  Your liberty is also important, and the liberty of truth itself - to be sure.  I imagine it almost feels a waste - to put that effort into a non-reply.  He mentioned dinner, maybe he fell asleep.  At least you are having fun - you have definitely made me laugh.  Good job contributing, regardless - for what it&#39;s worth at least myself and others have seen and appreciated your replies.  Think of it from my side too, sticking my neck out - i&#39;m already one of the most targetted individuals at tmor - no doubt they were watching every thing i said under a microscope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From your 2nd article: &quot;In other words, even when we feel stuck ‘emotionally’, there is always a biochemical potential for change and possible growth. When we choose to change our thoughts (bursts of neurochemicals!), we become open and receptive to other pieces of sensory information hitherto blocked by our beliefs! When we change our thinking, we change our beliefs. When we change our beliefs, we change our behavior.&quot; Seems that logic and reasoning could be sensory information that cause one to be open to change beliefs.</p>

<p>Them there&#39;s this in your article: &quot;Now it is clear that biology and physiology of belief is an open area for research both at basic and clinical level. The future directions are to develop validated experimental or sound theoretical interpretation to make ‘BELIEF’ as a potential clinical management tool.&quot;</p>

<p>Or this from <a href="http://www.kavlifoundation.org/science-spotlights/neuroscience-of-decision-making">http://www.kavlifoundation.org/science-spotlights/neuroscience-of-decision-making</a>
&quot;But a decision involves many processes--you need to accumulate evidence for or against different choice options, evaluate their possible outcomes and risks, suppress certain learned responses and biases, etc. So when you are interested in decision making, you cannot avoid looking at how the different parts of the brain do different computations in a coordinated way.&quot;</p>

<p>Ultimately, let&#39;s just go with my &quot;beliefs&quot; cause me to request an explanation for your random comment to me. I&#39;m confused on your claims way back at the beginning of this sidetracking &quot;conversation&quot; we are now in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are sincere here&#39;s a simple test you can do:</p>

<p>Put your car so your headlights shine on a flat surface at night maybe 20 or thirty feet away. Turn on your headlights. Cover one of the headlights with a towel or shirt or something. Stand in front of the uncovered light. It makes a complete shadow. Now put your fist in front of the light. Now move your fist away from the light up to the surface while watching it&#39;s shadow. Now put your finger in front of the light. Watch the shadow as you move your finger away from the light up to the flat surface.</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s pretty easy to do to see how shadows work. This simple experiment proves the fallacy of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon only casts a 70 mile shadow on the earth even though it is over 2000 miles wide. Shadows never get smaller than the object they come off of.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a big difference between asking a question and an accusation. </p>

<p>If you are sincere here&#39;s a simple test you can do:</p>

<p>Put your car so your headlights shine on a flat surface at night maybe 20 or thirty feet away. Turn on your headlights. Cover one of the headlights with a towel or shirt or something. Stand in front of the uncovered light. It makes a complete shadow. Now put your fist in front of the light. Now move your fist away from the light while watching it&#39;s shadow. Now put your finger in front of the light. Warch the shadow as you move your finger away from the light.</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s pretty easy to do to see how shadows work. This simple experiment proves the fallacy of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon only casts a 70 mile shadow on the earth even though it is over 2000 miles wide. Shadows never get smaller than the object they come off of.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore henceforth you all need to stop using this statement in your arguments.</p>

<p>Do you agree to stop using this argument? </p>

<p>What happens is your fist&#39;s shadow will be big at first, but at a certain small distance from the surface a second much darker shadow will appear, much smaller than your fist. At first a very small sliver then becomes the same size of your fist as you almost reach the surface. </p>

<p>If you are sincere you will do this experiment and see for yourself. </p>

<p>NASA fakes all their images. No one has ever been to space. Go check out the astroNOTS on the ISS. They are using harnesses and a greenscreen. You cant see forever due to perspective, any artist would tell ypu this. Everything converges at your horizon. The moon phases are most likely caused by the sun. But the sun is not 93 million miles away</p>

<p>As for perspective, that doesn&#39;t work in this case because the Rockies stretch the entire continent. If the the Earth were flat you would be able to see them for hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>All the flat earth theories I have seen say the moon and sun are disks or spot lights. In which case the moon would have no reason to have phases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was onto this for a good while.  TheMorgile and Jeranism are 2 good YouTube channels for the topic.</p>

<p>My conclusion - who,  why,  when?</p>

<p>These are the basic steps that took me way down the rabbit hole. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I started being curious as to why ALL astronauts on apollo missions are freemasons,  and them doing weird masonic rictuals on the &quot;moon&quot; or wherever the fuck they filmed the landing scenes. </p></li>
<li><p>Read up on the flaws of Heliocentrism.  My mind was blown when I read on Nicolas Tesla and other scientists,  Mach, Poincaré who denounced Einstein as being a clown with far-fetched theories that have as much value to explain the universe as a fairy tale. </p></li>
<li><p>Realised the globe earth is needed to have us go around the sun.  The debate (geocentrism vs Heliocentrism) has been ongoing for thousands of years. </p></li>
<li><p>Discovered the main founders of Heliocentrism (Kepler Copernic Galileo, Newton) are all Jesuits or trained by Jesuits. </p></li>
<li><p>Came to learn Jesuits = Freemasonry,   when it gets to the higher levels. </p></li>
<li><p>To this day I am learning and reading on the Jesuits,  one of the most (if not THE most powerful) organization on earth.  Their agenda is global power,  founded on deception. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>They are the key to this entire worldwide scam.  They were responsable for the education in past centuries and thus the globe model was pushed in classrooms all over the Christian world, centuries before NASA  was founded.  Freemasons founded. NASA and this turned out to be their way of shutting down any further debate:  that fake ad ass Big BLUE picture sealed the deal and shut up practically all sheeples.  </p>

<p>You could spend a lifetime of research just on this topic. It sounds real crazy the way I explain it, but look into the Jesuits and Heliocentrism and their influence on education -  they are the reason  people believe they are on a ball. </p>

<p>Kudos to you for asking questions,  be ready to be ridiculed and shamed wherever you bring up this topic. </p>

<p>Cheers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, not fish eye, just a series of mirrors that provides amplification like binoculars. On the class of ship I was on when you look through the scope it&#39;s either going to be at a 1.5x or 6x zoom. Regardless if you are looking in low or high power, the distance to the horizon will be the same. The Height of Eye, based on the boats depth, will determine the maximum effective range we can can see. Interesting concept of light bending, but our view is obscured by the actual curvature of the planet. The only way we can see beyond that maximum distance is there is something beyond that but is huge like a cargo ship or cruise liner, we will see that pop up over the horizon line, so that rules out the light bending. We only count the contact being at the horizon when we can see the waterline of the ship. There are formulas and a set rule to give us horizon line distance but if we were to have radar or AIS contact on the target we can see these ranges outside of the contact beyond that. </p>

<p>The earth has no measurable curvature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then why do surveyors working over long distances <a href="http://www.aboutcivil.org/curvature-and-refraction.html">have to account for it?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Water always finds its level and has never been shown to curve. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Yule_Oldham">Henry Yule Oldham</a> measured the curvature of a supposedly flat body of water in 1901</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There should be no way we can see any of the same stars 6 months apart because our nighttime would be facing 180 degrees in the opposite direction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey OP,  the flat earth truth is spreading like wildfire thanks to people like you and me. I just made a post about flat earth and I got tons of hate for it. </p>

<p>All truth passes through three stages. First it&#39;s ridiculed, second it&#39;s violently opposed, and third it&#39;s accepted as being self evident. </p>

<p>Flat earth is the truth, it is the revelation that will break the matrix and unite the masses. More and more people are waking up everyday. </p>

<p>The Jesuits, Freemasons, and Jews who manipulate the masses are getting scared. They have controlled opposition in every corner of the internet and everywhere in the world. </p>

<p>I suggest you keep spreading the word, OP. 
I talk about flat earth with my professors, my peers, my colleagues, and my family. I&#39;m always trying to open there minds of the brainwashed masses. </p>

<p>Most people are scared of being perceived as unintelligent or gullible; they don&#39;t want to be judged or ridiculed by society and they&#39;d rather blend in with the rest of the sheep. </p>

<p>Soon more flat earth advocates will start obtaining advanced degree and the heliocentric system will come crumbling down. We just need more flat earth advocates at the university level! </p>

<p>Anyway! I respect what you&#39;re doing OP. Keep it up :) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Because of the vast, VAST, differences in size of the Moon and the Sun, it totally makes sense that the shadow of the moon would be smaller than the actual moon. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s use a rough example of headlight, but instead of a fist we&#39;re using a peanut for the Earth and a Pea for the Moon (remember, we&#39;re talking Moon being smaller than Sun by 400x). The headlight is so much wider than the pea that instead of light only coming perpendicular to the circumference of the pea, it&#39;s actually at a very acute angle. Thus, the shadow is smaller than the actual moon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are sincere here&#39;s a simple test you can do:</p>

<p>Put your car so your headlights shine on a flat surface at night maybe 20 or thirty feet away. Turn on your headlights. Cover one of the headlights with a towel or shirt or something. Stand in front of the uncovered light. It makes a complete shadow. Now put your fist in front of the light. Now move your fist away from the light up to the surface while watching it&#39;s shadow. Now put your finger in front of the light. Watch the shadow as you move your finger away from the light up to the flat surface.</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s pretty easy to do to see how shadows work. This simple experiment proves the fallacy of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The moon only casts a 70 mile shadow on the earth even though it is over 2000 miles wide. Shadows never get smaller than the object they come off of.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore henceforth you all need to stop using this statement in your arguments.</p>

<p>Do you agree to stop using this argument? </p>
