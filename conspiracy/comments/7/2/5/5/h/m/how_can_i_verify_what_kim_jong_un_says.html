       I constantly read headlines reading how Trump and Kim call each other names in what seems to be a rap-battle contest of sorts between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see videos of Trump saying what I can read on those headlines, but I can never seem to find Kim ever saying anything. No videos, no related pictures... I only get a picture of Kim looking at things in every such articles, like this one here:

        Kim looking at things
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So how can I know whatever Kim says was actually said by him or, even further than that, that it was said at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for your help beforehand.

       First you need to learn Korean and then watch the North Korean State Media. You are at the mercy of the translator telling you what Kim says unless you know the language yourself.

       If one news outlet translates his messages wrong, I would be fairly certain another news agency would correct them. Unless you believe every news agency in the world are working together to mislead everyone. I check r/northkoreanews occasionally to see international news reports, and some of the users there are from the region and speak Korean.

       I'm not the one that implied that the translator would be mis-translating. That was OP.

       I'm simply saying that you rarely see Kim making a public speech. You're at the mercy of what the state news says, regardless of translation.

       You can set up a large satellite dish to watch KCTV from Intelsat 21 or Thaicom 5, depending on if you're in the east or west hemisphere. It'd be an investment however and you'd still only see their propaganda in Korean. Even then you'll only know what North Korea wants you to know, you won't find candid footage of KJU speaking anywhere.

       By asking this very question, you're ahead of 99% of the world population in critical thinking. Most people (not CTers obviously) just take (((their))) word for it.

       a really honest question considering recent statements that seem to fall on deaf ears, I'd sure like to know....
      </p>
      <p>
       (quote)
"Dear President Trump, world leaders, and peoples of the world:
      </p>
      <p>
       Much has been said and written about myself, the Democratic Republic of Korea, and threats to the world. Insults about myself, I can let slide. My primary concern and responsibility is the safety and well-being of the people of the DPRK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me make crystal clear that what DPRK seeks is peace. The DPRK considers this an imminently reasonable request, a request that is in line with being a non-threatening, peace-loving nation. Yet the United States refuses this request. Why? Why is the DPRK construed as a threat when it asks for a peace treaty? How should the DPRK view the US refusal of such an overture?
      </p>
      <p>
       The DPRK is led to conclude that given the fact that the US desires to maintain a state of war, given that the US continues to conduct war maneuvers with “decapitation” as a goal, given that the US is nuclear armed and has used nuclear weapons, given that the US refuses its obligations as outlined under Article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to “undertake to pursue good-faith negotiations on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race, to nuclear disarmament, and to general and complete disarmament,” given the destruction the US has historically wreaked on the DPRK (although the DPRK has never attacked the US), given that the US destroyed fundamentally disarmed states such as Iraq and Libya in which the leaders were executed in macabre fashion, and given that the US split the Korean peninsula … then the only prudent action the DPRK could take is to provide itself with a deterrent for the protection of the Korean populace.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the solemn duty of any responsible government and any responsible leader anywhere. It is one I must not shirk from.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DPRK does not seek confrontation with the US or with the American people. The DPRK seeks peace. Therefore, I call upon president Trump to enter a fair, respectful, good-faith dialogue committed to the establishment of peaceful relations between the DPRK and the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also implore our brothers and sisters in the Republic of Korea to help defuse tensions. Should the US government insist on maintaining a state of war, then there is no reason why Koreans should be pitted against Koreans. We must never again fight each other. We sincerely call upon our brothers and sisters in the ROK to deescalate tensions and enter into a new era of peaceful cooperation and prosperity.
      </p>
      <p>
       A faithful servant of the people of the Democratic Republic of Korea,
      </p>
      <p>
       Kim Jong-un"

       I'm not the one that implied that the translator would be mis-translating. That was OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm simply saying that you rarely see Kim making a public speech. You're at the mercy of what the state news says, regardless of translation.
