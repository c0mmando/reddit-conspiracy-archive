       We were in the process of reviewing a Standard Terms and Conditions (contract) for applying to be granted public (government) work as a professional providing architectural/engineering services via a local city here in Texas.  And on the last page (22) of this contract, it asks that we sign this one page that we will "not boycott Israel"
We were left a little confused as to why we were asked do this for such a small city here in Texas.  But it turns out that this is a state wide request for any supplier applying for public work.
Upon further research we come across wikipedia's link regarding this matter.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_for_Prevention_of_Damage_to_State_of_Israel_through_Boycott">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_for_Prevention_of_Damage_to_State_of_Israel_through_Boycott
       </a>
       <br/>
       As it's normally the case, wikipedia only provides the topical information.  Which automatically leads me to this subreddit even though this law was passed back in 2011.
I know there's a lot of news regarding Israel and a lot of theories regarding the connections of Israel and other countries than what the media and news release.  But this law just further makes me want to believe that we are truly not being told exactly what it is that Israel has over us to not express our freedom of expression towards them should we feel it be appropriate.  As a small company relying on public-work to get work/paid and being asked to sign this page makes me feel that Israel already has some power over me whether I like it or not.  I almost feel forced to sign it to keep my work going but at the same time feeling like I'm agreeing to something much more sinister.
       <br/>
       Any insight from outside the box would be highly appreciated as I usually find it while browsing this subreddit.

       "In a society of lies the truth is the enemy of the state." - George Orwell 1984
      </p>
      <p>
       These laws only end up drawing more attention to things they would rather keep hidden. When they create a martyr out of a skeptic it just makes people question things even more. Lies backed up by the violence of the state never lasts the test of time. It is purely metaphysical. No amount violence can ever make a lie true and no amount of violence can even turn the truth false.
      </p>
      <p>
       She questioned the Holocaust but I question how can Germany call itself a civilized country when they throw little old ladies in prison for thought crimes. Democracy functions on the free flow and exchange of ideas so that the truth may stand in the light. If what she says is little more than lies then debunk her and be done with it. But if what Ursula proclaims is as true as any fact in existence then it really exposes the state of the world we live in when the ruling class overplays their hand like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know that you live under a tyrannical regime if the mere opening of your month can send you to prison for years. This was no slap on the wrist. Usula Haverbeck will likely die in prison unless justice is restored and she is set free.

       This is proof that our reality is manipulated and controlled according to 'their' agenda(s). They want Germans and rest of the world to stay and drown in Holohoax guilt.

       They would not be able to get away with what they do presently if they did not control past narratives. For over 70 years all they have had to do to silence their opposition is blow the antisemitism dog whistle and call those who opposed their plans Nazis. Don't like bankers controlling the world and printing money out of thin air well then you must be an antisemite. Hitler also complained about international bankers so you must also be a Nazi. Don't like your nation being flooded with immigrants well that is "wrong think" that could lead to the next holocaust. Thus the opposition falls into line or else is marginalized to the fringes of society branded as a Jew hater.

       Yes, you are free to criticize anyone you want, but if your "criticism" includes support of any kind of boycott against Israel, you will be legally BARRED from doing business with any government entity in the State of Texas:

      <p>
       (JTA) —
       <strong>
        Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill banning state entities from dealing with businesses that boycott Israel or its settlements.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Abbott signed the bill on Tuesday, which was Israel Independence Day, at the Jewish Community Center of Austin.
      </p>
      <p>
       “You can always count on Texas,” Abbott said at the signing ceremony.
       <strong>
        “Any anti-Israel policy is an anti-Texas policy. Texas is not going to do business with any company that boycotts Israel.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       “I am proud to have commemorated Israel’s Independence Day by signing into law anti-BDS legislation in Texas.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Texas becomes the 20th state with laws or executive orders banning state business with companies that support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, or BDS, against Israel.

       Indeed, such laws are antithetical to the Constitution in general and to the First Amendment in particular.
       <strong>
        PROBLEM
       </strong>
       : The Constitution is little more than a museum piece.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US Government  - Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches - effectively

       How the hell could someone not like a Zappa song?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the talk of the constitution, I do agree to a point.  I think the people could prevent further erosion/destruction if they could be mobilized, but there are so many well trained people focusing on making sure there are as many artificial divisions as possible so any citizen group effort will always be opposed by another citizen group effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       This law seems to have gotten harsh criticism from a variety of sources, and for very good reason as I think we both agree.  I think I did read there were people planning on challenging it, which I hoped had already happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the quote from Strom.  I just think it's stupid and kind of ironic that it would be used in a sub dedicated to questioning and criticizing Soros, Trump, Clinton, Kochs, Rockefellers, Rothschilds, the TPTB in general, and pretty much everyone else including other commenters and the mod team here.  That will be the last I will say about it, as I'm sure you're tired of hearing my opinion on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually don't know how they'd enforce the law, and I don't think that just because someone signed an agreement in a contract it validates it if the agreement is unconstitutional.  I just really want to see it challenged if it hasn't already been.

       I have nothing against Jewish people (assuming your comment is towards me).  It's more about the specific law revolving around Israel and my freedom to express any boycott I please.  Especially if I'm designing a building that's for citizens of the country I live in.

       Well the language he is using is literally the Jewish word for us non-Jewish. "Goyim" or "goy" . Look up how the Talmud instructs Jewish people to treat goy, and you may start to find out why they feel they can impose these types of laws upon us.

       Be careful with using “they” when it comes to Jewish people. Jews don’t all refer to non-Jews as goys, and most of them are not Zionists. There are many Jews out there who are not religious at all.

       Yes I've run into this issue many times, zionists vs the other jews and have been mindful to tip toe around it.. But there's always a well a "you" who is quick to remind me of this fact, so quickly I might add...  I have to ask if there really is a silent majority of jews that are against zionists?  Because I really don't see it. Maybe during the creation of Israel we seen some members of the community oppose it but not so much anymore. Thus I don't think it's worthwhile to distinguish the two groups anymore. you never hear of the anti zionists or jews for giving Palestine back their land.. nah never..

       The law you linked applies only in Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
       The law passed in Texas is
       <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlodocs/85R/billtext/html/HB00089F.htm">
        here
       </a>

        in this news article
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Strictly speaking, it doesn't make boycotting Israel illegal, it only prohibits the state from contracting with or investing in companies that boycott Israel. The law may still be unconstitutional.

       You could refuse to sign it and take them to court to defend the principle of the first amendment. Contact your state or national ACLU and see if they might want to get involved. They are already on the record as being against legislation like this at the federal level, maybe they will take on as a legal case at your state.

       BDS is all about separating the 'goats' from the 'sheep'.

       Some Jews will embrace it and support the very moral concept of equal rights for all people. Other Jews will fight against it to their last breath in support of their own erroneous perception of Jewish supremacism.

       I think it would be possible to convict, if the person is candid enough to have admitted the reason of their choice. In many countries they do convict people for other kinds "discrimination" (although astonishingly enough I've never heard of a Chinese restaurant owner being convicted for hiring Chinese-looking waiters only).

       They get around that by making knowing Chinese a condition of working at those places. To be fair, if they can't communicate with the cooks or many of the customers, they probably shouldn't be working there

       In my experience they hire "Chinese-looking" waiters, which can be any person of Asian descent. Not that I think they're anything wrong with that of course, they should be absolutely free to do it. Also I've never seen a Pizzaiolo of African descent. Also the vast majority of women who consult a sperm bank choose donors that match their own ethnic background. Are most women racist? Of course not... The list goes on and on ...

       Discrimination, according to the new marxist definition, is another word for choice. As in, I'm "discriminating" winemakers from Bordeaux if I tend to prefer buying bottles in Bourgogne. It's quite ridiculous. Every individual choice entails discrimination by definition.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the proper sense discrimination means
       <em>
        dicrimination by the State
       </em>
       . Similarly "equality" means (or should / used to mean)
       <em>
        equality before the law
       </em>
       .

       No.  That's not the point of this type of law.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's aimed at a sovereignty issue.  In the past, some Middle East countries passed some ordinances aimed at preventing companies from foreign countries from doing business with domestic firms if they also did business with Israel et al.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US and other countries responded by making it illegal for firms to comply with that ruling.  This provided those firms with legal cover to negotiate with their hosts in order to continue transacting with them as well as to remain competitive with firms that would comply with the trade restrictions.

       I dunno what it is, but there's some random law that has been on the books since the 70s that allows for like 10 or 20 years prison for protesting specifically Israel. I was listening to a town hall meeting and a college student was calling out a MD senator for it.

       The senator said it has never been used and he doesn't expect to have to use it.

       The US government throws everything into contracts. But I doubt the federal government wants to enforce an anti boycotting law. If it's in the contracts, they don't need to enforce it as a law.

       Ok, so I actually read the Wikipedia page and , it turns out this is an Israeli law that only applys to Israel. So, if what you're saying is true (which I highly doubt)  It's probably an old federal law from the Yom Kippur War that Isn't actually enforced anymore.

       I love how you comment on things, pressing your pro-Palestinian, pro-Sharia agenda...without reading the required info beforehand...
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, if you look at the imgur link (which you didn't), you'd realize this is a "nothing burger". Why? Because there's a clause that says you
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       terminate business with an Israeli company, if it's a normal part of business proceedings! The clause specifically states that what is illegal is the usage of a boycott to essentially have a "hidden hand" (aka insider trading).

       I'm not seeing "exactly Economic Terrorism" in that picture.  Economic harm, yes, but not terrorism.  I'm sure if they meant terrorism they'd probably have said it.  I'm also curious what the exact text is that you're referring to that specifically states hidden hands or insider trading, or the exact text that implies what you're claiming.

       economic terrorism is terrorism that is economic.

       terrorism is any action that seeks to politically disrupt / undermine rule of law.

       economic terrorism is still terrorism.

       "economic" is being used here as a verb

       the type of terrorism. English 101.

        Contrary to "economic warfare" which is undertaken by states against other states,
        <strong>
         "economic terrorism" would be undertaken by transnational or non-state actors
        </strong>
        . This could entail varied, coordinated and sophisticated or massive destabilizing actions in order to disrupt the economic and financial stability of a state, a group of states or a society (such as market oriented western societies or economies) or a trading exchange for ideological, monetary or religious motives.
       </p>
       <p>
        These actions, if undertaken, may be violent or not. They could have either immediate effects or carry psychological effects which in turn have economic consequences.

      <p>
       Contrast that with the clause in OP's contract:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) "Boycott Israel" means refusing to do deal with, terminating business activities with,
       <strong>
        or otherwise taking any action that is intended to penalize, inflict economic harm on, or limit commercial relations specifically with Israel
       </strong>
       , or with a person or entity doing business with Israel, or with a person or entity doing business in Israel , or in an Israeli-controlled territory...
      </p>
      <p>
       [This section of OP's contract merely redefines "economic terrorism", which is listed due to previous non-state actors (like BDS) specifically refusing to do business with non-state actors over trivial matters unrelated to their appropriate state actors.]
      </p>
      <h1>
       OP can still partner with, and terminate a relationship with an Israeli company! Why? Because his contract clause states (as a finale)...
      </h1>
      <p>
       <strong>
        but does not include an action made for ordinary business purposes
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's nothing personal, just ensuring business
       <em>
        actually is
       </em>
       business, and not a subversive, underhanded tactic in attempting to ruin Israel's economy (like military contractors, OP?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Terrorism doesn't have to be "mentioned" if OP's contract pretty much defined it as-is.

       I'm not sure how you did any research and only found an Israeli law from 6 years ago, but not the law signed &lt;5 months ago by the Texas governor that requires exactly what you're describing. If you had googled something like "us texas public contract Israel boycott" the first page would have the press release and several news stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not commenting on the legislation, but it's certainly not being hidden- you can easily read the law and other similar state laws and all the reporting and various opinions for and against them.

       Can boycott America, but not Israel. Interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory has been Israel having indisputable proof of our government being involved and carrying out the events of 9/11. So we do their bidding.

       They own our communications infrastructure. They have dirt on all the bad people, who coincidentally are in office at a disproportionate rate. Search "Amdocs". Not to mentiont that their bible says to do pizzagate-esque stuff to gain power. I can't say this with 100% certainty, but I do wholeheartedly believe that they are the cameramen who record politicians in compromising positions, and are the ones organizing the situations which are compromising. Have you ever thought about the fact that one man with a camera, some inhibition-eliminating drugs, a politician, and a toddler could rule the world? Like "ooohh heeeeey, buddy. Rough night, huh? I have some bad news.. Looks like you.. fucked a child to death last night (
       <em>
        pushes play on video
       </em>
       ). It was gruesome, but here's the proof. Nasty stuff, senator. It's alright though. Just get me two videos of your friends doing this, friends of equal rank or higher, and you can have the only copy of this. Fair?" It's like Satan's version of paying it forward.

       OP, and others, has this been challenged in court?  It doesn't sound like a law preventing boycotting would hold up, though I'm not a lawyer.  I would assume boycotting Israel would fall under first amendment protections.

       To me this sounds like a first amendment issue.  It'll stay on the books until challenged, I think, and it does need to be challenged.  I'm also curious if it's ever been enforced.

       Yup.  Would you like some help finding the correct comment?  I'm sure there's a guide on how to use Reddit for people like you, probably easily located through a simple web search.

       It's unfortunate you keep replying to the wrong comments.  The other person won't be able to communicate back to you unless you reply to their message.  Don't worry though, if you keep plugging away at it I'm sure you'll eventually figure out how to use Reddit.  Have a wonderful rest of your morning.

       Yeah that was passed time ago this year, but it's almost as if these sort of things stir up more hatred towards zionist jews, really makes me wonder why they'll never just chill the fuck out for everybody's sake.

       They can't allow any criticism or negative action to be taken against them, lest they be crushed under the accumulated weight of their heinous crimes. That's why the term "anti-semite" has so much money poured into keeping it's place as a potent pejorative label.

       To me this sounds like a first amendment issue.  It'll stay on the books until challenged, I think, and it does need to be challenged.  I'm also curious if it's ever been enforced.
