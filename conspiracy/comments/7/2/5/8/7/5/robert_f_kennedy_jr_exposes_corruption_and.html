    <div class="md"><p>Too many people still don&#39;t realize there a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">special court</a> to deal with vaccine injuries in the USA, and a <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/">special fund</a> to compensate the victims. So that in itself debunks the notion that &quot;vaccines produce any injury of any kind&quot;.</p>

<p>Furthermore:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) of 1986 (42 U.S.C. §§ 300aa-1 to 300aa-34) was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan as part of a larger health bill on Nov 14, 1986, in the United States, to reduce the potential financial liability of vaccine makers due to vaccine injury claims. The legislation was aimed at ensuring a stable market supply, and to provide cost-effective arbitration for vaccine injury claims. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act">source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this court was established to defend <em>pharmaceutical companies</em>, not patients/victims.</p>

<p>That by itself should give pause to any free-thinking human.</p>

<p>Kennedy hopes new evidence and a fresh look at criminal misconduct will result in law enforcement action, rigorous and transparent vaccine safety science, and safer vaccines.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a <a href="https://worldmercuryproject.org/advocacy-policy/criminal-conduct-poul-thorsen/">new report</a>, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and his team outlined various criminal acts on the part of employees and consultants for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) whose questionable ethics and scientific fraud have resulted in untrustworthy vaccine safety science.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Among other information, Kennedy has found additional evidence of criminal activity by the CDC consultant, Poul Thorsen, the author and principal coordinator of multiple CDC studies exonerating the mercury-based preservative thimerosal in the development of autism.</p>

<p>The new evidence, recently uncovered by the World Mercury Project, shows that Thorsen and his collaborators did not obtain permission from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) to conduct their research, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2002 and Pediatrics in 2003. </p>

<p>In 2011, The Department of Justice indicted Thorsen on 22 counts of wire fraud and money laundering for stealing over $1 million in CDC grant money earmarked for autism research. The product of Thorsen’s work for CDC was a series of fraud-tainted articles on Danish autism rates that, today, form the backbone of the popular orthodoxy that vaccines don’t cause autism.</p>

<p>In 2009, when CDC discovered that Thorsen never applied for the IRB approvals, staff did not report the errors or retract the studies. Rather, FOIA documents show that CDC supervisors ignored the missteps and covered up the illegal activity.</p>

<p>This misconduct undermines the legitimacy of these studies which were used to refute vaccine injury claims in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP). </p>

<p>The studies were also used in the NVICP’s “Omnibus Proceeding” to dismiss 5000 petitions by families who claimed that their children had developed autism from vaccines. These claims, if settled in the claimants’ favor, would have resulted in payouts totaling an estimated $10 billion.</p>

<p>Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Chairman, stated, “World Mercury Project calls upon Attorney General Jeff Sessions to extradite Thorsen back to the U.S. to face prosecution. </p>

<p>We also call upon Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Tom Price to retract the Thorsen-affiliated autism research papers that are the fruit of illegally conducted research.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heads better roll over this...if true we&#39;re talking the partial destruction of an entire generation of children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just FYI, this doesn&#39;t strengthen any argument that there&#39;s anything Wrong with vaccines, it just taints the credibility of the research.</p>

<p>Also, there&#39;s a few things I found questionable.. if you click the source twice, you&#39;ll get a PDF, page 7 describes the indictment. So he apparently went and created a new bank account, made fake receipts to steal 1m, and bought a house, 2 cars, a Harley.. this is what they used as evidence.. but he defaulted on his loan for $405k? Before he was indicted. Where&#39;s the money?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The indictment provides that Thorsen submitted false invoices 
and created private bank accounts at the CDC Federal Credit Union to which he had monies wired 
to pay invoices (from a CDC laboratory using false signatures) and then used the monies (close to 
$1 million) to purchase a Harley Davidson motorcycle, two automobiles and a home, listed as a 4 
bedroom, 5 bathroom, 2688 sq. ft. home at 2657 Briar Lake Road, Atlanta, Georgia 30345. The 
Justice Department provided that it would seek to recover all the property that Poul Thorsen 
purchased. That, however, is unlikely both because of the long delay and because the largest asset, 
the home, was already in foreclosure before the indictment. (Exhibits 9 and 10)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2 different sites list a vastly larger SQ foot(more than half again, almost double), both list it as 5br 4bath(rather than opposite, the other says 3full 2 half baths) <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2657-Briarlake-Rd-NE-Atlanta-GA-30345/14552734_zpid/">https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2657-Briarlake-Rd-NE-Atlanta-GA-30345/14552734_zpid/</a> or <a href="https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/2657-Briarlake-Rd-NE_Atlanta_GA_30345_M68594-58005">https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/2657-Briarlake-Rd-NE_Atlanta_GA_30345_M68594-58005</a></p>

<p>So how is the largest asset, which if the address is correct even though the information doesn&#39;t match.. how does he have a loan for more than the website says it sold for, or just less than the other website places it&#39;s value? If he spent the money he supposedly stole that is.</p>

<p>That just doesn&#39;t add up, and it&#39;s the main thing they went after him for.</p>

<p>Special interest groups trying to kill the research seems like an easier to believe answer, finance stuff is just too easy to fake. Read the PDF, it&#39;s much more informative than either article, and gives you facts that haven&#39;t been &quot;interpreted&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think he did embezzle the money, I think they just wanna kill the research. But sure, do the research again. The entire idea of research is that it should be repeatable with the same results.</p>

<p>I have no skin in this game, I&#39;ve never had a reason to doubt vaccines, even if there&#39;s side effects, it beats being dead.. or rampant outbreaks.</p>

<p>I guess the only real issue is the years it would take to do, and the cost all over again.. and getting funding, for this specifically under a Trump presidency.. never gonna happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>its not about Wakefield</p>

<p>OP is about the CDC covering up the fact that they discovered in their own study that vaccines cause autism</p>

<p>the case against Wakefield seems remarkable for a few reasons</p>

<p>1) he has something like 12 co-authors on this study, who all allegedly didn&#39;t know what Wakefield was doing? if they didn&#39;t know what he was doing, why were they considered co-authors? if they did know what he was doing, why weren&#39;t they persecuted like Wakefield?</p>

<p>2) it took 12 years to retract the study? this does not give me confidence in the efficiency of the peer review process. to exacerbate this problem, Dr William Thompson&#39;s paper has yet to be retracted, in spite of him admitting it was a fraud. people to this day still cite Dr William Thompson&#39;s paper as if it was still valid</p>

<p>3) the punishment seemed rather harsh, considering that the editor of Lancet says half of the literature they publish is false. Wakefield&#39;s case was the biggest of its kind ever. i suspect that this was to send a message to everyone else of what will happen if you go up against big pharma and wall street </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the fraud not only invalidates their research, it actually proves the opposite of what they were trying to say, as far as I&#39;m concerned. </p>

<p>in other words, their fraud was enough to convince me that vaccines cause autism</p>

<p>furthermore, the way the establishment has treated the CDC fraud has convinced me that vaccine science is corrupt, that science in general is corrupt, </p>

<p>why hasn&#39;t Dr William Thompson&#39;s paper been retracted? the fact that his paper hasn&#39;t been retracted tells me that the journal it was published in is corrupt.</p>

It is basically like the flu only you get a rash too. A week later it was gone and everything was back to normal. It you develop autism due to vaccine injury then your life is ruined and you never recover. In the worst cases autism is a fate worse than death. </p>

<p>We didn&#39;t all live through it. We do now. And I&#39;ve got some good news. Vaccines don&#39;t cause autism. The Danish study pretty much put the nail in that coffin, unless you think families that have more autism tend to be anti-vaxxers.</p>

<p>As a graduate student in chemistry, I cannot fucking stress enough how big of a deal this is. Scientific, peer reviewed journals are publishing papers by groups that aren&#39;t approved for research. What in the hell. Not only does this discredit the CDC and the scientists, but that entire journal as well and every other scientist that&#39;s ever published in that journal. The people that run the IRB shit are anal as fuck. They&#39;ve revoke phDs for a whole lot less than this. I&#39;m surprised with all the regulations in place that this was even possible.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the fact that Merck is being sued by former scientists for fudging the efficacy data, certainly warrants a much stronger look at the MMR vaccine. If they were fudging the efficacy studies, and there appears to be data casting doubt on CDC safety studies.  Forget the philosophical or policy objections concerning vaccinations, but just focus on it as a product.    The view that it should be suspended, and very rigorous and independent studies undertaken is justified. </p>

<p>full data outcomes with statistical significance at 1 month exposure for almost the entirety of neurological disorders.</p>

<p><a href="http://putchildrenfirst.org/media/2.16.pdf">http://putchildrenfirst.org/media/2.16.pdf</a></p>

<p>full details of the CDC cover-up, provided by congressman weldon:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.safeminds.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Weldon-letter-to-Gerberding10-31-03.pdf">https://www.safeminds.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Weldon-letter-to-Gerberding10-31-03.pdf</a></p>

<p>Weldon’s letter to Gerberding goes on to observe that “the first version of the study, produced in February 2000, found a significant association between exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism and neurological developmental delays. A June 2000 version of the study applied various data manipulations to reduce the autism association to 1.69, and the authors went outside the VSD [Vaccine Safety Datalink] database to secure data from a Massachusetts HMO [Harvard Pilgrim] in order to counter the association found between TCVs and speech delays.” Clear enough.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Weldon summarizes: “The CDC produced an article by Dr. Verstraeten, published on Nov. 3 in Pediatrics. Dr. Verstraeten is a former CDC employee. Since 2001 he has worked for GlaxoSmithKline – a vaccine manufacturer. While working for the CDC in 2000, the first version of Dr. Verstraeten’s unpublished study found an association between higher thimerosal exposures and neurodevelopment disorders, including autism. Between 2000 and 2003, Dr. Verstraeten and coauthors manipulated and stratified the data so much that each of these associations magically disappeared. I don’t know if it was deliberate, but that is nonetheless what happened. This study has done nothing in my mind to put these concerns to rest, but only serves to raise suspicions.” </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>&quot;At the time that HP&#39;s data was brought in, HP was in receivership by the state of Mass., its computer records had been in shambles for years, it had multiple computer systems that could not communicate with one another (Journal of Law, Ethics and Medicine Sept. 22, 2000), and it used a health care coding system totally different from the one used across the VSD. There are questions relating to a significant underreporting of Autism in Mass. The HP dataset is only about 15% of the HMO dataset used in the February 2000 study. There may also be significant problems with the statistical power of the HP dataset&quot;</p>

<p>Oh.  so the CDC committed scientific fraud in 2003 and went outside their original scope and introduced faulty data sets to water down their 1999 causation findings. good to know.</p>

<p>so it may be that Thimerosal is just a red herring to keep the researchers from looking at other things, </p>
