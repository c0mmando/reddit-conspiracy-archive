       Why is Alex Jones becoming a warmonger and supporting Trump's saber-rattling against an unpredictable but rational actor in the world's stage? Alex use to have nuanced view on the Korean Conflict and now he's just defending Trump as he continues to threaten war with North Korea. Look I don't support North Korea, and I am sure a lot of the stories said about this secretive regime is probably true but that doesn't justify killing millions of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the point of "liberating" North Korea if were just going to be nuking the entire country killing millions of North Koreans who have no say in what goes on in Pyongyang. Its not the people's fault that they were born in North Koreas, as Carlin said, it was "a fucking genetic accident" to be born as so and so.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I don't know why Alex Jones and so many mainstream pundits and Fox News is calling for a war with North Korea? How stupid are people for falling for the same bullshit that was said about Iraq? Now granted Kim Jong Un treats his people like shit, I'm not going to defend the government of North Korea but it just reminds me of the lead up to the Iraq War.

       People keep saying this about Afghanistan as well. So far no one's recovered anything of value out of that hellhole, so I tend to doubt the veracity of these claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real reason IMO is that war makes the extremely rich even richer at no personal cost to themselves, and they control the show.

       Afghanistan had nothing to do with rare minerals, it was a launching pad to take out Saddam Hussein. Hussein indicated in 2000, he was looking to drop the Petrodollar, the rest is history. Wars are about resources or to protect rhe Petrodollar.

       Meh. Maybe. But I think the occupation of Afghanistan was mostly about positioning American forces on the western border of Iran, and maybe a bit about rebooting the Talilban-razed poppy fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       With bases in Afghanistan, the surrounding friendly "stans", and Iraq, the US basically has Iran hemmed in on all sides. All they need now is a good, solid pretext to invade and they'll have tanks in Tehran within a week.

       It doesn't matter how large the US defense budget is, all it takes is 1 ICBM to change the world as we know it, and NK has shown time and time and time again they're bat-shit insane.

       Oh get fucked. It's in everyone's interests that countries opposed to the USA get nuclear weapons, because it acts as a deterrent to their invasions and coups. I'd much rather North Korea have nukes than Trump/the Republican Fox News Party/CIA, because at least we don't know for certain whether North Korea will slaughter millions of civilians and torture innocent people to death in guantanomo gulags.

       US has spent 16+ years invading countries who didn't do 9/11.  1,000,000+ dead.  I don't think anybody "wants" them to have nukes.  It's just perfectly reasonable for them to defend themselves... against out lunatic foreign war policies... in any manner they choose

       I think they are just saying... We have committed genocide twice!, Been in imperial war 90+% of the years since 1776, ACTUALLY used 2 nukes on innocent populations (if you believe that), and have a very high body count of civilians under our belt... So who the F are we to tell anyone how to be "peaceful"... I agree

       Simple. War drumming is going on because Israel's Yinon plan is stalled, Russia has blocked the march to Iran by prevailing in Syria. A huge distraction has been ordered. By us either getting shot down or taking direct actions in N. Korea we directly engage CHINA! and, guess what, RUSSIA which shares a border and both have defense treaties. Ukraine, like a improvised IED, thanks Newland, will go off at the same time and Poland has been brought to a froth. Continuous prodding of Russia by arming Lithuania and other border countries, MORE provocation. Thusly, Israel gets the land (radioactive) but not until facing off with Turkey over Erdogon's obsession with Kurds who are being solicited by the Mossad and the near eastern desk of the State Department, KERPLOWIE, SMOKE, COVER! Everything is set.

       There's no easy way to deal with North Korea. That time has passed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The closest the USA got to having normal diplomatic relations with NK was during Bill Clinton's 2nd term. Unfortunately, it was too late. Bush got elected and relations stalled and eventually drifted away from the USA's grasps.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no way of telling if Bill Clinton, or Al Gore had he won, would've succeeded where Bush failed, but the window did appear to be open with regards to curbing their nuclear program.
      </p>
      <p>
       ~20 years later, we relations have deteriorated to the brink of war. NK thinks nukes are the only thing protecting them from American imperialism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Few options are available to US leadership:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Preemptive war
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Sanctions and pressure on China to put NK in their place
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Sit and do nothing, but risk a nuclear attack on South Korea and/or Japan.

        The tough words cheered the delegation from Israel, whose prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, applauded from the gallery and called it the boldest speech he had heard at the United Nations in 30 years. In his own address later, he said Mr. Trump had “rightly called the nuclear deal with Iran an embarrassment” and pointed to North Korea as an example. "In the last few months, we’ve all seen how dangerous even a few nuclear weapons can be in the hands of a small rogue regime,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “Now imagine the danger of hundreds of nuclear weapons in the reins of a vast Iranian empire, with the missiles to deliver them anywhere on earth.”

       It's difficult to listen to AJ go full-on neocon in his warmongering effort to demonize North Korea.  his show is basically shit these days with that dumb know-nothing newb hosting half the time and then the dumb know-nothing brit the other half.

       Popularly: NK has been built up as a boogeyman for the last handful of decades. It's widely known as a brutal totalitarian regime and an open "antagonist" to the United States and it's allies. Westerners hate the regime on impulse, and very few people stop to consider just how the current situation developed or why it hasn't been resolved yet. The current presidency is riding a "maverick" reputation pretty hard and is offering a """"solution""""" to North Korea, making people anxious to get things started for the sake of America and flags and dumb shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politically, NK is one of America's lasting failures. We backed a corrupt, unpopular regime and had to throw in militarily when the inevitable happened, then got fought to a standstill by a pair of countries that we hadn't even considered a threat. The military wants to mend the last half century of wounded pride, our neocolonial economy wants China stripped of any potential friends, and Trump wants a clear enemy to distract people from the train he and his buddies intend to run on us.

       I'm sure there are deep-state conspiracy reasons, but I think the general public is kind of mired in a depression over the dubious state of the economy, the relentless and corrosive political stalemates and in the back of their mind they see a righteous war with an obvious bad guy as something somehow appealing.  I think a lot of people have more or less good memories of the first Iraq war -- 24/7 CNN video of Baghdad being bombed made for "must see TV" and provided a kind of exciting, pro-US backdrop.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people kind of
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       a war because they think it will be cathartic -- patriotism will be good again, annoying issues like political correctness and racial discord can be pushed off to the side.  I think most people also think it will benefit the economy somehow -- WW II style war spending, with big money pushed into defense projects which will result in a bunch of good paying jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think these are all mostly misguided and misleading ideas, but they are largely the public consciousness.

       Easy they have vast mineral deposits. The Deep State military industrial companies: Lockheed, General Dynamics, Northrup, Boeing, Raytheon, Booz Allen (and many more) make money off weapons and war. The US exists as the largest sellers of weapons. Perpetual war makes money.

       Do I want North Korea to have nuclear weapons? No I don't want Kim to have an ICBM that could potentially reach the United States. But after seeing what happened in Iraq, what happened when Gaddafi gave up his weapons and what's been happening in Syria, as well as for the fact that in 2002 the United States labeled the DPRK as the axis of evil. They have a point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I don't support Kim Jong Un and his disgusting regime, but at the end of the day, Kim is a rational actor. It can get unnerving sometimes when they do these missile tests, I'm not supporting their actions but I can understand why they are doing this. Again, horrible situation for the people of North Korea but war is still unthinkable even if Kim is an asshole to his own people.
