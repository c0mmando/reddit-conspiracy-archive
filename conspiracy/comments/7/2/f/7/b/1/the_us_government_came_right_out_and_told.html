    <div class="md"><p>We need a political party, we need a clear message, and we need a clear solution based on our collective research. We can&#39;t organize, we can&#39;t agree on a message, and the solutions are almost universally multi generational or violent. We often forget thar we are playing a multi generational game, and we started at the final level. Not saying we can&#39;t do it, but this can&#39;t be a leader less movement, we need beacons for like minded folk, unity message no party, racial, or religious divides, etc... OCCUPY  was a great model. Unfortunately they have that model, and have procedure for crushing a similar uprising.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My favorite example is what they did to the OccupyWallStreet movement. It had a powerful message with a lot of public support: &quot;We are the 99%; the 1% has been stealing from us for decades, and the 2008 economic meltdown was the last straw. Punish the bastards.&quot;</p>

<p>Say what you want about the politics of wealth distribution; our entire struggle boils down to a secret cabal gaining more and more control over the monetary and political system, to the point where they can break laws with complete impunity (as well as their application of mass psy-ops to keep the 99% distracted).</p>

<p>With a concerted effort from various CIA-connected media outlets, they began spinning the narrative. The most effective way of doing this was focusing on the &quot;human element&quot; instead of the message. Who are these protesters? How can they keep going? Will this method last? Why can&#39;t they get a unified message? Do they actually know what they want? Don&#39;t they have jobs? </p>

<p>The protesters were trying their best to bring attention to the issue of financial corruption, but all of the attention fell on them themselves. Because they often had a hippy vibe, it was quite easy to sour their message in the eyes of conservatives. If the protests were used to create a dialogue in the media about the judicial handling of the planned stock market crash and hostile takeovers of banking companies like WaMu, it would be dangerously un-divisive. Everyone thinks that the CEOs of those banks should be in prison. Or at least, about 99% of us do. But only about 50% of us are on board with hippies living off of their parents&#39; bank accounts to indefinitely camp in hygiene-challenged parks (or however else the protesters are framed).</p>

<p>Then there was the opposition. One of the most effective methods that FoxNews uses to decimate public opinion of a group is to find the least articulate opposition debater and bring them on a talk show. After these bumbling normal citizens are blinded by the limelight and eviscerated, who in their right mind would support such a weak group? </p>

<p>Then there were the contrived and effective talking points. &quot;99%? How about the 53% of Americans that actually pay income tax while the rest suck up welfare dollars?!&quot; Again, politics of the issue aside, this is just so abundantly clearly a move to literally fracture the 99% in half to allow for infighting. We can&#39;t be united if half the citizens think the other half are welfare queens and half the citizens think the other half don&#39;t comprehend that poor people spend every dollar they make, and that money gets taxed, so it goes right back into the economy. </p>

<p>When all was said and done, OccupyWallStreet faded away into oblivion. We were so close to putting actual pressure on those at the very top, and now we&#39;ve been fractured once more and are focused on an incredibly effective Distractor in Chief. It&#39;s amazing how readily and comprehensively the oligarchy can mobilize when they see a threat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t wrong, but that just made them easier to crush by the system I described. There was so much wrong with the final and political system that it was hard to get a central message. And, unlike AstroTurfed decentralized movements like #BlackLivesMatter, #OccupyWallStreet doesn&#39;t appear to have had billionaires funding it from its inception. </p>

<p>For what it&#39;s worth, spinning it back to their organizational failures is exactly the type of technique that submarined them. Who wants to go out and support an organization that <em>everyone knows</em> is hemorrhaging incompetency?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I was familiar with occupy before the media really picked up on it, and I (successfully) predicted its demise from the get-go based on no central message. You talk to one guy in occupy, and they&#39;re saying they want violent redistribution of wealth. The next guy wants to audit the Fed. A third doesn&#39;t know dick about economics and just wanted to come protest. A fourth is talking about radical veganism and intersectional feminism for some reason.</p>

<p>If you think they would have succeeded (which means what exactly for a group with no central goal?) were it not for the media, you have your own problems with delusion. If you want to succeed at something, you have to have a defined goal first. Otherwise you have no definition of success. So unless you thought that weird kid in elementary school who ran around doing random shit before shouting &quot;I win!&quot; was onto something, you can&#39;t seriously think occupy would have gotten anywhere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mentioned some specific issues, I&#39;d like to address them and maybe give a different point of view.  I hope I don&#39;t come across as trolling as that is not my intention.</p>

<p>This business about NFL players standing for the anthem is a DOD-sponsored propaganda campaign in the first place.  The fact that so many people are so heavily invested in the question now is simply a marker for how effective American propaganda really is in 2017.</p>

<p>The Russian meddling in the election is distraction.  Even if they did manipulate our election, it is a sandfly on the bull that is the MIC dictation of every single election for the last several decades.  Say the Russian elected Trump.  How?  By advertising on social media and fake news.  The Establishment is simply angry that someone else dared to pull the same levers they have been pulling for generations.</p>

<p>See Cambridge Analytica and Edward Bernays for how this is done.</p>

<p>Healthcare.  Healthcare is dead in this country.  Accept it, move on to the next question: how the <em>fuck</em> are we going to take care of ourselves, our families, and our communities without help from the healthcare sector?</p>

<p>It&#39;s going to come down to individual people stepping up and providing the care that is necessary.  I went to medical school.  PA school and RN school are excellent alternatives.  EMT training + wilderness medicine certification would be another excellent path.  </p>

<p>And for God&#39;s sake, take care of your own health.  Eat food that makes you healthy, exercise, and don&#39;t smoke, and you&#39;ll be safe from most of the things that destroy people before their natural time is up.</p>

<p>Be the change the world needs.  Because the fuckers at the top don&#39;t care and if there&#39;s one thing we can be sure of, it&#39;s that they&#39;ll never actually help us.  It&#39;s too late for that.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s on us.</p>

<p>Overwhelm is real.  Turn off screens, go outside.  Our salvation is in the natural world.  Eden is waiting.  We are only cast out of Eden because we are ashamed of ourselves.  Embrace yourself, return to the forest.</p>

<p>Literally.  Go into the forest and talk to the trees.  Tell them your problems.  They won&#39;t answer, but you&#39;ll know the answer.</p>

<p>Great fuckin point. I do recall a time when the anthem played <em>before</em> players came out. Funny how such a small shift can have enormous repercussions down the road.</p>

<p>I do need to have a little commune with nature. I spent my summer indoors and in climate conditioned work. I&#39;m always much happier in nature. Thanks for the reminder to get the fuck out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hear hear! [Warning, long post incoming]</p>

<p>I would like to add that the psychological manipulation, censorship, and general sabotage that hits like a thousand cuts upon real movements, is incredibly powerful. I can only speculate that there are things we cannot even determine collectively, that are being particularly carried out to damage each and every one of our avenues of communication.</p>

<p>Let me explain: Facebook has an algorithm that determines what posts you see on your &quot;newsfeed&quot;, right? Certain people and topics come up more often than others, and other things don&#39;t show up at all. The story is that it all depends on &quot;your preferences&quot;: what you like, where you comment, what you comment, etc.</p>

<p>Personally, I have noticed that certain topics and people I am always into, that I continuously rave about, don&#39;t necessarily show up. The algorithm is supposed to respond to my demands, right? I&#39;m <em>supposed</em> to put myself into a bubble of information and stories. But oddly enough, this does not happen.</p>

<p>The thoughts and media I end up consuming are quite against my liking. In fact, it appears to be a distractive propaganda of sorts. A common theme is that of suicide. Any time a &quot;friend&quot; mentions it in the slightest, it shows up on my feed. One example.</p>

<p>Anyway, let us take this a step further: if Facebook (and only one company among many in this tragic comedy), once they had you hooked, could design an algorithm that did <em>not</em> reflect your interests, what else could they do?</p>

<p>Perhaps they might just lose messages that you send to people. They may never get them. How could you know if that&#39;s the only way you have contact? Perhaps Google decides to trash an important email or two to some important people you just met. How would you know? Perhaps AT&amp;T, with that call you made to them later, that went to message, never even arrived on their phone?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying this is happening, but it is quite well within the range of the technological abilities we have. And if the elite are really that afraid of a new world (which they appear to be), if they could, they might well do so.</p>

<p>I am personally being censored by these organizations, targeted by Microsoft (hacked three times over a few years, cannot use Windows anymore), listened to by the NSA (of course), spied on by the Russians (the Chinese, oddly, don&#39;t seem to care), and am being censored and psychologically manipulated by Facebook.</p>

<p>Algorithms operate on an individual basis. These companies may have an extra eye or two on me, but it may certainly be happening to millions of us at once. I have expressed myself publicly, in person, on matters that many of you would find important, and was told, in no uncertain terms, that I would be murdered if I continued. I have pushed as far as I could without coming to ruin, and the lesson is this: when the time comes, when the fire falls from the sky, when the sea boils and the earth quakes, the systems of control now dividing us will fall. Be ready when they do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long Story, and only the tip of the iceberg:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there was any <em>one</em> thing, exactly. Prior to the hackings, which took place from 2011 - 2014, before I switched to Linux, I wrote a coming-of-age novel critical of modern, American society. I pursued an economic theory with a goal of free energy and balanced socialism/capitalism. I wrote instructions for a CPU that more replicate the memory systems in our brain.  I pursued an original unified physics theory. Tangent: I asked a physics professor at the local university to take a look at the theory, and he gave me some quite important comprehensive critique. I met his son once, and six months later, his son committed suicide. A terrible tragedy. I have stayed away from the physics community since.</p>

<p>It would seem that these things were enough to get me hacked and censored. And when I say hacked, I mean HACKED. Complete loss of operating system, files and folders walled off. Since then, I have pursued much more work, and have been more or less free to do so, though within a &quot;gilded cage&quot; of sorts.</p>

<p>Except, of course, when you start playing improvisational piano in the rotunda and renegade lobbying at the statehouse. Talking to legislators and the governor&#39;s staff, persuading them that there is a better path. Within 2 weeks of first doing so, an extremely good friend of mine, in her mid-30s, who spoke 4 languages and worked for the Feds, dropped dead in her own apartment. They say it was the &quot;wrong combination of meds&quot;. Shortly after, a guy in an SUV nearly hit me while I was walking on a neighborhood street. I had to jump into a ditch to avoid it. He sat there in the car, and I walked up to him and said, &quot;Hey, you scared the shit out of me? What were you thinking?&quot; He said nothing, but stared back with cold eyes.</p>

<p>I went ahead anyway, every week, and eventually ended up speaking to several hundred people on the grounds of the capital at the end of the political season. I watched several dozen people record my speech, yet nothing ever showed up online. I was detained for a short while and released. A vague comment from a bystander I received later that day: &quot;At least we avoided an <em>emergency</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>Some months later, prior to the next session, I was told repeatedly by a good friend with connections, &quot;If you keep protesting, they will murder you.&quot;</p>

<p>Keep in mind, I may be blowing things out of proportion, or using confirmation bias, or excessive ego-tripping or any other fallacies of subjectivity. Still, it is a very curious situation.</p>

Maybe it can work in local politics where sometimes third-parties actually get election winning numbers of votes and local businesses tend to be less fucky, but concerning the congressional and presidential elections, we must balk in the face of any third party until we can implement something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BR0KoEp1l4">ranked-choice voting</a>.</p>

<p>We need to go further than repeating stuff on YouTube, to become real experts. It&#39;s challenging because of all the disinfo and accidental horseshit and bias. Go to lots of sources. See if your friends can find flaws in your presentation of a claim. Learn to rise above the childish taunting and whataboutism.</p>

<p>There are so many facets to hidden history it&#39;s really quite exciting. Process your fear and grief then dive in friends! More doors will open, you can&#39;t study the elite without touching on religion, magic, bizarre concepts, beautiful art and thrilling plots. The more we learn the better we can persuade.</p>

I let her call it out a few times, I watch for those who squirm or appear uncomfortable, then I ask those people: &quot;Huh, what is Tower 7&quot;? To which you get varying replies . While they are replying, you pull up your bookmarked video of the 9-11 footage on you phone and casually play just the collapse of Tower 7. &quot;Oh I see, geez check it out..&quot; Then you show them <em>Zeitgeist</em>, of course loaning them your earbuds (make sure they are clean!).</p>

<p>Then, when they look up, you grab Tower 7s drink. Make sure they see it. They will looks confused at this point, if they don&#39;t already. That&#39;s when you tell them, &quot;you have a responsibility now, to tell other&#39;s &quot;. Fucking red pilled the shit out of people like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The idea is to get as big of an audience as possible. Some may be ok just reading the subtitles since the other guy has the earbuds. He could probably split that with someone so they each have one ear bud. The others would have to be content to just watching it from a distance, with you narrating the movie yourself. Probably, the barista will already be aware of <em>Zeitgeist</em>, so there&#39;s no need to narrate to the baristas like you would at a Dunkin Donuts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh it isn&#39;t absolutely necessary asshole. Saying that is your way of convincing the most easily convinced demographic to fight for your cause: angry people who need somewhere to direct their anger. Say you get 10,000,000 people all riled up and organized for your &quot;violence is our last resort&quot; shpeal, if those 10&#39;000&#39;000 got organized and focused for a non violent effective solution with an equal amount of passion as they would have for violence, they&#39;d see great results. Ever consider that this violent mentality you have is part of the systematic brainwashing? It&#39;s easy to lose support and potential allies when you&#39;re seen doing violent/destructive acts. Look at what happened to BLM. Everyone loved it until the riots started and property started being set on fire, now the movement has lost traction. This makes it easier to shut down the movement. </p>

I don&#39;t like violence, but I am a realist and I understand that at this point in time, things have gone to far. We have been completely overrun by psychopaths. If we organize through the means that they allow us, they have complete control. The establishment will just infiltrate it with their own agent-provocateurs to get their desired outcome. </p>

<p><em>That&#39;s</em> how you&#39;re interpreting what I&#39;m saying? Oh, man....</p>

<p>Listen, dude. We can&#39;t vote &#39;em out, we can&#39;t rally with a bunch of picket signs to get rid of &#39;em, the media has people so divided and there are disinformation agents in every movement, there is no way to organize against the establishment in any meaningful way since all of our communications are monitored. Public opinion is continually shaped by their media, and entertainment industry. As long as those machines still stand, they are 100 steps ahead at all times... do you understand how evil the elite are? Like, <em>really</em>? I mean, here&#39;s just one example; they killed ~3000 people on 9/11 just <em>like that</em>. Isn&#39;t that evidence enough of what they think of us? And you&#39;re trying to justify why we should continue using their &quot;safe&quot; methods for change which have never worked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I couldnt agree with you more that we need to fight, but it can&#39;t be war, it can&#39;t be bloodshed, it can&#39;t be physical. We need people, led by a true leader of your cause, to achieve victory through non violent means. Don&#39;t you see that this call for fights and violence is what all of human history is? We fight and wage war to get what we want and I assure you that &quot;Sometimes fighting is necessary&quot; is the exact the line that caused the World Wars and every way before and after them. Ghandi didn&#39;t fight, and he is revered for his methods. MLK didn&#39;t fight, and he got black people to where they are today. There are ways to do things without violence, and if we refuse to see this, we will never leave our cycle of destruction. </p>

<p>High profile deaths wouldn&#39;t make a difference.  Theres more of the &#39;elite&#39; than anyone here realizes I think.  Its an entire society that we&#39;re just not part of.</p>

<p>Melania wore a $1,400 shirt to do some gardening and everyone freaked out, but theres hundreds of thousands (millions?) of people out there who wouldn&#39;t blink.  They don&#39;t go to the same schools, they don&#39;t live in the same neighborhoods, the laws don&#39;t apply to them.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve seen Downton Abbey, you might&#39;ve laughed about how frazzled they get whenever they have to talk about money, or how they can&#39;t deal with change.  Understand that these people don&#39;t see themselves like you see yourself.  Their money comes from nowhere because they don&#39;t have to earn it, they&#39;re upper class citizens and thats the way it is.  You and I are lower class citizens and thats the way it is.</p>

<p>The history of the world is the history of the up upper class.  Roman politics, medieval politics, modern politics.  Its all the same game played for thousands of years.</p>

<p>Its not <em>impossible</em> to make it in, but theres no way you or anyone else will ever root them out.</p>

<p>Or are there actually morons out there? </p>

<p>I&#39;m agreeing it was an inside job is a real conspiricy. Discussing consirpricy&#39;s validity is well needed because if you just believe and run with every conspiricy you&#39;re just a nut job, not getting anywhere. but if you give an analytical eye to each theory and don&#39;t believe it all, then you&#39;re following the rules a conspiracy theorist should be following.

<p>Here are a few that are specific to medical conspiracies:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#1950s">From 1963 to 1966, Saul Krugman of New York University promised the parents of mentally disabled children that their children would be enrolled into Willowbrook in exchange for signing a consent form for procedures that he claimed were &quot;vaccinations.&quot; In reality, the procedures involved deliberately infecting children with viral hepatitis by feeding them an extract made from the feces of patients infected with the disease</a> </p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States#Experiments_involving_other_radioactive_materials">Immediately after World War II, researchers at Vanderbilt University gave 829 pregnant mothers in Tennessee what they were told were &quot;vitamin drinks&quot; that would improve the health of their babies. The mixtures contained radioactive iron and the researchers were determining how fast the radioisotope crossed into the placenta. At least three children are known to have died from the experiments, from cancers and leukemia</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/americas-deep-dark-secret/">More than 30 years after Boyce and Almeida were released [from the &quot;Fernald School of the feeble minded&quot;], they found out that the school had allowed them to be used as human guinea pigs. In 1994 Senate hearings, it came out that scientists from MIT had been giving radioactive oatmeal to the boys - men now - in a nutrition study for Quaker Oats. All they knew is that they&#39;d been asked to join a science club. Among those who attended the hearing was Almeida, also a member of the club. He says the boys were recruited with special treats: &quot;We were getting special treatment, you know, extra dessert, we got to eat away from the other boys. We were getting extra oatmeal. We&#39;re getting extra milk.&quot; &quot;But they forgot to mention the milk was radioactive,&quot; says David White-Lief, an attorney who worked on the state task force investigating the science club.</a></p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>They work, but aren&#39;t necessary for most people. For one, there&#39;s a good chance you wouldn&#39;t get the flu anyway - I&#39;ve never had a flu vaccine, and the only time I got the flu was when H1N1 was going around (which wouldn&#39;t have been vaccinated anyway). Secondly, for healthy people, the flu (at least general seasonal flu) isn&#39;t a big deal - it&#39;s unpleasant, but non-threatening. Thirdly, it&#39;s not an eradication method - for many vaccines, rigorous application to the whole population can effectively wipe out the disease (see, e.g., smallpox). There are so many strains of flu, and it so rapidly mutates, that that isn&#39;t the case here (which is why you need it yearly if at all).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flu vaccines are a weird one. The majority of the time, I think declining a vaccination is dumb - it&#39;s not zero risk (nothing is), but the risks are very low compared to the potential downsides of the disease. High uptake of the vaccine can also lead to a vast reduction in the prevalence of the disease to the point where the vaccine isn&#39;t needed in the future.</p>

<p>Flu isn&#39;t like that though. If you&#39;re healthy, the strains of flu that the vaccine will protect against wouldn&#39;t cause any lasting harm anyway, and there&#39;s no lasting benefit due to the number of strains and rate of mutation. It&#39;s a far different situation, and I think it&#39;s entirely reasonable to turn them down (it&#39;s also, more or less, why the <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/flu-influenza-vaccine.aspx">UK NHS only offer it to at-risk groups </a>).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no such thing as &quot;safety&quot;.  Nothing is totally &quot;safe&quot;, everything bears risks, both seen and unseen, however small.</p>

<p>For example, even if the vaccine you were injecting was totally completely safe and did only and exactly what it was intended to do (very much up for dispute), simply the act of getting an injection itself - any injection - carries a risk.</p>

<p><a href="https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/09/15/vaccine-related-shoulder-injuries.aspx">https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/09/15/vaccine-related-shoulder-injuries.aspx</a></p>

<p>One can argue that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks - and that&#39;s exactly the debate we should be having.  Instead you have hordes of mindless children crying &quot;anti-vaxxer!&quot; every time logical and reasonable questions are raised about the risks various vaccines post, the efficiency of various vaccines, which vaccines are appropriate to administer to which group of people and in which geographical locales.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>because even though there are those who remain asleep it doesnt mean they will never wake up.  It is up to those of us who know and understand what is going on to spread these truths.  It isnt good enough to simply say we are being spied on.  People need to know how it directly effects them for them to really want change.  We have been vonditioned to feel that if it isnt happening to me then it isnt happening.  You need to go to your friends and family with almost a slideshow presentation of sorts with facts that show whats is happening.  Even if they wake up to the truth what will they do? all you and i or anybody can do right now is try to wake up the sleepy sheeps and hope that it tips the scale of the universe in our direction.  This is my optimistic mind speaking.  My realistic mind tells me the whole world can go to shit and the people who are on top now will stay on top after anything goes down.  to me the only REAL solution is to have a personal wealth cap and say no one can ever be worth more than x.  either this or we kill the bankers and take thier shit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A year ago, at a Quaker Meeting House in Lake Worth, Fla., a small group of activists met to plan a protest of military recruiting at local high schools. What they didn&#39;t know was that their meeting had come to the attention of the U.S. military.</p>

<p>A secret 400-page Defense Department document obtained by NBC News lists the Lake Worth meeting as a “threat” and one of more than 1,500 “suspicious incidents” across the country over a recent 10-month period.</p>

<p>“This peaceful, educationally oriented group being a threat is incredible,” says Evy Grachow, a member of the Florida group called The Truth Project.</p>

<p>“This is incredible,” adds group member Rich Hersh. “It&#39;s an example of paranoia by our government,” he says. “We&#39;re not doing anything illegal.”</p>

<p>What do you mean &quot;would be like&quot;?  My assessment makes no assumptions.  What I have described is the current reality.  That&#39;s how it is now.  From here its just a matter of them perfecting their technology and integrating their networks.

<p>How are the farm animals still there? If you run the farm, you don&#39;t kill them all on the first day; they are not your enemy, you are just living off of them. You care for them and ensure they breed safely, killing off the older ones only. Like I said, we can&#39;t be the livestock in the system if the system doesn&#39;t even work.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is kinda beside the point.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I’m afraid you’re missing the point then. </p>

<p>Just because you’re okay with one and not the other doesn’t make it different, or right - that’s the point. Reversing your analogy - if you have nothing to say, then you’re passively doing nothing, and you’d be okay with it. But if you didn’t want anyone searching, then they’d be actively violating your privacy. </p>

<p>The point/morality doesn’t change based on what you’re okay with. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I see what you are saying, but I really do think you are missing the point entirely. </p>

<p>The point that Snowden (source of original quote) is making is that they are both actively harming you by violating your rights, and if you don&#39;t care about one, it is equivalent to saying you don&#39;t care about the other, simply because you think it does not apply to you. We are afforded both of these rights equally under the Bill of Rights. Your privacy - in any of its forms, whether physical or virtual - is your right, just like freedom of speech or religion or assembly. </p>

<p>Saying you don&#39;t care about the right to privacy is the same as saying you don&#39;t care about the right to protest because you have nothing protest about, or saying you don&#39;t care about religious freedom because you aren&#39;t religious.</p>

<p>If you were to be stopped on the street and searched, or if you were to have cameras installed inside your home, I think you would consider that to be actively harming/impeding you in the same way as &quot;telling you not to speak is&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t you agree?</p>

There are more relevant courses for kids to take that can actually be beneficial in their lives. Take philosophy in college and pretend like you understand everything about life if you truly want. Writing and rhetoric courses teach you plenty about questioning biases and examining different point of views. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program">PRISM</a>), although officially targeted at specific individuals/addresses rather than a broad strokes dragnet, has that ability.</p>

<p>Regardless, even if we were to assume your point was true, I don&#39;t know why we should feel any better about massive collections of metadata. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon have demonstrated pretty thoroughly the power of aggregated data to sway the masses, and that&#39;s with them being relatively benevolent actors.</p>

<p>We absolutely should be concerned about this, <em>especially</em> if it hasn&#39;t yet reached the point of dystopian police state, because if we wait to raise our voices until then, it will have been too late already.</p>

<p>William Binney (Former high level NSA analyst, also whistleblower pre-Snowden): “At least 80% of fibre-optic cables globally go via the US”, Binney said. “This is no accident and allows the US to view all communication coming in. At least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the US.

    <div class="md"><p>Bear in mind that a big fraction of the population is not willing to be honest about their deep opinions.  Consider a serious Biblical literalist Christian, who also is a military vet and a cop.  This guy believes that gays will burn in eternal fire. He also knows that if he &quot;reveals his power level,&quot; the VA will cut him off and the cops will first fire him, and then beat his head in while he is &quot;resisting arrest.&quot; So he keeps quiet, and he keeps fingering the well-worn mini Bible in his pocket, looking for a chance and wondering if he&#39;s going to get shipped off to a FEMA camp.</p>

<p>If an external black swan disrupts the USA, then a lot of people with unpopular opinions will no longer be worrying about keeping quiet to preserve their jobs.  If the pensions blow up and there is no more pay even for cops and vets, do you think the cops and vets are going to retain their false veneer of political correctness?  I don&#39;t.</p>

<p>But bear in mind that people&#39;s deep beliefs are not likely to gel into a feel-good, big-tent populism.  If there is a major crisis - if, for example, the EBT cards stop dispensing welfare payments - then a lot of angry, repressed people might vent their rage on each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They use filters that search for keywords that are used often. For example this comment wouldn&#39;t stand out even if I mention a terrorist attack, but if you have a conversation with someone and you&#39;re planning one your words and phrases would stick out like a sore thumb against the background noise for a computer. Though it&#39;s not quite as simple as that and it&#39;s a very complicated procedure. Hell I&#39;d wager most information collected doesn&#39;t even make it to human hands, it just gets sorted and destroyed automatically by the computer algorithms that determine what is and isn&#39;t viable intelligence data.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason why our intelligence agencies have their own supercomputers, they are literally the only computers capable of sorting through vast amounts of data at a relatively fast pace.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why do some people still believe this country will ever wake up?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because the &quot;dream&quot; is better than any reality you can offer them.</p>

<p>As long as the majority of the populace is capable of meeting their basic needs (food, water, and shelter), the population will remain compliant and passive.</p>

<p>Another way of looking at it is that right now, you can search anything you want, go to store and buy the things you want, you can travel freely. One&#39;s privacy, especially from the prying eyes of the government, is not really a concern because the effects of it are not present enough on a tangible level to warrant the average person&#39;s attention.</p>

<p>Lastly, we can live without the internet. I&#39;d argue we can live without cars, phones. It might time to adjust, but we&#39;d still do it.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll &quot;wake up&quot; when lose the thing that we cannot live without, the thing that will make us rise up and fight. That&#39;s what you need to remember; no one is waking up because what&#39;s being taken from us is something people won&#39;t rise up and fight for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only problem with this argument, is that the government define what &quot;doing anything wrong,&quot; means; and in a totalitarian scenario, continually reducing the number of legal actions that people can take, is what they spend most of their time doing.</p>

<p>If we let things go to the point where people start making the response you are here, then that in itself is a warning sign; because if you actually cared about your own freedom, which people in more truly free societies are educated to do, then you wouldn&#39;t make that response to begin with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even sidestepping the fact that people have a right to privacy regardless, &quot;do[ing] anything wrong&quot; is a very broad category. To have nothing to worry about, you have to not only avoid anything illegal, but also avoid anything that may be misinterpreted or may become illegal. Further, it&#39;s not only illegal acts that have the potential to be damaging - say you have political aspirations. Would you really want the incumbent to have a complete record of everything dumb/embarrassing you did e.g. as a teenager? You may not think you&#39;ve done anything wrong, but a well-timed leak to the media could sink you regardless.</p>

It&#39;s a matter of things becoming so terrible that it&#39;s no longer the best course of action for a critical mass of people to continue with daily life, as opposed to spending every day in court, or rioting in the streets.</p>

<p>When government pushes it so far that THAT threshold is crossed, then things will change -- quickly.</p>

<p>But the government knows this.  That&#39;s why we&#39;re spoonfed lots of modern conveniences, cheap vacations, home &quot;ownership&quot; of expensive houses via life-long mortgages, etc.: they&#39;ll give us anything to keep us in our place, manning the factories and the desks.</p>

<p>That is, as long as it REALLY keeps us in our place, and doesn&#39;t give us TOO much freedom: the freedom to quit our jobs and live comfortably, doing our own thing without the rat-race.</p>

<p>But somehow despite the chemicals in the water, the murderous police, the spying, the sexual repression of what is allowed Americans think they are &quot;Free and Brave&quot;.</p>

<p>They even get angry at a few football players who kneel during the anthem, as if the anthem meant anything anymore. Sure they do it for their own dumb reasons but the fact remains, the anthem and the flag are now empty symbols, commercial gimmicks with no value.</p>

She then used her cell phone to call her friend and asked what to do. They decided she should smash her own window out and drop it off in a shitty part of town to make it look like her car was stolen. </p>

<p>Rumor has it that once she reported the car stolen and the cops found it suspicious then they listened to her phone conversation and that incriminated her. </p>

There&#39;s no way to abolish these measures except one way, and it&#39;s a way no liberal, or democrat and most republicans are going to agree upon: shrinking government and choking their resources.</p>

<p>If you begin doing this, you begin cutting programs so many weak people rely upon to exist. Almost all welfare programs from child to adult, planned parenthoods, WIC, minority programs... all of these things equate to thousands and thousands of programs that would have to be taken down with the CIA to starve the big bureaucracy.</p>

<p>And in order to do this, it&#39;s going to require a revolution on the scale of the civil war but with modern weapons, and that requires unity in a revolution. But with so many &quot;victims&quot; out there using government programs as a lifeline, a crutch, you will never find that unity.</p>

<p>People are having their attention misdirected towards wealth inequality and racial identity victim politics to ever form a cohesive idea of the true problems.</p>

<p>The majority of people want bigger government but less government meddling. For whatever reason, they can&#39;t identify how one comes with the other (unavoidably).</p>

<p>So how do you get all of these sick and helpless people to recognize that their path to power comes not from the talking sticks who represent their parties and freebies, but from within themselves?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shiiiiiit better than that. Surveillance is marketed as a feature and people pay a premium for it. </p>

<p>OnStar, Smartphones, computers, google home and fucking smart TVs. All that shit is real time surveillance and biometric data collection sold as convenience. Every keystroke, conversation, location and fingerprint is logged somewhere, by someone, from every device you own. Naive to think they can&#39;t, gullible to think they wouldn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m cynical, but it&#39;s hard to see a line between corporations and governments. Smartphones and social media are the intelligence communities wet dream. People bring multiple microphones and high definition cameras with them everywhere they go. They control your opinion through astroturfing and decide what you see through upvotes and likes. Naive to think they wouldn&#39;t, gullible to think they aren&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only problem with this argument, is that the government define what &quot;doing anything wrong,&quot; means; and in a totalitarian scenario, continually reducing the number of legal actions that people can take, is what they spend most of their time doing.</p>

<p>If we let things go to the point where people start making the response you are here, then that in itself is a warning sign; because if you actually cared about your own freedom, which people in more truly free societies are educated to do, then you wouldn&#39;t make that response to begin with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even sidestepping the fact that people have a right to privacy regardless, &quot;do[ing] anything wrong&quot; is a very broad category. To have nothing to worry about, you have to not only avoid anything illegal, but also avoid anything that may be misinterpreted or may become illegal. Further, it&#39;s not only illegal acts that have the potential to be damaging - say you have political aspirations. Would you really want the incumbent to have a complete record of everything dumb/embarrassing you did e.g. as a teenager? You may not think you&#39;ve done anything wrong, but a well-timed leak to the media could sink you regardless.</p>

<p>I&#39;m agreeing it was an inside job is a real conspiricy. Discussing consirpricy&#39;s validity is well needed because if you just believe and run with every conspiricy you&#39;re just a nut job, not getting anywhere. but if you give an analytical eye to each theory and don&#39;t believe it all, then you&#39;re following the rules a conspiracy theorist should be following.
