<p>I&#39;m still not sure what it&#39;s a distraction for but Weiner just got convicted.  It could be to sweep the whole pedophile stuff under the radar.  Or incoming story that should be huge but will be overshadowed by kneeling NFL players.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the fact that he keeps tweeting about it to keep the attention on this is the main thing that should worry us. He is doing it on purpose to distract from something else. Some people on 4chan are saying there are submarines in the coasts waiting to fired the nukes and shit but thats way deeper into the tin-foil stuff. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that was true though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like the media only blew up about it once Trump made it an issue. He&#39;s tweeted about the issue about 20+ times since he brought it up at his rally. As the President, he has the power to set the news cycle and make the media talk about whatever he wants. Looks like he wants the media to talk about the NFL</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The establishment controls culture.  They own the media, Hollywood, big cities, universities, and music.  </p>

<p>This is why you see a gay character and a black guy dating a white woman on most TV shows.  This is why you get a lot of liberal propaganda in movies.  This is why universities are in the state they are.</p>

<p>How do you fight culture?  Well you could infiltrate organizations like the establishment did.  Or you could get those organizations to double down.</p>

<p>This is what Trump is so great at.  He proposes a travel ban and the left loses their mind, proving they support foreigners.  Trump proposes a trannie ban and the left loses their mind, proving they have no problem allowing mentally ill people to serve in our military in the name of PC culture.  Trumps says he&#39;s going to build a wall and the left freaks out and prove that they care more about illegals than legal citizens.  </p>

<p>The NFL and rich black players have been whining about how oppressed blacks are in America.  Trump forced them to double down on their position.  America reacted. </p>

<p>And this is why the media freaked the fuck out about it.  They lost control of the narrative.  Now the American public are saying these rich black sons of bitches are disrespecting America, the very country that made them rich.  </p>

<p>We&#39;re just seeing the establishment desperately trying to regain control of the narrative.  We&#39;ll see it right up until the point the NFL caves.  Once ratings and ticket sales hit a certain low the NFL will be forced to put an end to this nonsense.  Until then expect a lot of liberal propaganda over the NFL.</p>
