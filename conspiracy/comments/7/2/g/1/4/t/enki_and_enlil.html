       I would encourage my fellow "wokes" to look into the Emerald Tablets and the Epic of Gilgamesh as they shed a lot of light on what's going on today. By reading these and other ancient texts it becomes appearent that all religions come from the same source (logic says "duhh").
The exception being Buddhism, which, isn't really a religion at all but a "way of life"
      </p>
      <p>
       Enlil, the older brother: Zeus, Jehovah, the eagle, El, Baal, etc god of the sky, heavens, and storms
      </p>
      <p>
       Enki, the younger brother: Poseidon, the serpent, Lucifer, the mad scientist, our father, the creator of mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       These two caricatures are the foundation of the Abrahamic religions. Yahweh
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       Enlil Allah
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       Enlil. They are talking about the same person. I say "person" because that's just what they were, the Annunaki, people; albeit much more advanced in technology and likely in spiritual aspects as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enki, in Christianity and Judaism, is the Devil. He is the serpent who let us "eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil". He is the one who originally thought to tamper with the early hominids of earth, giving them annunaki DNA, creating us; the first homo-sapiens.
      </p>
      <p>
       He did this, for gold.
      </p>
      <p>
       The annunaki
       <em>
        came here
       </em>
       for gold. They left with a massive universal science project that none of them signed up for, all thanks to Enki, the mad scientist, who in his pride sought to be a creator like the All Father himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enki loved his children, but Enlil did not (for various, conflictual reasons) and decided to allow them to be destroyed by a future cataclysm, rather than save the human race. Enki, unbeknownst to the other ancient astronauts, saved a few of his creations (likely in a genetic storage facility, colloquially known as "Noah's Ark).
      </p>
      <p>
       Enlil and the other gods were furious but they allowed man to continue despite his being an abomination, one that should not be allowed to exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence why we are quarantined here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alas, a plan was put forth by the "gods" who decided it was best for man to choose his own fate. The rest is history. The gods left, a few of them staying behind to watch their experiment gone wrong. Mankind was left to its own devices.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't help but get the feeling that the gods are returning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why now, is the question
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the plan

       This is fairly accurate. We will soon ascend to the 5th dimension and the third level of consciousness. I'm guessing some time this year.

       As cool as that sounds how would we know? Would we wake up and everything be the same with slight differences? Would we wake up to see the sky on fire and all hell breaking loose?

       The monthly Awakening predictions of New Agers, and especially their fraudulent channelers, has nothing to do with mandelbrot, or mathematics of any kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       It stems from and preys on the same mentality as Revelations Doomsayers and Nibiru Apocolytes:  Hope for resolution and affirmation of their desperate, misguided, and fruitless beliefs.  And no amount of false predictions will sway them from trying again the next time.  It's psychopathic and delusional.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've got nothing against spiritualism.  I even explore some, myself.  But false prophets, and their consistently ridiculous predictions, don't sway me a bit.  I don't care if they thump a Bible, or talk to demons from Pleiades.  They're all cut from the same cloth.

       what does "eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil" mean exactly? (Not that apple story, I mean what is knowledge without a sense of good/evil...did humans have not knowledge before this? Just moping around like deer?)

       In my understanding, it is a metaphor. The "tree of the knowledge of good and evil" is our physical body. With our body, we experience the dual nature of this level of dimensional existence. Pleasure/pain, hot/cold, up/down, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in our true nature, we are a soul. And this soul is formless and beyond these dualities. The soul exists in unity, but it inhabits a physical body in this realm. When humanity 'fell', we fell from a state of awareness of our 'higher', soul, nature, into a growing awareness of our 'lower' physical reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'fruit' that we enjoyed were the fruits of our actions, karma phala. Then we got karmically stuck in this dimension.

       If you believe the entity that did the Hidden Hand correspondence, yeah, prior to 'eating from the tree' humans were basically like deer in a garden run by a benevolent dictator that wasn't doing much to help their mental or spiritual evolution. The hidden hand entity maintains that the secret shadow group thats run the world from the beginning was intentionally trying to 'uplift' humanity by giving it the opportunity to learn from its decisions in a way that doesn't always have positive outcomes, but only the highest levels of that particular pyramid are actually aware of this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess one could conceptualize everything that came after 'eating the fruit' to be a top rate education in the school of hard knocks with the intent of eventually moving human souls up out of the dark.

       I did read a bit of that, and this was my basic understanding also...which makes sense really.  You need struggle to grow, but who set the struggle meter on 10/10? Cant we grow with it on 5/10? Gesh.

       Of course they did.  Just like the Annunaki, however, the reptilians are only one of many species that had their hand in the Earth Human cooky jar.  We are said to have been genetically tampered with by no less than 23 different species throughout many millennia.

       It seems unlikely, you say, that humans were tampered with over different time periods?  Why ever so?
      </p>
      <p>
       The expanse of different time periods and eras is what ultimately makes the postulation all the
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       viable actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think that the tampering of the human genome was done once and only once and/or by only one species?  Some sources have said that throughout the history of the planet,
       <em>
        many
       </em>
       different species have come here and have tinkered a little bit here, tinkered a little bit there with the human genome.  This is part of the reason why we have so many different
       <em>
        types
       </em>
       of humans on the planet and the homo sapien species is so very varied in its genotype.  It’s not classical darwinian evolution.  Don't think that for a second.  Darwin got quite a lot of things
       <em>
        entirely
       </em>
       wrong - either by accident, or on purpose (perhaps he was ancient psyop - who knows).
      </p>
      <p>
       What I would consider really unlikely actually is if we
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       get tinkered with by many different species over many different time periods and eras over the course of our history on this planet.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        That's
       </em>
       what would seem entirely unlikely to me.

       didn't just happen "naturally" through however many years of "gradual evolution through natural selection and breeding".  The Darwinian model of evolution does account for some changes, yes, but it only goes so far and up to a point.

       Sorry.  It is a terrible post.  OP didn't even accurately summarize Epic of Gilgamesh.  He gets most of the characters/events/details completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enki does not go through the Ark in the story, for example.  It's like OP is just spouting gibberish.  The true Gilgamesh story goes more like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Enkidu was formed from clay and saliva by Aruru, the goddess of creation, to rid Gilgamesh of his arrogance. In the story he is a wild man, raised by animals and ignorant of human society until he is bedded by Shamhat. Thereafter a series of interactions with humans and human ways bring him closer to civilization, culminating in a wrestling match with Gilgamesh, king of Uruk. Enkidu embodies the wild or natural world. Though equal to Gilgamesh in strength and bearing, he acts in some ways as an antithesis to the cultured, urban-bred warrior-king. Enkidu then becomes the king's constant companion and deeply beloved friend, accompanying him on adventures until he is stricken with illness and dies. The deep, tragic loss of Enkidu profoundly inspires in Gilgamesh a quest to escape death by obtaining godly immortality."

       As far as I can see, this seems to be minutia that has lost the forest for the trees.  Regardless of whether it’s Enki, Enkidu, clay saliva, an ark, or whatever, the overarching point is still the same and is valid - and that is that it seems likely that a pretty good portion of our genetics as humans ARE NOT FROM THIS PLANET - and I personally very much like it when people post OPs like this one.

       1) There is no archaeological evidence for a tablet called the 'Emerald Tablet'.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) There is archaeological evidence for  Deluge Tablet in the
       <em>
        Epic of Gilgamesh
       </em>
       .  In the Deluge Tablet the reference is to
       <em>
        Ea
       </em>
       , not Enki  as you assert (same creature, but the Epic uses the former name, not the latter).  Thus, the confusion of Enkidu and Enki which follows from your post.  The name 'Enki' does not appear in the Gilgamesh narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) The Deluge Tablet is about Ea, but much is centered around Utanapishtim.
      </p>
      <p>
       4) According to your wild-eyed 'theory'"
 - Ea (Enki) is the devil in Christianity and Judaism 
 - Enlil is Jehovah
      </p>
      <p>
       However, even taking this crazy theory at face value for the sake of conversation, IS ABSOLUTELY BACKWARDS, because in the Gilgamesh narrative Ea (Enki) is the one who spares Utnapishtim through the Flood.   Ea (Enki) would CORRESPOND TO Jehovah  (notwithstanding the fact that you are totally wrong about that supposed corollary; just pointing out that you also got the names confused.)  and Enlil would correspond to the 'devil'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this is strictly for the sake of conversation because the entire hypothesis is wrong.  I'm just pointing out that there are many historical details badly confused in this post.

       About my interpretation of the Enki-Lucifer connection; the serpent in the garden is seen by occultists as the good guy. They drew their myths of Lucifer and later Satan from both the Hebrew represention and Enki EXCUSE me, Ea.

       All of these gods' names are adhered to by the occult, which is why I find your nitpicking of the Ea/Enki cariciture so frustrating.

       One question: why come down onto a planet for gold rather than mining it from asteroids at microgravity?

       I don't pretend to know the reasoning all I know is that we live here on earth, not an asteroid, and that the cuneiform says they

       Obviously I personally don't know about this one way or the other, but it was said that Earth had/has a pretty decent amount of gold as compared to other planets and planetoids.

       But at the bottom of a gravity well.  Whereas with an asteroid, you just blow it up, filter out the gold, and no need for rocket fuel, etc.  Everything's easier.

       All kinds of possible reasons still for choosing Earth, however:  They might have mined other neighboring asteroids already, they might have felt a base of operations on an actual planet with gold would be better than staying in space and blowing up asteroids, Earth in particular may have already been at a stage of development fauna, flora, and animal-life wise that was favorable to their operations, there's also some documentation if I remember correctly saying that they had already previously committed to Earth as a favorable base of operations, so since they were already here, they wanted to continue pursuing the Earth avenue further before moving on to anywhere else etc, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying that what you're saying is wrong or invalid, but ultimately, I can imagine many reasons why other possibilities might have been more advantageous and/or more attractive to them than microgravity gold mining on an asteroid.

       I disagree that it was about gold. Although widely publicized, I think Sitchin's interpretation is not correct.

these Annunaki beings.....

       Are they not advanced enough to have technology to make
gold without bothering with mining??
Like using some form of unknown alchemy or nuclear fusion?
Seems primitive to need to mine gold of all things.

       Why do you think it's a metaphor?
Just wondering.
The leap from soul to gold doesn't make sense to me
but then again, those that think the Bible is an allegory for
the physiological kundalini stuff....well it gets quite creative lol
(like angels going up/down Jacob's ladder, apparently symbolizing electrical impulses through the spinal cord nerves).

       I have read some of it yes. I have reservations with channelled material. You really don't know what is on the other end. Deception, false pretenses, slivers of truth mixed with lies, these are common with such material.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having personally felt negative entities messing with my "vibration" I guess you'd call it, I am extremely distrustful of material from these sources. Many times, just reading and pondering certain channellings brings.... I'm not sure how else to describe it but a very negative entity around me. I can feel it come, and go.

       Remember that biblically Satan and his angels were cast to the Earth.  They are around, not so much physically as consciously. And they are very smart. Before he was cast out Lucifer was the brightest, incredibly intelligent and most knowledgeable about creation, as he was the 1st angel. And he hates us.

       Check out the Law of One: Ra Material
      </p>
      <p>
       Extraterrestrials that are billions of years ahead of human civilization define Infinity as Unity, ultimately everything is part of All there is/Infinity and thus everything can't help but be the Creator/Universe experiencing itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nature of reality/existence is of Oneness. Everything is Divine, there is only truly Freewill. Law of One also talks about the creation story of "God"/existence as well in session 13

       Here are some favorite Law of One quotes from Q'uo:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The heart of your journey is to seek the Creator that is within you, the Creator that you are, the Creator that is all things. There can be no other way of looking upon an infinite creation of unity. The Creator took pleasure in making this, what you call creation, in order that it might know itself through the free will of each of its entities that it has created. From the Logos of every star within your skies, to the planet upon which you dwell, to each of your entities that you share the illusion with, each of you has free will to exercise however you wish. Each exercise of free will teaches the Creator more of itself, and fulfills the purpose of the illusion. Each of your actions reveals more to you of yourself, and if you are conscious of the seeking process, of the Creator itself, it is a journey of lovers, the creator loving you with unending love, you seeking and loving the Creator with a growing love. At some point, you will find the Creator, there is no other outcome for the end of this journey. At some point, the creator will know all that you know and will thank you for all that you have taught it of itself. At some point every entity within this great one infinite creation will coalesce again into unity, bringing home to the Creator the fruits of this journey through the octave of densities in which you now travel.

       <p>
        Let us look first at the first choice and that was the choice of the Creator to know Itself. In choosing to know Itself the Creator flung from Itself innumerable and infinite sparks of love which coalesced into each awareness that dwells within the infinite awareness. Each of those sparks of awareness is the Creator, and yet, because the Creator chose free will in the manifesting of sparks of self, each spark is unique and has been unique since before time began. Each of you is eternal and in many ways immutable, a citizen of infinite nature, worth and value. Each one a holograph of the Creator and yet each one different.
Thus, the choice that birthed each of you was a choice to know the truth, to know the self, and as the Creator is love, so is each entity love. This is the central truth. This is that which does not change. Yet this is that which is ever wrapped in mystery. Each within this circle has come through many planes of existence, has learned a great deal, and each within this circle chose not only this incarnation now being experienced but also that cast of characters with whom each entity interacts in the family, in the close associations of friends, and all those who have significant connections with the self. There were agreements made before incarnation, most notably with the parents and those within the bonds of kinship of blood and of commonality of interest. Each difficulty, each crux that leaves one in a position of being forced to discover the self has been placed not with a hand that desires to punish but with a hand of loving self that wishes to serve ever more deeply, ever more purely. -Q'uo @the_law_of_one (May 18, 1997)

       What you are describing reminds me a lot of the topics brought up in the book I'm reading The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind by Princeton University psychologist Julian Jaynes.
      </p>
      <p>
       He posits that humans were not always conscious in the manner we are now. That humans up until after the Greeks had their heyday historically were essentially psychologically bicameral in nature, thus the origin of gods in human culture. One side of the brain was creative and gave the orders (gods) and the other side robotically obeyed the orders. Essentially a division between will and action. As bicameral cultures grew (in ancient Sumeria) more complex the growing voices of the gods created a rich culture around the gods (not sure you could even call this religion or worship at this time) and creates almost a tower of Babel like cacophony of voices or wills. This is how the book explains the sometime rapid annihilation of great civilizations like those in meso/south america and say the Assyrians.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gist I'm getting so far is that on a long term scale whole cultures collective consciousness may be going through long term cycles of bicameral and more unilateral psychological models. The binary division you speak of between Enlil and Enki kind of sounds like what is being spoken of in the book. Perhaps a cultural shift back towards a bicameral social psychological state. There does seem to be a lot more interest in spiritual and new age type topics now so it doesn't seem so far off to me. Don't know, just rambling at this point.

       Good attempt.... but the truth is there is probably no God...  Might be some universal power..or we could all be in some simulation...or something... I'm not 100% ruling out.. but the bible stories/origin myths are all that  -- just myths..
      </p>
      <p>
       But you are close - it's quite possible their were powerful leaders called the Annunaki, or more likely just the first cults formed up around these. Everything in the bible though does come from the Sumerians... Garden of eden/Noah... etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion it's a nice story..and kind of funny, as I'm pretty sure the 'good' god is satan, the bad 'god' elohim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan/Enki wanted mankind to thrive, live, gain knowledge 'evolve' into something better and more advanced. Enlil/Elohim wanted mankind to be dumb slaves/mules...
      </p>
      <p>
       Later on when Enlil was cast out.. he found the jews and co-opted their traditions/life/ways and made them forsake other god's..etc.. Most likely 'he' didn't do shit... some 'cult' leader who was full of charisma/etc... probably did in his name.. he was a follower of Enlil, convinced the jews that he was the only god they needed....In the bible there are many verses that speak of other gods..etc.. so the bible isn't fully mono-theistic, it believes in other god's..but Elohim was the 'patron' god of the Israelites so to speak....
      </p>
      <p>
       If there really were a god though -- I'd want it to be Enki. Enki honored knowledge, and was more aloof. He didn't require obeisance, and wasn't a narcissist. He just reveled in his creations and was a scientist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elohim/Enlil ... he was power hungry, petty, narcissistic, I mean come on...if there's an almighty god do you really think he'd be so racist, and so hung up on people bowing to him? Then when we die we spend all eternity continuing to bow and kneel at his feet? I'd much rather a god that's more like a real father -- someone who listens/cares/but ultimately wants us to chart our own path and build our own legacy with or without them. Someone who could care less if we bow down and worship them...

       Sitchin spoke to demons through psychic connections. There was a video of him doing a handshake of the illuminati with the fbi guy that is now banned from youtube... Sitchin was also a free mason...

       proves there was never gold being mined. nor does it talk about Nibiru as a planet. Search the words of Enlil and Enki. Nothing of what SItchin said is there. And those are translations from multiple people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second of all how do you know if Enlil is bad or good. No one does. Third of all look at all the illuminati lizards.... theyre evil and they killed princess diana... theyre the sons of RA...
      </p>
      <p>
       Illuminati came to exist in 1776 so anything written before is the truth. 1611 Old Testament. Book of Enoch who walked with god.

       The God of the OT -- is like Donald Trump -- a total Narcissist... Worship me or die he says, --why would an all-powerful, benevelent God who loves all people be so obsessed with compulsory worship of us puny humans?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were God would you worry so much about the human race, when there could be millions of planets with other intelligent races on? Or would you be out there creating new worlds and keeping to yourself and just watching and reveling in how cool your creation is?
      </p>
      <p>
       God doesn't need us to worship him, and if he does it must give him some power - if nobody worships him does he cease to exist because there's power in believing in him? Like believing in fairies in Peter Pan?
      </p>
      <p>
       Truth is God is a Narcissist, Every God has been focused on 'being worshipped' ... this is a power control mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was first setup by rulers, kings, pharaohs -- in fact some of the first 'deities' were just pharaohs who convinced their constituents they were 'more than human' - just like OZ. Priests saw this power, and came up with Gods as another mechanism to control mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone fears death and  having 'answers' or 'control' over where people end up is extremely powerful. Thus the very first God and all subsequent gods were created by man in man's image to rest control / money and more power from people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of everything done in history has been done by people who are the 'elite class' to gain control/power over the 'weak class'. Religion, Politics, Wars, Money, -- all of it is one big huge game of monopoly and is all man-made.

       this site proves what Sitchin said is a lie. SO for all we know Enlil is the good one. In the bible it describes the pagan holiday Xmas... why would Enlil write in the bible about xmas before Christ came to life and foretold its a pagan holiday which it is since it makes everyone care more about gifts. which jesus said do not accept gifts from anyone

       Sorry.  It is a terrible post.  OP didn't even accurately summarize Epic of Gilgamesh.  He gets most of the characters/events/details completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enki does not go through the Ark in the story, for example.  It's like OP is just spouting gibberish.  The true Gilgamesh story goes more like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Enkidu was formed from clay and saliva by Aruru, the goddess of creation, to rid Gilgamesh of his arrogance. In the story he is a wild man, raised by animals and ignorant of human society until he is bedded by Shamhat. Thereafter a series of interactions with humans and human ways bring him closer to civilization, culminating in a wrestling match with Gilgamesh, king of Uruk. Enkidu embodies the wild or natural world. Though equal to Gilgamesh in strength and bearing, he acts in some ways as an antithesis to the cultured, urban-bred warrior-king. Enkidu then becomes the king's constant companion and deeply beloved friend, accompanying him on adventures until he is stricken with illness and dies. The deep, tragic loss of Enkidu profoundly inspires in Gilgamesh a quest to escape death by obtaining godly immortality."

       2) There is archaeological evidence for  Deluge Tablet in the
       <em>
        Epic of Gilgamesh
       </em>
       .  In the Deluge Tablet the reference is to
       <em>
        Ea
       </em>
       , not Enki  as you assert (same creature, but the Epic uses the former name, not the latter).  Thus, the confusion of Enkidu and Enki which follows from your post.  The name 'Enki' does not appear in the Gilgamesh narrative.

       3) The Deluge Tablet is about Ea, but much is centered around Utanapishtim.

      <p>
       4) According to your wild-eyed 'theory'"
 - Ea (Enki) is the devil in Christianity and Judaism 
 - Enlil is Jehovah
      </p>
      <p>
       However, even taking this crazy theory at face value for the sake of conversation, IS ABSOLUTELY BACKWARDS, because in the Gilgamesh narrative Ea (Enki) is the one who spares Utnapishtim through the Flood.   Ea (Enki) would CORRESPOND TO Jehovah  (notwithstanding the fact that you are totally wrong about that supposed corollary; just pointing out that you also got the names confused.)  and Enlil would correspond to the 'devil'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this is strictly for the sake of conversation because the entire hypothesis is wrong.  I'm just pointing out that there are many historical details badly confused in this post.
