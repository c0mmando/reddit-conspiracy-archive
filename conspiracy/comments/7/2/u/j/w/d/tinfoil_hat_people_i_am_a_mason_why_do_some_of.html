       You could say the same about many organizations today that need a meeting space. For example, I share a building with the International Order of Odd Fellows. That doesn't mean we are in any way connected. The same goes for shared membership. If a particular lodge has many members that are police officers, that doesn't mean that the two organizations are in cahoots.

       I didnt say they were, Im just saying this is probably why Masons are often considered Illuminati. Its pretty clear Weisshaipt recruited through the lodge. Im not claiming all Masons are evil scumbags or anything.

       Interesting concept, but most Masonic ritual and traditions predate the Bavarian Illuminati. If anything, the enlightenment era influenced them both.

       Pantheism, Its outside the usual judo-christian theme but i believe it makes far more sense. Most standing religions are one in the same even if the followers do not see it. We dont speak of religion in the lodges, the closest thing is reference to eras of religious history.

       I'm a Mason as well, 32°. Scottish Rite &amp; Shriner. We are not Illuminati. Almost all Illuminati start off in college fraternities. Some go to the Masons, Odd Fellows, etc., and further up the line.

       But regular Mason's are not Illuminati whatsoever. Just regular folks.

       Mason here, no joke, just swing by your local lodge and ask about joining.  If you're not sure where your local lodges are or when they meet, google "Grand Lodge of STATE" or "Grand lodge of COUNTRY/PROVINCE" (If you're outside the US) and they'll probably have a lodge locator tool.  Every lodge has a different personality, visit a few if you can.

       Well,
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       lodges don't have someone present all the time.  Mine tends to only have a Masons there Tuesday nights (there are some non-Masonic groups that meet there other nights).  It's as simple as finding out when their meeting is (should be posted near their building, online, and on their grand lodge site [might even be on your town's entrance sign if it has a Masonic lodge logo]) and showing up about 30-60 minutes before the meeting start time and getting to know them.  That's exactly how I went about joining and 2 years in don't regret it a bit.

       One more thing, depending on your location, is that there are some fake lodges out there that are basically pyramid schemes.  Checking your local Grand Lodge website should help you avoid those.

       Oh boy.. I said I wouldn't do this. As for the degree, it doesn't matter. There is nothing "higher" than the 3rd degree. When it comes to religion, everyone is welcome to practice their own faith (as long as they have one). The Illuminati happened to share some membership with freemasonry, but it was actually started by a guy who was disgusted with the youth of the day and the fact that they didn't care about taking higher education seriously. It lasted a short time before dying out. There is nothing special about the Bavarian Illuminati. They were just one of several societies centered on learning that came about in the enlightenment era.

       Except for the "honorary" degrees. You guys say theres no difference, but us profane, of course, wouldnt know. Also, what criteria does it take to be given the rank of 33rd degree, I hear earning this degree is very different than all the others.

       That is why I said "as long as they have one". Many people and organizations around the world feel as though you have to have some sort of belief system in order to have a solid understanding of morality.

       was right again in his response to you. the one addtion i will add is it up to you as to who or even what you're supreme being is and how you define him. Im pantheist, my god is everything in the universe including me and you and it has a lower case g.

       yes, that sums it up well. If only you all could be this sane. And yes all degrees outside the first 3 are purely symbolic and to due with delegation of different tasks within ritual. Thank

       What power, exactly? Most lodges spend most of their meetings arguing about light bills and many very historic and beautiful Masonic buildings are demolished or sold off every year. Here's a question for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       If Freemasons are trying to take over the world, and many know that several of the founding fathers of the United States were Freemasons, and let's assume that they did indeed use their Masonic teachings in the formation of the country, what the heck is taking us so long?
      </p>
      <p>
       We are talking about 300 years of organized Freemasonry (this year), and perhaps several more years before that. If we are trying to take over the world and turn everyone into lizard people, we sure are doing a terrible job of it.

       I really don’t mean to take it so personally. The problem is that people actually believe and devote their lives to the theory, which is a sad way to live. As for the above 33rd stuff, there are only a small number of 33rd degree Scottish Rite Masons (33 if I remember correctly). If they do exist, it would be a couple of old guys sitting around arguing about the bills, not trying to take over the world.

       I love when people quote Pike when it comes to Freemasonry. You understand that he was just a dude with an opinion, right? Morals and Dogma was his personal understanding of what Freemasonry meant. Nothing else.

       Absolutely, after this point. When the Scottish Rite first came to the United States, it was largely disorganized and the ritual wasn’t very good. Shortly after Pike received the degrees (again, just moral lessons), he set about fixing all that according to his interpretation. After that, the organization didn’t look at all like the original.

       was traditionally received by the candidate when they were initiated into the 14th degree and that practice wasn't stopped until 1974. I don't buy your excuse which was put forth by another person here and I'm perplexed as to how you don't have your own opinions on the book.

       I'll respond to your other comment shortly, but that's not what I meant by the right family lineage. I was speaking of ethnicity and bloodlines. I'm also not impressed by your boast about buying a house at 21. First  of all we don't know you personally so that comment is useless for everyone here except to show that you are arrogant to some degree. Second of all we don't know the circumstances of your wealth (and please don't bother writing out your stories that we can't prove).

       Do you think the British aristocracy depicted in their Masonic regalia believe to have the same status in the Masonic brotherhood as you or any of your ancestors?

       I don't even ask if you believe to have the same status but if you think
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       believe that.
      </p>

       Personally I can't see under any terms how

      <p>
       Why are they part of the "club"? Do they know more about the "club" than you and the majority of its members? Are there special levels in the "club" just for them and their ilk people like you will never have access to?

       I think the Mains are just one place Jews have recruited Gentile collaborators at certain times in the past. And that was only because that's where many powerful men could be approached in secrecy.

       It is just a title. He is not a master, nor is he worshiped in any way. The reason for secrecy (in my opinion, it will be different for everyone) is to keep it solemn and meaningful for the individuals. The oaths and ceremonies are symbolic so you can learn the lessons. Most do not originate with Freemasonry and are seldom historically accurate.

       I grew up in 7 countries with little to no foundation or structure. Im from a long line of masons and figured the brotherhood would give me the foundation and structure i needed in adulthood. also when i was a child i was in a terrible accident that killed my sister and broke over 30 of my bones. I was not getting the care i needed at the hospital and likely would have died, my godfather a mason, contacted brothers in the area i was living in and had them contact my mother and have me moved to a private shriners hospital that gave me everything i needed. Also i really like judo-christian history despite not being either.

       I have a question for you. I was born and raised in a very strict mormon household. I no longer believe in religion. They NEVER mentioned masonry to me as a child. I was never told just how much of the temple ceremonies were taken and used. It seems like something they would have mentioned at least once before I went(unprepared) and was overwhelmed by the strangeness of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think about the mormon temple ceremonies and do masons feel frustrated that it was stolen from them? Also, is it possible at all the Joseph Smith was killed by a mob of masons because he broke the blood oath by adopting various keys and tokens from your rituals?
      </p>
      <p>
       Any other insights or thoughts on the matter would be cool. Thanks for doing an AMA!

       I'm by no means an expert. I only know about Freemasonry from what I have read. I'll do the best I can to give you what I know.
      </p>
      <p>
       When mormonism was just being started it was deeply tied to freemasonry. All the early church leaders and many of prophets after joseph smith were deeply involved in it. At the time you couldn't really be a prominent member of your community without being part of the secret brotherhood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometime in the early 1840s the mormons in Nauvoo, IL came together and formed their own masonic lodge. I don't think this was a typical lodge. Joseph Smith was declared "Mason on Sight" by the grandmaster in IL and was immediatly granted the rank of third degree mason. From what I can gather making someone a mason on sight is somewhat of an honor and is quite rare. I think this lodge was a bunch of mormons doing their own thing under a poorly regulated masonic title.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mormon church shares a bunch of stuff with freemasonry. There are tons of symbols, vocabulary, and the temple robes. Too much to cover in a small comment reply. The mormon garments(magic underwear) have a square and a compass on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The secret handshakes and ritualistic hand gestures(known as signs and tokens) are another big thing. Mormons believe you give these signs to the sentinel angels guarding the highest kingdom in heaven in order to get in. I think masons typically use them as a means to identify other masons.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Joseph Smith was killed in carthage jail he supposedly ran to a window and put his hands up declaring "Oh lord my god" right before he was killed. Many people speculate he was actually calling for help from fellow masons but was cut off. In freemasonry the phrase "Oh lord my god. Is there no help for the widow's son?" is a secret keyphrase that a fellow mason would hear then be bound to help you out if you were ever in distress.
      </p>
      <p>
       These days mormons are discouraged from being masons. No one mentions how the roots of the mormon temple ceremonies came from freemasonry and the leadership aren't affiliated at all with the brotherhood. It's just a black hole of information that you really have to dig at in order to learn. This isn't new, mormons whitewash their history in an extreme manner. One of the reasons I walked away was all the church history that no one ever talked about and I could only learn about it by breaking rules and studying history books. Anything that doesn't paint mormonism in a perfect light is considered "Anti-mormon literature" and you are taught not to even look at it.

       Do any rituals ever seem to be spiritual, in any way?

       I had past family members who were Freemasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe any of them were very high up, it was more of a social club apparently. Booze and activities with some community service sprinkled in.

       Guys, the real players of the cabal are not low degree masons or lodge managers. The people within the majority of lodges are clueless to the higher ranked plans of true freemasonry. 
This dude probably has no clue masons and old occult religions like that of old egypt are connected.
He knows nothing.

       I appreciate the response.  I have always heard of the similarities and wondered how temple mormons reconciled their unique religious practices being so closely related to the masonic degrees.  Will be researching more.  Fascinating stuff.

       OP is a lying sack of shit. He commented on r/Freemasonry just 2 days ago saying that he was joining "next month" and asked what book to use. I guess he'll be a great mason considering how compulsively he lies.

       Disinformation is easy when you can pay out google/YouTube and media. Zionist are the "real" rulers of Earth and they're not real Jews. Jews and Masons are mostly wonderful people. But Zionist infiltrate any group with power against them. Everything is infiltrated.Now the sodium fluoride is loosing its effect, and we all wont answers in a world of pure lies. So the first clue is where most jump to conclusion. Sorry Masson now save us

       One more thing, depending on your location, is that there are some fake lodges out there that are basically pyramid schemes.  Checking your local Grand Lodge website should help you avoid those.

       Absolutely, after this point. When the Scottish Rite first came to the United States, it was largely disorganized and the ritual wasn’t very good. Shortly after Pike received the degrees (again, just moral lessons), he set about fixing all that according to his interpretation. After that, the organization didn’t look at all like the original.
