    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m honestly unsure about it all. Those Nazi&#39;s were some pretty intelligent scientists.</p>

<p>With so many saying we can&#39;t get passed the Van Allen belt, as well as them saying &quot;they choose not to go back&quot;, and &quot;the technology isn&#39;t there anymore&quot;, it leads to further questioning from someone like me. There are a few holes in it, and I don&#39;t accept that it happened because I&#39;m told.</p>

<p>I know they have the science worked out in terms of getting there and back, but, to me, with so much point counter point arguments, it&#39;s honestly hard to know who&#39;s paid to say what and who isn&#39;t. </p>

<p>A lot of people will say I&#39;m nuts for evening thinking that the landings could be faked ... but, at the time, during the space race, it was pride and economics on the line for such a race. JFK said they would be on the moon by the end of the 60&#39;s, and for pride as the best nation in the world, that was going to happen. It was also worth their while to stage it, to try and get other countries to waste their budgets on such projects, leaving them handicapped for other areas, such as military might and other technologies. </p>

<p>SO! I can understand why it would have been propagated to make it look like they went. And, then, once you start that charade, you pretty much have to live up to it, as it&#39;s a big piece of wool across the eyes of the world if so. </p>

<p>Yet, I do believe the technology would be there if it were possible to pass the van allen belt, which they are still looking for safe ways to pass through ... I mean, these missions were literally the only ones to do so with people, and no one has done it since. Not to mention they did it with very little study done on the VAB and in a craft with no extra shielding, which traveled through about 5 times as much of a lethal does of radiation. But, it&#39;s said that they plotted a course through thinner parts of this belt, to limit exposure. They could do all that in 69 on a $50 billion dollar budget, equal to about 270 billion today ... which really isn&#39;t impossible to replicate with the amount of money the US dump into various programs today.</p>

<p>It is interesting to wonder about. Some of the images are most definitely faked, as crosshairs are behind some of the images, lighting don&#39;t add up, landing craters aren&#39;t present (which should have kicked up some dust, unless it floated down like a feather - unlikely that a 500,000 lb rig empty, and 6.1 million lb rig loaded up didn&#39;t even stir a bit of dust, lower gravity or not), a lot of the pictures are perfectly framed even without a viewfinder (not saying he guys who potentially went weren&#39;t talented, it just leaves a lot of wondering).</p>

<p>So, honestly ... while I do seeing it being possible, many people tell different tales, and with 50 years gone by, there has been a lot of research or real material and faked material ... which leaves a lot of mud in the water, and some doubts in my mind. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is the best answer I have ever heard. I, myself, believe we did go but what they showed the public was all staged. They couldn&#39;t show us what was really up there. Why else would all these astronauts like buzz and Neil finally come out and say to the world, the things they said? If they were under confidentiality terms why would they admit it. They lived their lives, not being able to tell people the truth and it was bothering them so much that they finally admitted it. 
    If you went to the moon and saw that there were aliens there but your employer says you can&#39;t tell anyone what you saw, how would that make you feel? You would definitely want to tell people. 
And I don&#39;t see an advantageous motive for them to lie and say they saw aliens. Why would they risk their credibility by claiming to have seen aliens? I just don&#39;t see them risking their credibility unless it was true...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a good few interviews from some of these guys in their later years, and I agree with you there... they have said some questionable stuff, not in line with the original reports of what they found up there ... if they did go, haha. </p>

<p>I think with a lot of images surfacing now a days, there could be possibly more than what was said to be up there. </p>

<p>Also - the whole russia + US Space satellite is an interesting topic these days. They can&#39;t see eye to eye on very much, but, monitoring the moon seems to be one thing they do very much agree on. </p>

<p>Interesting thoughts. </p>

<p>Speaking of all this, I haven&#39;t gone down a good Moon rabbit hole in a long time... so, I&#39;m not even sure some of the evidence for either side that has popped up these days!</p>
