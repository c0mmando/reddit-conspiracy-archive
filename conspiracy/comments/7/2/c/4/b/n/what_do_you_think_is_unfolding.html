They are coming back, I have seen them.  All kinds of shapes, things from the sky have fallen, are falling, are coming back and are back.  Think of microbiotic life, swimming under a microscope - or deep underwater creatures of all shapes and manner of movement.  They are everywhere now - some slow, others plodding, others rotating even bright flaming objects, streaking at incredible speed - like lightning.  Everywhere, they will be - you will see, there will be no safety or place to hide.  Satan and his hosts being now cast down, the boy and woman safe - It has turned to us all, for revenge and destruction.  There will be a war unreal, unlike anything anyone has ever seen.  Surreal, yet so real and terrible beyond imagination.  Comes our champion - Jesus and his hosts - and the arch-angels and forces of the aspects of our planets.  The spirit of the solar system united, of places above, below, right, left - and in the middle - will unify to obliterate the abomination of it.  The very root of evil will be burned beyond nonexistence, thrown to an abyss beyond the shadow of even that styggian reach.</p>

<p>Translation of Broadsheet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the morning of April 14, 1561, at daybreak, between 4 and 5 a.m., a dreadful apparition occurred on the sun, and then this was seen in Nuremberg in the city, before the gates and in the country – by many men and women. At first there appeared in the middle of the sun two blood-red semi-circular arcs, just like the moon in its last quarter. And in the sun, above and below and on both sides, the color was blood, there stood a round ball of partly dull, partly black ferrous color. Likewise there stood on both sides and as a torus about the sun such blood-red ones and other balls in large number, about three in a line and four in a square, also some alone. In between these globes there were visible a few blood-red crosses, between which there were blood-red strips, becoming thicker to the rear and in the front malleable like the rods of reed-grass, which were intermingled, among them two big rods, one on the right, the other to the left, and within the small and big rods there were three, also four and more globes. These all started to fight among themselves, so that the globes, which were first in the sun, flew out to the ones standing on both sides, thereafter, the globes standing outside the sun, in the small and large rods, flew into the sun. Besides the globes flew back and forth among themselves and fought vehemently with each other for over an hour. And when the conflict in and again out of the sun was most intense, they became fatigued to such an extent that they all, as said above, fell from the sun down upon the earth ‘as if they all burned’ and they then wasted away on the earth with immense smoke. After all this there was something like a black spear, very long and thick, sighted; the shaft pointed to the east, the point pointed west. Whatever such signs mean, God alone knows. Although we have seen, shortly one after another, many kinds of signs on the heaven, which are sent to us by the almighty God, to bring us to repentance, we still are, unfortunately, so ungrateful that we despise such high signs and miracles of God. Or we speak of them with ridicule and discard them to the wind, in order that God may send us a frightening punishment on account of our ungratefulness. After all, the God-fearing will by no means discard these signs, but will take it to heart as a warning of their merciful Father in heaven, will mend their lives and faithfully beg God, that He may avert His wrath, including the well-deserved punishment, on us, so that we may temporarily here and perpetually there, live as his children. For it, may God grant us his help, Amen. By Hanns Glaser, letter-painter of Nurnberg.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything is always unfolding. Those with eyes to see have always had this eerie feeling inside of things being out of whack and about to snap back. There&#39;s a case to be made that the universe is in the process of rectifying itself right now and I would partially agree, but it&#39;ll never be la-la-land. We are in living in times of revelation, regardless of whether or not I mean in the biblical sense. The world is being revealed for what it is. The truth is there to see among a sea of old and new bullshit. A needle of gold in a mountain of shit, but it&#39;s there.</p>

<p>There&#39;s lots of stuff on the horizon that may or may not come to pass, from economic collapse and extinction to post-scarcity prosperity. It&#39;s up to everyone of us to choose which path we&#39;ll follow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That would be around the beginning of adolescence, and a very typical point of realizing that the world is neither what you&#39;re told it is, nor what it could be. A lot of people get a similar sense, but I would say that most of them suppress those feelings very quickly or ignore them until they go away. To some folks it will never occur that something is wrong.</p>

<p>The critical point, in my view, is that we seem to be approaching a tipping point of people who 1) realize that things are not the way they could be, that 2) there are better ways s of doing things available to us and that 3) there is no good reason for why we shouldn&#39;t abandon our old ways and embrace new ideas that encourage the fulfillment of our full human potential.</p>

<p>Have you heard of the 100th monkey phenomenon? It&#39;s the reason why we&#39;re being actively divided along superficial lines of  little practical importance. If all of those who are already awake just realized how many others are awake or waking up too, we would instantly become an unstoppable force. I think we&#39;re already seeing that take place right now, though, there&#39;s still a lot of confusion and dissonance being seeded or flourishing naturally among us, creating chaos and uncertainty on its own. I&#39;m hopeful that this dissonance will resolve itself into harmony soon and then develop this March we&#39;ve been marching to into a joyous Waltz.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>have to look at the 100th monkey thing.  I agree with all of this.  I think meditation and just being good and calming your mind and having no thoughts allows you to just &quot;know&quot; things and i think thats what is reffered to as a &quot;gut feeling&quot;.

<p>They need it now more than ever as their stranglehold is loosening with Trump, Brexit, and Alt-Right, etc. But the evidence for life outside of earth&#39;s atmosphere is still nill.</p>

<p>Eventually liberal scientists in cahoots with the MSM will just make it up. For months if not years Yahoo news, for example, has been priming us with near daily stories of unexplained radio signals, newly discovered planets, Mars &#39;artifacts,&#39; etc.</p>

<p>This will start as a supposed radio signal of extra-terrestrial and intellignet origin. At first it won&#39;t be dicipherable but it&#39;s mere existence will be heralded by the Left and MSM as a complete rebuttal to the Bible and everything &#39;Bible thumpers&#39; believe and stand for. Gradually new signals from this &#39;civilization&#39; will be &#39;translated&#39; and we will learn that they are highly advanced due to their rejection of rascism/sexism/homophobia and their embrace of climate change science, socialism, single planet governance and pan-sexualism. They may even throw in some backstory about a tragedy that befell this planet in its past due to their denial of climate change, which they were able to overcome only through Globalsim. It will quickly become &#39;archaic&#39; and &#39;unscientific&#39; to question any aspect of the Libertarded &quot;Open Borders/Open Anuses&quot; agenda since all of Liberalism will have been &#39;proven&#39; by these aliens and the Utopia they have allegedly built through science worship, socialism, infanticide, and unrestricted gay sex.</p>

<p>The planet will be too far away to visit or for them to visit us, or for conversations to take place in real time. We will have to take at face value the scientific elite&#39;s word about the messages&#39; existence and content. Conspiracy theories will circulate but there will be an aggressive disinformation campaign and those who question the validity of the official account will be vilified by the MSM and possibly criminalized.</p>

<p>When this shit starts to go down, don&#39;t believe the hype</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism is falling apart and it&#39;s plain to see to anyone not ideologically brainwashed to hold it up on a pedestal like it&#39;s <em>literally</em> equitable to freedom. </p>

<p>The London Interbank Exchange Rate, LIBOR- which is used as the basis for $300+ <em>trillion</em> in financial markets, including <em>a majority of US mortgages</em>- is based on <strong><em>absolutely fucking nothing</em></strong>. It is completely made up. Nobody here talks about that <strong><em>ever</em></strong> but there&#39;s a ticking time bomb to a global financial meltdown. </p>

<p>Self driving cars are coming within a decade at the very latest, and they are going to put nearly 20 million truck drivers in the United States <em>alone</em> out of work. The people who are like &quot;well there will always be more jobs&quot; never stop to ask &quot;who will pay to retrain all these drivers?&quot; If you&#39;ve been paying any attention at all to our political system you&#39;d understand that these people are going to be left to rot. </p>

<p>And it&#39;s not just the truck drivers, but think about allllll the rural towns across America just barely holding on thanks to interstate trucking stopovers. All the numerous industries dependent on this spread of revenue. All of it will be fucked. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s just <em>two</em> of numerous looming crises. The student loan bubble is another one. It&#39;s already killing consumption in nearly every industry. How many hundreds of articles have you seen along the lines of &quot;Millennials are killing X&quot;? It&#39;s almost like our jobs are shit, our pay meager, and we&#39;re up to our eyeballs in debt that we were raised to believe was necessary. Go to college, get a good job! Ignore economics/politics/reality. Regardless of your feelings on personal responsibility or whatever (meaning your feelings don&#39;t change reality) this is another trillion dollar bubble waiting to burst. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t even going into the general agreement that we&#39;ll reach a general AI by 2045 or so. I&#39;m no luddite, I&#39;m not against AI development, but all you pro-capitalism people... do you not understand that it&#39;s going to master <em>very much</em> <strong><em>who owns that AI</em></strong>? Is anyone here comfortable with Google, or any other private owner, holding ownership of the AI which will put you out of work forever? Or of the AI which will make this Orwellian nightmare of surveillance complete, by allowing all of this mass data to actually be analyzed in real time? Even barring ideological issues with ownership, do you not see the economic catastrophe presented by AI when it&#39;s advanced enough to do literally everything you can do? When AI replaces engineers and doctors, what happens to the engineers and doctors? How are wage laborers to survive if there is no longer any demand for labor? </p>

<p>God fucking help us all if any of these crises occur simultaneously, because it will get <em>bad</em>. Again, this is a <em>small</em> list of potential crises, it&#39;s far from exhaustive. </p>

<p>Anyway, as a result IMO what we&#39;re going to see unfold is a rise in support for various forms of socialist ideology as well as an anti-communist reaction from the right pretty closely paralleling Weimar Germany (it&#39;s almost like people look for alternatives when the system is collapsing). The US dollar is going to be continuously weakened as a result of maneuvering by China, Russia and India and this will only intensify domestic events as our monetary policy is no longer sufficient to support consumption at home. Shit is going to get really bad for a lot of people, and if it gets bad enough that the elite believe that both capitalism will fall and the fascist reaction will also fail then I believe we&#39;ll be looking at an extremely large scale foreign conflict to both rally &quot;patriotic&quot; anti-communist support as well as distract from the general economic turmoil experienced at home. I don&#39;t think anything else will be sufficient to maintain their power if things get bad enough, and even this might not work. </p>

<p>P.s. just want to mention before anyone gets triggered about communist authoritarianism, libertarian socialism exists. Maybe you weren&#39;t taught about it in school (I wasn&#39;t- I wonder why that could be?), so look it up. When people start framing everything in terms of free market capitalism or government owns everything socialism, maybe you should ask why you&#39;re presented with a false dichotomy where the elites win either way? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with a lot of what you said and also agree that AI could be a very bad thing.  In the other hand if we can use it correctly we could provide a world where people can go do what they are passionate about and love to do because we have all of the jobs being done for us.  We could build a utopia.  Whatis stopping us from doing that? Ill tell you, we are raised to be self-centered empty stupid shells of human beings.  They purposely magnify negative everything in the world and love, kindness and friendship is viewed as being weak and silly.  Society needs to get its head out of its ass and start thinking for irself again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, under Capitalism, &quot;we&quot; wouldn&#39;t be the ones using it. It would be whatever individual or corporate entity owns that ai. So, say it was Google. That AI would then have access to massive databases full of the personal and psychological records built by them every time someone uses their services. I&#39;ve been reading that there are algorithms now that can create accurate predictions of your behavior with only a few likes on Facebook. </p>

<p>So how does that sound? An intelligence able to have more &quot;thoughts&quot; in a nanosecond than a person has all year, with unrestricted access to a complete profile of everything they&#39;ve ever liked or said or been to, and the practical omnipotence of a massive multinational corporation, turned against them explicitly to exploit them for profit. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We could build a utopia. Whatis stopping us from doing that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re part right. It is &quot;society,&quot; but just like every other society in history the people within it are culturally shaped by the dominant social conditions, and in the world today, those conditions are Capitalism. It has no use for kindness or empathy or any of that crap, because the &quot;good&quot; choice <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons?wprov=sfla1">can leave you at a serious economic disadvantage</a></p>

<p>And that&#39;s aside from the constant, <em>constant</em> indoctrination people are subjected to in the form of things like advertising. This is especially bad in places like the US where you can advertise directly to children. It&#39;s an industry that exists explicitly to manipulate people without them realizing it, and is so ubiquitous that people don&#39;t even blink when they encounter it. So pretty much from infancy people are being influenced and indoctrinated with the &quot;values&quot; of Capitalism, which are almost entirely negative. You&#39;re not good enough, not pretty enough, not smart enough, not <em>complete</em>, without this or that product. And the only way to get that product? Money, which in turn necessitates a whole social system based on exploitation and ceaseless competition, where your value as a person is measured not by your deeds or accomplishments, your virtues or vices, but by how much money you have. How you got it doesn&#39;t matter, just that you have it, and as much of it as possible, by any means. </p>

<p>We can have Utopia, but Capitalism has to go first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not wrong, although there are a few particular characteristics of fascism which are absent in our government there is absolutely a case to be made that there has been essentially a merging of corporate and political authority. However, it is capitalism which ultimately enables this to occur. These corporations are privately owned and leverage their immense influence on behalf of their shareholders and corporate officers.</p>

<p>I recommend reading Trotsky&#39;s <em>Fascism: What It Is and How to Fight It</em> for a bit more information, iirc he makes an argument that &quot;the seed of fascism is endemic to capitalism&quot; based on the class relations present under capitalism. I might have that confused with another book though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I already have trouble convincing my friends that capitalism <strong>today</strong> is failing to improve life with the yields of automation.
Imagine convincing them that the worst is yet to come.</p>

<p>It seems as though indoctrination into capitalist ideology is largely successful even with individuals who can access the internet.
The notion that wage labour relationships are more exploitative than mutually beneficial in our time of abundance is considered by many a regressive, communist one. These aforementioned friends have better than average understanding of economics, and their lives directly depend on wage labour, yet they wouldn&#39;t want anything to drastically change.</p>

<p>A fact that must sink in at some point, is that labour relief thanks to automation <strong>should</strong> be a good thing. Then all there&#39;s left to understand is why people still keep working the same hours while others lose their jobs, and who benefits from each salary fewer to be paid. I filled in those blanks quickly, but I honestly don&#39;t know what to do with the people who haven&#39;t already. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you seem real caught up on this Hurricane John business. Apparently you&#39;re so sure Hurricane John is real, and you say maybe it&#39;s explained by Mandela effect, or maybe it&#39;s explained by memory implantation, why nobody remembers Hurricane John except you. However hurricanes and tropical storms are specifically <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml">named on a schedule.</a> There is no storm that meets the criteria to be named John, therefore there is no way there would be a storm named John. And the most reasonable explanation for this is not a Mandela effect with alternate dimensions, or memory implants with some worldwide conspiracy and future technology, rather the most reasonable explanation is simply that you are mistaken, which is totally normal and happens all the time. Please get your shit together bro, I say this as an encouragement. Cheers</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How would these implants work? Who has the ability to secretly change the memories of entire populations at any time? Let&#39;s follow this reasoning, let&#39;s think about this. If someone wants to change our memories and confuse us, that means he is against us, he is our enemy. And if there is a very powerful force, so powerful that it could change our memories at any time, that means this force can also do great harm to us, because it is very powerful and has total control over everything we believe. In other words, if someone is implanting these memories into us, it also means he is very powerful, and he wants to hurt us. Do you follow? So explain this: if someone is very powerful, powerful enough to change our thoughts, and someone is also our enemy who wants to hurt us, then why isn&#39;t he hurting us any more? He could do whatever he wants to us. Make us believe the rapture already happened, make America believe Russia launched bombs and Russia believe America launched bombs. So if he has this power, and he wants to hurt us, why doesn&#39;t he hurt us?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After years of randomly reading bits of conspiracy media here and there the conclusion I have come to is that perhaps back during the times of the roman empire, or soon before it, a secret society emerged that sought to create a world order they felt would sustain the test of time.
Plenty of people have their views on existence and what could be the best scenario for humanity.
Just like Phillip K Dick, The Matrix and so many more movies and books have described, we are living in a virtual reality that was constructed for us by &quot;TPTB&quot;.
What we&#39;re going through right now is an amusement park ride on the way to a future imaged for us by many individuals, I only hope it works in our best interest.</p>

<p>At this point there are really only two answers to the Fermi Paradox, one being that we are in a form of &quot;virtual reality&quot; or a plane of existence isolated from an actual multiverse and the other scenario is that earth-beings have been in contact with E.T. for quite  some time.</p>

<p>What is happening on the macro-scale, that being the European crisis, middle east wars and the US, these are just steps towards the greater plot of this story.
Globalized society, people forced into clusters of megacities followed by space exploration/colonization.
Space colonization could already be going on for all we know and if that is true, then I think people have already made contact with aliens.
Maybe they have been for thousands of years or more, maybe it was the Nazi broadcasts into space that attracted them ... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Even if we act to erase material poverty, there is another greater task, it is to confront the poverty of satisfaction - purpose and dignity - that afflicts us all.</p>

<p>Too much and for too long, we seemed to have surrendered personal excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things. Our Gross National Product, now, is over $800 billion dollars a year, but that Gross National Product - if we judge the United States of America by that - that Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage.</p>

<p>It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl.</p>

<p>It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts Whitman&#39;s rifle and Speck&#39;s knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children.</p>

<p>Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials.</p>

<p>It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.</p>

<p>And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.</p>

<p>If this is true here at home, so it is true elsewhere in world.&quot;</p>

<p>european bankers took over wall street in 1913 and used the might of the us to continue conquering the world..  the same players (enhanced with wall street) financed the nazis and the soviet union.  mao was enabled by &#39;yale in china&#39; and after he consolidated his power wall street (via kissinger and nixon) &#39;opened&#39; to china.  the same financiers created the european union.  and finally we have the same players expanding to new blocks such as the brics and sco. </p>

<p>today all this is one block, a singular power structure, but they must pretend they are fighting each other, to keep it secret how consolidated they are.</p>

<p>it is just like 1984, no joke.</p>

<p>so not too many players left really, more like rich vs poor class struggle or at least industrialized nations plundering poor nations with natural resources game at this late point.  neocolonialism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I watched the youtube message put out by David Jeremiah on this question:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_W273I2CU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_W273I2CU</a></p>

<p>(it sticks mid-way at about 08:30 but if you bump it along it picks up about 09:50)</p>

<p>Firstly, David Jeremiah is a fairly solid Christian teacher--not one of my favourites--but pretty solid; however, I’m conflicted on how far he’s sticking out his neck here.</p>

<p>Secondly, while the infomercial is fairly interesting, my primary objection is that while Rev. 12:1 reports “A great <strong>sign appeared in heaven</strong>...”, to my mind, the sign should be visible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>The infomercial uses computer techne to describe this scenario of Leo plus Mercury, Venus and Mars over Virgo with Jupiter in Virgo for nine months--and all this as seen from Jerusalem with the tie in of the blood moon and full solar eclipse 2017.</p>

<p>I don’t know: I still feel inclined to think a sign in the heavens should be visible with the naked eye.</p>

<p>I could be wrong...keep looking up...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My best guess is there will be a big asteroid swarm hit ... not earth destroying... but enough to put us back 50-75 years in technology.</p>

<p>We the people will be struggling for electricity and petroleum, totally dependant on a post-asteroid emergency government.</p>

<p>A generation after that... E.t. drops in on Earth to save us with advanced tech.</p>

I see these posts everyday almost about having a &quot;vibe&quot; or gut feeling&quot; that something is happeningabout to happen, but it never does or people put 2 and 2 together and come up with 7 to justify their needs. Even if something were to happen you can&#39;t do anything that will have any impact other than arguing about what you think about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Spiritual war. Ragnarok is coming around. Give your life to Odin and prepare yourselves for the worst, but hope for the best. </p>

<p>The elite have summoned something awful and used the powers we are all blessed with against us. They have made us fat, lazy and complacent. They put fluoride in our bodies to block our third eye, which is the foundation of all astral work. </p>

<p>They put chemicals in the food to keep you fat and ignorant while you watch the next rerun of a reality tv show instead of meditating and honing your power. </p>

<p>They let you spin your hamster wheel day in and day out to stop you from realizing your potential. </p>

<p>They dress your women as sluts and tell them to put out to every man they half glance at. </p>

<p>They tell your children they are the wrong gender before they can even comprehend basic algebra. </p>

<p>They rewrite history and tell you that you are wrong for knowing otherwise. </p>

<p>They tell you to hate the blue team or the red team because of your alignment. Look at my username. Do you know how often i get straight vitriol for it before people even know my reasons for supporting the president? </p>

<p>Split us into individuals without families or morals and with enough complacency to allow our children to get abducted, used in rituals and birthed of barbarians. </p>

<p>We will never see an outright war. We will see one side win and the other lose. Then the new normal shall prevail. If we win, life will be great, with plenty of hard work rebuilding our lives</p>

<p>If we lose, we wont have much of a life to rebuild. We shall become the slaves of the elite or stains on a wall. </p>

<p>Odin will prepare you as warriors. He will release in you a new resolve you have not known. He asks only for your strength and devotion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I support trump simply because he is upsetting the balance. The right introduction of chaos into the system will tip the scales in our favor by simply changing the rules of engagement. </p>

<p>Do i expect to own a home with a white picket fence and be a CEO in 8 years time? God no. Do i expect the deep state to have showed its head and be at the prime position to be struck, absolutely. </p>

<p>Odin is the only god (aside from Kek) to have actually given me results. I am a pagan and have worked with everyone from the Christian Jesus, to Satan, to multiple demons and the overarching energy of the universe itself. Odin sent me a message in a dream that <em>he</em> had chosen <em>me</em> so i arranged a meeting in the astral. </p>

<p>Deals were hammered out, terms were agreed upon. My life is much better now than it was in the past few months. I wear a valknut daily and have asked him to brand my soul with it (your soul can feel pain btw. Hurt like a mother fucker. Havent felt that much pain in a while. Worth it though) </p>

<p>The main reason he recruited me (according to him) was for my ability to work with the multiple dimensions. He needed my knowledge of such abilities to seek out solutions for Ragnarok. He could not get this the conventional way i presume due to the nature of it. Its a bit of an ability I&#39;ve honed over the last decade or so. </p>

<p>We exist across multiple dimensions and are constantly shifting (especially since the hadron bullshit broke reality) our perception between them. Become aware of this and you can use it to shape reality however you choose after a while. There are costs of course, but thats for another day if anyone wants to know the details.</p>
