    <div class="md"><p>Hmmm Well what if the other multiverses all worked like that? It would be a narrowing down and not an expansion. The very concept of a multiverse implies expansion into multiples, not a reduction to a singularity.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There can only be a finite number of multiverses as the physical laws of reality only allow for certain possibilities. The soul is also a finite resource that must be divvied up at conception (which is why we start out so simplistic obviously and advance as realities collapse and our soul grows back together). </p>

<p>However eventually the physical form cannot cope with so much soul in so few iterations and deteriorates with every version of yourself lost. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our Physical laws don&#39;t necessarily apply to all multiverses. Especially one in which a rapture could happen as it seems to defy physical laws. One being self preservation.</p>

<p>And the best way to preserve ones soul would be to make it everything but finite. Even though a life may be considered finite in our perception , it&#39;s only because the Infinite versions of it are not perceived. Because we do t perceive them all does not necessarily mean they are impossible. Or have been narrowed out of the souls experience somehow.  On the contrary, our soul has become so large that out of necessity we have narrowed our own perception to create a universe within it.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB5oURGTuOM">Lurking Among Us Hidden in Obscurity,
Descended from the Dawn of the Ages,
The Children of Yig And Set,
Serpent Volk.
Whose Civilaztions were Ancient,
Long Dead And Forgotten
Before The Eldest Pyramids were Built.
Man Was Not the First
To Walk Upright Upon the Earth.
Cruel, Pitiless, of a Cunning Mind.
Unwilling to Relinguish Dominion of the Earth.
They Are Cold, Knowing No Remorse.
They hath Made UnWitted Slaves of a Blinded Humanity.
They walk amongst us Unseen,
Possessing Empty Human Shells.
Consumed by a Reptile Mind,
Reveling in Sodomy and Rape
And Unspeakable Horrors Exacted Nightly Through
Astral Dreamscape Manipulation.
They Feed on Human Suffering.
They crave the Despairing of Man.
They Prey upon Those who are weak,
The Young whose minds are Innocent,
And those grown Weary and Exhausted
In a Decadent Civilization.
Cruel, Pitiless, of a Cunning Mind.
Unwilling to Relinguish Dominion of the Earth.
They Are Cold, Knowing No Remorse.
They hath Made UnWitted Slaves of a Blinded Humanity.
Seemingly Lost in Meditation,
Their Cold Eyes
Stare Sightlessly into Nothingness.
But they are not there.
Nay, they hath Left their slithering forms,
Lurking, Skulking, Crawling on the Astral Plane,
Stealthily Defiling Forever the unwary minds
Of those who Sleep Unguarded.
Committing Perverse Acts of Torment,
Violent Sexual Atrocities
Of Which None Dare Speak,
Once they Have Been Awakened.
And thus they keep us Ever Subjugated,
Hopeless, Fearful
And despairing in the Deep Hidden Abysses of our Souls.
Helpless, Unable to Escape the Unending Quiet Desperation.
We have Been Broken down
Conditioned to Accept Unconscious Slavery.</a></p>

8/21 - 9/30 = 40 Days</p>

<p>Day of Atonement is on 9/30.  God gave Ninevah a 40 day warning, which started with a <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/tomhobson/2017/08/jonah-eclipse-ancient-nineveh/">solar eclipse</a>.  Ninevah repnted, thanks to Jonah.</p>

<p>However the same eclipse appeared 99 years ago, and 40 days later, <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/113882/remembering-the-world-war-i-eclipse/">WW1 started</a></p>

<p>This 9/23 sign was the &quot;7 day warning&quot;.  But this time it is not to a specific country, but the entire planet.</p>

<p>The hammer is going to drop.  Here is why the 9/23 prediction was wrong, and why 9/30 is the important date:</p>

Not necessarily thinking myself deserving of Heaven, but not necessarily believing in it to begin with, i am still in the researching stage. To be reading about biblical cosmic events and then watching the sun have large solar flares after it has seemingly been asleep was and still is disconcerting. Regardless of dogma, i am probably being naively optimistic reading gnostic texts in search of a heads up pre-apocalypse. </p>

<p>I cant speak for all of us, but from one nut who believes the myths have meaning, and genuinely tries to impart that, I apologize for any fear wrongly sow. </p>

<p>I do think the end of the age is evident, though. The whole world is thinking differently, and our societies are moving towards... Something. I am optimistic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t speak for OP, but I understand the Bible as codified in the sense of using multiple levels of metaphor. Through that lens, its stories and morals reflect C. G. Jung&#39;s theories of archetypal psychology and consciousness to an uncanny degree.</p>

<p>Its true that much meaning was lost in translation (though its less distorted than you make it out to be, as most modern versions are translated from the original Greek manuscripts if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>Its also true that some of the most important chapters have been banned by the catholic church, such as the book of Enoch, the gospel of Thomas and The gospel of Mary.</p>

<p>Still, keeping all those things in mind, there is an incredible amount of wisdom and truth to be found within it. If you want a rational, psychological and moral interpretation of the Bible stories, Jordan Peterson discusses that view extensively in his Bible lecture series.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you cite a passage for any of those things? It seems to me you&#39;re being much more selective in your reading than I am. I mean, I know those themes are in there, but not once have I read them as an endorsement.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not denying that those same texts can be misinterpreted and misrepresented to vile degrees, but I&#39;m claiming that there is a reasonable and arguably correct way of reading them. That claim is based on the thesis that the stories contained within the book are of profound psychological significance on an archetypal level, especially for a time in which psychology was far from having a name.</p>

<p>There is also a point to be made about those texts referring to the realities of the time. When it says that you shouldn&#39;t lay with another man as you do with a woman, it makes little rational or moral sense today but was good advice then. The likelihood of contracting a deadly disease through unprotected homosexual intercourse was much, much higher then. And assuming you had a family too (which was often the case for gay men at the time), such a fun little sexual adventure could quickly turn into a nightmare for a lot of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The incest thing is not specifically condemned in the story of Lot and his daughters. He does offer them up for a gang bang though, totally aspirational and just what every father should be striving for.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy has this to say about slavery and genocide:</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 7:1-2When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations . . . then you must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them, and show them no mercy.20:10-17When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. . . . This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby. 
     However, in the cities of the nations the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, do not leave alive anything that breathes. Completely destroy them—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—as the Lord your God has commanded you.</p>

<p>Not exactly a book to be used for arguing about moral superiority. Some things are the right thing to do, no matter what the norms of the day say are right. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the reply. You bring up a few crucial points.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The incest thing is not specifically condemned in the story of Lot and his daughters. He does offer them up for a gang bang though, totally aspirational and just what every father should be striving for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s true, but why would you think Lot&#39;s plan is somehow being endorsed by the Bible when the two angels – who visited him and who he wanted to protect from the Sodomites – stop him and tell him that&#39;s a dumb idea in the very next line? The angels simply turn the Sodomites blind and tell Lot to pack his shit, run away and not to look back. They tell him to do what&#39;s best for his family, accept his prior failings and weaknesses, be grateful for the chance to receive mercy, and not to look back. It&#39;s not bad advice. The offering of his daughters, in my eyes, is purposefully extreme to show what... I would say egoic cowardice is capable of. If you&#39;re familiar with Jerry Smith from Rick &amp; Morty, it would be that kind of character flaw.</p>

<p>At least that&#39;s my current understanding of the story, but I feel like I haven&#39;t spent enough time yet thinking about it. It&#39;s probably deeper than that.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy is more difficult to get a handle on because I&#39;m not as familiar with it. But I&#39;m going to suggest anyways that it might be the case that the Gods we as individuals, as well as tribally/culturally are representations of psychological archetypes. The typically imagined Christian God would be the manifestation of the ultimate creative harmony, Allah might be the manifestation of purity or something like that, and Lucifer might be something like the manifestation of desire and possession. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not necessarily a value judgment, but an observation about psychology. It may be the case that the God of Israel was not the same God Lot had dealt with, or who Jesus spoke of as his father.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Past translations (Greek, namely) had different words and Greek/Hebrew gematria tied to it as a system of interpreting the meaning of select words and passages via numbers to reflect hidden meanings for the adepts (those of the priestly class in mystery schools or connected individuals higher up in secret societies). All of language is a construct that creates meaning. The many tongues of confusion, brought about by the construction/destruction of the Tower of Babel (babble). </p>

<p>What we read now in English is so far perverted that to truly gather any form of intended esoteric meaning, you&#39;d need to read the English, and then highlight the passages you think could have hidden meaning, then figure out both the ancient Greek and Hebrew translations of the words, and then the number associated via gematria. Ultimately, depending upon the number meaning you arrive at, it could possess geometric, harmonic or astronomical significance.</p>

<p>Now, apply this method to MANY of the religious texts: the Bible, the Q&#39;uran, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Nag Hammadi library, the Apocrypha, the Book of Enoch, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Enuma Elish, the Atrahasis, the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda, the Tibetan and Egyptian Books of the Dead, the Upanishad&#39;s, the Baghavad Gita, the Mahabharata, the Vedas (I think the Rig Veda is the most easily accessible one), the Illiad, Odyssey and the Aeneid, and many other texts that hold meaning from a cosmological sense that I may have left out.</p>

<p>Quite a quest. Will take the whole of one&#39;s life, at the very least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there is one message, but many. Legit astronomical prophecy, perhaps done in the &#39;dreamtime state&#39; that shamans and aborigine/aboriginal tribes access, which seems to view both space and time in a completely different way than we do (everything is happening at once: past, present and future). Geometrical teachings ensured to last through the Age of Pisces because it has purposefully been formulated into such a widespread book of work. Coded messages in the here and now for secret, spy-like communication amongst puppet leaders and their handlers to follow a global agenda for the greater plan: that may be why there is a Bible in each hotel room. Could be spiritual teachings of love, by reading only what someone like Jesus is quoted as saying from &quot;his&quot; own two lips. I put &#39;his&#39; in quotations because Jesus as a person may never have existed, but rather could be an expression of a greater, ultimate reality that transcends the material realm, and him being referenced as a person was the best way to communicate the message of love itself. </p>

<p>I welcome any other thoughts.</p>

<p>Good to know. It&#39;s about understanding the universe eventually, and our role in it, I think, because it matters what choices we make, whether we go with the flow, or not.
As Leibniz said: &quot;Therefore, the universe that God chose to exist is the best of all possible worlds.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t remember that having ever been claimed before, did I miss something?</p>

<p>To my knowledge, there was a prophecy that predicts a 7year period of false peace, of which the beginnings was to be marked by an astronomical event that only happens once every 7000 years. That event was indeed yesterday. That&#39;s already pretty remarkable.</p>

<p>Why anyone would think that Nibiru would collide with earth on that day is a mystery to me, and at least part of that hysteria seems to be inflated by outsiders to knock down those who are trying to rationally comprehend the Bible and its significance.</p>

<p>What it means (if it means anything at all) to be living during the prophecied years of the seven years of tribulation remains to be seen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was predicted for 2015 most recently, followed by the claims that because it did <em>not</em> start in 2015, it can&#39;t start again until 2022. And then again in 2029. And then again in 2036. And then again in 2043. And then again in 2050. And on and on and on. Except that&#39;s all based on the 7 year Shimtah cycles, which predictors can&#39;t even agree on which seven year chunks those start and end on. 2012, 2015, and 2017 were all apparently the start of those.</p>

<p>And the eclipse the other week was supposed to kick it off this time. Oh, but no, it wasn&#39;t the eclipse, it was apparently a planet that nobody could see, that was gonna crash into Earth. Oh, but no, it wasn&#39;t gonna crash into the Earth at all, just fly past. And nobody could see it.</p>

<p>It was predicted for 2014 back when Kerry was trying to end the Middle East conflict by then, and 2014&#39;s blood moon was supposed to be the astronomical sign.</p>

<p>It was predicted for 2012, <em>also</em> about Planet X/ Nibiru, which nobody could see of course, and which apparently made excellent time through space to make it all the way back here for nobody to see it again. Halley&#39;s Comet needs 75ish years, but an invisible planet can pull it off in 5, I guess.</p>

<p>It was predicted in 2011, with the astronomical event being the comet Elinen passing between the Earth and the Sun, which was supposed to cause significant damage to the Earth, somehow, and also the comet maybe would just smash into the Earth? But that didn&#39;t happen.
Nothing happened yesterday.</p>

<p>And with regards to Nibiru, if you go back through all the non-space related doomsday predictions, you wind up all the way back at 2003, where Nibiru was supposed to swing through the first time around and kill most humans by causing the poles to shift, as foretold by a woman who claimed her brain implant let her receive warnings about Nibiru from aliens in the Zeta Reticuli star system. </p>

<p>Nibiru, the planet nobody can see or detect and which makes great time through space, didn&#39;t even start as a religious thing. It was aliens communicating through a brain implant. The same woman who was claiming Nibiru was causing EMPs in 2015 when it swung past, and pinning plate tectonics on Nibiru that same July.</p>

<p>Like, when did this thing even become a religious thing? Seriously?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That wouldn&#39;t surprise me since a lot of things we use coincidentally contain estrogen-mimicking chemicals. What I do know is that alcohol fucks with your balls and lowers testosterone. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alcohol use affects all three parts of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, a system of endocrine glands and hormones involved in male reproduction. Alcohol use is associated with low testosterone and altered levels of additional reproductive hormones. Researchers are investigating several potential mechanisms for alcohol&#39;s damage. These mechanisms are related to alcohol metabolism, alcohol-related cell damage, and other hormonal reactions associated with alcohol consumption. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, cans used in food and beverages use a Bisphenol-A liner to prevent the food from touching the can. <a href="https://www.livescience.com/17157-1946-bpa-bisphenola-levels-canned-soup.html">https://www.livescience.com/17157-1946-bpa-bisphenola-levels-canned-soup.html</a></p>

<p>BPA and similar chemicals, such as BPS, BPE, BPB, BPF, and HPP can be found in receipt and other types of paper, plastic bottles and other goods, foods in contact with plastic, etc. </p>

<p>I know of one canned food manufacturer who doesn&#39;t use one of these chemicals to line cans: Eden Foods. They use a vegetable resin instead. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He asked his can suppliers — three of them at the time — if bisphenol A was in the cans they were selling to Eden Foods. “I made hundreds of phone calls to these three manufacturers,” he said. “Remarkably, I couldn’t find out if it was in the cans I was using or not.”</p>

<p>The can companies didn’t have to disclose what chemicals they were using as long as they claimed it was a trade secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to define salvation in order to accurately ask that question. </p>

<p>I am a pessimist, existentialist, realist, but also a lover and classical pianist. Salvation doesn&#39;t mean &quot;God&quot; or a &quot;relief from life&quot; - we are here to live, required to live, because we simply &quot;are&quot;- that is to say, we exist and have a consciousness. If you feel a term such as salvation honestly saves you, believe in that; does not mean that I have to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How trite.</p>

<p>I betcha have understandings, and faiths in the significance of your life in relation to the lives of others!</p>

<p>By definition, self-transcendence is when the brain focuses less on the the self and can be understood as being connected to God or Nirvana. It is the sensation of feeling like you are part of a bigger thing.</p>

<p>Hehe, you see that there? you&#39;re just in hate with the word god, words are imaginary y&#39;know. These words are empty, I&#39;m arranging sigils and glyphs your individualized subjective self-referential mind associates with certain conceptualizations of potential actuality. The truth is you have no idea who I am and you&#39;d probably never ever truly grasp at the crux of it. I don&#39;t think in English, but rather neurotransmitters, holy integrations, and segmented emotions, words are secondary nature.</p>

<p>The fact that your eyes are skimming toward the right absorbing information transmitted across space-time and you&#39;re the consciousness that is self-aware is beyond words , it&#39;s awe striking isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>don&#39;t get caught up on words or you miss the magic as, mysterious ways is in</p>

<p>The important thing is the astronomical alignments that coincide with the date. We live in an epoch signalled to us by the Mayans, the mysterious inhabitants of Gobekli Tepe, and many others. The constellation Virgo rises with the sun on the autumnal equinox, and other planetary alignments appeared to coincide with the idea that a passage from Revelations was describing the star map of yesterday. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, any Christian preaching a pre-tribulation rapture is not reading their Bible correctly. Nowhere does the Bible indicate a rapture happening before the tribulation. That whole &quot;Left Behind&quot; crap is not scripturally accurate at all. Just like in the time of Moses, God will not take His people out of the land until His wrath is done (I think to try to bring as many people back to God as possible before it&#39;s too late). He obviously will keep His people safe and only pour it out on those who accept the mark, but that also doesn&#39;t mean we get off scot-free. Revelations clearly states that there will be a ton of martyrdom and all types of awful things the Antichrist will bring about to those who reject his one world regime. I think this whole time from the eclipse to Sept 30 is just a huge warning sign that the tribulation is about to begin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any so-called Christian who believes in the end times, a rapture at any time, or reads revelations as a contemporary happening is an embarassment to the faith.  Contemporary end times doctrine is less than 220 years old, it was pitched by Charlatans and Hucksters, and has no basis as a part of the Christian faith.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s something to ponder.</p>

<p>The CIA has some of us &quot;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ShrugLifeSyndicate/comments/6zcp2s/the_mind_one_of_the_worlds_greatest_dryhumor/dmxm7kd/">brainwashed</a>.&quot; I say that with a wink and a nod and a nudge to my fnord.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a magician (jester really, but I like to imagine I&#39;m not owned by a court). Watch this magic trick: the earth is flat, the CIA is weaponizing religion, and mole people secretly orchestrated the black plague.</p>

<p>How easily I can hide the truth in plain site!</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another:</p>

<p><em>The fool takes out a megaphone</em></p>

<p><em>Piss</em></p>

<p><em>Piiiiiiiiisssss</em></p>

<p><em>PIIIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSSSSS</em></p>

<p><em>The fool tosses his megaphone into his tool box</em></p>

<p>There, now everyone thinks I&#39;m an idiot! I could walk around spitting delicious secrets all over the internet, and everything I say is dismissed without a second glance!</p>

<p>Actually, that was what everyone was saying. Everything from the last year or two was leading up to 9/23, now 9/23 is the &quot;beginning of the end.&quot; And in 2018 or 2019, there&#39;ll be a new prophecy, the one that everything from 9/23/17 was leading up to, and once that one passes, people will say <em>that</em> was the true beginning, leading up to 2020 or 2021.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s because rapture probably isn&#39;t going to happen. Why because there are many different versions of the Bible. We don&#39;t even know the people who translated them personally so it&#39;s hard to know if they were really in Christ or God. So I can see how people really don&#39;t know wether it&#39;s real or not or just isn&#39;t. 
The end of the world will be like a thief in the night. Meaning all communications will not exist to tell anyone before or after? I know if something big like the end of the world will happen it would be like war. War has existed for a long time why would God have something like the rapture to save us. 
God will probably pick fighters or something to save some of us but not all. Some don&#39;t believe so he probably wouldn&#39;t save them but idk I&#39;m not God.</p>

When the door on the Ark closed for Noah and his family, 7 days later the flood waters came - as everybody outside was laughing, mocking and scoffing right up unto the water came.  Make no mistake, 9/23 was the final 7-day warning, out of a 40-day warning period (which started 8/21 with the great Solar eclipse, which comes back in SEVEN years). Seven years is the length of Jacob&#39;s Trouble (the Great Tribulation period).  Yes that eclipse comes back in 2024.</p>

<p>The 40-day Eclipse warning is also the sign of Jonah, which was only given to a wicked and adulterous generation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi! I&#39;m one of those morons! I&#39;ll keep my reasoning short so you all don&#39;t have to read much before shouting me down :).</p>

<p>I believe that a cosmic catastrophe is coming because there is a mountain of geological evidence that suggests our planet regularly undergoes cataclysmic events. Couple that with the mythology of every single ancient culture speaking of cataclysms and how they come in cycles, it paints a convincing picture that whatever it is, it will come back eventually.  Now some scholars and historians have postulated that a fair amount of old mythology is allegorical to celestial movements, so it wasn&#39;t out of the question that Revelations had that same allegory. Maybe it still does, we won&#39;t know until it happens.</p>

<p>But the point I am trying to make on this topic, and I&#39;m sure a lot of the others who share the same view, is that whatever it is; Nibiru, a brown dwarf star, a binary twin, a large rogue comet, Wormwood, Nemesis, and out of frequency object, it does exist and it will be back. And if you <em>listen</em> to our older cultures, it&#39;s going to be back soon. We&#39;re not &#39;moving the goal posts&#39; or whatever buzzword the hidden masters of r/topminds have given you this week, we&#39;re simply stating this will happen and it&#39;s worth taking warnings of it seriously.</p>

<p>OK have at it :). </p>

<p>It seems to be very light on evidence and very loosely reasoned. I don&#39;t think it is very persuasive.  If you were to assemble a large body of evidence, I would read through it.  If I had more alleged evidence, I would be more critical about the reasoning. E.g. &quot;All ancient cultures left writings about cataclysms.&quot; Yes, but we don&#39;t understand the details of those writings, and we don&#39;t have much reason to extrapolate from them.</p>

<p>The various speculations about Mayan calendars and the Great Pyramid are interesting reading. I would classify them as &quot;high strangeness.&quot; Conspiracy topics are IMHO stuff like JFK getting shot. Traditionally, decades ago, people published books about both categories with the same publishers, but that doesn&#39;t mean that these two topics are often relevant to each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for a very open-minded response! I of course have much, much more evidence and sources, all of my knowledge on this subject comes from several books on various aspects of the subject. I have listed them in several posts and I suggest if you&#39;re interested you track then down and give them a read :). I could of course write up giant posts where all the evidence and indications are listed,  have internet sources and even pictures!  But that would take a very long time and to be honest I&#39;m not going to do that so a bunch of smug neckbeards from topminds can reward all of my hard work by calling me an idiot and a crackpot. It&#39;s much easier to refer people to these same sources so they can be informed and formulate their own opinions based on a greater pool of knowledge to draw from, rather than a bunch of social prejudices.</p>

<p>I suppose the conspiracy aspect of this comes from the notion that the elites and the church know that this is the solar system live in and have chosen to hide that fact from people for their own nefarious purposes. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB5oURGTuOM">Lurking Among Us Hidden in Obscurity,
Descended from the Dawn of the Ages,
The Children of Yig And Set,
Serpent Volk.
Whose Civilaztions were Ancient,
Long Dead And Forgotten
Before The Eldest Pyramids were Built.
Man Was Not the First
To Walk Upright Upon the Earth.
Cruel, Pitiless, of a Cunning Mind.
Unwilling to Relinguish Dominion of the Earth.
They Are Cold, Knowing No Remorse.
They hath Made UnWitted Slaves of a Blinded Humanity.
They walk amongst us Unseen,
Possessing Empty Human Shells.
Consumed by a Reptile Mind,
Reveling in Sodomy and Rape
And Unspeakable Horrors Exacted Nightly Through
Astral Dreamscape Manipulation.
They Feed on Human Suffering.
They crave the Despairing of Man.
They Prey upon Those who are weak,
The Young whose minds are Innocent,
And those grown Weary and Exhausted
In a Decadent Civilization.
Cruel, Pitiless, of a Cunning Mind.
Unwilling to Relinguish Dominion of the Earth.
They Are Cold, Knowing No Remorse.
They hath Made UnWitted Slaves of a Blinded Humanity.
Seemingly Lost in Meditation,
Their Cold Eyes
Stare Sightlessly into Nothingness.
But they are not there.
Nay, they hath Left their slithering forms,
Lurking, Skulking, Crawling on the Astral Plane,
Stealthily Defiling Forever the unwary minds
Of those who Sleep Unguarded.
Committing Perverse Acts of Torment,
Violent Sexual Atrocities
Of Which None Dare Speak,
Once they Have Been Awakened.
And thus they keep us Ever Subjugated,
Hopeless, Fearful
And despairing in the Deep Hidden Abysses of our Souls.
Helpless, Unable to Escape the Unending Quiet Desperation.
We have Been Broken down
Conditioned to Accept Unconscious Slavery.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the record I&#39;m glad it didnt rain asteroids. Not necessarily thinking myself deserving of Heaven, but not necessarily believing in it to begin with, i am still in the researching stage. To be reading about biblical cosmic events and then watching the sun have large solar flares after it has seemingly been asleep was and still is disconcerting. Regardless of dogma, i am probably being naively optimistic reading gnostic texts in search of a heads up pre-apocalypse. </p>

<p>I cant speak for all of us, but from one nut who believes the myths have meaning, and genuinely tries to impart that, I apologize for any fear wrongly sow. </p>

<p>I do think the end of the age is evident, though. The whole world is thinking differently, and our societies are moving towards... Something. I am optimistic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to define salvation in order to accurately ask that question. </p>

<p>I am a pessimist, existentialist, realist, but also a lover and classical pianist. Salvation doesn&#39;t mean &quot;God&quot; or a &quot;relief from life&quot; - we are here to live, required to live, because we simply &quot;are&quot;- that is to say, we exist and have a consciousness. If you feel a term such as salvation honestly saves you, believe in that; does not mean that I have to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there is one message, but many. Legit astronomical prophecy, perhaps done in the &#39;dreamtime state&#39; that shamans and aborigine/aboriginal tribes access, which seems to view both space and time in a completely different way than we do (everything is happening at once: past, present and future). Geometrical teachings ensured to last through the Age of Pisces because it has purposefully been formulated into such a widespread book of work. Coded messages in the here and now for secret, spy-like communication amongst puppet leaders and their handlers to follow a global agenda for the greater plan: that may be why there is a Bible in each hotel room. Could be spiritual teachings of love, by reading only what someone like Jesus is quoted as saying from &quot;his&quot; own two lips. I put &#39;his&#39; in quotations because Jesus as a person may never have existed, but rather could be an expression of a greater, ultimate reality that transcends the material realm, and him being referenced as a person was the best way to communicate the message of love itself. </p>

<p>I welcome any other thoughts.</p>
