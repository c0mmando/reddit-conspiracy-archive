<p>Immediately after I just left the room and went on facebook and there&#39;s all these quotes on my newsfeed from pages I liked about not making a girl cry and girls crying and all that.</p>

<p>It is weird because I didn&#39;t have my phone or laptop around her. I think this is too weird to be a coincidence because stuff like that usually doesn&#39;t come up. WTF?</p>

<p><em>Edit. We just broke up. I just logged back into facebook afterwards again and <a href="https://imgur.com/a/9XH3P">this</a> was one of the first few things on my newsfeed. This is fucking ridiculous. (She thought I was cheating on her)</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah there was a supposed whistleblower (LARPer?) who supposedly was in the Air Force and worked at a data center or something. he supposedly wanted to tell us things, but instead of just coming out and saying it he beat around the bush.</p>

<p>one person asked if (the person) was on a list</p>

<p>the AF guy responded that its much worse than that</p>

<p>AF guy seemed to be implying that &quot;lists&quot; do not work the way you might assume, like there is not a list of &quot;9/11 Truthers&quot; and your name is either on it or not on it. </p>

<p>its more like there is a list of every Social Security number, and each SS number has certain words attached to it, mostly for advertising/marketing purposes. it sounds like this database was made by the government/military but used for private enterprises</p>

<p>so its your SS number that they are attaching all this info to, and it follows you whether you get a new phone, whether you move, etc.</p>

<p>each advertisement has a specific number, which is how they are able to send you the most appropriate advertisement, for example thru the google ads you see. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice break down and reminder.  After reading your reply I remember the fleeting account, whether larp or not... it sorta makes a lot of sense on a more/less nefarious scale (depending on how evil you think the act could be of course).  Man... that&#39;s sorta worse than more extreme lists (that come to mind).  It&#39;s basically the building blocks of all the other lists, and they are slowly whittling away at your pocket book while monitoring your consumption habits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is how it works as far as I know (I&#39;m no expert):<br/>
Every word your microphone picks up is being sent to a cloud where they are being analyzed instantly. It works similar to Siri on Iphone, it can analyze your words, your tone, context, emotion, gender, age etc in a split second. It can register crying as &quot;crying&quot; exactly.<br/>
We, the casual users don&#39;t have much insight on how these things work though.<br/>
 The sad truth is as long as you have smart devices you are being tracked. If you don&#39;t have them then you are still being tracked because there are many cameras in stores (especially in the United States) that can track your face, make a profile for you then register your facial emotions, time you spend on watching a product, shopping habits, payment you use etc then assign it to that profile.<br/>
This is modern world &quot;targeted advertising&quot; and you are a target (just like all of us).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My brother told me something pretty interesting once. A friend of his started noticing ads on his phone of things he&#39;d be talking about to others&#39; in person. </p>

<p>Basically to make more sense of it- if his friend would be talking to his gf about buying an air conditioner he&#39;d start finding ads for them on sites while surfing the web. Thing is, he hadn&#39;t ever searched for them on the web prior. Ads of a Florida getaway if he&#39;d talk about vacation, etc. Almost as if his phone was listening in and coming up w/ ads that coincided with his conversations. </p>

<p>I wonder if it was all just coincidence.  </p>

<p>Both of your phones are always listening, and if you use FB on your phones Facebook is listening to everything. Doesn&#39;t matter if her phone was in her bag. If you both are speaking loudly enough it can hear through a bag.</p>

<p>You have heard of Vault 7, I&#39;m sure... Yes your smart TV is listening.</p>

<p>same wifi</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what she was searching. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know this. Is this just conjecture or is there proof that fb is doing this? I also didn&#39;t have my phone with me but she did.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m thinking it was my smart tv but it so mind blowing that facebook did this in minutes, literally.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Facebook listening to you through your phone is not conjecture, just google it and read some of the articles. I do believe, however, that you need to be using the fb app on your phone for that to happen, or else be logged into Facebook via your phone&#39;s browser. Same shit on desktop/tablet. Google does it as well. Welcome to the future. Sucks! Total invasion of privacy, and if you use any of those services/sites/apps you agreed to it and allow it.</p>
