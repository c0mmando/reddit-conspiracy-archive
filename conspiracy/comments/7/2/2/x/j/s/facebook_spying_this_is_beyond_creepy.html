       I just had a fight with my girlfriend (she thought I cheated on her or something but I didn't) so she started to cry and all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately after I just left the room and went on facebook and there's all these quotes on my newsfeed from pages I liked about not making a girl cry and girls crying and all that.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is weird because I didn't have my phone or laptop around her. I think this is too weird to be a coincidence because stuff like that usually doesn't come up. WTF?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Edit. We just broke up. I just logged back into facebook afterwards again and
        <a href="https://imgur.com/a/9XH3P">
         this
        </a>
        was one of the first few things on my newsfeed. This is fucking ridiculous. (She thought I was cheating on her)

       Even crazier is they would be sending you specifically adverts based on her app eavesdropping.  Truly frightening.  I don't even use Facebook or have a smart tv, yet i get targeted ads based on conversations in proximity with my phone and tablet.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had my GPS on with Google maps while out of town last week for a concert.  Walking back to the hotel, my wife and I discussed getting some dinner and I got push notifications for restaurants near our hotel.

       Agreed, but I don't even use facebook.  My cell phone is brand new however, so whatever is stock on the device (lg g6) listens in too.  I'm guessing the plethora of Google apps preinstalled.

       yeah there was a supposed whistleblower (LARPer?) who supposedly was in the Air Force and worked at a data center or something. he supposedly wanted to tell us things, but instead of just coming out and saying it he beat around the bush.
      </p>
      <p>
       one person asked if (the person) was on a list
      </p>
      <p>
       the AF guy responded that its much worse than that
      </p>
      <p>
       AF guy seemed to be implying that "lists" do not work the way you might assume, like there is not a list of "9/11 Truthers" and your name is either on it or not on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       its more like there is a list of every Social Security number, and each SS number has certain words attached to it, mostly for advertising/marketing purposes. it sounds like this database was made by the government/military but used for private enterprises
      </p>
      <p>
       so its your SS number that they are attaching all this info to, and it follows you whether you get a new phone, whether you move, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       each advertisement has a specific number, which is how they are able to send you the most appropriate advertisement, for example thru the google ads you see.

       Nice break down and reminder.  After reading your reply I remember the fleeting account, whether larp or not... it sorta makes a lot of sense on a more/less nefarious scale (depending on how evil you think the act could be of course).  Man... that's sorta worse than more extreme lists (that come to mind).  It's basically the building blocks of all the other lists, and they are slowly whittling away at your pocket book while monitoring your consumption habits.

       Here is how it works as far as I know (I'm no expert):
       <br/>
       Every word your microphone picks up is being sent to a cloud where they are being analyzed instantly. It works similar to Siri on Iphone, it can analyze your words, your tone, context, emotion, gender, age etc in a split second. It can register crying as "crying" exactly.
       <br/>
       We, the casual users don't have much insight on how these things work though.
       <br/>
       The sad truth is as long as you have smart devices you are being tracked. If you don't have them then you are still being tracked because there are many cameras in stores (especially in the United States) that can track your face, make a profile for you then register your facial emotions, time you spend on watching a product, shopping habits, payment you use etc then assign it to that profile.
       <br/>
       This is modern world "targeted advertising" and you are a target (just like all of us).

       My brother told me something pretty interesting once. A friend of his started noticing ads on his phone of things he'd be talking about to others' in person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically to make more sense of it- if his friend would be talking to his gf about buying an air conditioner he'd start finding ads for them on sites while surfing the web. Thing is, he hadn't ever searched for them on the web prior. Ads of a Florida getaway if he'd talk about vacation, etc. Almost as if his phone was listening in and coming up w/ ads that coincided with his conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder if it was all just coincidence.

       Were you both on the same wifi, same IP address? Was she also searching "cheating" related content on Facebook or other websites that FB tracking cookies can see what you both are searching online?
      </p>
      <p>
       Both of your phones are always listening, and if you use FB on your phones Facebook is listening to everything. Doesn't matter if her phone was in her bag. If you both are speaking loudly enough it can hear through a bag.

       You have heard of Vault 7, I'm sure... Yes your smart TV is listening.

       I didn't know this. Is this just conjecture or is there proof that fb is doing this? I also didn't have my phone with me but she did.

       I'm thinking it was my smart tv but it so mind blowing that facebook did this in minutes, literally.

       Facebook listening to you through your phone is not conjecture, just google it and read some of the articles. I do believe, however, that you need to be using the fb app on your phone for that to happen, or else be logged into Facebook via your phone's browser. Same shit on desktop/tablet. Google does it as well. Welcome to the future. Sucks! Total invasion of privacy, and if you use any of those services/sites/apps you agreed to it and allow it.
