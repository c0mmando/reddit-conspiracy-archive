    <div class="md"><p>My mother was Australian and I&#39;ve always known about this.</p>

<p>There&#39;s little dispute that he was warned that the surf was extremely rough and went in anyway.  The real questions are &quot;Why would you do that?&quot; and &quot;What actually happened after that?&quot;</p>

<p>There are basically two schools of thought in Australia.  A minority think that he was wanting to commit suicide in a way that no one could be sure of - but there wasn&#39;t any really pressing reason for him to do that, and he seemed in fine spirits at that moment, even though he suffered from depression.  Still, it cannot be ruled out.</p>

<p>A majority think that he was foolhardy and believed that he could deal with any weather.  &quot;Poor evaluation of risks&quot; is endemic amongst politicians from the Kennedys to George W. Bush to the Clintons etc... and I lean toward that theory.</p>

<p>For years, I wondered with quite a lot of other people if he&#39;d staged a disappearance.  But pretty well everyone gave up that theory.  He was very recognizable, a gregarious family man, and it&#39;s been fifty years.  He would certainly have reappeared at some point, if only when the statute of limitations ran out.</p>
