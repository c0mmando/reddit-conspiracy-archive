       A quick look at his wikipedia page says the opposite.  He was one of the few western leaders who fully supported the US in Vietnam, and he allowed the US to establish their base at Pine Gap that essentially lets the CIA/NSA/etc bypass the constitution and spy on citizens.

       My mother was Australian and I've always known about this.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's little dispute that he was warned that the surf was extremely rough and went in anyway.  The real questions are "Why would you do that?" and "What actually happened after that?"
      </p>
      <p>
       There are basically two schools of thought in Australia.  A minority think that he was wanting to commit suicide in a way that no one could be sure of - but there wasn't any really pressing reason for him to do that, and he seemed in fine spirits at that moment, even though he suffered from depression.  Still, it cannot be ruled out.
      </p>
      <p>
       A majority think that he was foolhardy and believed that he could deal with any weather.  "Poor evaluation of risks" is endemic amongst politicians from the Kennedys to George W. Bush to the Clintons etc... and I lean toward that theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       For years, I wondered with quite a lot of other people if he'd staged a disappearance.  But pretty well everyone gave up that theory.  He was very recognizable, a gregarious family man, and it's been fifty years.  He would certainly have reappeared at some point, if only when the statute of limitations ran out.
