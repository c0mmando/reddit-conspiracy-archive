       I was in litigation, so doc review was always just one of fifty different things on my plate. I'd have liked it a lot more of I could have just done that, instead of squeezing it in after dinner.

       I left my practice years ago to go into consulting. We help clients do commercial negotiations. Much less money, but the improvement in quality of life is more than enough to compensate.

       Eh, it's not fun, but a lot of people really thrive on it. For all the pressure and bullshit, it can be a really intellectually stimulating and thrilling job sometimes. I do miss discovering a killer argument or catching someone in a lie under oath. And I definitely miss the money. Just not enough to put up with the various bullshit that comes with the perks.

       I did it for a while.  I noticed I was losing my health, and I had plenty of money but not enough time to spend it.  This quote really struck me:

       Totally sympathize. I never lost my health (I was probably skinnier back then, actually) but I realized after I quit how I'd been angry all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was lucky, too, we were doing pretty decent work for pretty decent people (suing hedge funds for fraud and such). I've got some law school friends who got pressed into work for Big Tobacco. I can't even imagine--not just sketchy clients, the work seemed extra boring and aggravating.

       No, I haven't seen anything like that which is why I referenced an Austrian economist who has a ton more insight into our economy than banking/finance  guys who are solely focused on running their businesses.

If you had anything juicy worthy of the r/conspiracy community, you would have lead the post with that. ooo, bankers have affairs. so do like 30% of married couples. here's a question: Is there ANYTHING that you would consider a conspiracy in ANY of the emails you have read throughout your career?

       Regarding your comment, we all understand, but the same can be said of the Nazis.  Most were just people like you and me that chose to be a cog in the system.  I believe that the elite would have a very hard time surviving if they lost their support system.  I cannot imaging a Rothschild breaking a sweat to get something done.  There is always someone there to do the labor and grunt work for them.  It is their weakness, but we are not strong enough to walk away.

       No, people commit suicide, it's part of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there were nefarious things going on with the "elites" I think I would have come across SOMETHING in the 3 years I've been doing discovery work, parsing through hundreds of thousands of high level emails and text messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       If "elites" do exist, they aren't the business people who you think they are. Further, they all must be magicians because they don't communicate with the people who you said would be necessarily for a "support system"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll tell you this, doing this kind of work has completely changed the way I think about business and capitalism. Through most of my life I've been a democrat who leaned toward being anti-big business. Because of the job market I was forced to take a job doing something I thought was against my core values and beliefs. I went in thinking I'd find a ton of evidence which would serve to  harden my own beliefs but what I found was just the opposite. People are just people, they may make mistakes but aren't out to screw everyone in the vast majority of cases I've worked on.
      </p>
      <p>
       random thoughts: In some of the cases I have worked on, the government either creates the problem or intensifies it and then just files suit against the company, hoping for a payout and a nice headline.
      </p>
      <p>
       I once worked a case where a company made a mistake, alerted government and then tried to fix the issue with a prompt and comprehensive response. The government stopped them from acting. Three weeks went by before the government finally allowed the company to go ahead with the exact same plan. The damage incurred in that three week period was enormous and could have been avoided but instead the government just held the company responsible for the additional damage and charged people with crimes. Headlines painted the company as evil and government as the hero, quite a sight to see when you have all of the facts in front of you.

       I deal with a certain Federal Agency, and the wrong type of people are attracted to those jobs.  I can't figure out why.  I mean, I have come across some that genuinely want to help, but they are overshadowed by the power hungry zealots that are looking for someone to kick.  This is the biggest reason we need to have a small government and term limits on public service.
