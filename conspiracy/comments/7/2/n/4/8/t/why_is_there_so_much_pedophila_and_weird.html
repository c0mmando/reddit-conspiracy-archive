       I don't know all the reasons, but one is that it's very good blackmail fuel. Once they have a video of someone forcing themself on a child, they know that person is now under their complete control.

       Before you ask "Why is this true?" you have to first ask "
       <em>
        Is
       </em>
       this true?" And the first step in answer that question is to ask "Is there evidence of this?" And then you read and use your critical thinking skills to decide whether the answer to that is yes or no.

       And there's the problem. If you mix together a couple of facts with a gallon of myth and misinformation then go "Whelp, that's enough for me!" then you're gonna reach incorrect conclusions.

       MKultra is not a weak argument, Bohemian Grove is not a weak argument, Jefferey Epstein and related scandals is not a weak argument, The Finders is not a weak argument, Jimmy Saville is not a weak arguement, The Keepers and systematic religious pedophilia is not a weak argument, Aquino and the systematic rapes occuring at military day cares is not a weak arguement.

       Again these are only a small number of countless CONFIRMED cases.

       Why do you refuse to budge? Large scale pedophilia groups is not a "conspiracy theory" they are real and documented people have gone to jail and been convicted the information is out there google any of the topics above, each one individually is enough to make an average person nauseous.

       Yes, those are all weak arguments if you're trying to assert that there's some shadowy globe-spanning network of pedophiles who secretly run the world.

       I am interested in what your opinion is though. To me it's pretty clear that their are some higher ups in entertainment, religion, education, etc who are actively involved in human trafficking. Using their popularity/ title as a front for their private life.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example, Ashton Kutcher has lead efforts against human trafficking. Yet, there is some pretty damning evidence against him.

       If you've been watching George Webb at all, you'd know that a lot of times honey traps are set up to let an actor/musician/athlete etc. have sex with a minor or kill someone for kicks, or some other kind of bad stuff, and afterwards use it against that person to extort their money or make them do or say anything. When you see people do cringe worthy shit, I bet sometimes its not their choice.

       Think of it this way. You and your associates are involved in social construction on a global scale, and you use this power for your own self enrichment. You do increasingly terrible things and all the while realise there is no central authority figure to regulate the behaviour of you and your chums. You know that history tells you that if the peasants become aware of what you're doing they'll (in theory) tear you apart in the streets. So after a short while the most pressing question is how does everyone at the top trust one another. If everything is done for your own self gain and nothing more, what's to stop one of your chums selling you out to take your stuff, because that's the point after all isn't it? To get more stuff? It's almost like what is needed is a system to ensure that everyone playing at the top has a very strong motivation to continue playing by the agreed rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       So a solution is to engage in the most heinous acts possible together. That way everyone has dirt on everyone else that should it ever see the light of day, would ensure bloody reprisal from the plebs. Because all are involved no one can rat out the others without going down themselves, so an element of trust is fostered among a subculture which by definition cares about no one but themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you add new players to the game? Via initiation of course! That way you can be safe in the knowledge that no one can ever rise to a position where they could screw you over and take your stuff because it would be suicide for them to do so. If people want to play ball at the top, they have to join the club. If they don't, they can't be trusted by the rest of the players, thus they cannot be allowed into the game.
