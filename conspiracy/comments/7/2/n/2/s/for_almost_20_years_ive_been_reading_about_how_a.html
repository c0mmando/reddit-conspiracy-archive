       In my mind, the best way to completely disable opposition is to render everyone homeless and starving. How many of us could survive if cash bought nothing?

       Kind of. They are trying everything they can to trash the US economy (war, 'natural disasters', mortgage crisis, salmonella 'food' crisis, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       After the economy is trashed, they will try to rush in and 'save' us. China will probably buy up all our dept if we give our sovereignty to them, or something of that nature. China is already wanting to form a new 'financial' world order, with their selves at the helm instead of the US.

       It sure does look that way. It keeps getting worse by degrees, has for a looong time, but this could accelerate the 'need' for all those paranoid conspiracy fantasies to be implemented for real. Up close and personal, in your face, slam-bang change... And not for the better. We need a revolution. Band together, solidarity, community. Exactly the thing the power elite doesn't want us to do.

       I've been seriously considering starting a kind of hippie commune. A sustainable community that's off the grid. It would be more like a gated community though, with our own "security"(and a weapons stockpile). Make it look like a commercial enterprise with a green sustainability business model.

       Yea, looks to be. However, the shadow people are not some grand invincible army, incapable of being decimated.
      </p>
      <p>
       They might say it from time to time, or at least allude to what they might like to portray as their indisputable might.
      </p>
      <p>
       But their power can be shattered, their treachery exposed. Realizing that this dark entity has no real home base, and is capable of striking out from behind many flags is a good start when attempting to develop strategies to expose them to the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are many and they are few.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are light, they are dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tiniest shard of light, can destroy the "great-est" mass of darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'd say we the people are in a pretty damn good position to cut this beast down. Remember, it is only a frail little man pulling levers behind the curtain.

       No, silly. Would you trust someone who is in a conspiracy? No? Then his co-conspirators won't either. Especially they, because they are inclined to think about conspiracies in the first place.

       Who are we supposed to worship now?

       Is it back to "Divine Right of Kings"? It seems kind of wrong to spring all this on the public at once without any warning or education.

       Since when are large, successful organizations or systems of any kind built entirely upon trust? Sheesh, I don't even trust a fraction of the drivers on the road, yet I am still willing to put my life in their hands in order to get where I need to be.

       That's a good question/point.  Perhaps if there are conspirators, they may believe they are doing the right thing -- they believe what they are helping to orchestrate is needed for our survival.  I don't know.

      <p>
       That may be the key question!  I'm not sure why I would think that (I'm not 100% convinced), other than there has been a steady stream of "propaganda" (for lack of a better word), since I was very young, that the US is a great nation, and it's sovereignty must be kept in tact.

       that is good for a laugh.  Now I'm sure that you guys think the 'intelligent' thing for me to do would be to engage with you in civil discussion so we could each learn more about one another's viewpoints.  But I'm smart enough to know that doing so would be just as productive as trying to talk to a Christian Fundamentalist about evolution.

       Honey, you're not making any sense.  First you imply you're smarter.  Then you define the 'intelligent thing to do' and do the opposite by budding in and insulting someone while they are asking a question -- hoping to get some attention.  Are you still upset about your big brother ripping the head off of your dolly?  Because you always act up when your dolly gets hurt.

       I'm sure that subtlety is beyond you, so let me explain clearly:
      </p>
      <p>
       I defined what I take
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       to think the 'intelligent thing to do' would be.  I'm inferring
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       perspective on that, just to be clear - I am not implying that I share it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I then follow this by explicitly denying that you have the correct conception of what the 'intelligent thing to do' would be.  I'm saying that you are wrong about it, and indeed that what you think would be the intelligent thing to do would actually be an
       <em>
        un
       </em>
       intelligent thing to do (given that rational dialog with conspiracy nuts is impossible).
      </p>
      <p>
       Did I make that clear enough, or are you still confused?  I know this comprehension thing is hard for you:(
      </p>
      <p>
       (and a note on style: you may think that talking about 'dollies' and so on is clever, but it actually just makes you seem really
       <em>
        weird
       </em>
       .. )
