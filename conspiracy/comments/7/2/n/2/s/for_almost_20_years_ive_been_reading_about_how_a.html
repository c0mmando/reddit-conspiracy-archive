<p>After the economy is trashed, they will try to rush in and &#39;save&#39; us. China will probably buy up all our dept if we give our sovereignty to them, or something of that nature.

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, looks to be. However, the shadow people are not some grand invincible army, incapable of being decimated. </p>

<p>They might say it from time to time, or at least allude to what they might like to portray as their indisputable might.</p>

<p>But their power can be shattered, their treachery exposed. Realizing that this dark entity has no real home base, and is capable of striking out from behind many flags is a good start when attempting to develop strategies to expose them to the masses.</p>

<p>We are many and they are few.</p>

<p>We are light, they are dark.</p>

<p>The tiniest shard of light, can destroy the &quot;great-est&quot; mass of darkness.</p>

<p>So I&#39;d say we the people are in a pretty damn good position to cut this beast down. Remember, it is only a frail little man pulling levers behind the curtain.</p>

<p>Since when are large, successful organizations or systems of any kind built entirely upon trust? Sheesh, I don&#39;t even trust a fraction of the drivers on the road, yet I am still willing to put my life in their hands in order to get where I need to be.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a good question/point.  Perhaps if there are conspirators, they may believe they are doing the right thing -- they believe what they are helping to orchestrate is needed for our survival.  I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>That may be the key question!  I&#39;m not sure why I would think that (I&#39;m not 100% convinced), other than there has been a steady stream of &quot;propaganda&quot; (for lack of a better word), since I was very young, that the US is a great nation, and it&#39;s sovereignty must be kept in tact.</p>

<p>I defined what I take <em>you</em> to think the &#39;intelligent thing to do&#39; would be.  I&#39;m inferring <em>your</em> perspective on that, just to be clear - I am not implying that I share it.</p>

I&#39;m saying that you are wrong about it, and indeed that what you think would be the intelligent thing to do would actually be an <em>un</em>intelligent thing to do (given that rational dialog with conspiracy nuts is impossible).</p>

<p>Did I make that clear enough, or are you still confused?  I know this comprehension thing is hard for you:(</p>
