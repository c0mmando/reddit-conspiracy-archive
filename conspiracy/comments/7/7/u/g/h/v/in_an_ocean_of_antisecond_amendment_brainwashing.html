        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><ol>
<li><p>Pennsylvania state Reps. Marty Flynn and Ryan Bizzarro were robbed at gunpoint outside the capitol building. Flynn, a former prison guard who is licensed to carry a concealed weapon, pulled his gun and fired when the 15-year-old robber fired his gun. Although no one was hit, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cops-pennsylvania-politician-exchanges-gunfire-with-would-be-robbers/">Flynn credited the fact that he had a gun with saving his life and Bizzarro’s</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>On Oct. 5, 2014, a man who ignored Texas’ laws saying concealed weapons can’t be carried into bars, shot and killed <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Reports-Two-men-fatally-shot-while-trying-to-rob-5800877.php">two of four armed robbers attempting to rob E.J.’s Bar near Houston</a>. Although many are hailing the patron as a hero, he disappeared after the shooting, probably, Concealed Nation said, because he would face felony charges for taking his gun into the bar.</p></li>
<li><p>Craig Everette, 23, a combat veteran and purple heart recipient, saved his aunt and her boyfriend in September when his aunt’s estranged husband came to their Pennsylvania house and started shooting. Everette had been inside, but when the husband showed up, he slipped outside, <a href="http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2014/09/da_he_saved_the_lives_of_the_i.html">armed himself and came back</a>, shooting the man to death.</p></li>
<li><p>In July, a psychiatrist pulled a gun and shot and wounded an armed patient <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/07/24/shooting-wellness-center/13113555/">who killed a caseworker</a>. The doctor, who wasn’t named, apparently had ignored the hospital policy against anyone but on-duty law enforcement carrying guns.</p></li>
<li><p>A woman’s adult son shot and injured his mother’s boyfriend, Tony Hardin, in Tennessee, after Hardin allegedly fought with the woman and chased her with a hammer, <a href="http://wreg.com/2014/06/19/man-shoots-moms-boyfriend-to-save-her-life/">threatening to kill her</a>. Hardin faces charges.</p></li>
<li><p>A father shot two armed robbers who were <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/husband-and-wife-open-fire-on-gunmen-who-try-to/article_29109617-bc56-534f-82e6-d36ccba40c38.html">using his 17-year-old daughter as a human shield</a>, killing one and critically wounding the other. The girl had gone to her car to get something when the two men approached her, pulled guns and told her to go inside the house. The girl’s father and mother saw the incident, both picked up guns and confronted the men, shooting them.</p></li>
<li><p>In May, a 51-year-old grandmother who <a href="http://americanmilitarynews.com/2014/05/great-equalizer-concealed-carry-grandmother-wins-firefight/">was approached by two men in a threatening manner went to pull her gun, for which she had a concealed carry permit</a>, when one of the men opened fire, shooting her three times. After being shot in the side and the hand, the woman pulled her gun and shot at the men. They were arrested later when they sought treatment at a hospital for their wounds.</p></li>
<li><p>A woman being dragged across a Texas parking lot as she held onto her purse in an apparent mugging attempt was saved when a nearby stranger, who was carrying a concealed weapon, joined the situation and <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/news/2014/04/29/two-suspects-who-dragged-mom-across-a-parking-lot-get-a-swift-lesson-in-texas-concealed-carry-law/">held the suspects, a man and a woman, at gunpoint until police arrived</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>A Detroit retired nurse pulled her gun and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2600888/Meet-pistol-packing-nurse-helped-stop-Detroit-mob-attacked-grandfather-got-help-boy-accidentally-hit.html">stopped a group of people from beating a man to death</a> in April. The man being attacked had reportedly hit a 10-year-old boy with his car, and he got out to check on the child when a group of men attacked him.</p></li>
<li><p>An 11-year-old girl shot and killed a cougar that was <a href="https://clashdaily.com/2014/02/girl-power-11yr-old-kills-cougar-stalking-13yr-old-brother/">stalking her brother as he walked toward their house</a> in Twisp, Washington. Her 9-year-old brother had killed a cougar near their home earlier in the month.</p></li>

<p>25x more likely to be killed by a gun in america than any other high income nation. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newscientist.com/article/dn17922-carrying-a-gun-increases-risk-of-getting-shot-and-killed/amp/">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newscientist.com/article/dn17922-carrying-a-gun-increases-risk-of-getting-shot-and-killed/amp/</a></p>

<p>If you carry a gun youre almost 5x more likely to be shot than if you didnt. </p>

<p>And if you try to defend yourself, youre even more likely to be killed with a gun. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/defensive-gun-ownership-myth-114262">http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/defensive-gun-ownership-myth-114262</a></p>

<p>Guns killed at least 80x more people than they protected. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2013/12/gun_ownership_causes_higher_suicide_rates_study_shows.html">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2013/12/gun_ownership_causes_higher_suicide_rates_study_shows.html</a></p>

<p>Theres 3x more suicides than homicides per year in the US. Around 80% of suicides were gun related. So youre much more likely to shoot yourself than be shot by someone else. </p>

<p>....They dont really sound that safe to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How do people not understand this yet?? Guns are fucking killing tools.  Why do people ask the question &quot;are guns safe?&quot;  of course not... That&#39;s why you have to be smart about it.  Lock your guns up, conceal your gun, engrain gun safety and respect into your children.  Guns will not be taken away.  It&#39;s that simple.  And here&#39;s the other simple truth: these crimes you linked will not happen with the normalization of mental health awareness. It really is that simple.  If the media put as much focus on teaching the importance of mental health as they push the &quot;guns are bad&quot; narrative, none of thus would be an issue</p>

<p>Since you are someone who openly admits to not be an American, I don&#39;t really feel bad saying this, but you have no idea what you are talking about. There was debate even among the Founding Fathers concerning this, but men such as Jefferson and Madison <em>definitely</em> believed in an armed citizenry to resist a possible tyrannical government. As Jefferson said: &quot;The Tree of Liberty is watered with the Blood of Tyrants&quot;. It was definitely conceived as a method to ensure resistability against the government, especially considering we had just had our own rebellion against what was deemed a tyrannical government.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s funny is the mental disconnect you seem to have here...there is no guarantee that your current form of government will exist in its same form in 10, 20, 30 years. Democracies and Republics fall, history has shown us this. It is absolutely necessary that a citizenry have recourse to Arms in the event that a tyrannical force imposes its will upon the government, likely through deception at the ballot booth (Tyrants often claim they are something else). Again, it is absolutely essential to have an armed citizenry to ensure the theoretical base of power always rests with We The People.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Again, my argument has been about where the theoretical power base lies. We, as a People, have the capacity to reform and cleanse our current government, and I believe political solutions exist. But the fact that we are armed also guarantees that we will always maintain this capability, regardless of who is in power. All that is needed is a collective awakening, and action en masse. The history of our Republic is filled with these moments- of decadence and corruption brought into check by the People. Seethe Gilded Age followed by the Progressive insurgencies of William Jennings Bryan and TR, or the Roaring Twenties followed by the New Deal politics of FDR.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll ad my own reasons, based in historical precedent. The Roman Republic didn&#39;t possess a truly armed populace...the monopoly of force was maintained only by the Patrician class, who could afford to equip their own groups of private thugs, or pay off gangs, at a whim. The Roman conception of Freedom was mere freedom from bodily harm...freedom over your own person, not Freedom to participate in the systems of the Republic...at least not for the Plebeians.</p>

<p>In England, the populace is disarmed. They have a Monarchy, with veto powers over parliamentary laws, and a history of Aristocratic control, not even counting the fact that 36% of all land in the UK is still owned by the same 200 families who owned it 200 years ago.</p>

<p>In these two societies...where did and does the theoretical power lie? Not with the People. With the Elites, always with the elites.</p>

<p>Now I turn to the United States...the People are armed, with an enshrined Right to carry such arms, and a cultural identity associated with it. Even if it never comes to violence, and armed populace ensures that even just theoretically, the power lies with the People. The key aspect of Republican (the system, not the party) politics is resistability- the capacity for a People to fight for and maintain their freedom within the context of the political system. An armed citizenry ensures this capacity for resistability always remains, no matter the circumstance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You ignore the different cultural history of the US and the UK and insert gun ownership as the reason for this. Also technically the monarch can veto yes but has not donr so since 1707 and assent was last gigen in person in 1854. Don&#39;t be naive ans think a veto could be used with no blow back, least of all from politicians. Just look at the fury of brexiteers who scream about the &#39;will of the people&#39;</p>

<p>Also by the late republic the patrician class waa very small really.  Yes there were optimates but they weren&#39;t patrician necessarily. The Plebeians had huge political power, far more than the American people do currently  (bit of a blow to your argument I&#39;d say).</p>

<p>Yes rich men used the Plebeians but the plebs also had much power due to the tribunician veto.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do not claim gun ownership is the sole difference between U.K. and US culture, I&#39;m using it to show how the theoretical power base of both societies is different.</p>

<p>And while the public may dislike a veto, if you read the guardian article you will see that the PM and cabinet change the bills before they are ever presented if faced with a veto threat...that is real power, even if not exercised.</p>

<p>You also did not address aristocratic control of the land.</p>

<p>Additionally, You have a fundamental misunderstanding of late Republican politics if you think the Plebs had any real power. While Caesar was advocating for land reform it was only ever going to be in he guise of him as &quot;representative&quot; of the People. The Plebs were never going to gain real political power. The last men before Caesar to seriously try this were the Grachi, and they were murdered by the Patricians. The only way forward after Caesar was one man rule. The Plebs did not have the power, the generals and heir loyal armies did. </p>

<p>My understanding of the late republic is fine thank you.  The plebs had far more influence than the average american citizen. Also the issues of the plebs were things that the optimates had to deal with. Such as the land issue, they certainly had massive influence over  them</p>

<p>End of the day America&#39;s rampant gun culture leads to your numerous mass shootings and other gun related violence. They don&#39;t make anyone safer and they wouldn&#39;t really prove a barrier to a gov takeover. Heard about what Australia did?</p>

<p>We can agree to disagree here. </p>

<p>Concerning U.K. Aristocratic control, I wasn&#39;t offering a solution, merely stating it is a serious issue.</p>

<p>We have our own elites in America but they are younger, based on capitalistic and monopolistic control of the means of production. Similar, but different problems. </p>

<p>I will gladly keep our guns to ensure the power ultimately rests with the people. You and I are fundamentally at odds here but that&#39;s ok. </p>

<p>Yes, but you actually <em>do</em> have Aristocrats...and they own 36% of all the land in the country. Hell, William and Kate legally own Cambridge, which they lease out and collect money to support themselves from. This is something that the US does not have...complete hereditary control of vast tracts of National land.</p>

<p>It is not illusive. The fact that citizens can bear arms means the theoretical power rests with them. Though our government is at the moment subservient to corporate and elite interests, the People maintain the capability to strike back both politically, as well as with arms if necessary (though I believe a political solution still definitely exists).</p>

<p>They may not beat a tank or drone, but if they are dead they arent paying taxes.  Not to mention that the army occupying American cities isnt exactly great for the economy.  Rich people cant stay super rich if their country&#39;s economy is crashing because the army is hunting down and killing gun owners.  Are people who dont own guns going to want to work at their corporate job when the army is fighting it&#39;s own citizens in the street?  Are they going to wait in line for the new iphone when fighting this is happening?  </p>
