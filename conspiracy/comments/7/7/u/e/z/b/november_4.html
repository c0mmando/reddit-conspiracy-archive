<p>George Soros just put $18 billion into his open societies foundation which funds these radical groups...

    <div class="md"><p>Yelling in a park no, but $18 billion can pay for more than yelling.. like rioting and likely weapons involved... they’re talking about knocking on doors and how all trump supporters are nazis etc (and to “punch a nazi”) large scale civil unrest should have some effect on the markets? 
the US dollar is not tanked right now, world markets depend on the US dollar as values are based on it (that is why the Chinese buying petroleum with the Yuan instead is a big deal)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have there been confirmed connections between Soros&#39; money move and this specific protest? And besides that, say he and/or his group was funding it, it would be very easy to trace an incitement of civil unrest to him (his billion dollar funds transfer was front page on NYT, so it&#39;s not necessarily secret or even being hidden). There have been more chaotic times in the US and we&#39;ve done fine. Our money is fiat and backed by IOU&#39;s, we print more than it&#39;s backing. </p>

<p>You think this relatively small group of agitators would act violently and then turn a nation of center-rightists into full blow armed commies ready to go at it with a group that is full of vets and trained public servicemen/women? Don&#39;t let the media hype you up. The only ad I&#39;ve seen so far is an hour and a half away from me in SF, it&#39;s not really a surprise. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are connections between Soros and antifa and black lives matter along woth other groups who have already been very troublesome... his open societies foundation funds them directly, and on top of that Soros has said his intentions himself in numerous publications and interviews. In spite of this I’m not aware of any legal action against him in the US, despite antifa already being declared a terrorist organization, at least in some states.</p>

<p>Can  antifa members beat US marines etc one on one (even 5 on one)? hell no. But can Antifa etc bomb things and create enough unrest in enough places to create a major problem? I would say yes.....</p>

They took out a full page ad in the New York Times for $100,000 and got 200 people.
People are finally waking up to the BS I guess, good news.</p>
