       From Fox News:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Campos was last photographed in public on Oct. 10, accepting an “SPFPA Hero Award” for bravery in the line of duty, while dining with Hickey and others at a high-end Vegas steakhouse. But soon afterward, investigators said that the security guard was shot before the massacre, raising questions about whether the hotel did enough to prevent the bloodshed."

      <p>
       From Huffington Post:
      </p>
      <p>
       " The two men were photographed together last week, as Campos received an “SPFPA Hero Award.”"
       <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jesus-campos-mandalay-bay_us_59e60a87e4b0a2324d1dea23">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What's interesting is the Huffington Post article actually hotlinks to the SPFPA website where pictures and a site existed for the event. The link now goes to a dead page.
       <a href="http://www.spfpa.org/news/spfpa-strong-honoring-our-heros.html">
        http://www.spfpa.org/news/spfpa-strong-honoring-our-heros.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Fortunately, someone archived the SPFPA award site:
       <a href="http://archive.li/dCCWh">
        http://archive.li/dCCWh
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, conveniently, climbing the front page of this sub at this moment is a post saying the pictures of the award ceremony are clearly legit/not altered or fake and anyone disagreeing is "crazy". What's really interesting to me is that the same submitter 6 hours ago submitted
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/77suvb/jesus_campos_award_picture_at_jesus_georges/">
        this thread
       </a>
       stating that there is no evidence outside "conspiracy sites" that this award ever took place.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks and feels as if this angle is being erased from history and overwritten with bullshit that it was never real and we're all just absolute dipshits for daring to remember facts.

       The less 'conspiratorial' explanation... which is still very interesting, is that someone tipped off the organization that this isn't the side you want to be on.  Any chance the people in that picture didn't think it was the guy on Ellen, and said we want nothing to do with this?

       We are assuming their motives in hiding information from the public are purely bad and covering up something.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if they are still looking for suspects?  What if there's an attack planned on, say, November 4?  You'd string the public along to catch the perpetrators, wouldn't you?

       I have no idea, of course, and after the Comey shit-show, I don't trust the FBI at all.

       If this is a one-off, and it really was just Paddock, wouldn't they have a ready narrative explaining everything?  Especially if he was a known-wolf and the FBI was involved.

       I'm trying to understand what you mean
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

Stringing someone along means to decieve them. And I think you might mean lone wolf maybe? Known wolf works too, just never heard it but I kind of like it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But you're right, they are making the story more complicated than it has to be if there's just the one suspect. Most likely answer is that the Mandalay Bay is potentially facing at least 556 lawsuits (going by the total reported victim count, 58 dead 498 wounded) for not preventing the attack, for damages, wrongful death, etc. The legal team and owners of MB probably recognized that immediately and concocted a story about having Campos heroically shot after the shooting began, then had to backpeddle on the timeline since that lie would inevitability be found. Either way, Campos being anywhere near the scene of the shooter gives MB ammunition for the legal defense to fight all of those lawsuits. I predict that we are going to see MB fight for years to pay out as little as possible to the victims.

       <em>

       interview, and MGM statements to the media. Deleting the award ceremony pics – which have already been widely published – from that website does nothing to erase that story.

       That thread just states/argues that the renovation wasn't done on that particular room.

       What I don't get is how he could possibly have gained so much weight in a week, which makes me suspect that photo is not of the guy who was on Ellen.

       stress usually don't bring on a huge appetite, usually makes people nervous and not hungry, he'd probably lose weight if anything, his eyes should be puffy and maybe even a little red from hard time sleeping etc.

       A lot of people stress eat. A whole lot in fact. Also keep in mind... He may have been put on steroids, antianxiety meds and antidepressants. There is really no way to tell how much weight he actually gained. We have no idea where he carries his weight gain at on a normal basis. We don't know if the award photo was shopped to make him look smaller. There are too many variables to say either way. There are very logical reasons he could have gained weight.

       Be wary for disinformation, it exists. A tragedy did occur that night, but keep your eyes open for optimists. Not your fellow peers, and citizens but foreign powers employing the use of disinformation and playing to your endearment to conspiracy theories to perpetuate their agenda of de-stabilization.  We aren't immune to de-stabilizing events perpetuated by foreign governments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Question everything
      </p>
      <p>
       Ps: If you accept that it was Jesus Campos on Ellen, you have to accept these photos of him reviving an award are manipulated. 40lb in 8 days is plain ridiculous for a person shot and that was under care and surveillance. It being produced by foreign powers isn't out of this realm, and therefore shouldn't dismiss it entirely. Something did happen. We don't know the whole truth. So it makes sense for other sovereign states to attempt to de-stabilize us. I'm not saying RUSSIA, who the fuck know.
      </p>
      <p>
       To put it in perspective:

      <p>
       If an event occurred, not only would your own state try and push its boundaries of governance on your life, how can other countries not find the dismay beneficial.
