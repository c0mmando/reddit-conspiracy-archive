    <div class="md"><p>Of course there is that, but look at the newest stuff coming out with women like riley reed and especially piper pieri. They look very young and their male costars look much older. The sexualization of the &quot;school girl&quot; is a stones throw away from blatant pedophilia. I&#39;m not saying ur sick if that&#39;s ur kink but realize you are fantasizing about fucking an underage girl, even if the actress is of age in reality</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Piper pieri, riley reed, etc. I&#39;m getting a lot of hate for this post but let&#39;s be real, porn is highly addicting and the more you use it, typically, you begin to need more graphic and hardcore content to do the job. With a huge population of people watching porn and very little discussion happening about the issue id say there is a high probability that people interested in advancing deviancy under the guise of sexual exploration are doing so. And it may not even be intentional. The porn culture may be going down an ugly road. Don&#39;t get me wrong, nothing wrong with having kinks but there are certain things that should be taboo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy shit bro, incest has been around for eons. Before pron. </p>

<p>What you are noticing is more non-makin-kids porn, i.e. same-sex, furrys, overwatch, etc.... porn that doesn&#39;t involve p in the v. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t care if you suck dick and you have balls, they care if you have children. They care if you teach your kids right from wrong (thats why ricegum, jake paul, danielle brigollie spellcheck are all assholes that are popular doing whatever they want, however they want) teaching our kids not to respect elders, not to question authority, not to think, just tap and press buttons and spread your ass cheeks baby. another thing you are seeing is the normalization of pedophilia beacause of weinstein, epstein, clinton, saville, etc... too many people are pedos, too many famous people are pedos, too many important people are pedos... from the vatican to washington dc, to your sons baseball coach and your daughters gymnastics coach, every where there are are pedos who have names to other more important pedos..... so by &quot;normalizing&quot; it now.. even Corey talking about it for years, MJ turning into a monster after being treated like one ... etc... its been happening for years so we can get to the point of someone like harvey to be outted and people are still coming to his defence... its amahzing to me utterly amahzing. </p>

<p>video of the wonder years kid gettin his ass grabbed... where to stop/start.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The second part of his argument, and one that he glosses over but deserves more attention, is the increased presence of incest porn on sites. Go to any major site and you&#39;ll see &quot;step brother step sister&quot; or &quot;mom and son&quot; or &quot;daughter and step dad.&quot; It&#39;s a relatively recent trend and it&#39;s a little disturbing. </p>

<p>I completely agree with your comment however. I&#39;m into more petite women, partially because I&#39;m not particularly tall, but also, people just like what they like. I believe OP&#39;s implication of this point was the attempted normalization of pedophelia, or attempts being made to make people interested in younger girls; falsely equating a small figure to that of a child. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with his point, but I do understand his point if it&#39;s in the context of trying to make people interested in younger looking bodies. </p>

<p>The man is spot on with the uptick in incest porn though. You&#39;ll see a particularly attractive thumbnail to a video, look at the title &quot;mom sucks son&#39;s cock&quot; or something to that tune, and that&#39;s when I nope out. Porn is quickly losing its appeal </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for your open mindedness. Young looking women are hot. I agree. BUT when you start contextualizing these actresses in scenes where the implication is that they are not of age (school girl, babysitter, etc.) it&#39;s a dangerously fine line to walk/stroke</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not just that either but you’re right. On OP’s not of body types and “incest” play, that’s moreso just ignorance on the subject. My gf is tiny and slightly boyish and is my “little”, or “babygirl”. You, from there, can assume the pet names she uses for me. I see nothing wrong with this type of play so long as it’s just that, play. As an FYI, both of us are responsible, mature and mentally balanced adults in our 30’s, and neither of us condone heinous sexual acts upon underage or non-consenting people. Nothing wrong with exploring sexuality, in just the same way that there’s nothing wrong with porn casting tiny/younger looking women. If you’re putting certain labels on people kinks, perhaps some self reflection is in order ;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, bdsm and bondage is hot and sexual exploration is good but there is a trend of porn stars that look young and incest related content. A lot of mainstream porn is coming out of LA.

Add to that the fact that she calls me Daddy. Perhaps what you see as incest porn is actually just sexual play that stays within the general confines of standard bdsm practice. Sorry, I definitely aren’t seeing what you’re seeing and boy howdy do I ever watch ALOT of porn lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think sex is viewed incorrectly and therefor people fall into a state of being manipulated.  All my life i was taught that sex is this special thing and blah blah blah.  it is there for procreation and it feels good so we keep doing it.  now if your not looking for procreation then your seeking pleasure.  this is ok.  your not a slut.  there are so many taboos and social constructs surrounding sex I understand why people question thier own gender and are completely confused.  If i want to fuck a dude, a chick, a chick that ised to be a dude, who gives a flying fuck? If i want to have a relationship with one person and marry them and vow my life body and soul to them then who gives a fuck? my point is tou cant be corrupted by it if you change your view.  dosney has us believe that we all will find true love and the one person.  the reality is thats not common and love in its real form takes work.  You can seperate that love though and make it physical.  physical pleasure is what its all about! Everyone has personal limits, you cant apply your limits to others.  I agree that porn can be a bit much but at the same time YOU decide what to watch.  Just be aware that the eyes are the window to the soul and your soul sits in your pineal gland and anything you view has an effect on the physical part of you as well as your soul.  if you decide to partake in the physical and enjoy it for what it is then the soul is not partaking.  if you should choose love with sex that is where your soul is involved and its more than physical.  i am rambling on because this is a complex topic for me and most but in the end try to shift your paradigms about sex and discover for yourself what it means to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mia Malkova is like 2ft tall dude. In fact a lot of women in porn are shorter than you think. Short women are chosen because 1.) they make the male pornstar look bigger and 2.) because with their proportions it&#39;s easier to exaggerate their sexual features at the right camera angle. And if anything, I&#39;ve noticed curvier women are becoming more popular.</p>

<p>But anyway, I think the increase in incest porn doesn&#39;t necessarily indicate either an increasing interest in incestuous relationships or an a conspiracy to promote them. I think the trend is the result of two realities of modern society: 1.) that the period of boyhood for males has been expanded (it is often into one&#39;s thirties that men finally report &#39;feeling like an adult&#39;), and (maybe) 2.) that due to advances in makeup, women&#39;s fitness, and sluttier fashion styles becoming more widespread, that women are remaining attractive for longer than before.</p>

<p>Basically what&#39;s happening is timid young men want to fuck MILFs who come on to them without them having to leave their house. The appeal isn&#39;t that sons are fucking their mothers, but that young-looking dudes are banging older women. The story isn&#39;t what gets people off, it&#39;s the models. Personally, I&#39;ve never clicked on a video because of the text underneath— what I do is think, &quot;Damn, that&#39;s a hot thumbnail,&quot; and click on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>just look at fashion models. they&#39;re underweight, thin, androgynous. gay fashion designers prefer them to look this way. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCPq6nORmLQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCPq6nORmLQ</a>
pretty fucked up. really promotes anti-female sentiment, makes girls feel fat even though they are non-overweight and average. i think i&#39;ve read it started becoming this way post-1950s; end of pin-ups/bust&amp;thighs, Marilyn Monroe, etc. probably globalization, Francophilia. fashion and pornography co-inspire each other. pornography thrives on taboo. plenty if not most of the media peddles a pro-gay sentiment, except that it&#39;s not about rights, but about sexualizing and perverting homosexuality to the point of taboo. 
there&#39;s economic incentive. just leads back to pornography. if something preys on taboos effectively it will sell better. are any taboos not exploited for monetary gain?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the documentary the talent scout points out that different countries have different ideas of beauty. I’m sure that besides a few countries in Africa (Mauritania), most cater to the preexisting and preconditioned consensus that the image of a skinny and young woman is preferable to anything else. From that point it’s just a cruel and dehumanizing business run by men that often leads to failed teen models being sold for sex. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP is right. The ads and suggested videos are put there to cause an increase in sexual deviation. </p>

<p>The same fucked up stuff is happening on youtube and its targeting little kids.</p>
