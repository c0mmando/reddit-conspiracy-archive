        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>And I&#39;m getting annoyed as fuck that people are saying &quot;look how long it took for this investigation to bring this to light... Trumps investigation will take a long time to bring truth too.&quot; </p>

<p>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong but the way I&#39;ve interpreted this story is that the FBI investigation started* in 2009 and ended in 2015. The investigation began prior to the uranium deal and it was kept from Congress and the public. So no, it didn&#39;t take this long for it to end... it just took this long to come out.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m not denying that there wasn&#39;t some kind of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign but I find it highly unlikely that as a non-political actor, he would have been able to achieve anything close to this level of corruption. </p>

<p>Edit: words</p>

<p>Edit 2: fixed the time frame. Investigation began in 2009 and ended in 2015. It began prior to the uranium deal and the FBI failed to inform congress of what had been uncovered when the deal went through in 2010. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me try to understand this. So suddenly people around here think Russia is corrupt and the FBI is trustworthy and we shouldn&#39;t be working with Russia? This kind of contradicts everything so many people have been arguing around here. So we should trust the FBI. Obama wasn&#39;t telling the FBI who and what to investigate. And Russia is super corrupt. We can all agree on that stuff at this pointm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve basically been explaining this in detail until I am blue in the keyboard.</p>

<p>Look at this image:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/TZrYgtb.png">https://i.imgur.com/TZrYgtb.png</a></p>

<p>It is the proof that started this avalanche of evidence. Hwne the Panama Papers were released, it proved Troika Dialog is a Russian front.</p>

<p><a href="https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=8a5bd4fb-2687-4cdf-9906-0a65f4d8d52b&amp;amp;filingTypeID=1">https://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;amp;filingID=8a5bd4fb-2687-4cdf-9906-0a65f4d8d52b&amp;amp;filingTypeID=1</a></p>

<p>That is proof John Podesta works for Russia. It is an LD 1 disclosure form. It shows he is getting paid by Troika Dialog.</p>

<p>Big picture, this means that the entire DNC is being kept in power by the Russians with Russian money.</p>

<p>But, it gets worse than that. Ruben Vardanyan has a lot of such companies, like Joule Unlimited that claimed to be able to produce clean energy from cyanobacteria... but was really just a Russian front to pay into the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to get people to listen for ages. The Clinton Foundation is a CIA front that runs pay for play and forensic interruption to keep it&#39;s clients out of jail. Not only that, the CIA has co-opted resources in Russian energy.</p>

<p>Russia isn&#39;t our enemy, they are our bitch and they have to pay into our protection racket. Meanwhile, the news is in the pocket of our intelligence community and it isn&#39;t meant to inform you, it is used as a tool of policy change where it 1) is always gradually asserting authoritarianism and 2) always hiding the activities of the intelligence community.</p>

<p>The evidence is everywhere, but the bare bones are as follows.</p>

<p>Podesta also received 100,000 shares from Joule, over 4 years.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4635">https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4635</a></p>

<p>(Here is Podesta&#39;s tax attorney: <a href="http://www.steptoe.com/professionals-John_Cobb.html">http://www.steptoe.com/professionals-John_Cobb.html</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://joule-unlimited.com/about/board">http://joule-unlimited.com/about/board</a></p>

<p>That is the board at Joule. All Russian CEOs, including Sberbank, Troika Dialog, Rusnano and Rosatom.</p>

<p>They all worked together to make the Uranium One deal happen.</p>

<p>But, it gets worse.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eO8ZHfV4fk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eO8ZHfV4fk</a></p>

<p>Chaika is exposed in this documentary that is banned in Russia.</p>

<p>Yuri Chaika was in put in power by Medvedev, but he indicates to an intelligence analyst that Sergei Ivanov is calling the shots.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/54/5410884_re-insight-russia-head-of-major-criminal-group-arrested.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/54/5410884_re-insight-russia-head-of-major-criminal-group-arrested.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Chaika said he has already been under a lot of heat because of the Politkovskaya arrests. He said that he would rather not tell me about the
&quot;Chechen mastermind&quot; they arrested. I asked if this was because he was not really a mastermind and Chaika said that &quot;many things needed to be tied up as we head into this election and the end of Putin&#39;s reign.&quot; [I know this is strange, but he kept saying things like, &quot;Ivanov needs to have control over the situation he&#39;s about to enter into.... Ivanov is known for his distance from such situations, so they need to be wrapped up.&quot;]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is crazy, is that even organized crime won&#39;t go near energy assets, which is a playground that Podesta, Hillary and the DNC have no problem playing in. That is a really interesting point... that they scare the Russian mob.</p>

<p>Either way, these people at the top of Russian politics are very often cooperating with our own intelligence assets. Here is a list:</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OVvquE_0SIXo1NLgJmFr7gjUbDFNjUG2YzdHZxPFyzU/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OVvquE_0SIXo1NLgJmFr7gjUbDFNjUG2YzdHZxPFyzU/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<p>During the course of the Uranium One scandal, Gazprom was also acquiring extraction rights and expanding with more locations and resources.</p>

<p><a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/55/5500400_re-t-weekly-next-week-.html">https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/55/5500400_re-t-weekly-next-week-.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>the company builds pipelines around the world and Gazprom wanted
the the company, so the owner of the company ended up with his
shoulders broken and stuffed into a pipeline. Then they turned on
the nat gas and he suffocated while his limbs flew off in the 50
mph nat gas flow.....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Russians seem pretty great at compartmentalizing, but all these paths seem to course through Dmitry Medvedev.</p>

<p>I am confident that a decent group of investigators can tie all this up, now that the Chaika scandal has been exposed. It is just a matter of tracing the web.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the news in the US doesn&#39;t actually educate people on how Russian corruption works because that would elucidate ties to our own government.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course it doesn&#39;t involve one side. It&#39;s just that we have proof of what one side is up to.</p>

<p>Both sides make promises. One promises less government and less taxes, while the other side promotes social justice and monetary aid. Both sides of the same coin.</p>

<p>As it stands, the hard evidence we have to work with is very one-sided... until you start counting the pedophiles in politics. Seemingly, they are the easiest to compromise, so make useful tools.</p>

<p>Anyone who subscribes to &quot;right&quot; or &quot;left&quot; is just being tricked by the false promise. Both sides are surreptitiously selling you creeping authoritarianism.</p>

<p>They are cycling all this money through NGO&#39;s with political agendas. Comet Ping Pong and the other businesses owned by Alefantis were given to him by the Saudis.</p>

<p>There is a lot more to the money exchanging hands and assets, but the easiest hard core incontrovertible evidence starts with Podesta and spirals out from there.</p>

<p>Alefantis is laundering this money through a variety of non-profits with Maya Harris, sister of Kamala Harris, who has ties to secret Masonic police who die as soon as they are exposed.</p>

<p>Why do donations from elsewhere not suggest they are the ones keeping the DNC in power?  Why dont donations to Trump and the RNC lead you to the same conclusion?  </p>

<p>We have Podesta working for a Russian bank,  and Russia being one of the many donors to the Clinton Foundation.  That just seems extremely flimsy to support your conclusion.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The level of involvement is what is important.</p>

<p>Yes, the Podesta Group is involved with a number of entitites... this highlights the epitome of &quot;Pay to Play&quot; where anyone willing to pay an influential lobbyist has a greater voice than the American people. It&#39;s a bad problem that circumvents the spirit of the Constitution and democracy, in general.</p>

<p>But, what we have is John Podesta, himself, privately receiving money and laundering it through his daughter&#39;s company, Leonidas LLC. When Mueller&#39;s subpoenas hit the Podesta Group, they updated their disclosures further. This means that they only admit to what has already been proven by other evidence. They aren&#39;t admitting to anything they haven&#39;t been caught red-handed doing.</p>

<p>But yes, you are right... people and entities on that list, like Saudi Arabia, are funding, in small pieces at a time, the DNC through &quot;fundraisers&quot; like at Comet Ping Pong. We know Comet Ping Pong, for a fact, is doing this, so that is why I bring up the example... Soros and Saudi money are going through there, along with Pegasus, Transformer, and other businesses.</p>

<p>But, this goes on to involve a myriad of liquor store operations. They are breaking down large sums of money through places like &quot;Goat Hill Pizza&quot; on Connecticut Ave, a front for Nancy Pelosi.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right. It isn&#39;t just Russia, it&#39;s just that the microscope pointed at this one microcosm and revealed a pattern that is much scarier and larger than the myopic view we currently have.</p>

<p>Yes, it is both parties. Yes, the media is involved. Yes, there are double and triple agents on all sides. Modern espionage a a giant mind f*** because they really want to keep everyone guessing.</p>

<p>But this is where we have to start. John Podesta, blackmail/bribery circles, CIA drug and gun trafficking, the mining industry connections, the forced labour and it&#39;s source.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t just them, though, and this isn&#39;t a new thing. Reagan was the front for the American Security Council Foundation, whose motto was &quot;Peace Through Strength&quot; and they, essentially, lobbied and bullied ans psy op&#39;d their way into controlling natural resources in poor countries that were easy targets.</p>

<p>If you look into the Bush NGO&#39;s, then you see a continuation of this type of behavior. </p>

<p>The Clintons are just another in a long line of puppets by people controlling the natural resources. This is why sides don&#39;t matter. There is a playbook to compromising people to control them. </p>

<p>How hard would it be for the Deep State to control you, if they wanted to?</p>

<p>I just feel like you might be somewhat distracted by &quot;sides&quot;, but this is the best evidence we have of how US government corruption works and how to recognize it, elsewhere. It&#39;s time to follow this trail of evidence to everywhere it leads.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was a fair response.  I still don&#39;t see the significance in Russia in all of this,  but i do agree that lobbying and pay to pay are a huge problem.  This is why i support some kind of campaign finance reform to reduce the power of lobbying.  </p>

<p>I do believe we are currently going in the wrong direction in fighting this.  Before Trump the President had to  divest in any of their businesses.  That&#39;s gone.  We have a multi headed monster that is growing more heads faster than we can cut them off.  Ultimately the root of the problem is the public.

<p>We just have evidence that shows how this organization works. Russia is merely a tentacle. But, for the public, knowing how Russian corruption interacts with US corruption, they can begin to understand how that same relationship works with every other country.</p>

<p>The public is the problem in that they have been successfully subverted in their minds. A result of propaganda.</p>

<p>The public can protect itself against these powers by being staunchly anti-war and staunchly pro-transparency.</p>

<p>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong but the way I&#39;ve interpreted this story is that the FBI investigation ended in 2009, prior to the uranium deal and it was kept from Congress and the public. So no, it didn&#39;t take this long for it to end... it just took this long to come out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to The Hill article, the investigation began in 2009 and ended in 2015.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired earlier this year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, I&#39;m not denying that there wasn&#39;t some kind of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign but I find it highly unlikely that as a non-political actor, he would have been able to achieve anything close to this level of corruption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The corruption and kickbacks where to a Truck company. The deal was a no-bid contract where the company paid the Trucking company extra and got kickbacks in return. Both parties profited and the Trucking firm was not a political player(at least nothing in the article stated any political ties). Wouldn&#39;t this be affirmation that you don&#39;t need to be political in order to collude with Russian officials.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, when you accused me of being a shill? That’s what you consider “substantive”? Mmmkay pumpkin. </p>

<p>The money never made it to the Clintons because it would be illegal to use foundation funds for their personal use. </p>

<p>Also, there were several Bureaus that had to sign off on the deal which means it wasn’t even in her control if the deal went through. </p>

<p>So, go back to your emotional outbursts and your pathetic attempts to call me a shill (except you’re too much of a bitch to just say it). Leave the actual facts to other people, sweetheart. </p>

<p>Do they not own the foundation? Is that not their foundation. They could pay them selves 20 million dollars salary next year or give them selves a hefty bonus like any other business. It&#39;s their money, they decide what to do with it. Saying it went to a charity is the same as saying it went into their own pockets.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State makes arms deals go through. That&#39;s their job. But suddenly they aren&#39;t responsible for mineral sales? </p>

<p>You are being hard headed and belligerent. You are bating me and I&#39;m not biting. If you were a shill, not my words, then keep doing your job. You wouldn&#39;t be fooling anyone in this sub. If your not a shill and your just that into partisan politics. I suggest posting some question to help you figure out your way through the joke of a system.</p>

<p>Because you don’t have the balls to actually say it. Pretty pathetic. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do they not own the foundation? Is that not their foundation. </p>

<p>I can tell someone has never taken business courses. Do you understand how charity foundations work? That’s a rhetorical question, it’s clear you don’t. That money doesn’t go to the Clintons and in fact they’d be in trouble if they were using it for themselves. See</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>So you don’t understand civics either. 7 other bureaus and agencies had to sign off on the deal. Yet you’re implying she alone was responsible for all of it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are being hard headed and belligerent. You are bating me and I&#39;m not biting. </p>

<p>TIL posting facts is “baiting”. Mmkay. Let’s see, I said it wasn’t true and since then I’ve said exactly why. Man, facts are so mean!</p>

<p>As I said, run along now. I’ll give you some advice: research before posting. It helps. </p>
