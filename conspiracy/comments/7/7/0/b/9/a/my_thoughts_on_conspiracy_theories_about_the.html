        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m clearly an active member in the sub, and I sincerely appreciate all the work that you guys do for the betterment of our society. This is only my second week browsing through here and I already feel at home knowing there&#39;s so many intellectual people questioning the same things that I am. I&#39;m only writing this because I&#39;ve seen a few posts and comments that have bugged me.</p>

<p>Questioning things like the shape of the earth or climate change is not inherently wrong or stupid. What I do think is stupid is blindly accepting a mainstream idea, so that&#39;s not my issue. My issue is that people come to believe in these certain theories by thinking that the scientific community actively tries deceive people for personal gain like the government, deep state, or corporate entities. As someone who has spent a great deal of time in scientific academia, I can tell you this couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. The reality is that the scientific community is no where near a cohesive group of people that work together to shape public opinions and beliefs. Scientists are extremely competitive with each other and will immediately reject their colleagues results, forcing them to present irrefutable evidence of their conjectures. Even then they will not accept anything until experiments are reproduced over and over again with the same results. This is why they&#39;re entirely incapable of working together to deceive the public. So please go on google scholar and read relevant papers that have the most citations so you&#39;ll be up to date on all the latest research and be more informed about how the universe actually operates.</p>

<p>On the other hand, climate science is probably one of the most imperfect scientific disciplines and the results can often seem ambiguous. The climate is extraordinarily complex and difficult to model. Even the most accurate models and data leave some room for interpretation. We can&#39;t even predict the weather that accurately. Thus, this causes skepticism from outside observers of the research and findings they present. This why I think the idea of man made climate change hasn&#39;t been accepted across the board.</p>

<p>As far as the flat earth theory goes, cmon guys. How the fuck would scientists be able to launch telecommunication satellites that keep us connected if they had the shape of the earth wrong? </p>

<p>Science is when enough old white men with white hair agree on something white. hAHAHA. Not really, but honestly... science at its core defenition is something that a group of people believe in to make money. That&#39;s how I see it. Science is science until someone pays someone to &quot;prove&quot; their science wrong... give me a break.</p>

<p>Again, use google scholar and search &quot;9/11 Report&quot;, suck my dick google, you lying piece of shit.  </p>

<p>Are you fucking kidding me? I&#39;m not going to define science for you, you can figure that one out yourself. My favorite professor in school was a Russian lady who was trying to discover a mathematical model for airplane turbulence so idk wtf you&#39;re talking about just old white men. </p>

<p>And oh really it&#39;s just for people to get rich? It&#39;s actually quite the opposite. They&#39;d all be dominating pricks on wall street if that were the case.</p>

<p>Seriously though, im afraid alot of people can&#39;t help beeing somewhat paranoid due the constant bombardment of information in this day in age; half of which isn&#39;t correct data... Before they know it they don&#39;t trust anything anymore. I too have moments I need to take a step back and unwind. However, i&#39;ll always believe science can save us. hehe If only america had invested in it while not in a war... Economy wouldnt be in the shitter if they had; but alas...</p>

<p>That&#39;s why they all watch rocket launches and celebrate when they see their capsule docks with the ISS or when their booster lands safely back to the earth and is reused for the first time in history.

<p>Which they now pay to private companies who have proven themselves capable of building reliable rockets for cheap. They didn&#39;t just randomly reach out to Musk to start a fake rocket company as a front for their conspiracy. Before he started SpaceX he was a successful software developer and entrepreneur. Again why would he risk all of his and his investors&#39; money with the hopes that maybe NASA would choose him to launch their fake satellites when they had no idea who he is. It took him 4 launch attempts and years of hemorrhaging before he even secured a NASA contract. </p>

<p>I also have a lot of experience in academic science, and from my perspective and experience I would agree with much of what you say. However, I have also learned a great deal in the last couple of years of studying conspiracies, and I believe that at the highest levels of academic science there is some kind of conspiracy to misdirect and deceive. </p>

<p>Also remember that academic science is only one small part of science, and it is increasingly becoming the money-making tool of venture capitalists. And on top of that you&#39;ve got scientists working in industry and the government. What you and I know of academic science has little resemblance to their work. </p>

<p>If you want to start to go down the rabbit hole on this one, I suggest reading <a href="http://milesmathis.com/hawk3.pdf">this paper on Stephen Hawking.</a> You have to approach it with a truly open mind, but in my opinion the evidence presented is decisive. So if you want to really have a discussion on this, why don&#39;t you read it and then tell me what you think, and we can continue from there. There is much, much more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude I think your misunderstanding. </p>

<p>Myotrophic lateral sclerosis has a life expectancy range of 3-5 years, which some rare cases, there is no factual scientific reason for Hawking to still be alive, there is no biological pathway they can make up to try to pretend like its extending his life/giving him longevity/whatever. </p>

<p>I am personally a biochemistry nerd, and I love reading peer reviewed articles, but there is no paper that factually explains metabolically how the fuck he is alive, all the papers seem to explain AWAY from the issue, it will usually &quot;fall off the tracks&quot; and just babble on with no substance/information. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For me the important takeaway of this paper is that all the scientists who knew Hawking personally before this happened have to be in on it, since they would see it&#39;s not him. This shows that academic science (or physics at least) is tightly controlled at the highest levels and scientists are actively involved in misdirection and public hoaxes. And the fact that this switch has never been noticed or reported on by any newspaper or media outlet anywhere is yet another indication of just how controlled the media is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest indicator for me, personally, as a bionerd, is the hands: </p>

<p>In the 1960&#39;s, his hands had begun to curl, his hands recently are shown as normal/fake/or something else, they are not ALS hands, just as the paper states.</p>

<p>There is an addendum though, it is possible in the mid 1980&#39;s they perfect stem cells to a point where he is actually a stem cell guinea pig. This is something that I have never thought of until recently, I am curious about when they first started/studied stem cells, I must research. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t you hear? He got rich so his cheeks fattened due to eating better (because we know how people with ALS are such big eaters), but he also got cosmetic surgery on his ears and changed the shape of his head. Oh, and those weird-looking nasty new set of teeth he has are dentures. Even though he could afford the best by that point, he didn&#39;t want to overdo it. </p>

<p>/s</p>

<p>Anyway, stem cells also can&#39;t explain any of that. The best they could do is explain his longevity. On the other hand, would the stem cell treatment have cured him altogether? I think you agree, that&#39;s a different dude. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you like reading about science, then you should definitely read the scientific work of the guy who wrote the paper on Hawking. It&#39;s on his science site: <a href="http://www.milesmathis.com">www.milesmathis.com</a>   Mind-blowing, but you really have to be able to put aside a lot of assumptions and prejudices to grok it. </p>

<p>And if you like reading about conspiracies, you should read his conspiracy work: <a href="http://www.mileswmathis.com/updates">www.mileswmathis.com/updates</a>. Scroll down to his 2013 paper on Theosophy and the Beat Generation. Read the articles forward from there in chronological order, because he makes discoveries as he goes, and later papers build on earlier ones. You may want to skip his art criticism papers and poetry, though they&#39;re also good.  </p>
