        <h3 class="title">Eight Still Unanswered Questions About Flight 93</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">50</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-17 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/stickdog99.html">stickdog99</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Did the 9/11 Commission Report satisfactorily address even one tough question about what actually happened to Flight 93?</p>

<p>1) What did the recovered data from Flight 93&#39;s flight data recorder (FDR) black box say? Is there really any reason why recovered information about Flight 93&#39;s recorded flight path has to remain top secret?</p>

<p>2) If the &quot;radar analysis, the flight data recorder, NTSB analysis, and infrared satellite data&quot; all put the time of crash at 10:03:12 as the 9/11 Commission contends, why was there a noticeable seismic spike in the vicinity of the crash at 10:06:05 and none at 10:03:12?</p>

<p>Terry Wallace, the most prominent scientist in the field of forensic seismology, personally examined the seismic data very carefully and critically. There is no evidence of any seismic activity spike anywhere near 10:03:12. However, there is an obvious seismic spike with the clear signature of a surface disturbance at 10:06:05. If Flight 93 didn&#39;t produce the 10:06:05 reading, what did?</p>

<p>3) At what speed and angle of incline did Flight 93 hit the ground to account for its record debris field in terms of both dense material (metal and bone more than 1.5 miles away with new reports of metal debris found at least 8 miles away) and light material (buckets and buckets of paper, plastic and foam found more than 8 miles away)? Has any another plane in the entire history of air disasters produced a debris field anywhere near this expansive after hitting the ground in one piece? </p>

<p>Consider that residents of Indian Lake (which is located 1.5 to 5 miles from the Flight 93&#39;s impact crater) heard parts of Flight 93 falling on their rooftops &quot;like acorns&quot; and collected various pieces of sheet metal that were reportedly black and charred. In addition, a large portion of one of Flight 93&#39;s engines that weighed well over a ton was found 1/2 mile from the impact crater, the FBI located the biggest piece (reportedly about 5&#39; x 7&#39;) of fuselage in a pond about 1.5 miles from the impact crater, and bones and other debris washed up on the banks of Indian Lake and were collected as far as 8 miles away in New Baltimore for days.</p>

<p>How could the same direct ground collision be both energetic enough to set a new ballistic standard for aviation debris field coverage (in a 10 mph breeze, no less) without generating even the slightest measurable seismic reading? And in addition to contending that one of the most energetic plane crashes in aviation history did not register on any seismograph, the 9/11 Commission must invoke a completely unreported nearby event to explain a clear surface seismic disturbance more energetic than the Flight 93&#39;s crash on the order of magnitudes just under three minutes later. At this point, the 9/11 Commission is daring where even creationists fear to tread.</p>

<p>4) What about the impact crater supposedly caused by the crash of Flight 93? Dozens of different reports in the days following 9/11 estimated the crater depth at 8 to 12 feet. However, the cockpit voice recorder was reportedly found buried at a depth of 25 feet, and the PA Department of Envronmental Protection reported that the crash site was finally excavated &quot;down to a depth of about 45 feet.&quot; This implies that more than 75% of the dirt and rock displaced by Flight 93&#39;s crash -- a crash that somehow supposedly launched a barrage of metal pieces 1.5 to 8 miles away -- managed to land right back into the footprint of its impact crater, all without registering even the slightest seismic blip, of course.</p>

<p>5) What about passenger Tom Burnett&#39;s report that one of the hijackers had a gun?</p>

<p>6) What about passenger Ed Felt&#39;s 911 call from the bathroom -- widely reported as the final call from the plane? Emergency dispatch supervisor Glen Cramer stated on 9/11 that a distraught passenger calling from the airplane bathroom &quot;heard an explosion and saw white smoke&quot; just three minutes before the 9/11 Commission claims that Flight 93 crashed. This 911 tape was confiscated by the FBI within hours, and Glenn Cramer was later ordered not to discuss this matter with reporters. What did expert audio analysis reveal about the sounds Felt described as explosions? Did anyone ever even make any attempt to synchronize this 911 tape with the &quot;black box&quot; cockpit voice recording and flight data information? If so, what did this process reveal? If not, why not?</p>

<p>7) Two FAA employees who were working at Cleveland Center ATC on 9/11, Stacey Taylor and Richard Kettell, both reported that they saw Flight 93&#39;s transponder signal come back on twice -- displaying an altitude between 4,000 and 7,000 feet -- just minutes before it disappeared forever over Shanksville. What could possibly have accounted for this if the hijackers still controlled the plane? Did anyone ever attempt to synchronize this intermittent transponder data with the cockpit voice recorder, the flight data recorder and Felt&#39;s 911 recording? Finally, unless both air traffic controllers lied about this transponder activity, what compelled the FBI to disparage the passengers&#39; memories by publicly concluding they never breached the cockpit?</p>

<p>8) By 9:50, Cleveland Center ATC, United Airlines officials, the FAA, several other local Air Traffic Control towers, Cleveland&#39;s mayor, Pittsburgh&#39;s mayor, the FBI and even a motley crew of meddling US Congressmen were all fully aware that a confirmed hijacked 757 was flying erratically over western Pennsylvania on a day when three previous hijackings had already killed thousands. All of this is well documented. Yet the 9/11 Commission seriously expects us to accept that the entire US domestic defense system remained entirely ignorant of Flight 93&#39;s immeasurable threat for at least 20 more minutes? Are we really supposed to believe that basically our entire system of government knew all about our enemies&#39; movements with the singular exception of the one part of our government that&#39;s directly tasked with defending us against enemy attacks? Because once again the 9/11 Commission has left the land of hard-to-swallow and entered the rabbit hole of inconceivability.</p>

<p>In times of crisis like 9/11, certain individuals will always risk the reprisals of ignoring established protocols and/or chains of command to attempt to ensure an efficient and potent response to a national emergency. So no matter how unfathomably incompetent the 9/11 Commission paints the FAA, there were certainly many people who knew about Flight 93 who would have made it their business to personally inform their defense department contacts directly, especially considering both the stakes and the previous events of the day. By so adamantly insisting otherwise, the members of the 9/11 Commission demonstrated an incredible level of contempt for their readers&#39; intelligence.</p>

<p>Just a few problems --</p>

<p>1) The suppressed evidence:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030219125659/https://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0245/ridgeway.php#Stiff">https://web.archive.org/web/20030219125659/https://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0245/ridgeway.php#Stiff</a></p>

<p>In bits and pieces, a better picture of what happened on September 11 comes into focus—no thanks to the federal government, which has stonewalled inquiries. A few months ago, I joined with Russ Kick (a Voice freelancer and the Web sleuth behind the archive TheMemoryhole.com), using the Freedom of Information Act to seek communications from the four doomed flights. In its response the Federal Aviation Administration at first stated, &quot;The recordings of communications, transcripts, and any documents relating to your request are part of an ongoing, sensitive investigation.&quot; Access denied.</p>

<p>Further down, in the same letter, the FAA wrote, &quot;There are no records or other correspondence relating to any signals, alarms, or any other form of nonverbal communications emanating from the four hijacked flights,&quot; adding, &quot;There are no documents in written or recorded form having to do with communications from any of the four hijacked flights.&quot;</p>

<p>In its response the FBI said, &quot;[The] material you requested is located in an investigative file which is exempt from disclosure.&quot; The CIA referred us to the FBI and the FAA.</p>

<p>This is absurd, since as far back as last fall, ABC broadcast smidgens of the air traffic controller tape. And AirDisaster.com, a usually reliable and thoroughgoing site, has posted a sound file of air traffic control during the morning of September 11. It shows that Cleveland Air Traffic Control had two brief contacts with United Airlines Flight 93—the &quot;Let&#39;s Roll&quot; flight—before the crash.</p>

<p>2) The seismic data:</p>

<p>The final three minutes of hijacked United Flight 93 are still a mystery more than a year after it crashed in western Pennsylvania - even to grieving relatives who sought comfort in listening to its cockpit tapes in April. </p>

<p>A Daily News investigation has found a roughly three-minute gap between the time the tape goes silent - according to government-prepared transcripts - and the time that top scientists have pinpointed for the crash. Several leading seismologists agree that Flight 93 crashed last Sept. 11 at 10:06:05 a.m., give or take a couple of seconds. Family members allowed to hear the cockpit voice recorder in Princeton, N.J., last spring were told it stopped just after 10:03. The FBI and other agencies refused repeated requests to explain the discrepancy.</p>

<p>Seismologists - experts in the earth&#39;s vibrations - have almost exactly pinpointed the time of the crash of Flight 93 at 10:06:05. &quot;The seismic signals are consistent with impact at 10:06:05,&quot; plus or minus two seconds, said Terry Wallace, who heads the Southern Arizona Seismic Observatory and is considered the leading expert on the seismology of man-made events.</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know where the 10:03 time comes from.&quot;</p>

<p>New evidence that came out last week may support the electrical-failure theory. A federal air traffic controller from Cleveland, Stacey Taylor, told &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; that Flight 93&#39;s transponder, initially shut off by the hijackers, came back on briefly only to give out - at 10:03 a.m.</p>

<p>3) The debris field:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/headlines/20010913somersetp3.asp">http://www.post-gazette.com/headlines/20010913somersetp3.asp</a></p>

<p>Finding the flight data recorder had been the focus of investigators as they widened their search area today following the discoveries of more debris, including what appeared to be human remains, miles from the point of impact at a reclaimed coal mine.</p>

<p>Residents and workers at businesses outside Shanksville, Somerset County, reported discovering clothing, books, papers and what appeared to be human remains. Some residents said they collected bags-full of items to be turned over to investigators. Others reported what appeared to be crash debris floating in Indian Lake, nearly six miles from the immediate crash scene.</p>

<p>In a morning briefing, state Police Major Lyle Szupinka confirmed that debris from the plane had turned up in relatively far-flung sites, including the residential area of Indian Lake. Investigators appealed to any residents who had come across such debris, in the surrounding countryside or even in their yards, to contact them, emphasizing that even the smallest remnants could prove to be important clues.</p>

<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020604191702/www.intellnet.org/news/2001/09/14/6642-1.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20020604191702/www.intellnet.org/news/2001/09/14/6642-1.html</a></p>

<p>Investigators also disclosed Thursday that debris from the shattered plane had been discovered at Indian Lake, two miles from the crash crater, and in New Baltimore, eight miles away from where the plane slammed into a grassy field. The find immediately fueled speculation that structural problems, or possibly even an explosion, had damaged the Boeing 757 before it hit the ground.</p>

<p>Some Indian Lake residents reported seeing &quot;sparkling confetti&quot; or hearing sounds like &quot;acorns hitting the house&quot; around the time of the crash. &quot;Every piece that we picked up was charred,&quot; said Indian Lake Mayor Barry Lichty, whose neighbors spotted debris in their yards.</p>

<p>&quot;We found a few small pieces of sheet metal,&quot; Lichty said in a telephone interview. &quot;They were about the size of bolts.&quot;</p>

<p>At nearby Indian Lake Marina, employees took FBI agents out on boats and helped collect debris that washed up on shore including &quot;parts of the plane and papers - just little pieces,&quot; said Tom Spinelli, a marina service technician. &quot;A lot of California information on it, like phone numbers,&quot; Spinelli said in a telephone interview. &quot;We thought we saw pieces of bone - they took it with them.&quot;</p>

<p>Shaking off the chill from a brisk October Saturday, I stand in a line of trees outside of Shanksville, Somerset County, on land my family has owned for 70 years. My grandfather, who worked as a carpenter helping to construct the Pentagon in the 1940s, once lived in a cabin he built on the 164-acre tract.</p>

<p>The property is now associated with one of America&#39;s darkest days. It&#39;s just yards from where United Flight 93 slammed into the ground on September 11, 2001 -- Pennsylvania&#39;s Ground Zero.</p>

<p>Look at the news photos of that God-awful crater, created when the hijacked jetliner hit the earth at a speed of 500 miles per hour and forever altered the landscape, both literally and figuratively. The blackened hemlock trees in the background of those pictures once marked our property line. Now they have been cut down as a result of fire damage and pollution from jet fuel.</p>

<p>According to investigators, the cockpit of the aircraft separated from the plane upon impact and flew into the trees, where it disintegrated. The biggest portion of the aircraft that was recovered, a piece of the fuselage, was found after officials drained a pond some 2,500 yards away from the crater. The infamous three-page letter in Arabic encouraging the hijackers was also found nearby, along with credit cards and the plane&#39;s black boxes.</p>

<p>As a state police fire marshal and criminal investigator, Trooper John F. Marshall has seen his share of gruesome crime scenes.</p>

<p>So, when many members of his troop in Uniontown were sent to neighboring Somerset County to help secure and investigate the Sept. 11 crash of hijacked United Airlines Flight 93, the Greenville native didn&#39;t consider the assignment anything out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>For the first two or three days, Marshall walked the surrounding countryside looking for airplane parts. &quot;I found a lot of parts,&quot; said Marshall, who was awarded a 2000 Law Enforcement Agency Directors award for identifying a man nearly four years after he was found murdered.</p>

<p>&quot;The biggest part I found was one of the plane&#39;s engines. It was about 600 yards from the crash site itself. I think they took it out with a winch on a bulldozer.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2001/US/09/13/penn.attack/">https://www.cnn.com/2001/US/09/13/penn.attack/</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, investigators say they&#39;ve found debris from the crash at least eight miles away from the crash site.</p>

<p>A second debris field was around Indian Lake about 3 miles from the crash scene. Some debris was in the lake and some was adjacent to the lake. More debris from the plane was found in New Baltimore, some 8 miles away from the crash.</p>

<p>State police and the FBI initially said they didn&#39;t want to speculate whether the debris was from the crash, or if the plane could have broken up in midair.</p>

<p>Investigators later said the debris was all very light material, such as paper and thin nylon the wind would easily blow. The wind was blowing towards Indian Lake and New Baltimore at 9 knots (10 mph). &quot;According to the NTSB, it is not only possible that the debris is from the crash, it is probable,&quot; Crowley said.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070306192305/http://www.wingtv.net/thorn2006/shanksville.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20070306192305/http://www.wingtv.net/thorn2006/shanksville.html</a></p>

<p>Melanie says the lawn maintenance man from Beauty Lawn heard a loud “bang” and subsequently informed Melanie that there were papers blowing all over the churchyard. Upon inspection, she found not only papers littering the property, but also small pieces of metal. Melanie also told us that the FBI had set up a trailer in New Baltimore after Flight 93 purportedly crashed in the field at Shanksville, and locals were advised to bring all recovered debris to this trailer and hand it over to the Feds. Subsequently, she and other residents of the community dutifully delivered bags of debris to the FBI as directed. Along with papers and checks, Melanie also found small pieces of metal in the churchyard, which she said the FBI identified as pieces of the plane’s underbelly. Keep in mind that New Baltimore is roughly 6-8 miles away from Shanksville and the wind speed on the morning of September 11th in that area was only 9-10 mph. </p>

<p>Standing next to Stephanie Childers was a man named Bob Pile, who had been listening to our discussion. Bob recalled “what seemed like buckets of gravel” hitting the roof of his house on the morning of 9-11 around the time of Flight 93’s reported impact. Bob says his home is one mile away from the crash site. He thinks it is very odd that gravel would reach his home over that distance, and had no explanation as to how this might have happened.</p>

<p>4) The impact crater --</p>

<p>The cockpit voice recorder was found at a 25-foot depth in the impact crater:</p>

<p>For Deena Burnett, it had all begun on the morning of Sept. 11, when her husband called her four times on his cell phone from aboard the hijacked Newark-to-San Francisco flight. She scribbled down notes and later made a transcript that she always carries with her.</p>

<p>Deena: Where are you? Are you in the air?</p>

<p>Tom: Yes, yes, just listen. Our airplane has been hijacked. It&#39;s United Flight 93 from Newark to San Francisco. We are in the air. The hijackers have already knifed a guy, one of them has a gun, and they are telling us there is a bomb on board. Please call the authorities.</p>

<p>6) The 911 call:</p>

<p>Day of Terror: Outside tiny Shanksville, a fourth deadly stroke</p>

<p>Wednesday, September 12, 2001</p>

<p>Authorities weren&#39;t ready yesterday to pronounce the crash a result of terrorism. But a telling detail came minutes before the plane went down when dispatchers at the Westmoreland County Emergency Operations Center intercepted a frantic cell phone call made to 911 by a passenger aboard the doomed flight. &quot;We are being hijacked, we are being hijacked!&quot; the man told dispatchers in a quivering voice during a conversation that lasted about one minute.</p>

<p>&quot;We got the call about 9:58 this morning from a male passenger stating that he was locked in the bathroom of United Flight 93 traveling from Newark to San Francisco, and they were being hijacked,&quot; said Glenn Cramer, a 911 supervisor. &quot;We confirmed that with him several times and we asked him to repeat what he said. He was very distraught. He said he believed the plane was going down. He did hear some sort of an explosion and saw white smoke coming from the plane, but he didn&#39;t know where.&quot;</p>

<p>Agents seized the 911 dispatch tape from Westmoreland County as part of their investigation.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160506053059/http://www.wtae.com/Alleged-Partial-Flight-93-Cockpit-Transcript-Obtained/26951552">https://web.archive.org/web/20160506053059/http://www.wtae.com/Alleged-Partial-Flight-93-Cockpit-Transcript-Obtained/26951552</a></p>

<p>One passenger who called Westmoreland County 911 said he was inside a locked bathroom. Dispatcher Glenn Cramer said the unidentified man repeatedly said, &quot;We&#39;re being hijacked!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He heard some sort of explosion and saw white smoke coming from the plane and we lost contact with him,&quot; Cramer said.</p>

<p>FBI officials had a tape of that call in custody. They would not comment on its contents or the speculation of a struggle on board. </p>

<p>Unanswered questions: The mystery of Flight 93</p>

<p>by John Carlin
The Independent
August 13, 2002</p>

<p>(Questions)</p>

<p>One telephone call from the doomed plane whose contents do not entirely tally with the hero legend and which is accordingly omitted in the Independence Day-type dramas favoured by the US media. The Associated Press news service reported on 11 September that eight minutes before the crash, a frantic male passenger called the 911 emergency number. He told the operator, named Glen Cramer, that he had locked himself inside one of the plane&#39;s toilets. Cramer told the AP, in a report that was widely broadcast on 11 September, that the passenger had spoken for one minute. &quot;We&#39;re being hijacked, we&#39;re being hijacked!&quot; the man screamed down his mobile phone. &quot;We confirmed that with him several times,&quot; Cramer said, &quot;and we asked him to repeat what he said. He was very distraught. He said he believed the plane was going down. He did hear some sort of an explosion and saw white smoke coming from the plane, but he didn&#39;t know where. And then we lost contact with him.&quot;</p>

<p>Neither the FBI nor anyone else in authority has explained the reported 911 phone call from the plane toilet, even though it appears to be the last of the phone calls made from the plane and even though it conveys the far from insignificant claim that there was an explosion on board. The FBI has confiscated the tape of the conversation and the operator Glen Cramer has received orders not to speak to the media any more.</p>

<p>7) The transponder signal:</p>

<p>BROKAW: You&#39;re keeping your eye on Flight 93 at this point?</p>

<p>Ms. TAYLOR: Yeah. And then the transponder came back on. We got two hits off the transponder. That&#39;s something we&#39;ve always wanted to know. Why did the transponder come back on? Because the hijackers had shut it off so that they couldn&#39;t be tracked, even though we were still tracking them. Now we were getting an altitude readout on the airplane. I can&#39;t remember the precise numbers, but it was around 6400 feet, and then around 5900 or 5800 feet. And we&#39;re thinking, &#39;Oh, you know, maybe something&#39;s happened, maybe this isn&#39;t what we think it is.&#39;</p>

<p>BROKAW: (Voiceover) But minutes later, at 10:03, the transponder shuts off again. Flight 93 disappears from radar.</p>

<p>8) Everybody knows except the Air Force:</p>

<p>Day of Terror: Outside tiny Shanksville, a fourth deadly stroke</p>

<p>Flight 93 may have gotten as far west as Ohio before turning around. The Cleveland mayor&#39;s office told The Associated Press that an airplane in distress had passed through Cleveland-area airspace before being handed off to Toledo, although it was not clear that the plane was Flight 93. As the plane neared Pittsburgh, Mayor Tom Murphy stayed in contact with the FBI and the Federal Aviation Administration. &quot;We were in communication with the FBI and the FAA about the jet as to where it was,&quot; Murphy said. &quot;They had the jet coming out of Cleveland and losing it when it came into Pittsburgh airspace, and there was no communication with it, and we were concerned.&quot;</p>

<p>John Murtha Johnstown-Cambria County Airport tower chief Dennis Fritz said his tower, located about 20 miles from the crash site, got a warning call from Cleveland Air Traffic Control.</p>

<p>Leaders of Congress -- including Senate Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.), Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) and House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) -- were told at a briefing by the Capitol Police that the hijacked plane might have been bound for the Capitol or Camp David, the presidential retreat in Thurmont, Md., 85 miles southeast of the crash site, according to participants in the meeting.</p>

<p>The participants discussed the possibility of shooting down the aircraft, said Rep. Mike Pence (R-Ind.). &quot;The question I heard asked was: &#39;Who has the authority to order a commercial jetliner shot down by the military?&#39; &quot; Pence said. However, the congressional leaders soon learned that the plane had already crashed.</p>

<p>Suburban flight dispatcher to recount worst day
By Jon Davis, Daily Herald Staff Writer
Wednesday, April 14, 2004</p>

<p>Dispatchers were told by superiors: Don&#39;t tell the pilots why we want them to land. &quot;One of the things that upset me was that they knew 45 minutes before that American Airlines had a problem. I put the story together myself (from news accounts),&quot; Ballinger said.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps if I had the information sooner, I might have gotten the message to 93 to bar the door.&quot;</p>

<p>Cockpit voices, calls set off alarm</p>

<p>By Glen Johnson, Globe Staff, 9/13/2001</p>

<p>As air traffic controllers watched one aircraft speed in the direction of the White House Tuesday morning, a frantic evacuation of the Executive Mansion began. Another plane was also headed for Washington before it crashed outside Pittsburgh, and the president&#39;s spokesman indicated yesterday that the White House or Air Force One may have been potential targets.</p>

<p>The revelations came as the FBI swept through the aviation community, seizing air traffic control tapes and interviewing anyone involved with the flights. The crashes at New York&#39;s World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field in Shanksville, Pa., killed 266 passengers and crew members and untold numbers of people in the buildings.</p>

<p>Unanswered questions: The mystery of Flight 93</p>

<p>by John Carlin
The Independent
August 13, 2002</p>

<p>(Questions)</p>

<p>The location of US Air Force jets, which might or might not have been close enough to fire a missile at the hijacked plane. Live news media reports on the morning of 11 September conflict with a number of official statements issued later. What the government acknowledges is that the first fighters with the mission to intercept took off at 8.52am; that another set of fighters took off from Langley Air Force base near Washington at 9.35am - precisely the time that Flight 93 turned almost 180 degrees off course towards Washington and the hijacker pilot was heard by air-traffic controllers to say that there was &quot;a bomb aboard&quot;. Flight 93, whose menacing trajectory was made known by the broadcast media almost immediately, did not go down for another 31 minutes. Apart from the logical conclusion that at least one Air Force F-16 - 125 miles away in Washington at 9.40am, meaning 10 minutes away from Flight 93 (or less if it flew at supersonic speed) - should have reached the fourth of the &quot;flying bombs&quot; well before 10.06am, there is this evidence from a federal flight controller published a few days later in a newspaper in New Hampshire: that an F-16 had been &quot;in hot pursuit&quot; of the hijacked United jet and &quot;must have seen the whole thing&quot;. Also, there was one brief report on CBS television before the crash that two F-16 fighters were tailing Flight 93. Vice-President Dick Cheney acknowledged five days later that President Bush had authorised the Air Force pilots to shoot down hijacked commercial aircraft.</p>

<p>(Government Answers)</p>

<p>The Air Force jets were on their way but failed to make it on time, according to General Richard Myers, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. Fighters did finally approach Flight 93, he acknowledges, &quot;moments&quot; before it crashed, but did not shoot it down. Which begs the question why they were unable to arrive sooner to intercept an aircraft that clearly had terrorists aboard and that was flying straight for Washington more than one hour after another United Airlines plane had crashed into the second World Trade Centre tower. The report in the New Hampshire newspaper, and the one on CBS, have not been explained, and the air-traffic controllers in Cleveland who tracked the last minutes of Flight 93 on radar have been forbidden by the authorities to speak publicly about what they saw on their screens.</p>

<p>In Washington, the fears are even more pronounced. As they watch on radar as Flight 93 heads toward them, they can&#39;t help worrying: &quot;What is its target?&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>At United Airline&#39;s crisis center, a solitary blip glows red on a big screen. It transfixes Hank Krakowski, the airline&#39;s flight operations director. Although the airline still has hundreds of flights in the air, officials at the airline&#39;s headquarters outside Chicago choose to illuminate only the path of Flight 93 on the status board.</p>

<p>&quot;Are they gonna have to shoot it down?&quot; he wonders.</p>
