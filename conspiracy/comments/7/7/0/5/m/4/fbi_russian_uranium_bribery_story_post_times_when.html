       I think you misread the article, because the Clinton's had nothing to do with the trucking company that was being investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there is no evidence that any bribes went to the clinton foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes they received donations from some russians, and that doesn't look great, but this new story doesn't implicate the clintons in any new way and doesn't add any new evidence in regards to the clintons or Obama.

       We didn't have evidence that it was bribery though.

       This is what always happens with conspiracy theories.

       Before the evidence, it is argued that it isn't proven.
After the evidence, it is argued that we always knew it so it doesn't matter now.

       except that statement in no way proves or offers evidence that the clintons accepted bribes in exchange for clinton offering her support of the deal, which by the way, required dozens of people outside the state department to approve.

       let me put it this way- if this story ever moves beyond propagandizing for trump by demonizing his political rival from last year, if clinton is ever charged in connection with this, i will get a tattoo that says "pilgrimboy was actually right"

       That part's not new though, we've known about that forever.  It never became a story because it was clear Clinton didn't play particularly important role in approving the deal -- she'd handed it to a deputy and like eight other agencies also signed off.  The U.S. generally wouldn't step in to block the the sale of shares of a Canadian company to Russia.

       It doesn't say they were bribed (and not saying people haven't bribed them ever).
      </p>
      <p>
       What it does confirm is russian influence, which up to know conservatives have laughed at. Looks like them russians do want to influence politicians and such here in the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, uh, why did it take so long for the FBI to say this or investigate it? Might be because investigations take a long time - contrary to what conspiracy/trump people here have been peddling.

       This story is a gold mine of hypocrisy - especially when you are someone like me who is an independent and didn't vote for either idiot.

       no new evidence in regards to clinton and obama, the article is mainly about the FBI investigation into bribery and extortion of a private trucking company.

       Yeah, I read the Hill story and I'm confused what the collusion is supposed to be.  It seems like there's separate things:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Russian uranium company paying kickbacks to a trucking company, which the FBI investigated, and people were arrested -- the article seems to fault the DOJ for not taking more credit?  ("But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged")
      </p>
      <p>
       2) U.S. agencies, one of which was the state department, declined to block a sale of shares in a Canadian uranium company to that same Russian company -- article says nobody knows if the committee making that decision ever heard about the trucking kickbacks
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Russians -- not identified in the article -- donated to the Clinton Foundation
      </p>
      <p>
       Article doesn't really tie any of these threads together

       So if this story actually "proves" collusion between clinton and the russians, and Trump is the sitting POTUS, surely he will bring charges?
      </p>
      <p>
       So when he doesn't (and I promise he won't), what will that tell you all?

       That the Clintons are too powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think the release of this story verifying that the information that the FBI has is to lay on the pressure to get the government to press charges. They can't just prosecute the Clintons without winning public approval for the prosecution. They aren't like me who the government could come in and arrest without raising much of a stir.
