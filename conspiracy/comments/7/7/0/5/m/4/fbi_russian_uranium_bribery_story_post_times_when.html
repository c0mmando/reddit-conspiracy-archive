<p>I think you misread the article, because the Clinton&#39;s had nothing to do with the trucking company that was being investigated.</p>

<p>And there is no evidence that any bribes went to the clinton foundation.</p>

<p>Yes they received donations from some russians, and that doesn&#39;t look great, but this new story doesn&#39;t implicate the clintons in any new way and doesn&#39;t add any new evidence in regards to the clintons or Obama.</p>

<p>Did you even read the article from The Hill?</p>

<p>My above statement is still 100% accurate.</p>

<p>We already knew that the russians gave a bunch of money to the CF. </p>

<p>This is what always happens with conspiracy theories. </p>

<p>Before the evidence, it is argued that it isn&#39;t proven.
After the evidence, it is argued that we always knew it so it doesn&#39;t matter now.</p>

<p>It matters now.</p>

<p>let me put it this way- if this story ever moves beyond propagandizing for trump by demonizing his political rival from last year, if clinton is ever charged in connection with this, i will get a tattoo that says &quot;pilgrimboy was actually right&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t say they were bribed (and not saying people haven&#39;t bribed them ever).</p>

<p>What it does confirm is russian influence, which up to know conservatives have laughed at. Looks like them russians do want to influence politicians and such here in the US.</p>

<p>And, uh, why did it take so long for the FBI to say this or investigate it? Might be because investigations take a long time - contrary to what conspiracy/trump people here have been peddling.</p>

<p>This story is a gold mine of hypocrisy - especially when you are someone like me who is an independent and didn&#39;t vote for either idiot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct. It doesn&#39;t use the word &quot;bribed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They also obtained an eyewitness account — backed by documents — indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton’s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I read the Hill story and I&#39;m confused what the collusion is supposed to be.  It seems like there&#39;s separate things:</p>

<p>1) Russian uranium company paying kickbacks to a trucking company, which the FBI investigated, and people were arrested -- the article seems to fault the DOJ for not taking more credit?  (&quot;But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged&quot;)</p>

<p>2) U.S. agencies, one of which was the state department, declined to block a sale of shares in a Canadian uranium company to that same Russian company -- article says nobody knows if the committee making that decision ever heard about the trucking kickbacks</p>

<p>3) Russians -- not identified in the article -- donated to the Clinton Foundation</p>

<p>Article doesn&#39;t really tie any of these threads together</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That the Clintons are too powerful.</p>

<p>But I think the release of this story verifying that the information that the FBI has is to lay on the pressure to get the government to press charges. They can&#39;t just prosecute the Clintons without winning public approval for the prosecution. They aren&#39;t like me who the government could come in and arrest without raising much of a stir.</p>
