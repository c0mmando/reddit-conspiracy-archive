    <div class="md"><p>What about flying saucers from a physicist’s point of view? Edward Lovick, the grandfather of America’s stealth technology, says that in the late 1950s, Kelly Johnson had him spend many months in Lockheed’s anechoic chamber radar testing small-scale models of flying saucers. “Little wooden discs built in the Skunk Works wood shop,” Lovick recalls. According to Lovick, Kelly Johnson eventually decided that round-shaped aircraft—flying discs without wings—were aerodynamically unstable and therefore too dangerous for pilots to fly. This was before the widespread use of pilotless aircraft, or drones....</p>

<p>The EG&amp;G engineer’s explanation about the child pilots inside the flying disc answers the riddle of the so-called Roswell aliens, certainly in a manner that would satisfy the fourteenth-century English friar and philosopher William of Ockham. It is an answer that is not more complicated than the riddle itself.</p>

<p>According to the EG&amp;G engineer, the aviators were not aliens but were created to look like them, by Josef Mengele, “shortly before or immediately after the end of the war.” Children would have had great difficulty piloting an aircraft. The engineer says he was told the flying disc was piloted remotely, but offered almost no information about what would have had to have been the larger aircraft from which this early “drone” was launched. “It came down over Alaska,” he says.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would be really interested to be proven wrong, but the likelihood of that anon having inside info on aliens is vanishingly small. They don&#39;t even grasp basic facts that would be well-known to anyone in intelligence, like the fact that Bush and Clinton ran drugs through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mena_Intermountain_Municipal_Airport">Mena Airport</a>.</p>

<p>That should lead us to question why they are pushing discussion away from McCarran, or more likely a small airport in the area that could have been used to run CIA contraband. It&#39;s a virtual certainty at this point that the &quot;shooter&quot; was a CIA pilot of some kind.</p>
