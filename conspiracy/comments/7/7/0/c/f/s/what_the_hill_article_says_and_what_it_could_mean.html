        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is the article :  <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/355749-fbi-uncovered-russian-bribery-plot-before-obama-administration?amp">http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/355749-fbi-uncovered-russian-bribery-plot-before-obama-administration?amp</a>  I advise you to read the whole article before reading what I have to say about it.</p>

<p>Some dates we need to know : </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Eric Holder, Attorney General (In charge of FBI and DOJ) :  In office February 3, 2009 – April 27, 2015</p></li>
<li><p>Loretta Lynch, Attorney General (successor to Eric Holder) :  In office April 27, 2015 – January 20, 2017</p></li>
<li><p>Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State :  In office January 21, 2009 – February 1, 2013</p></li>
<li><p>Robert Mueller, Director of the FBI :  In office September 4, 2001 – September 4, 2013</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2009, Eric Holder was the Attorney General, Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI, and of course Obama was the President.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They also obtained an eyewitness account - backed by documents - indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton&#39;s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This states that Russian <em>nuclear</em> officials gave the Clinton Foundation <strong>millions of dollars</strong> during the time she &quot;served on a government body that provided a favorable decision...&quot;  This can mean only one thing.  The donations to the Clinton Foundation happened between when Hillary became the secretary (Jan 21, 2009) and the time when the uranium deal was approved.  This was in Oct. 2010, when Uranium One (Canadian company) was partially sold to Rosatom (Russian company), giving them 20% control of the company.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin&#39;s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, Robert Mueller knew that there was <strong>substantial evidence</strong> that Russia was bribing and extorting American interests, AND that the Clinton Foundation was receiving millions in contribution at the same time.  This should also mean that Eric Holder, whom Mueller would have reported to, knew about the evidence as well.  But the Secretary of the State and the President approved the deal anyway.</p>

<p>This is treason.  Clear and simple.  Selling uranium to Russia while taking bribes.  This is a heinous crime.  This is corruption at its worst.  And to think, Hillary has been blaming the Russians for a year now for her loss.  Unbelievable.  The only condolence I&#39;ve received from this is knowing that this is just the TIP of the iceberg.  More information will follow.  This could be the greatest scandal in American history.  </p>

<p>I have no doubt now that the tarmac meeting between Lynch and Bill was about this cover up.  About how none of this would get out.  These are the most despicable people in the world.  Excuse me now, I&#39;m gonna go throw up.</p>

<p>Anyone who disagrees with OP is downvoted. And you guys call us liberals snowflake lol. </p>

<p>Also OP&#39;s run down is completely wrong. Hillary Clinton alone didn&#39;t have any power to decide for herself in the deal. It had to be approved by nine members of the Committe on Foreign Investment in the US and nine different agencies. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That included Clinton as secretary of state, but also the secretaries of the Treasury (the chairman of the committee), Defense, Justice, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security as well as the the heads of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The deal also had to be okayed by the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission as well as Utah’s nuclear regulator.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Russians donation to the CF occurred before and during her 2008 presidential bid, before she could have known she would become SoS. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also unclear whether the people donating were still involved in the company by the time the Russian uranium deal happened. So there&#39;s zero proof of any quid pro quo. </p>

<p>You guys act like Clinton herself decided upon the deal. There were nine agencies involved with this thing. On top of that, independent federal and state nuclear regulators had to sign off on the deal.</p>

<p>Russia doesn&#39;t have licenses to export the uranium out of the US, so OP&#39;s claim that this would be treason is laughable at best. </p>

<p>Something to think about: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why on earth would the United States allow the transfer of a uranium company?</p>

<p>As others, including a New York Times’ investigation, have explained, the United States was still seeking to &quot;reset&quot; its relationship with Russia and trying to get the Kremlin on board with its Iran nuclear deal. But at the end of the day, the Russian deal wasn’t that big.</p>

<p>Russia’s purchase of the company &quot;had as much of an impact on national security as it would have if they set the money on fire,&quot; said Lewis. &quot;That’s probably why (CFIUS and the NRC ) approved it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also why the fuck would it be treason, according to OP. The company was barely belonging to the US.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Back in 2007, it was a South African company that had mining assets in Africa and Australia. That spring, it merged with another mining company, the Canada-based UrAsia Energy. The combined company kept Uranium One as its name but Toronto as its base. Under the terms of the deal, the shareholders of UrAsia retained a 60 percent stake in the new company.</p>

<p>Russia didn’t get involved until two years later, in June 2009, when its nuclear agency started buying shares in Uranium One. The Kremlin upped its stake in the company from 17 percent to a controlling 51 percent the following year, and assumed total ownership of the company in 2013 (and renamed it to Uranium One Holding)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This &quot;run down&quot; is bullshit, so is the story by John Solomon at The Hill. </p>

<p>Later, when it is discovered that he accepted a bribe, do you think him saying &quot;well, I wasn&#39;t the only one who voted, so the bribe is irrelevant&quot; would make him innocent? Please answer since you seem so far superior to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>RE: timing of donations, e.g. before/during 2008 presidential run and before SoS, so she didnt know she would be SoS.</p>

<p>Yeah, she thought she would be President which is more powerful then SoS. I mean, shit, the case against trump all hinges on &quot;russian help as an attempt to get him elected&quot; - he might not have gotten elected though. But, the investment was still made no matter the outcome. Just like Clinton. The investment into CF was made, hoping for an outcome of Presidency. If she fsiled, she failed. Just like Trumps investment could have happened. SoS was just a happy secondary consolation prize. Hey, maybe obama even made the appt to help keep all this quite as it would be deveststing to the party. So while its true we dont have the written memo on donations checks as &quot;for CF wink wink&quot;, this is the same circumstantial evidence we are happily applying to Trump given that we dont have his words written anywhere that says &quot;payment for russian interference, kthxbi&quot;. Yet, for trump case, everyone assumes thst the circumstantial evidence is rock solid, but with Clinton, its meaningless allegations. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>She had no idea that she was going to be Obama&#39;s SoS either. It can&#39;t be seen as a happy secondary consolation prize because no one really expected that to happen.</p>

<p>The thing is, the uranium deal itself is really blasé. Russia already owned a good chunk of the company and they were probably more interested in the company&#39;s assets in Kazakhstan than the uranium. If the US would need more it usually imports it. So while you guys are blowing this thing entirely out of proportion you are missing that the deal itself is rather boring. </p>

<p>The real crime here was the Russian bribing by Mikerin. </p>

<p>Also there&#39;s a lot mot than circumstantial evidence about Trump &amp; friends regarding Russia collusion. Even in the public there are several admissions of guilt from Trump Jr and Peter Smith. On top of that is Manafort&#39;s and Flynn&#39;s corruption and their foreign agent status which they didn&#39;t tell anyone about which is illegal. </p>

<p>THAT is a lot more dangerous than anything related to this uranium deal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m surprised, I haven&#39;t seen <strong>nearly</strong> enough discussion of Canadian billionaire Frank Giustra&#39;s involvement in this story. He is the Clinton Foundation&#39;s all-time largest donor and a member of their board of directors. Giustra is a <em>major</em> player in the Uranium One story, starting from when he flew Bill Clinton to Kazakhstan in 2005 to meet the country&#39;s president days before Giustra closed a huge deal to purchase Kazakh uranium rights for his Panama Papers shell company UrAsia Energy, which became a major player in uranium mining overnight. Two years later, UrAsia was sold to Uranium One. Two years after that, Uranium One was sold to Russia. It wasn&#39;t about the American uranium everyone keeps talking about so much as the much larger quantity of Kazakh uranium this deal delivered to Russia, with immense profits for everyone involved.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also notable that when Clinton was appointed secretary of state, one condition was that she was to disclose all foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation over $100,000, and she originally failed to disclose tens of millions in donations from Giustra and his Canadian charity. There are so many sprawling tendrils of this issue -- it&#39;s gratifying seeing it finally get some well-deserved scrutiny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The facts aren&#39;t really in dispute.  We know that the underlying events with Uranium One took place, and we always knew how much money went to the Clintons.  </p>

<p>The only information that&#39;s new is the timing of information about kickbacks and such.  Given that we have an indictment with a cooperating witness who provided real-time recordings and such of the kickbacks, etc., it doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s much room for debate on the underlying facts.  </p>

<p>That said, nothing will happen, and it&#39;s barely any more corrupt than 100 deals that happen in DC every day.  Our government runs almost entirely on bribery and corruption.  The only difference here is that it involved Russia, the boogeyman du jour.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for doing the additional research/verification, and for summarizing with implications, and for taking the time to post it all here.</p>

<p>I am continually reminded of former actor and Senator Fred Thompson after he decided to not seek a third term. He said he became so disgusted with the moral and ethical wasteland in Hollywood that he decided to end his acting career and go to Washington to do some good for the country. He said after nine years in DC, he was even more disgusted by the much worse evil and corruption there, and decided to return to Hollywood.</p>

<p>I have never seen any readon to doubt his assessment of both locales.</p>

Selling them hundreds of billions worth of high tech military material every couple of years on top of that, is even worse than treason, it&#39;s an overt act of war against the own citizenry which hasn&#39;t really done anything to deserve such terrible fate, except for being entirely too subservient and apathetic.</p>

<p>This has gone on for far too long and they all have to go, stripped clean of the fortunes they&#39;ve amassed, which do not even cover a fraction of the losses to the nation they have caused, and live on in infamy for the rest of their lives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excuse me. But you&#39;re saying &quot;other agencies approved so Clinton is in the clear&quot;. </p>

<p>Let me ask you something. If Congress wanted to pass a law, but one Senator was resisting. So I go bribe him. He accepts, and the law gets passed.</p>

<p>Later, when it is discovered that he accepted a bribe, do you think him saying &quot;well, I wasn&#39;t the only one who voted, so the bribe is irrelevant&quot; would make him innocent? Please answer since you seem so far superior to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>RE: timing of donations, e.g. before/during 2008 presidential run and before SoS, so she didnt know she would be SoS.</p>

<p>Yeah, she thought she would be President which is more powerful then SoS. I mean, shit, the case against trump all hinges on &quot;russian help as an attempt to get him elected&quot; - he might not have gotten elected though. But, the investment was still made no matter the outcome. Just like Clinton. The investment into CF was made, hoping for an outcome of Presidency. If she fsiled, she failed. Just like Trumps investment could have happened. SoS was just a happy secondary consolation prize. Hey, maybe obama even made the appt to help keep all this quite as it would be deveststing to the party. So while its true we dont have the written memo on donations checks as &quot;for CF wink wink&quot;, this is the same circumstantial evidence we are happily applying to Trump given that we dont have his words written anywhere that says &quot;payment for russian interference, kthxbi&quot;. Yet, for trump case, everyone assumes thst the circumstantial evidence is rock solid, but with Clinton, its meaningless allegations. </p>
