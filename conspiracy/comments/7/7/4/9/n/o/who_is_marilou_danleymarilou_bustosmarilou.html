She has a really sketchy past. NewsWeek posted that she had 2 husbands and 2 different social security numbers, but then retracted their statement. The only people that would have 2 social security numbers, names, spouses, and lives are either criminals or intelligence officials, or both. There is tons of public information about this lady. Below are links to her sketchy past:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I can, for one second, attempt to be a voice of reason here.  Posts like these are terrifying to me.  While I don&#39;t think it&#39;s outlandish to be looking into connected people, it can also turn into a shitshow.</p>

<p>And if I happened to be dating someone that was involved in some wild conspiracy theory, it&#39;d be a nightmare to know people were digging into my shit.</p>

<p>Bottom line:  If you&#39;re going to do it, at least try to be respectful.  Because this is exactly why this community gets a bad rap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Given the nature and import of the crime her alleged boyfriend has been blamed for it&#39;s a line of inquiry that deserves to be fully researched and if the facts that turn up indicate that she has a past that that&#39;s as unusual and as strange as it happens to be and that is also a matter that public records themselves have revealed about her, I have no idea whatsoever about what you&#39;re possibly objecting to.</p>

<p>What those records point out is that she isn&#39;t any ordinary person and quite possibly not even the person she&#39;s being described as being. </p>

<p>Clearly it&#39;s illegal to have multiple social security numbers that mainly indicates that a person is involved in some kind of fraudulent activities. Anyone can, of course use any name that they choose, provided that it isn&#39;t in order to deceive anyone about who or what they are or to defraud anyone by way of it and given the former she can&#39;t simply be given a pass on that. </p>

<p>Before pushing her out of the picture the authorities themselves indicated that she had numerous aliases and multiple social security numbers to go with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree at all.  And I would hope the proper authorities are investigating diligently.  On the off chance there <em>is</em> a conspiracy and for some reason they are not, it&#39;s my hope that the conspiracy community investigate responsibly - something Reddit and keyboard warriors aren&#39;t particularly known for.</p>

<p>Because again, if the lights and cameras were turned in MY direction, I&#39;d be terrified of the online detectives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is it strange to think that Jesus Campos might actually be related to Marilou...?</p>

<p>Supposedly she goes by a few names - Marilou Ocampo Natividad, Marilou Ocampo Bustos, Marilou Bustos Natividad, etc.</p>

<p>I did a search for her under some of those names and on instant checkmate, a Marilou Ocampo Bustos pops up in California and Nevada and it lists some of her relatives as Jesus Bustos, Rosa B Quintero and Larry Ocampo. Is there a chance Jesus Campos is an alias for Jesus Ocampo Bustos...? I think at some point too, someone found out that Jesus Campos was using the social security number of someone named Jesus Quintero, which is why that Rosa Quintero name stuck out to me.</p>

<p>I know those are somewhat common names, I just wonder if these two could actually be related in some way. One of the first pictures they showed us of Jesus was a straight-on photo of him from the neck up, he was grinning and he looked healthy, he had a little bit of a beard along his jawline... if you compare that photo of him to photos of Marilou and her daughter Sheila Bustos Darcy, they have the same nose, eye shape, jaw line, and red/gold complexion. </p>

<p>Marilou immigrated here as Marilou Ocampo in 89 or 90. I think Jesus was born in 1992. Is it possible she could be his mother, maybe? Or an Aunt? I know she has a few brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>Whether they’re related or not, I have a strong suspicion that both Marilou and Jesus were in on this in some way. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>but then retracted their statement</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Newsweek has retracted its story that reviewed public records of Marilou Danley, the girlfriend of Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The initial report was based on the marriage record of Danley, who was known under a different name when she married Geary Danley in Clark County, Nevada. Newsweek mistakenly matched that record to a second public record of a different person.</p>

<p>The mistake was revealed when a Newsweek reporter re-interviewed a person who had initially declined to comment for our story.</p>
