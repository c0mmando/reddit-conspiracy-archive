        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay, I&#39;ve seen several people post recently about sources they think are misinformation, and I think they make valid points. I think our biggest problem at the moment is that we aren&#39;t organizing information that&#39;s come in, organizing what seems to be debunked.. to simply be able to look at it all, and think about what it is we are missing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to bed soon, but I&#39;m willing to try to organize something, but at the moment all I have to work with is my mobile which will make it more difficult. Is anyone else willing to try this from another approach? <strong>Edit</strong>: I don&#39;t think any one person could organize like I&#39;m talking about, I think it could take a dozen people to organize datasets, then a few people attempting to organize what they&#39;ve gathered.</p>

<p>The idea, is to approach it from more of an investigative stand point. Start by breaking it down into a timeline, state what the &quot;official statement&quot; is for each segment, then assemble each cohesive alternate explanation is, and what possible things refute that information.</p>

<p>The goal is to have something comparable to the white board you see in TV shows. Something you can look at, and question: what are we missing? Is there a better way of looking at this?</p>

<p>The reason: posts get buried, valid proof didn&#39;t get noticed, debunked things keep getting mentioned, multiple sources that contradict each other happen..</p>

<p>So again, is anyone interested in making a megathread to organize this in a way that allows us to simply look at the facts and go from there?</p>

<p>r/lasvegasfalseflag seemed to me, to be a kind of attempt at this, but that&#39;s one user cherry picking what they think matters.. and I think that as a collective we can do much better.</p>

<p>And if you think there&#39;s a better way to organize, better methods, please do comment.</p>

<p>As there&#39;s likely to be an increasingly bigger gap between us getting anything official, I think we would be better served by using the time to organize what we know, what we think we know.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the way I envision this, is we figure out how to best divide the timeline: before event, during event, post event. Then each element within each part: paddock, Campos, engineer, misc.. etc.</p>

<p>Each part of the timeline would be its own post, multiple would likely need to be made.. then a parent or more than one that attempts to organize the &quot;big picture&quot;.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen anything that strikes me as methodical, or attempts to really organize in general. If anything does exist, feel free to let me know..</p>

<p>At this point, I&#39;m pretty sure all agree, what we&#39;ve been told doesn&#39;t make sense. So why not attempt to organize something that does make sense, that we can then use to get closer to some form of truth.</p>

<p>I will say, I think motive shouldn&#39;t be part of this, as it will be more complex and opinion based.. and likely require several posts of its own to try to analyze.</p>

<p>I will edit typos and that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing I think officials have been completely honest about, is how complex this situation is. The very fact that we have very little officially told to us is evidence, but how much backtracking they&#39;ve had to do is absolute proof in my opinion.</p>

<p>Besides, everything deserves its own approach.. I&#39;m only presenting an idea of how to break things down and organize. It could be much more methodical, and maybe come up with better results if it is.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think any kind of template could contain this bad boy.. but you&#39;re welcome to find one?</p>

<p>I just want to see us do more with the information we have, rather than argue and lose possible facts to time..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly think this is a created diversion to keep people focused on domestic terrorism instead of real issues, for example: what just transpired with the devastation this hurricane season; all of a sudden Elon Musk basically owns Puerto Rico, or the Flint water crisis, or the multitude of other crazy shenanigans going on?</p>

<p>Side note:  Terrorism was created by America.  It is a fabrication that has come to fucking life, but I&#39;m no longer terrified and here&#39;s why: </p>

<p>People like us are spreading doubt when it comes to the mainstream narrative, enlightening others who wouldn&#39;t typically be influenced, to do their own investigations and ask their own questions.  </p>

<p>This activity will only see exponential growth.   Especially if we keep recognizing the people who die fighting for truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I&#39;ll argue that there was a White guy in one of the Carolinas that attempted to blow people up, to start a civil war.</p>

<p>More facts, he created a bomb that read supposed to blow up many hours later, at 6am, that involved shrapnel, at an airport.</p>

<p>If you Google &quot;Civil War Carolina airport&quot; you should be able to find it pretty easily, it happened after the Las Vegas Massacre..</p>

<p>So, if the purpose is as simple as to divide us, why is this not actually covered by mainstream news? &quot;A thwarted airport bombing receives little press&quot; being the headline of the only kind of mainstream media that covered it.</p>

<p>My point.. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that simple.</p>

<p>Sorry for grammar errors if any, I&#39;m drinking.</p>

<p>I&#39;m talking about a community effort to try to organize the information..</p>

<p>I wish there was a filter that simply removed all the sexual allegations and other stuff that seems far less important.. but you didn&#39;t pull every single post regarding the Las Vegas event.</p>

<p>I think and hope there&#39;s people that have tried to organize information themselves, and others that just have certain facts they&#39;ve held onto that they want to contribute with.. but I&#39;m on mobile, and my clipboard has been full a while now, even after dumping it in a notes app multiple times.</p>

<p>Do you want to help organize the information that you&#39;ve gathered? There&#39;s just so much, I think it will require a lot of people putting in a lot of effort..</p>

<p>yes.  the idea was to have a central location for all posts... i wasn&#39;t going to be the editor.  i figure others would be able to use that sub for a good source.</p>

<p>I would rather we not delete anything.  All meta data is valuable - even the troll data gives investigators an idea of how the trolling is being propagated.</p>

<p>If you want to be helpful, please started creating a wiki timeline, as you suggested -- that would be really terrific!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as sexual allegations go, I&#39;m talking about the many different posts that have made it harder to find anything Las Vegas related.. Weinstein, Hillary and Russia.. it&#39;s been harder to find posts related to Las Vegas, because so much else is being spammed in this sub.</p>

<p>Plenty of people are posting relevant things without the key words Las Vegas.. basically, there&#39;s no way to filter through all the other things being posted in this sub.</p>

<p>Basically, u/totesmessenger(sp?) hasn&#39;t been pointing out you linking to many posts I think are very relevant.. but that&#39;s because there&#39;s been an obvious agenda of posting duplicate posts, or spamming the sub with things that doesn&#39;t matter, because it&#39;s been posted already.</p>

<p>I think the term is sliding.. hiding things people want to know under repeated posts of the same bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The lack of blue text, or links, is the issue.
Maybe what I want is to difficult for the people really interested.. but it&#39;s one or more parent posts that link to posts like that.. that actually organized the sources it&#39;s &quot;quoting&quot;.</p>

<p>Put more simply, maybe what I&#39;m hoping for is an impossible request.. but the idea is to organize the sources of information by simply being able to click links.. you can keep clicking, going further down the rabbit hole.. with the idea that there&#39;s a bigger picture we can all look at, after validating that the rabbit hole is worthy of doing down.</p>

<p>In retrospect, what I&#39;m aiming for seems impossible.. but it&#39;s validated by the idea that officials haven&#39;t been able to make sense of this either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So far it&#39;s looking like a horrific mass murder in which we&#39;re not clear on the events leading up to it or the motivation, so many parties have created their own as stand-ins for the time being. Some have done this deliberately in order to frame what it looks like from a conspiracy perspective moving forward. Every mass shooting gets it&#39;s theory, and they&#39;ve tried to get theirs to &quot;win.&quot;</p>

<p>But in reality, we don&#39;t have many facts. Nor has the MSM given us many facts to chew on either, which is suspect and allows for more speculation. This seems an interesting part of this, as any ready-made political narrative would be seen by opponents of those politics as being a psyop government inside job, just switch up the targeted culprit group to your choosing. With the picture still unclear and unformed for the public, this is being done regardless. </p>

<p>I agree that the public and the media hasn&#39;t been given many facts, and the mainstream media is unusually disinterested in finding them of their own accord.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in multiple shooters, gun deals gone bad, or crisis actors.  I also don&#39;t believe that Paddock is a ghost with no past, no politics, no associations, and no friends that he ever confided in.  </p>

<p>I do believe that paddock spent months, if not years, meticulously planning an attack on a country music concert in Las Vegas.  I believe that if it had been a Dead Kennedys concert in Portland the MSM wouldn&#39;t be so accepting of the &quot;no motive&quot; narrative coming out of law enforcement.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m not putting much stock in the promoted theories as they stand, each has been invented from the raw material we know about or simply made up to fit an agenda. It is quite strange that so much of this is a void so far. </p>

<p>What do we seem to know about Paddock? Had some money, a gambler, on anxiety meds, abusive/controlling with his girlfriend. There&#39;s always such a rush to the government or CIA motivation, but this neglects the role something like the mob might play, or (perhaps most depressingly of all) the idea that he was simply a well-concealed psychopath who always intended to go out this way. It was easy for him to buy these (legal) weapons, rent that suite, and the festival was an easy target. Some things are so brutally simple they just <em>must</em> be more complex than we feel comfortable admitting. Still I await more facts and some evidence. </p>

<p>I am reminded of the low IQ Australian twentysomething who went on that rampage in &#39;96. He had no known political affiliation or gripe, was driven to mass murder over good-old vengeance. This didn&#39;t stop some Aussie parties from believing it was a big plot to disarm the country, though, a theory that persists after all these years regardless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree to a degree.. I was offered to mod r/lasvegasfalseflag, since their intension was to gather information on everything Las Vegas, but it doesn&#39;t exactly have a user base, and linking to posts here that are made there aren&#39;t going to effectively do anything to change exactly what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>Ultimately, if people make a conscious effort to hide posts regarding Las Vegas, regardless of what we do.. they can do it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The thing is, there&#39;s plenty of people here who likely have been researching, gathering links to YouTube videos, posts on here.. how many thousand posts do you think have been posted here in the 17 days since it happened?</p>

<p>A small group of people sifting through so much information, considering they may be biased, or too skeptical, or.. that&#39;s why I think a collaborative effort of a diverse base is far more likely to give better results.</p>

<p>Plus, there&#39;s simply more information related to this, than anything I can think of to date. If 100s of law enforcement haven&#39;t found answers they can give us, having thousands of minds contributing might have a better result.</p>

<p>I think the biggest problem is that no one has been approaching it from a methodical and organized way, that&#39;s what I&#39;m proposing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this post was just to see if anyone is interested.. how the information is organized is going to be the most important step, no one is really talking about that here.</p>

<p>If you wanted to make a post that links back to here, with the general focus on being what is the best way to break down the timeline, so that no post/person is going to try to organize more information than is possible.</p>

<p>For instance, information anytime before the event, the preparation phase (3-7 days before the event?), The actual event (probably the biggest section), what&#39;s happened since the event..</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure that breaks it down enough, so a post to see if anyone has any better ideas as to how to organize would probably be helpful.</p>

<p>I saw someone mention using previous events as a template, but I think this event is far too complex to fit into any other attempt at organizing information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>do i think the mods would do that? yes yes i do, i&#39;ve been here long enough to watch it happen multiple times. this is not some place immune to the fuckery of reddit, dont think for a second this place is better than worldnews or the the_donald, its not, we just pay more attention and call it out when it happens.</p>

<p>a lot of info and links have popped up here only to be buried or removed. i suggest using an off reddit site to save that sort of info, use reddit to find it. prep your posts elsewhere and post results or things you want to share or ask for input on but under no circumstances think a megathread is a good idea to host all that info. all it takes is a &quot;mistake&quot; by some admin to bury, edit, or delete that info.</p>

<p>also keep in mind when you share a source here, if its something that has slipped through the internet clean up teams it will instantly get more attention and possibly be removed from the source hosting it.</p>

<p>so download it and rehost it yourself if you can (so the original source stays up longer)</p>

<p>closed Sub&#39;s are a good place to get a tighter knit group but again its still on reddit and imho this whole platform is compromised and part of the problem and maybe even part of the groups pushing things like the LV shootings.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, everyone can see all changes made, and by who with a Google doc. The owner can revert it back to any point via snapshots made with every change. It would be nearly impossible to do anything truly damaging, worst would be adding stupid sources, but then again, the idea to gather information, not decide whether it&#39;s worthy before it&#39;s gathered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In no way am I saying no one else should do it too.. and do you think the mods here would delete a post about one of the most popular subjects at the moment, or do you think the people making each post would?</p>

<p>I&#39;d love to get some links to anyone else that&#39;s working on one, or even any that have already been made..</p>

<p>The mod of r/LasVegasFalseflag offered for me to be a mod, do you think it&#39;s more or less likely to be effected by negative actors if the main posts are created there?</p>
