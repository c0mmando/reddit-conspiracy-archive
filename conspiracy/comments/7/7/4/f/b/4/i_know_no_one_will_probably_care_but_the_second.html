Both since it happened, and two concerts at the venue years ago. There wasn&#39;t an angle I could see, and I posted a few pics a couple nights ago, that could have allowed for a second shooter. Mandalay has no more shot out windows. Luxor, if they had shot out windows, were a lot quicker at fixing them which would be odd since they&#39;re both MGM properties. The condos across the free way (The Martin or whatever they&#39;re called now) are too far for accurate fire other than snipers. Plus, they&#39;re a condo complex, so less likely some rando shows up with lots of suitcases and isn&#39;t scrutinized.</del></p>

<p><del>I&#39;ve been to a handful of the other casinos recently as well, and there was nowhere &quot;off limits&quot; like you&#39;d expect if they were trying to cover up bullet holes.</del></p>

<p><del>If there&#39;s something fishy, it&#39;s on Campos or the as yet unanswered &quot;why&quot; wrt to the amount of guns/explosives/etc that Paddock had with him.</del></p>

<p>Edit: After watching video provided by  <a href="/u/letsgetphysical__">/u/letsgetphysical__</a> I&#39;m convinced I may be wrong. I can see flashes from the Delano, which is part of, but not connected to at high levels, Mandalay Bay. </p>

<p>I did. And if you dig through my post history, like a lot of people here seem to do, you&#39;ll see a lot of posts about Vegas. Including shots from Saturday at the actual scene. </p>

<p>And if Campos is dead, that just adds to my point that it centered on him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The audio is interesting. I&#39;ve seen a couple videos that initially had me on the &quot;multiple shooters&quot; bandwagon. After seeing the site, I don&#39;t see anywhere he suggests that could work other than, as I said in my previous post, <em>maybe</em> the apartments on Giles (doubtful, they were herded that way due to closed exits, would have been way more casualties) or the second window which is the last thing giving me pause. </p>

<p>I saw a good portion of the perimeter of the SkyVue wheel legs, yes they have doors on the opposite side of me, but none of the fence was disturbed. Same with the dirt mound at SkyVue. Not high enough to get over the stage, and no disturbed fences. </p>

<p>It&#39;s entirely possible I&#39;m wrong, and will openly admit to that if it comes out, but from having spent a lot of time in that area pre-shooting for concerts and working at one of the casinos plus the time I spent down there last weekend, I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s likely there was a shooter on/near the ground. Plenty of people have shown he could easily kill that many people from his perch, and a lot of the injuries are from crowd trampling/running/fear. </p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t. Far more likely is the <a href="http://www.fakeology.com">fakeology</a> angle which suggests there were no actual shooters, and this was little more than a made-for-TV movie.</p>

Casinos don&#39;t like losing money even more than they don&#39;t like publicizing it. Bellagio tracked a motorcycle rider like 2-3 miles away after he robbed their cage or tables a few years, and he was caught because of it. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the church works, much like the apartments. Because of the closed exits (if that&#39;s not people being confused, because I&#39;ve only ever seen exits on the east side) they would have been herded that way to get out and I think the kill count would have been higher. </p>

<p>Vegas. Concert. Drunk. </p>

<p>I see a bunch of people crouched, like they&#39;re depending on the chain link to save them. It&#39;s a still. Show me a vid and I&#39;ll buy it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So why are they lit like it is during the day, at about 5pm?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was at least 10PM. Videos prove this. It was dark when shots rang out. A still with spotlights and floodlights doesn&#39;t make multiple videos and 911 calls from the scene suddenly change time. This sentences reads like &quot;I&#39;ve never been to a concert or sporting event inside/at night in my life.&quot; </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&#39;t sound like the bio of a mass murderer to me. Sounds like the bio of a planted agent.</p>

<p>Yep. No disagreement. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>but he is also linked to Contemporary Services Corporation. What is that? It just happens to specialize in crowd control and crowd creation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? A person that makes money by filling arenas and casinos to make events look important is involved in drawing crowds? A Person that might lose money if any of those in attendance dies is involved in security? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some are saying they couldn&#39;t have created a crowd of 20,000 in Las Vegas, but they can</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They do. Regularly. Casinos, sporting events, concerts, conventions... Las Vegas is the home of crowds. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Other researchers have shown that prior to the fake shooting spree, Crowds on Demand placed ads in Craigslist and other places looking to hire crisis actors by the thousands. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I remember this post. No argument again. It may have been planned and staged, but it wasn&#39;t a hoax and people did die.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking of the Department of Homeland Security, did you know that there were other smaller shooting events that night at other Las Vegas casinos? They have been overshadowed by the Mandalay Bay event, but shots (again probably blanks) were fired at many casinos</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t completely dispute this. I&#39;ve seen in person a couple of the alleged sites and have seen no bullet holes or patchwork anything to lead me to believe something happened, so I doubt they were live shots if any shots at all. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the focus now to keep going, but I feel like I have made my point. If not, I&#39;m never going to convince you unless I develop time travel and take you back to the even with me. </p>
