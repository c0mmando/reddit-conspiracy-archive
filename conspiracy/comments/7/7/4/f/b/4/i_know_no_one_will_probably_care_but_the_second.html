        I'm not gonna spend a lot of time here, because I know no one is going to believe me, but I've been down to the site. Both since it happened, and two concerts at the venue years ago. There wasn't an angle I could see, and I posted a few pics a couple nights ago, that could have allowed for a second shooter. Mandalay has no more shot out windows. Luxor, if they had shot out windows, were a lot quicker at fixing them which would be odd since they're both MGM properties. The condos across the free way (The Martin or whatever they're called now) are too far for accurate fire other than snipers. Plus, they're a condo complex, so less likely some rando shows up with lots of suitcases and isn't scrutinized.

        I've been to a handful of the other casinos recently as well, and there was nowhere "off limits" like you'd expect if they were trying to cover up bullet holes.

        If there's something fishy, it's on Campos or the as yet unanswered "why" wrt to the amount of guns/explosives/etc that Paddock had with him.

       Edit: After watching video provided by
       <a href="/u/letsgetphysical__">

       I'm convinced I may be wrong. I can see flashes from the Delano, which is part of, but not connected to at high levels, Mandalay Bay.

       I did. And if you dig through my post history, like a lot of people here seem to do, you'll see a lot of posts about Vegas. Including shots from Saturday at the actual scene.

       And if Campos is dead, that just adds to my point that it centered on him.

       The audio is interesting. I've seen a couple videos that initially had me on the "multiple shooters" bandwagon. After seeing the site, I don't see anywhere he suggests that could work other than, as I said in my previous post,
       <em>
        maybe
       </em>
       the apartments on Giles (doubtful, they were herded that way due to closed exits, would have been way more casualties) or the second window which is the last thing giving me pause.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a good portion of the perimeter of the SkyVue wheel legs, yes they have doors on the opposite side of me, but none of the fence was disturbed. Same with the dirt mound at SkyVue. Not high enough to get over the stage, and no disturbed fences.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's entirely possible I'm wrong, and will openly admit to that if it comes out, but from having spent a lot of time in that area pre-shooting for concerts and working at one of the casinos plus the time I spent down there last weekend, I just don't think it's likely there was a shooter on/near the ground. Plenty of people have shown he could easily kill that many people from his perch, and a lot of the injuries are from crowd trampling/running/fear.

       What doesn't make sense to me are the reports of shooters in other casinos. We have videos of crowds running around in fear, but no gunfire in any of them. And no evidence like broken glass or bullet holes. I'm starting to think inaccurate information was spreading around and it caused people to panic throughout the strip.

       I agree. People were shot, ended up in other hotels. Timing for some of them is questionable, but not impossible. I know Vegas casinos like to cover up messes from them, so tourism doesn't get affected, but there's no way in this mess there wouldn't be some sign.

       The shooters at other casinos weren’t there to raise the body count. They were there to cause panic and confusion and cause the casinos to go into lockdown mode so witnesses wouldn’t be walking around on the strip with camera phones.

       That still doesn't explain why none of the videos have gunshots or even any evidence a shooting took place. There would be fire alarms going off from all the gun smoke.

       You’re right. Which leads me to believe this is still shaky evidence. So far, all I’ve seen is the Bellagio video that does not show any evidence that windows were shot out or anything else.

       The only two guys that witnessed the shoot out in the hallway were an illegal alien, and the brother of a Vegas police officer, what coincidence.

       Shooters could have been anywhere, there could have been a shooters on the fuel tanks, hence the reason Paddock shot at them.

       What if shots fired at other casinos were actually someone(s) seeing the news, and said 'fuck it, ill never have a better time to rob Caesars' or whatever? Pop off some rounds, run in, grab chips off tables everywhere, done. Now every now and again when you need some money you have your girl or somebody go down, cash in a thousand or whatever.

       Like I said, I didn't see gunshot impacts or areas blocked off when I was down there. I can't say it didn't happen, but if there was a robbery you can bet it would be all over the local news. Casinos don't like losing money even more than they don't like publicizing it. Bellagio tracked a motorcycle rider like 2-3 miles away after he robbed their cage or tables a few years, and he was caught because of it.

       Bullets are loud, and most people aren't used to it. The window(s) used have an open canyon with lots of tall buildings to shield/echo the sound straight up the strip the mile and a half or two miles it takes to get to P. Ho.

       I don't think the church works, much like the apartments. Because of the closed exits (if that's not people being confused, because I've only ever seen exits on the east side) they would have been herded that way to get out and I think the kill count would have been higher.

       I wrote up a theory where the 2nd shooter, and even Paddock/whoever was shooting from Mandalay weren't going for kills. They were purposely herding the people to those fuel tanks. That's why so many people ended up at the airport. Whoever was supposed to park the vehicle with Paddock's 2nd phone to detonate the ammonium nitrate/tannerite and subsequently blow the tanks backed out. Take of it what you will. You've been on the ground down there, you know the scene better than 95% of us here.

       I could buy that theory. I'm not sold on the "Lone Wolf" thing, because nothing about that makes sense. I'd totally buy the "it was supposed to be bigger but people backed out/got scared" angle though.

       They're making you run in circles trying to make sense of an event that cannot possibly make sense.  It doesn't make sense because it didn't happen.  No one died.  It was a drill.

       I don't buy that. I know people that were there. My company lost someone that was there. It's easy to dismiss, until it happens to you. I feel the same as you about Sandy Hook and Aurora, but Vegas hit home hard. It was not a drill, not a hoax, and real people did die. It may have been a false flag, or a secret op gone wrong, but it was not a hoax.

       Do you personally know them, or do you just know of them.  Like, have you had a meal with them?  The deep state has many ways to hide or disappear or fake or relocate identities.  Many people on the victim list have ties the MIC/intelligence community.  Some of them don't exist at all.

       I have interacted with them over the phone. This was many months before the event. I have co-workers who I have interacted with in person and trust that have also dealt with injured family from this. As I've said in the past, I don't want or expect you to believe me because I'm not a public figure and not going to produce evidence, but I am 100% confident this was not a false flag.

       It was at least 10PM. Videos prove this. It was dark when shots rang out.

       I can't completely dispute this. I've seen in person a couple of the alleged sites and have seen no bullet holes or patchwork anything to lead me to believe something happened, so I doubt they were live shots if any shots at all.

Focus 2m41s to 2m45s on that video. There's muzzle flash. You can argue if it was blanks or not, but there's flash there. Someone was firing a gun in that video, from where Paddock should have been!

       Also, watched your other two videos. The last is the most compelling. People were moving before the big volleys, and looked to be in a hurry. This is why I believe there were additional shots and why I believe this was probably a hit rather than a crazy dude that had no reason to go crazy.

       What convinces it's a hoax is how bad the crisis actors are in the videos they put out in order to fool people into believing it's real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider that "NSFL" video that's the only video that shows a dead body on the entire internet.  It is not scary at all, it's comical.  Watch it carefully:

      <p>
       Why this video is fake:

       His behaviour is so abnormal because it's a propaganda piece released by the crisis production company.  Why is a random nobody documenting himself being a hero and barking orders at EMTs?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have the interviews with the victims and their ridiculous stories that don't match what our eyes see:

       The "why this is fake" thing also doesn't convince me. I can hold a phone and say I'm a nurses son too. And depending how long ago the last shot was, I'd buy that it'd already stopped. The video at the beginning already contains too much "alleged" information to take seriously.

       The focus I had at 2m41s to 2m45s is the complete wrong hotel. The Delano is attached at ground to third level of the MB, but the flashes are coming from the Delano. The flashes match up, at least at full speed, to the pings on the ground. I still don't believe this is a hoax as I personally know people affected, but this got even stranger.

       I think that if we can learn how Paddock actually made a living, we will gain some important clues as to what happened. If Paddock had not committed any shooting, a brief profile of the man would suggest involvement with organized crime or intelligence/defense contractors. There's something very fishy about this guy and its not the type of character you would expect to commit mass murder.

       Not necessarily.  The sounds are from either blanks or speakers.

       I think that if we can learn how Paddock actually made a living, we will gain some important clues as to what happened. If Paddock had not committed any shooting, a brief profile of the man would suggest involvement with organized crime or intelligence/defense contractors. There's something very fishy about this guy and its not the type of character you would expect to commit mass murder.
