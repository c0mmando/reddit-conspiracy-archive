        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The LVMPD knows the full scale motive of this attack but cannot be truthful about it because it implicates the FBI in one of the most massive corrupt schemes in American History and selling arms to ISIS Terrorists within US Borders. Stephen Paddock was an undercover FBI Agent and an arms dealer who participated in multiple illegal arms trades and entrapment schemes in the Las Vegas area. Paddock was undergoing a routine deal but terrorists found out ahead of time of Paddock&#39;s true identity as a federal agent. They shot him in the chest and carried out the attack and fled the scene in 3 large black vehicles.  Hence why Sheriff Lombardo looks scared to death during the last press conference, with Special Agent Aaron Rouse intimidating the shit out of him like a hawk. He blatantly looks like he&#39;s a good man, but he is being strong armed and threatened, to lie, on behalf of covering up the FBI&#39;s ass, and the truth. </p>

<p>So imagine Paddock, a millionaire, is an illegal arms dealer, dealing weapons to ISIS perhaps. The deal goes sour, they shoot Paddock in the chest, he bleeds out. The militants then carry out the massive shooting rampage. </p>

<p>There are transcripts of shooters at the Aria, the NY NY, the MGM, the Bellagio, the Tropicana, Ballys, and the Beau Rivage. </p>

<p>EDIT: By the way, can anyone give me their opinion on what the fuck that video is at the Tropicana with 5 armed men (looks like Blackwater, or Sheriff Dept. SWAT) with assault rifles, walking through the casino, pointing guns at civillians (which you DO NOT DO), and then a man in a suit in the back, and most peculiarly, an average joe, in orange tennis shoes and ratty clothes, carrying some sort of briefcase, or device. It was like the armed men were escorting this guy. What the fuck is that video? Creeps me out.</p>

<p>Question #1: With all the low key reports from people that were actually in these various hotels that claim they heard gunfire IN the various hotels (i&#39;ve seen footage of people running frantically in at least 2 of these hotels, like COLUMBINE), has <strong>no one</strong> reported actually seeing a gunman/gunmen? If it was Islamic Terrorists, I feel like I would have heard at least 1 witness testimony of someone saying &quot;he shouted Allauhu Akhbar and opened fire..&quot;. I just find it peculiar that we have hundreds of people on Youtube/Snapchat, etc (and I do believe them) that claim there was gunfire in (the aria, the Bellagio...etc..) but no one actually saw a gunman/gunmen..strange. What&#39;s yall take on that?</p>

<p>Secondly, I heard multiple reports of people saying there was machine gun fire coming from a PA system of sorts, or like the hotel sound system, intercom? Like it was a recording... what the fuck is that about? If that is true, this is a massive &quot;thing&quot;, whether it be false flag, diversion of some other event, cover up, psychological test? What is that about?</p>

<p>Lastly, the whole JANET thing. Do y&#39;all think this would have anything to do with the fact that JANET is literally across the street from Mandalay Bay and the concert venue, right next to the gas tanks? Look up JANET if you don&#39;t know what that is... leads to some very interesting observations with the fact of what it is, and the fact that their airport hub is right up in there where all this shit went down. It is INCREDIBLY plausible that the &quot;other shooters&quot; escaped on JANET. After all, JANET literally means &quot;Just Another Non Existent Terminal&quot;.</p>

<p>And my last question... the closest event I can think of to this was the Paris attacks that happened fairly recently. There was no question with any of that. That <strong>WAS</strong> ISIS. There is footage all over Live Leak of Isis Militants walking through the streets firing rounds at people, and yelling Allahuah Akhbar etc. There is footage out the wazoo. Legit. With this Vegas deal, there is NO FOOTAGE of Paddock on any hotel cameras. Now perhaps there is tons of footage but the authorities are holding onto it for investigation. I would understand that. But with Columbine, Paris, etc, there was video camera footage of the shooters available for the world to see very quickly. You mean to tell me... that on the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay, <em>there are no security cameras</em> looking down the halls, at the entrance to the rooms? Bullshit. You mean to tell me there is no security footage of an alleged Stephen Paddock bringing 12 luggage bags of guns and ammunition into his room? Bullshit. It&#39;s a fucking CASINO, where the eyes of security can see every square inch of the place. There is no footage because I don&#39;t believe Paddock brought all that shit into his room, and if he did, he had help. <em>There were more people involved</em>. Bottom fucking line. I reckon If i got to take a look at the real footage it would show a very different narrative than what we are being told. Something is wrong here... so terribly wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That absolutely crossed my mind. ISIS militants would go out guns blazing without a doubt in my mind. Martyrdom. But, the fact that Paddock lay there dead, man, this just reeks of Paddock being present for the whole thing, but not an actual shooter. I still don&#39;t understand the Jesus Campos thing. I&#39;m still waiting for a lead on that..</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But why would Mossad carry out an attack on US civilians?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same reason Mossad was primarily responsible for 9/11:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>to blame a mid-east boogey man of the day -- then Al Qaeda™, now ISIS™ -- this is the &quot;false flag&quot; part.</p></li>
<li><p>to enrage Westerners against &quot;mooooooslims&quot;, and trigger the invasions of &quot;enemies of Israel&quot; (Iraq, Syria Libya, Iran, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>related: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RC1Mepk_Sw">General Wesley Clark: Wars Were Planned - Seven Countries In Five Years</a></p>

<ul>
<li>the non-israeli zio-fascist bankers also benefit (more weapons being sold, blown-up and needing more) + oil.</li>
</ul>

<p>so it&#39;s really a win/win for anyone supportive of the zio-fascist cabal. </p>

<p>/it&#39;s not just America... anywhere you see ISIS™ operating... it&#39;s just a big false flag organization trying to piss-off Westerners in hopes of getting the respective countries to invade Islamic countries in the middle east -- primarily for Israel and the zio-fascist bankers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve witnessed my fair share of head wounds...that&#39;s not a lot of blood for a frontal lobe shot.   The reason blood is coming out of his mouth is because he shot through the sinus cavity, and the blood is taking the path of least resistance.   A shot to the frontal lobe isn&#39;t necessarily fatal unless the victim bleeds out, which is usually why someone dies from that wound.   Watch the Bud Dwyer suicide video.   Basically shoots himself in the same place and watch how much blood comes from his nose and mouth and ask if you think Paddock shows nearly as much.</p>
