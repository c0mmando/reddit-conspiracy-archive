       Right. Thank you. Pertinent information.

       Since you need someone to put it in simpler terms: we all know there is widespread vote manipulation via not and discussion dilution/distraction, all for the sake of pushing an agenda. Multiple subs, many agendas- big or small, political or marketing.
      </p>

       Can you explain what you view as "an agenda" and also explain why you don't expect nearly every subreddit to have one? From
       <a href="/r/pol">
        /r/pol
       </a>
       to TD to Kotakuinaction to conspiracy to srs, all subreddits are subject of the rules that their mods deem appropriate. All subreddits have communities with ideals that somewhat align, communities that downvote lies and / or dissenting opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would help if people weren't constantly trolling. Mods wouldn't be so quick to implement these rules and communities wouldn't be so quick to reject benghazi-level nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you want an example of how this "agenda bs" is happening everywhere, look no further than our sub right here. China gave Trump's daughter numerous patents as part of a deal with our president. But we saw crickets here, nothing, zilch, nada, because almost no one in this community cares if the conspiracy points to a conservative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should pol be the opposite of that and make it so that no one cares if a conspiracy points to a leftist? Absolutely not. But Obama, Hillary... these people aren't in office. They're not accepting bribes
       <em>
        right now

       Yes, subreddits have themes. That is... Reddit. How hard is it to get through your skull that 3rd parties, with agendas of their own, operate within these themed communities? Damn dude.

      <p>
       And I see you're still caught up in partisan bullshit. Obama, Hillary, and Trump are all on the same team. You act like it's a given every politician is corrupt, then claim that Obama and Hillary are not taking bribes simply because they are no longer in office haha.

       All of reddit is manipulated by bots and shills. But most of the time, posts on here about how 9/11 was actually al qaeda will be downvoted by nearly every subscriber. Calling Bernie a communist on his sub gets the same reaction. I think you're pretending that the pol sub is an even mix of all viewpoints when it's not. It's 90-95% leftists on there downvoting anything they deem conservative.

       Yes. It's happened to me a lot when I first started. I think it has to do with average karma on a subreddit.

       I'm a leftist in every sense except I oppose gun control. I buy into the hillary did  Benghazi nonsense about as much as I buy into the NRA being responsible for the Vegas shooting, which means I don't buy it. I was being downvoted on most of my comments because I think it's silly to push the debunked 9/11 trutherism and pizzagate instead of pushing questions about Michael Hastings or Pat Tillman. This crowd doesn't like that... those deaths don't help a right-wing agenda.

       Well when you come here and say you can't buy into the 9/11 truth, you'll get downvoted because it's been proven that it didn't happen like we were told. Are you really not going to take in the facts presented by structural engineers and other leaders in the fields who know what they're talking about?

       There are no "leaders in their field" who dispute that 9/11 was terrorists who smashed planes into the WTC filled with enough jet fuel to cause a collapse from the burning. The people you refer to, they are fringe weirdoes without any sort of reputation at stake, starved for attention or filled with too much ignorance to look at the facts and make a sound judgement. I have seen actual experiments showing that jet fuel can weaken steel beams enough to make them bend like jello. And that experiment was done outdoors, not
       <em>
        inside
       </em>
       where the heat is trapped.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was a truther for a long time. And each and every point that I believed to be lies, I looked long and hard to find out why the government was covering things up. Eventually I realized that there is no conspiracy other than negligence... that some things like the WTC falling or the moon landing are too grand or too complicated for small minds (like mine at the time) to fathom what was actually happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding pizzagate, you're being facetious. Harvey Weinstein is a perv and has no connection to Comet Pizza. Also, he hasn't been accused of sexually harassing or assaulting toddlers.

       Please explain to me how jet fuel burning in a building for hours and hours will not cause it to collapse. Don't run off and continue peddling the BS. I am challenging you to challenge yourself and provide me with the details you believe to be proof of the conspiracy so that I might be able to enlighten you.

       Explain WTC Building 7...What conspiracies do you even believe in then? I wasn't attacking you but you came right at me for what I know as the truth and I was being polite...
      </p>
      <p>
       No other building in the history of building fires has ever collapsed. If you were a truther you should already know the facts I believe. The men and women that have shown 9/11 didn't happen like we were told aren't fringe weirdos, looking for attention. They want people to know the truth. You've seen actual experiments, good to know. These structural engineers and scientists have also done models. How about the recent report from University of Alaska Fairbanks saying it was a controlled demolition. So you're saying a reputable university doesn't know shit?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying Weinstein was involved in Comet Ping Pong. Stop thinking that is what PEDOgate is. The world is full of pedophiles in politics, in Hollywood, where ever there is powerful people you'll find pedophiles...Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment of underage girls...

       First off you are exhibiting common truther symptoms. You called my rebuttal an attack but it wasn't. If you are looking for truth, the first rule is that you can't be stubborn. Getting defensive is being stubborn. Present counterpoints, don't "defend yourself" because you're nervous that you might be wrong. Prove why you're
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       To what you said: you are right that this hasn't happened at any other time in history because no one has dumped that much jet fuel in such a condensed area of buildings. Richard Gage is a known liar. He is behind that UAF study. Please show me why his words mean more than 99.99% of other engineers and scientists?
      </p>
      <p>
       Building 7 went down because of debris and jet fuel, and a fire burning for hours and hours and hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't lean on other fringe studies or characters to say that you're right. Show me the specific facts that they've stated in the studies, facts that you agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding "pedogate" i have nothing to say and that's not what I want to debate. We are in agreement that Hollywood has perverts and that pedophiles seek entering that "lifestyle" just as priests do because it's easy prey. We agree on more in that regard than you'd guess but comet pizza is uninvolved and i don't think a discussion or debate about it would benefit either of us.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you want to present science or data to point to any WTC building going down as a result of a demolition, that
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       help, because if you keep an open mind and trust that some people would not risk their reputations by spreading blatant lies, you will learn what really happened

       Oh I'm not nervous that I'm wrong. If Richard Gage is a know liar what would a reputable university let him release the study? It's also not 99.9% of scientists...

       You don't think the images, artwork and bands that play at Comet are a bit off? One band literally was talking on stage about being a pedophile....

       They're weird. I will give them that much. But it's weird that Indian tribes still eat human brains. People do weird shit that we can't understand or relate to.

       Regarding Richard Gage, my understanding is that he's simply using their study to further his agenda about trutherism.

       The downvoters work in teams! It's not natural/organic, when you post something controversial or against the agenda you immediately get 10-20 downvotes simultaneously! Bots? Paid groups? Not sure, but it's their system!

       It is though somewhat understandable that if you express opinions which vary from the norm of a sub then you'll attract downvotes.  I don't discount though the possibility of organised downvoting.

       I agree, but I've tested it many times and it happens in a few split seconds so I just find it hard to believe that so many people read and downvoted my comment in that tiny space of time? I've even been gang stalked, I'm sure it was a bunch of mods, they were losing the argument and so I got a private message warning me to back off! I told them to go suck a D, then I started getting bombarded with the most vile (though extremely lame and childish) private messages, they even said they'd get me banned from the sub which I laughed at, next thing I received a permanent ban! Seriously weird shit

       They also have farms on indians downvoting anything remotely protrump including legit news stories that even suggest a possibility of a pro trump outcome.

       How people aren't seeing through all this is honestly mindboggling.
      </p>
      <p>
       The masses are pathetic at the moment. I got drunk last night at a bar and some dude was being rude as hell for no reason and i left a full beer and yelled at the whole bar about how this guy is a complete asshole. Then my uber driver was a black guy and we got into a convo about how democrats are racist and its all scam.
      </p>
      <p>
       The true racists and intolerant idiots are all on the left and they are infecting society with a cold rudeness.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are so hyped up and immersed in lies that they arent even warm to strangers anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       And its no wonder, when its now a question of whether people should even respect the national anthem.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our society has a rotten core that is being exposed and the masses are doing everything they can to pretend its not.

       Yeah, this past year has been insane for me. Not hating Trump like the rest of my City has lead to so many people whom I considered open and intelligent and friends suddenly became completely deranged and impervious to logic. Most of them have completely shunned me. It’s been so bizarre.

       It just shows how intelligent and tactful the scum behind the scenes are that they've managed to brainwash SO many people without them even realising it, that they actually believe the crap they believe are their own thoughts and opinions!!!

       OP made a long comment with lots of links with claims about Podesta, Russia, etc. Hard to say if he was banned for posting that extremely long and misleading comment with lots of links or if it was because it was actually copy pasta, but I'm betting the latter.

       It happens in all subs. The mods have no control whatsoever over the 9 minute timeout. None, zero, zilch. I see that I've been downvoted to -5 for saying that earlier. An unassailable easily verifiable fact, known to every moderator on all of reddit, and the community downvotes it for some reason. People reading this should keep that in mind while viewing comments on other topics. You can't make this stuff up.

       It's 10 mins actually, but that is some bullcrap. Go to a default sub (news, politics), make one controversial statement that goes against subscriber's beliefs. Get downvoted, get mutliple replies. Guess what? You can't defend yourself. have to wait 10 mins. Wanna reply to them all? The minutes add up to hours. Then I just give up. The thread leaves the front page. Nobody cares about it anymore. Discussion ended.

Pig's supposed to look like that
Barnyard thug
Sleeps on straw and calls it a rug
Yeah that's a rug, OK
He's walking down the street
And nobody's gonna argue with him
He's a half-a-ton of pig meat

Lives a pack of wolves

       It's been said before but personally I think they actually need this sub to corral this kind of anti-establishment sentiment and observations well away from all the cat pic people. Don't go waking up all the sleepy dreamers as they're robbed of their futures eh?

       I put some weight to that line of thought, keep us quarantined away from the masses. I also think they see this subs growth and its like a town forum. It unites many thinkers, people questioning. I try to put myself in their point of view, would it be more effective to just ban hammer this sub and any other place  where conspiracy theorists, free thinkers gather or leave us alone. I come to the conclusion that while there are downsides to banning us and having us spread around other subreddits, a la the fat people hate fiasco. This forum is more dangerous whole and interacting with each other, its a rallying point basically. Ban it and there is not many other places on the net as well organized, moderated. It would have to start from scratch as a sub.

       With the 95%+ negative coverage about Trump, it's nice to see the other side of the argument from time to time.  Sure a lot of it is shitposting MAGAMAGAMAGA. But if I remember correctly Jon Stewart made a handsome career out of calling CNN fake news and bullshit and the Clintons have never been seen as decent human beings by anyone who has actually looked at any of their past and current dealings. God help me, but sometimes T_D really makes some good points from time to time.

       We live in a world where known conspiracies are the current events. We live in a world where our media entities are proven to engage in conspiracy. This very topic is exposing the conspiracy of moderators to censor true information for political reasons. If you have a better conspiracy than the mods banning people to protect these politicians, then you should post a topic about it.

       Tell everyone you know about your experience.  Make them believe you.  You may lose some friends but, the more people understand the massive cover-ups and corruption, the better chance there is that something will be done.

       First time someone told me this it was a old friend from high school on Facebook who posted a Flat Earth meme. We argued for hours and he ended by saying was gonna kick my ass lol I dont buy flat earth but he made good points unrelated to flat earth that lead me to question a lot of stuff.

       Pro tip, when I ellucidated my suspicious feelings to my friends, i didnt come straight at them with the common conspiracy tropes so easily disregarded by the masses nowdays. I tried to explain it in a way of unanswered questions, and they started to see where I was going in my exploration of said unanswered questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was in a similar place to you when the Podesta leaks dropped, so I empathize. I was always one to be able to consider "outlandish" or conspiracy related ideas but when I finally started looking into and actually researching said corruption for myself, it opened up a whole new god damned world.

       It honestly comes down to sources. The most adamant against my thoughts were the ones who took 0 time to look into it for/with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, the unanswered questions route was so good. Simple questions, like the short video of WTC7 falling straight down. And if it WAS controlled demolition, why? And so on. I was extremely timid going about it, like people plan weekend vacations, I would get prepared to bring up a topic to a friend or my gf

       Right, I find asking questions the best tactic too. I often follow it up with "why can't we ask questions?"  And for the right audience, following the money is the most persuasive evidence.

       reddit is the 4th most visited website in the us and makes about $20 million/year. by comparison, facebook is the 3rd most visited website and makes
       <strong>
        $26 billion
       </strong>
       . the reason reddit is still alive (and why they've closed-source their code recently) is because

        <p>
         its a great away for the
         <em>

         </em>
         to control narratives in the internet sphere
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         discussion dynamics are very flexible, giving moderators/dictators/CIA agents/whoever else is sitting on the other side the ability to throttle dissenting views, make them appear to look bad, and censorship. reddit is well known by know for its censorship culture. gimics like the voting system means that unpopular opinions are not seen by large groups of people, shadow banning prevents accounts from posting on certain subs. etc.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       tl;dr reddit is likely a corporate/government honeypot at this point.

       Yup.   People are finally starting to believe the 100% hoax theory too.  Slowly but surely.  People should always look the hardest where the MSM and elites try to censor.  That is the the Las Vegas hoax YouTube videos that google changed their algorithms because people realized immediately that it was all bullshit. So what did they do. They flooded google and YouTube with only mainstream sources to bury the good hoax videos.   Then in the conspiracy community they launched the two shooter theory to distract everyone to go down a false trail.  People recognize this pattern from all the other “shootings”. Then they came out with the usual “he could be isis”.  This time they also came up with “he’s a gun dealer”!  Anything but “it’s all a hoax”

       Everytime I see reasonable comments pointing out something being fishy with an official explanation, someone comes in with the most ton-foil-esque response. It's like clockwork. There's nothing wrong with questioning things, or saying something doesn't make sense to you. It seems that some people think they need to discredit the whole idea of questioning things by trolling and pretending to believe the whole thing was a hoax, no dead bodies, and oh yea, the Earth is flat. You guys are ridiculous.

       The point is when someone comes up with a reasonable argument, especially in this sub, someone else starts tolling and pretending to believe the craziest version of the topic. In this case, it's the "100 percent hoax" nonsense. If someone else questions modern physics, some troll will respond with flat Earth shit. If someone questions whether the government knew about 9/11 and let it happen (or even assisted), someone else will say the government used satellite energy weapons. Pretty much every time this happens.

       Except I’m not a troll and there is a lot of evidence it’s all a hoax. Why would google censor the hoax videos if they were so ridiculous.  Why were the upvote counts 90% positive before they were scrambled?

       To be fair, trolls usually say "the government wiped all of the evidence away." That way, they don't have to prove their claims. I'm sure the government really does erase shit off the internet, but it's not going to be nonexistent hoax videos. It's just a cop out so you don't have to cite anything.

       Whatever man. If you don't provide legit citations, don't expect people to believe you are being serious. There are probably more trolls in this sub than there are real people, so if you want to act exactly like them, don't be surprised by the responses you get.

       That makes perfect sense from an SEO perpective... MSM have staff who's sole job is to get their content highest. While it may not be right, that's no conspiracy.

       You are making it seem like they didn’t openly say they changed their algorithms to fight against the spread of fake news.  This means they are changing the way people can find videos that explain how this is a hoax.  I do not believe they changed it due to “ business decisions” because they were making just as much money on those hoax videos.  I don’t know why you are purposely trying to twist their completely admitted reason for doing this.  I do agree, however, that not using YouTube would be for the best.

       They are not taking down the videos. They are prioritizing content. Like you said, they admitted they are doing it. Just like every other business who is making money off of content. It isn't a conspiracy- it's shitty capitalism at play. Just because they aren't prioritizing what you want to see and are prioritizing what will make them the most money does not make it a conspiracy- it makes it capitalism.

       He's telling the truth; google admitted that they had to change their search algorithm to rid the results of this 'fake news.' just because everything has to be spoon fed to you doesn't mean other people are incapable of research. It takes longer to ask someone for citations than to just look it up yourself, so that tells me all I need to know about you.

       There’s a lot of evidence it’s all a hoax.  Unfortunately google decided those videos and evidence should be suppressed in favor of the mainstream explanation.  Why not leave them up to be ridiculed. It could be because the upvotes on the videos were around 90% because people started to finally open their eyes.

       No one died.  Look into Sandy Hook and the Pulse Nightclub shootings as examples of drills that were portrayed in the media as real shootings when they clearly were drills.  Sandy Hook even has IN THE MEDIA FOOTAGE 26 trees behind the firehouse that they placed out later that week for the victims!!!  How convienent!!  Look up bad crisis actor interviews and you will start to see their poor deception they are attempting.

       Go ahead and tell me why though instead of grandstanding blanket statements.  There are some people that think ANY deviation from the government story makes ANYONE a nut job.  So should we shut down this sub.  Because some people don't like our theories.  Go ahead and try to explain the Christmas tree thing or tell me why you think I'm wrong. Not just attack me.

       Sorry, I really wished I believed it was real.  Every human sense that I have is screaming fake, this is not how humans act.  I don't know you or know anything about your relationship with your friend.  All I know is we are being hit with deception after deception.  Lie after like.  I don't believe your friend died in a shooting in Las Vegas on October 1st.  What I don't know is whether she really died in some other way, or if she was paid to skip town, or if her entire persona was created for this event.  I'm leaning towards option 3 though.

       I created this alt and unsubscribed my main one just because I didn't know how far any of the shills would go. I tried to post quite a bit though. It was so obvious to me on the 2nd that it was fake but I couldn't even talk about it with anyone. I was even questioning my own sanity for a bit. I guess I was more naive than I realized. Ha!

       I know what you mean.  Watching people in interviews where you can instinctively tell that they are lying or acting but you can’t pinpoint what it is.  If you’ve ever seen a real person in pain or sorrow you can use that experience and match it against these “witnesses” and see there is no truth to their stories.  Their bodies physiological reactions along with the way they speak about the events that happened right in front of them give them away.  There’s no red puffy eyes.  No sudden uncontrollable crying, no signs of just being in shock.  All just actors who seem to be describing a scene that they memorized over the last few days. Who could spit out a chunk of their story but fumble over elements that a real witness wouldn’t.  Nothing but crocodile tears and unusually witty stories about the recently deceased.

       Well, and if the 'bodies' vid is supposed to be real, then where are the crying people then, especially since they turn out the lights in the end. If my friend or my SO were dead on the ground you couldn't pull me away or fucking hear from me screaming over their body. Also, if my buddy got shot in the fucking chest, do you really think that I'm going to give 2-3 interviews and then be like 'oh, i just got a text that he came out of surgery and is fine'. I've seen, felt, experienced fear, trauma, loss. Those people have not.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've also got the lack of visible wounds, even on the dude who got shot in the head but survived. It just makes me angry. It was a harsh awakening for me. I thought that the 'system' was flawed, sure, but that our votes mattered and there were a lot of good people. Now? I dunno. Why did they lie? It made me go back and look at other hoaxes that I brushed off as just conspiracy 'nonsense' like Sandy Hook. Doesn't take much looking to see that the acting is just as bad.
      </p>

       Just my take on it and I could just be a big, uncaring asshole like many have said. :P

       No your not a big uncaring asshole.  You are ABSOLUTELY right about the no crying family members in the liveleak video!  I noticed it too.  It was just a bunch of people squatting down around them with no one in shock, crying, or freaking out like normal people would be.  They all just nonchalantly said “oh, he’s got a gunshot in the head” and there were 0 actual human reactions.  They are all paid actors.  I work around people dealing with sudden death or injuries and NO ONE would act the way these people did in interviews. The guy with the “buddy” with three center chest wounds would have a “ buddy” that bled out before he got to the hospital.  Funny enough his “buddy” got discharged from the hospital 3 days later!!  Yeah fucking right.  Pulse shooting looking at the last names of lube, and colon and you can tell that they are laughing at us for believing this shit.  They love it.   American Horror Story has a shooting in front of a stage the SAME week as the shooting.  What a fucking coincidence.

       Is why now I'm still unsure of the 'why'. As seen by the Weinstein distraction, they have real paid actors who can at least half-assed act. Why use shitty effects / fake blood when they could've done a really good job? Like, is it an intentional hoax to make people start to 'wake up'? I keep waiting on an announcement or something where they bring out the candid camera guys.

       I don’t know.  I think the illuminati believe in having the truth in plain sight.  It’s part of their belief system.  Order through chaos and they want the truth in plain sight.  I want to say they are getting sloppier but I don’t think they are.  I think they always have the same amount of sloppiness but if people only watch MSM news they won’t ever figure it out.

       Maybe.. I mean, in looking at past pics of the Boston bombing thing and the Sandy Hook interviews, I'm pissed at myself for not paying more attention back then. Maybe, to people who went through this back then, this IS just as obvious and nothing new.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still chewing on this part a bit. I've even thought that maybe some non-actors made it in. Like, would they buy out the whole concert since it was slow night / last day of festival or would they use part actors to get non-actors to run off first.. Part of me thinks that if they were going to do this, they wouldn't have risked anything and all would've been meant to be actors. From the pics, I don't think it was 22000 people either when you compare to other pics online of crowd sizes...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, was the hoax even intentionally sabotaged a bit, especially by the 'Are you good, my brother?' guy who didn't stick around after the guy asked him who he was.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like something's coming soon and will explain it, but, again, could just be naive and hoping that the world should make sense.

       I think it could be either/or when it comes to it all 20,000 people were actors. I didn’t ever really think about the crowd size being lied about but now that you said it I see what your saying.  It makes my mind go to their biggest false flag to be honest 9/11.  I know the whole thing was a false flag but what if they did the same tricks there.   I don’t necessarily think something big is coming because I felt like everyone would figure it out the last few shootings and no one did.  This ones already being forgotten.  You could be right though that they are making more and more “mistakes” like they want people to figure it out.  It scares me what would happen if everyone did find out.  I think people are so complacent and comfortable that they wouldn’t want to do anything crazy and I don’t blame them.  I don’t want our country to collapse in on its self.

       Seems like 22,000 was size of hockey arena, one crowd thing said, and I've looked at several pics. Just guessing, and would really welcome someone more expert, but the panning shots, I'm thinking 5k and max maybe 10k, but thats just me going off of internet data and not very scientifically.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, you CANT just tell the whole US and world that "Haha, guys. We've TOTALLY been lying to you for awhile on all these things." I mean, I've dabbled and been light conspiracy over years, as in I would entertain the thought but not research and would still just go with the MSM. 9/11, I watched the news in horror that morning and was shocked with the rest of the world. Over the years, it was like 'Man. These people are jerks.' and then eventually, I watched a bit more, looked a bit more and watched that study on building 7 and was like.. wow. I just freaking realized that the whole damned thing is most likely false flag and is part of the reason the Vegas hoax / awakening affected me so bad. I BELIEVED what I was told. I bought into it and was deceived by my govt for years. I thought it was corrupt, but that we had a chance to change and that maybe one day, people could unite and make shit better. Just, I'm more self-aware than most IRL people that I know, and realizing that the system is a lie and a farce really fucked with me. When the reality that you've bought into and put passion/emotions into for years get squished, it hurts a bit. I did not have an anchor and it was scary. Now, it seems dumb that I was so affected, but I've read that is not uncommon for such a big disillusionment. So, yeah, if you have others that feel so strongly but in masses, I think that it would be a bit chaotic.

       It's not dumb,  it's the feeling that your whole reality, all your past empathy for these "shooting victims" was all for a farce.  Once you break through and the shock goes away you are left with a feeling of "okay, what now..."  I'm still stuck in the part.

       What do you mean by hoax tho? Like did people die? Hoax to me is completely fake ...so no-one died then?? 
That's all I really care about is the families and victims.. fuck that shooter guy and fuck the government but it's sad when people die.....espically in cold blood.

       Well, its just MY take on it and I could be wrong, but yeah, hoax. No one died. I believe that its possible that the police even thought it was an active shooter drill like they did in August 2016. (Look at the victims in it. Looks like the 'blood' in that random liveleak one which was very fake.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe, I'd just rather believe that they were misled, and didn't mean to be part of the hoax that the FBI, etc pushed them into.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vids that were out the day after, well none showed anyone get trampled or shot. You had the vid where the cowboy was like its not real and then they panned out over the crowd which was just walking away and no one on the ground at that point. The pics of the dead guy were one of my first clues since I was geared up and afraid to look, expecting a death scene and it was just horribly fake with a bunch of shit wrong with it. Again, thats also one of the reasons why I keep thinking that the LVMPD was expecting a drill/training, since it was obviously 'staged'. In those, they don't care to be super realistic and TRICK the public, they just have to be somewhat realistic so that their officers are training.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot more too, but I gave up on posting. I kept track for awhile of all of the videos/photos that were showing up everywhere, and even followed up on one of the obits where google map got screwy in their hometown. Their local message boards were empty of anything of them on that day, etc. There was like 1 post of so and so died! and a 'I heard about that'. I'm sure there are more now, but the forum was all active on other local events and if they were the hero of their small town, there would be a lot more concern. Whatever, though. I've went through my stages of realization and it was a hard thing to come to grips with that the public was intentionally deceived and that the system is a sham.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: I truly believe that no one died.

You seem to have done a lot more research than me.

       I saw the photos of the bodies laying on the floor and thought something doesn't seem right and the videos had me thinking it was 2 shooters. My gf sais it's a hoax..and to be honest the more things they tell us the more confused I get and I'm starting to believe her and like minded people like yourself.

       No problem. I did more research because I was distraught and confused. Maybe I'll try to find the vids that I downloaded before they were removed. Someone might've reuploaded by now, but I gave up on a lot of it since no one was listening. Just I know that many were removed from youtube pretty quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also thought there were 2 shooters at first, but when the cabbie moved her camera at 'just' the time the bullets paused and then there were a couple other vids proving it was a strobe during the shooting, I was really confused.

       Not sure if that staged pic was Paddock, but that pic was fake, whoever it was. I've already torn it apart as have others. Specifically, though, blood color/consistency is wrong, spatter is wrong, gun wrong spot, casings are wrong in number and location. If he shot himself in head there is no brain matter in the pic to prove it. You can find links of real gunshot wounds and those make you feel sick (or did me). Did he supposedly shoot himself in mouth (or just bleed out his mouth for some reason?) If so, there should be distortion or whatever around the mouth, tears and such.

       They keep changing the narrative because they want you distracted and to keep chasing that 'OMG, PEOPLE DIED'. Maybe it is just a gun control thing. I'm not really sure why the insistence that deaths occurred. I try to be open that people died, but I just can't buy it. If anyone died, I don't think that they are anyone in the official list.

       So, this video is completely staged then? Also, the body at 0:15 is identified as Christopher Roybal, and at 0:34 is identified as Keri Lynn Galvan.

       Yeah, it is definitely staged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where are their entry / exit wounds? Those people aren't medics. If it was as the reporters say and ambulances were to and fro, there would be true medical there. If you match up time stamps to when police came then and said 'We have blabla in medical tent' which is near the beginning, again, you'd have real medical on scene. That vid is very unconvincing. Watch active shooter drills on youtube. Fake blood with just little staging and people not really trying to act. It's not real. Did any news or police even ever vouch that this vid was taken at the concert? Perhaps, its fake news intended to make it look like a hoax... Then again, the other vids and interviews still go along with that as well.

       Perhaps, you aren't trying enough. If someone has been removed from your life, then I am sorry for your loss.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the Vegas stuff so far out there is all fake. If your friend or acquaintance really died, then you should want to expose the fake bits since that would be a slap in the face and coverup to any actual deaths.

       I guess I just figured everyone else was lying in the past, when I’ve seen similar things come up. The user must of been banned for something else they’re not explaining..... I was wrong, I did nothing wrong but post a story and almost instantly banned

       r/news - Posted Sessions full answer during his hearing three times and was banned without prior warning

      <p>
       r/politics - calling someone a shill

      <p>
       r/NFL - Asked three times why and no answer was given

       r/sports - Was told I said something anti-liberal. Muted and the mod refused to tell me what post it was
      </p>
      <p>
       r/Pittsburgh - Posted my theory that blacks struggle due to having kids they can't afford at early ages. Was told that implies blacks are inferior and banned.

       I've never been banned from a subreddit, but has anyone posted something that prompted reddit to ask for an email verification to continue using the username/account?  I answered someone's question concerning holocaust denial in what I thought was a brief neutral summary of what I'd seen of that argument and soon after: account disabled.

       That's why I asked.  Figured I can't be the only instance and it has been bugging me.  I went back just now to get a screenshot, but I must've waited too long to link it to an email because now it's just permanently suspended.

       Stay vocal about it is all I can suggest. Hopefully other chime in with similar experiences and it can be exposed for what it is, like all of the other sketchy tactics reddit has employed.

       I was hesitant to call attention to it given the nature of the subject, but my curiosity won out eventually.  Now that it has, this likely won't be the last I post about it.  Though since I've decided to do so, I wish I had a screenshot of the site asking for an email to continue using it.

       Some odd shit goes on around here. The other day I saw a reply in a comment chain that had been masked with a link saying something about "this comment has been marked as sensitive, click to show". Like what the fuck is that? I didn't have the presence of mind to screenshot it before I clicked, and it was soon lost (it was a busy thread, I think in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/worldnews">
        /r/worldnews
       </a>
       ). I haven't seen another yet, but I'm watching for it.

       Awhile back reddit started opting people back in to the outbound link tracking. I was vocal about that for awhile. It's in your preferences, and check under the "personalization preferences" for more stuff to opt out of. Just don't trust that it will stay that way permanently. About all we can do is make more people aware of this stuff, so you're doing the right thing.

       But that's what makes posting on Reddit fun. Say something even remotely right leaning and watch everyone scream at you. Lol. Honestly, how boring would Reddit be if it was an echo chamber.

       Which leads me to my point.  Why the hell do leftists / liberals even bother posting on Reddit? Everyone's gonna just circle jerk around you.

       It is healthy to question the official narrative. It is also healthy not to believe conspiracies without weighing up all the evidence, or experiencing things for yourself, though even then, its best to err on the side of skepticsm. Though it can be said the conspiracy

isn't really a conspiracy, but a natural progression of a information filtration system manipulated to particular agendas. I guess the conspiracy lies in the purpose, extent and manufacturing of the deception, which is very much entrenched institutionially.

       Belief is the death of intelligence. I think you are misunderstanding that the whole point of being a skeptic is that you don't believe in anything, infact, you naturally assume a position of doubting everything. At least whilst as a Skeptic.

       Skepticism, since you don't seem to know what that is, is a refusal to believe either a stated case or any specific one that contradicts it, either, due to a lack of enough supporting evidence to convince you either way due to a false assumption that there are only two possibilities which are being presented and pressing their case on that simplistic basis and insisting that one of them must be right if the other can simply be proved to be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be a skeptic is to withhold judgement and know that it's better to live with the uncertainty than accept either on that kind of a basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are always more potential possibilities, one of which is that both are completely wrong and that the real answer is to be found elsewhere and if the issue is important enough to further investigate those possibilities in addition to what's been postulated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything you can't prove by your own most direct experience doesn't demand that you should or somehow need "to believe it".
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact "belief" is contrary to the very nature of any true scientific and intellectual investigation or understanding. A true skeptic recognises that a certain perspective can be useful in some cases but not others. It doesn't require  any "faith" or undying beliefs to pragmatically use that perspective or any of the information derived from it strictly for practical purposes or infer any additional meaning to simply because it's workable or good enough for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have perhaps heard of the "unified field theory" that has yet to be discovered. The Holy Grail of science.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is because what is known and accepted as being correct in the individual fields of physics, chemistry, and mathematics nevertheless have unresolved discrepancies and conflicts that exist between them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something of major significance that goes to the fundamental understanding of each of them that wouldn't exist if any of them was completely correct in every way. While individually they appear to be in their own domains and pure applications certain chemical reactions cannot be explained from a purely physics point of view because they conflict with it says they should be but aren't and certain phenomena in physics can't be explained in purely mathematical terms because they conflict with what a proper mathematical description describes what they should be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I really need to believe that the Earth is round or flat if I can't get far enough away from it to verify which it is and quite frankly their are discrepancies in both points of view that quite simply shouldn't be there that necessitate all kinds of other assumptions that can't actually be proven, either?
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything all my everyday experience of it is actually that it's a flat stationary plane. The Sun is still said by one and all "to rise" and "set", while it is assumed that it's the Earth rolling and rising and not the other way around. You'd think someone would have gotten around to correcting that by now, wouldn't you? Or maybe it's just not all that important.

       Skepticism itself is just another ideology; a conscious belief that there is a lack of evidence to convince you of any belief. People are multi-faceted and to think that anyone actually takes on the persona of a skeptic full-time is ridiculous.

       I'm not disregarding science, where are you getting that from? I'm criticizing the lack of real scientific methods used to come to real conclusions in the science community today. This is seen most prevalent in the medical science community where big pharma is the final word.
      </p>
      <p>
       Questioning the most commonly held beliefs in science today are met with ridicule. An individual in the science community that comes to conclusions through research that are not in line with the narrative of big pharma are ostracized from the community. That's a far cry from the way science is supposed to be approached.

       <em>
        know
       </em>
       , and they will defend what is
       <em>
        known
       </em>
       as if their life depends on it.

       being skeptical about something is requiring evidence and facts to prove it to yourself. They are not opposites of each other. Erring on the side of evidence and facts, means you are skeptical of the opinions and narratives that are directed at you which is generally what we get from the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think that OP is trying to say that you should not believe statistical facts and evidence, unless the source of those facts itself provides reason to be skeptical of.

       An assertion that an allegation is not true. To be skeptical is different, in that you are doubting as to the truth of something, rather than being conclusive and having certain knowledge i.e. saying with certainty that something is true or false

       By very definition, skepticism is to doubt some form of knowledge or belief. That doesn't mean you can't have beliefs, though if you are skeptical about literally everything then it stands that you are also skeptical about those beliefs. However there isn't some law that says all skeptics must have no beliefs. See it as something you can dip in and out of. Nihilism on the other hand is a belief that there is no such thing as objective (transcendent) meaning to life. That is to say all meaning is arbitrary. A skeptic might or might not become a nihilist depending on what data they are exposed to but skepticism and nihilism have very little to do with each other.

       You're talking in circles. You priority to treat "skeptic" as noun instead of just an adjective is troublesome. You make it into a title instead of way of being.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be skeptical of a subject is healthy, but to be skeptical of everything is counter-productive and unrealistic. No human truly thinks like that. Skepticism itself is just another ideology; a conscious belief that there is a lack of evidence to convince you of a specific belief. You cannot escape the human need for a belief system.

       and supposed anti-semite posterchild Richard Spencer who was very close with Trump's foreign policy advisor, Stephen Miller, at Duke- when Miller (a jewish neocon) was bringing David Horowitz on campus.

       <p>
        The two worked on an immigration policy debate at Duke. But, Spencer wrote, “After we left Duke, we drifted apart. The last time we spoke was, I think, around 2009. We were friends, but we haven’t been in communication for some time.”

        The mentor story has become a meme that has gotten out of hand, Spencer wrote. “There’s no man behind the curtain.”

        Late in his time at Duke, Miller founded the Terrorism Awareness Project, which aimed to educate students about Islamic terror threats. The group tried to buy college newspaper ads headlined “What Americans Need to Know About Jihad.

       None of those articles claim that Hillary or Obama was bribed.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do all have dishonest article titles when we have been told that the FBI didn't inform the people who reviewed and approved the sale, the articles are written to direct you to think so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: NYPost title says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Obama administration knew about Russian bribery plot before uranium deal.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Then their article says this:
      </p>
      <p>
       *_ _ _but multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever told other committee members about the crimes they had uncovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       Newsweek title:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        FBI Kept Russian Bribery Plot Under Wraps Before Obama Administration Approved Nuclear Deal With Moscow
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Independent title:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Obama administration approved nuclear deal with Kremlin after FBI uncovered Russian bribery plot
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Undermined by their first sentence:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Obama administration
        <strong>
         potentially
        </strong>
        knew of corruption at a Russian nuclear supplier years before it agreed to sign over 20 per cent of US's uranium supply to the company, a new report has claimed.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They do that kind of thing all through their article. They do not make any claim that Clinton was bribed.

       In this thread: people who downvote because they vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you voted in the last election, you were played as a chump. Fuck Trump, fuck Hillary, fuck all of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system attracts sociopaths. It needs to be dismantled, and rebuilt. By voting, you're singing a contract that says, "Yes, I approve of the current system."
      </p>
      <p>
       Divorce yourself from "sides" and "ideologies". Left and right, red and blue, are divide and rule. If one side was the correct one, then it would have already solved our problems by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next stage of human evolution is unification. Not under a president, or politician, or dictator. A voluntary unification. If we begin to grow towards that, humans will conquer death, disease, and travel the stars.

       Never banned from those subs, but I do not post or comment either. Their biases are really easy to notice, the shilling, vote manipulation, banning...I do not care to participate. If I cared I would use subversion, as many dissidents have done for many years, it is not that hard as those "sheep" are not very smart nor informed. Their handlers...that is something else...you have to be more devious.

       There's ALWAYS a technicality. Every institution implements a sufficient number of rules until you're always breaking one. Then they leave you alone unless they want to get rid of you, then they can pick which rules to use as an excuse.

       well, depends how you look at it, churchiill won for himself, but britain as a country lost. the zionists won, but the jews lost. and the russians, well, they lost cos the americans took the nazis back to usa with them, and america lost, because the japanese hit them where it hurt, pearl harbour. the winners were the zioists who invested against their own people. so it was a complete joke tbh

       them banning you doesn't mean they're part of the conspiracy is all I'm saying. I just think it's sort of silly that, with all the shit going on around you, getting banned from some subreddit was your big eye opener.

       The conspiracy to me is that a few dozen people are banned from posting about a major news story... news is being filtered. I’ve always thought that Reddit was a good place to “get news first” but after this I’m on the other side of the stick per say.

       I originally found here after Vegas, when someone posted the shooter dead on the floor, then I started reading into somethings and realized that it actually seemed to be a “balanced” community. Anyways

       I'm pretty new to reddit but from what I understand, subreddits are independently maintained and mods can ban you for literally no reason, just because they don't like you. be likable and you probably won't get banned.

       Keep in mind that you got banned from r/News for breaking the subreddit rules and that the mods here are on semi-permanent holiday. As long as you unquestionably subscribe to anything that goes against the official story and never question baseless conspiracy theories, you'll fit right in!

       it's hard to get more direct evidence than that really. it's not just about left or right politics being swayed, if the american military is involved in covering up and controlling the narratives on an entire site as big as reddit, there is much more going on here

       You sure you weren't banned for the really long post you made with total 100% confirmed claims such as:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There is proof from multiple sources that confirm 100% that Russia is helping fund the DNC to stay in power... both the Russians and the DNC. The implication is that the news works for the Deep State and the DNC and most of the RNC is propped up by the Deep State. If this was not true, then the control over the mass media would not be as strong. The intelligence community controls both political parties and the news.

        The Pentagon is on a spending spree as it scrabbles to amass vast quantities of Soviet-style weapons and ammunition. But it’s running into problems sourcing them, and is using misleading legal documents to disguise their final destination: Syria.

       I'm gonna ask the question, what would be the reasoning behind an autoban for someone posting from a source that isn't explicitly stated in the rules, and also can simply be deleted. Is this the standard operating procedure? If so, why don't we see more people upset as I am sure it has happened before, and is a pretty damn extreme measure.

       I'm sure you can understand how your statement was misconstrued. You insinuated that TheHill is mentioned in the rules, but its not; meanwhile Rule 3 actually states posts will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Editing your OP might help separate fact from speculation.

       No, you want to pretend it's politics because you are a partisan hack bindly defending a sub that has already shown this behavior previously. I'm not arguing whether the hill is banned or not, I'm arguing that the story isn't politics, and that the rules are applied in a biased manner. It's you who can't admit there is a problem and that you are wrong.

       so you are saying the political news site doesnt give political news? perfect sense.

"The Hill is a top US political website, read by the White House and more lawmakers than any other site -- vital for policy, politics and election campaigns."

       Yes, I do. I'm specifically calling out the user, and the news sub for choosing what counts as politics in a bias way. That should be obvious. They (being user, and sub) have a no politics rule, yet 2 of the top 5 posts are about Trump, while the thread op claims to have been banned for posting news about the previous admin, with links to the Clintons on shady deals done with Russia.

       As you dive deeper down the rabbit hole, don't get too angry or depressed. Even with all this bad shit going on, we still got it really good. Make sure you are reasonably prepared for any worst case scenarios and beyond that there's not much we can do. Except vote and spread the word.

       I don't understand how everyone is acting like this is some kind of revelation. Comey literally handed out immunity to Hillary Clinton's aids, who were caught red handed destroying evidence during the investigation. Insuring that not only will he not pursue justice, no one could ever pursue justice in the future. No one said shit about it.

       I got banned from the atheist sub for not believing in religion? Yes, you read that correctly. I have screenshots of the entire thread. Unknown truths can get you reported and/or banned. It's only free speech until someone gets offended. Reddit CEO, Tim Huffman, admitted changing pro Trump posts/treads. Critical free thinkers are silenced. We have the potential to upset the established order.

       allowed on the front page or even by msm I still don’t think the majority of Americans would believe or care about much of it....let’s just say there was irrefutable proof of Russian collusion by HRC, her supporters would explain it away and still say “Trumps worse”...same with the other side....the rabbit hole is so deep and the deception so vast that to get that many people deprogrammed is practically impossible by design

       It's happened to me too. The big social networking sites are all taking part in this. That's how it seems to me at least. I don't want to turn this into a Democrat vs Republican thing but they sure as fuck all censor anyone going against Hillary or Obama. Hopefully employees within their companies will start leaking.

        There is proof from multiple sources that confirm 100% that Russia is helping fund the DNC to stay in power... both the Russians and the DNC. The implication is that the news works for the Deep State and the DNC and most of the RNC is propped up by the Deep State. If this was not true, then the control over the mass media would not be as strong. The intelligence community controls both political parties and the news.
The common thread is that the news does two things... pushes for creeping authoritarianism and never reveals what the intelligence community is up to.

        Chaika is exposed in this documentary that is banned in Russia. Yuri Chaika was in put in power by Medvedev, but he indicates to an intelligence analyst that Sergei Ivanov is calling the shots.
        <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/54/5410884_re-insight-russia-head-of-major-criminal-group-arrested.html">

        </a>
        Chaika said he has already been under a lot of heat because of the Politkovskaya arrests. He said that he would rather not tell me about the "Chechen mastermind" they arrested. I asked if this was because he was not really a mastermind and Chaika said that "many things needed to be tied up as we head into this election and the end of Putin's reign." [I know this is strange, but he kept saying things like, "Ivanov needs to have control over the situation he's about to enter into.... Ivanov is known for his distance from such situations, so they need to be wrapped up."]
What is crazy, is that even organized crime won't go near energy assets, which is a playground that Podesta, Hillary and the DNC have no problem playing in. That is a really interesting point... that they scare the Russian mob. Either way, these people at the top of Russian politics are very often cooperating with our own intelligence assets. Here is a list:
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OVvquE_0SIXo1NLgJmFr7gjUbDFNjUG2YzdHZxPFyzU/edit?usp=sharing">

        During the course of the Uranium One scandal, Gazprom was also acquiring extraction rights and expanding with more locations and resources.
        <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/55/5500400_re-t-weekly-next-week-.html">
         https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/55/5500400_re-t-weekly-next-week-.html
        </a>
        the company builds pipelines around the world and Gazprom wanted the the company, so the owner of the company ended up with his shoulders broken and stuffed into a pipeline. Then they turned on the nat gas and he suffocated while his limbs flew off in the 50 mph nat gas flow.....
The Russians seem pretty great at compartmentalizing, but all these paths seem to course through Dmitry Medvedev.
I am confident that a decent group of investigators can tie all this up, now that the Chaika scandal has been exposed. It is just a matter of tracing the web.
Meanwhile, the news in the US doesn't actually educate people on how Russian corruption works because that would elucidate ties to our own government.

       You seem to be confusing news, with speculation and gossip. So I'm not surprised that your post was removed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, can't this whole theory be blown out of the water with a few simple facts? Those being, Obama is not the president, Hillary isn't either, and the Democrats lost the last election. So they've done and awful job of holding onto power. Let me guess though, that's all part of the misinformation campaign, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also also, of course you aren't going to be told what the intelligence community is up to, they'd be pretty fucking awful at their jobs if you did wouldn't they?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd be more concerned about the actual provable things your government is up to rather than their side tail chasing speculation.

       Okay, sure.  Assuming we get some new, different, more concrete facts, of course it can be blown out of the water, and anyone with those facts should present them, rather than allude to their existence.

       Whats all part of the misinformation?  What did you think you proved by stating the result?   However, the positive press coverage and media manipulation that occured in clintons favor could absolutely be argued as part of the misinformation, but luckily that didn't work.

       With regards to your comment about my suggesting that misinformation be a necessity. That isn't what I said at all. I was simply alluding to the fact that the intelligence community is secretive by design. And anyone who expects to be told actual facts about the goings on within said community is being very naive. I don't like it, but it's the way it is.

       Just ask why this article, from this topic from 2015, regarding collusion with russia, didn't come into our public view until 2017.
       <br/>
       If this mentioned trump, he literally would have been impeached.
       <br/>
       I get that you don't understand american laws and how we feel about cheaters and patriotism in general, but we love our country and don't like people using it for their own personal gain.  Clinton seems to have done just that, with more concrete information than what has been suggested against trump in the past year.

       Feel free to take it as crazy if you want, but at the very least you should try and think from the perspective of an american, as thats the group of people being effected here.

      <p>
       He has put his own children into office.

      <p>
       He has dodged the draft yet called war veterans cowards for getting caught.

      <p>
       He has shown a habit of walking in to other peoples teenage daughters while they were naked.

Oh yeah, it happened soon after i made fun of a certain group of douchebag's dear leader and I'm not talking about North Koreans here.

       Besides the conspiracy and the mods, there are a ton of idiots on reddit and they downvote anything unpopular or contrary to their arguments, even if deep down they know they're wrong, they can downvote you from anonymity so it's cool.

       This sub didn't use to give that much importance to left or right...
       <br/>
       And the way the_donald redditors like conspiracy only for the fact that the left denies most of what it spurs, I guess it's ok? As long as you are getting informed about how the world works, I guess it's ok to hate your fellow humans for different opinions?

       You can post any current news you like at r/freeworldnews. It's small but growing. We've never banned anyone yet. Raw video, controversial news, news from anywhere in the world, opinion pieces, even stuff you write yourself. Spicy comments. It's all welcome. And yes, I was banned from there as well, for being critical of Islam.

       It bugs me that the sub called 'news' is just propaganda. At least at 'the donald'  you know what you are getting. Any new reddit user will likely subscribe to 'news' thinking it is something it's not.

       Are this story and the mysterious code Assange put on Twitter a couple days ago related? Do we know what that code is/was yet? I know it’s a code to a torrent but is it the “dead mans switch” code or what?

       The mods look at your other-sub posts and ban based on their individual preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no law. It's a bunch of child-like SJWs (probably living off disability check for mental illness given their frequency and time on reddit, along with their emotive stances).

       If they see you with a T_D, and personally dont like it, they ban you.

       I have 'askmen', and after talking to some cunt who hates men, I get banned for what I can only assume is affiliation - because the argument are philosophically sound (it's completely my own, it's learned from philosophical authorities - like she assumes her 'CRIS' professor was).

       The conspiracy to me is that a few dozen people are banned from posting about a major news story... news is being filtered. I’ve always thought that Reddit was a good place to “get news first” but after this I’m on the other side of the stick per say.

       I originally found here after Vegas, when someone posted the shooter dead on the floor, then I started reading into somethings and realized that it actually seemed to be a “balanced” community. Anyways

       Maybe.. I mean, in looking at past pics of the Boston bombing thing and the Sandy Hook interviews, I'm pissed at myself for not paying more attention back then. Maybe, to people who went through this back then, this IS just as obvious and nothing new.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still chewing on this part a bit. I've even thought that maybe some non-actors made it in. Like, would they buy out the whole concert since it was slow night / last day of festival or would they use part actors to get non-actors to run off first.. Part of me thinks that if they were going to do this, they wouldn't have risked anything and all would've been meant to be actors. From the pics, I don't think it was 22000 people either when you compare to other pics online of crowd sizes...
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, was the hoax even intentionally sabotaged a bit, especially by the 'Are you good, my brother?' guy who didn't stick around after the guy asked him who he was.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like something's coming soon and will explain it, but, again, could just be naive and hoping that the world should make sense.
