        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Campos disappeared before the interviews in order to play innocent as long as possible. I mean, it&#39;s the perfect play - agree to do national interviews basically removes any suspicion that he was involved. But then when the time came, he ran. No way he was actually going to answer questions about all this. He risks being exposed.</p>

<p>Campos is an illegal immigrant, which is why Mandalay doesn&#39;t want him in the spotlight, either.</p>

<p>Paddock was selling guns, probably as part of an FBI sting to catch bad guys (i.e. Fast &amp; Furious). This his nonexistent history. And come on - he knew the FBI well. They probably talked with him often when they were hunting his dad in the 70s.</p>

<p>If not to sell those guns and ammo, why would he bring a thousand pounds of it up all those flights just to use a few of them to shoot into the crowd? And that&#39;s why he had all those cameras set up - he was going to film the transaction to use later as evidence against Campos.</p>

<p>Campos was the shooter. Paddock was selling guns to him. Campos killed Paddock, then shot into the crowd. Shot himself in the leg (how convenient) when cops got close to avoid being suspected of being the shooter.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the shooting had stopped by the time the cops got to the floor. Because Campos had shot himself by that point.</p>

<p>That last paragraph is the key.</p>

<p>Finally, just look at his face. Expressionless in every photo, even when receiving an award. Dude is nervous and freaky as hell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are the first person I have heard say Cartel.
That was my thought from the beginning.  The sale was to a Cartel.  Jesus was in on it.  The shot the concert for a getaway with Jesus sealing the door and shooting Paddock then himself.
If they went down the steps and Jesus sealed the stairway door behind them, who would know?  Down to flights, catch an elevator with half the long guns in large cases and no one thinks a thing in the panic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only &quot;logic&quot; I see is that it was his revenge against someone trying to set up the Cartel/Him. The idea being that the FBI would never admit to attempting another Fast and Furious. This is their punishment for attempting such a thing, again. He gets away with the crime but more importantly the Cartel sends a message to the Feds that if they continue to play games like this then there will be consequences. So the Feds come up with a hero story for Campos and sell it to the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Been saying this since day 1. Two pistol shots ended the shooting. I wonder how Paddock managed to shoot himself twice. Also the shooter that &quot;targeted the fuel tanks&quot; would have done their research unless they didn&#39;t give a fuck who or what they were shooting. I don&#39;t think Paddock (or any shooter for that matter) would target the tanks, without actually looking up if it would work(0% chance of working). This, to me, indicates that the person who shot the tank was doing so randomly to try and cause the most damage. I think this was Campos. I do think Campos is probably FBI/CIA though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If we want to go down the potential Campos was the shooter hole, I would be more focused on Campos being affiliated with Antifa than the cartels. Big money goes into Antifa from Soros and Co. </p>

<p>I feel like pinning it on Campos would be a very difficult task given the fact that Paddock had rifles everywhere and had bombs in his vehicle. There would be a lot of holes to cover up(not that there aren’t already).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is literally zero precedent for attempting to attribute an attack of this nature to Antifa. The cartel &quot;theory&quot; is already shaky at best, but trying to shift blame to Antifa is just ridiculous.

    <div class="md"><p>It makes more sense if it is domestic, that it was done by a domestic terror group who already has established they intend to riot, fight and kill Trump supporters until he is out of office. There is no suggestion anywhere that the Cartel could or should be involved. I’m just saying if you want to look at a possibly conspiracy on Jesus then at least have it be plausible. Antifa isn’t a stretch when for one, he’s Hispanic, for two, there are rumors going around he’s illegal and has someone else’s SSN, and finally Antifa would and does have motive, whereas Cartels have no reason.  </p>

I think there&#39;s something weird about the guy and him being involved in the terrorism personally is a likely possibility in my opinion. The explanation that he was buying guns fits well, and if this Jesus fellow was the one who killed Paddock, then it makes sense that perhaps Paddock shot at Jesus too, and that was how he became injured. If he shot himself, the wound&#39;s location and angle could be proof that he shot himself. </p>

<p>Why bring thousands of pounds of ammo all the way up to the 32nd floor just for a gun deal?!??!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Campos is an illegal immigrant, which is why Mandalay doesn&#39;t want him in the spotlight, either.</p>

<p>Yeah, cover up the deadliest shooting in history because the guy is an illegal, and the LVPD, FBI and Homeland Security all want to hide that fact as well?! Because they give a fuck about some hotels hiring practices.</p>

<p>Because?</p>

<p>Paddock was selling guns to him.</p>

<p>He was selling guns? How could Campos afford those guns?</p>
