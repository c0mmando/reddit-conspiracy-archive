    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;d feel way better about this distraction if people were actually going to prison for these crimes. It&#39;s good in one way that it&#39;s being exposed, but if no one names names then nothing changes at all and the predators will just laugh and carry on doing it, and the victims will know that even when it came out in the media, even when it was all anyone talked about for weeks, still NOTHING was done. It&#39;s just sick.</p>

<p>Am watching &#39;An OPen Secret&#39; again, which is about pedophilia in the industry, names several hollywood pedophiles including Bryan Singer. It&#39;s out there, but even now no one in the mainstream is demanding justice for these kids, and they know it&#39;s still happening and that there are children, right this minute, being abused, sold, passed around like prostitutes and they say nothing and do nothing!</p>

<p>The fact that no one else is being named is very suspicious and does make it seem like a distraction. People are so frightened, it&#39;s sad. Same with Las Vegas, all these witnesses who are too frightened to come forward and just say what they saw and provide their video of multiple shooters. What kind of country are we living in?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lawyer here - what you&#39;ve said is not exactly accurate. </p>

<p>Statute of limitations means it can no longer be prosecuted. It doesn&#39;t mean it cannot be discussed. </p>

<p>Truth is an absolute defense to defamation/slander. </p>

<p>Now more than ever, multiple corroborating victims would make it extremely difficult to attempt to institute a defamation suit. </p>

<p>But what if the truth is only based on the allegation itself with no real evidence to prove it? </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s also important to note that defamation suits could be drawn out by the higher ups who have the money to pour into the cases, and bleed the victims dry </p>

<p>That&#39;s a good point, and why I think multiple people coming forward would be beneficial. </p>

<p>As to your second point, I 100% agree. On an individual level, these are usually in the favor of the more powerful person with more resources. </p>

<p>But right now is a rare opportunity to take advantage of a public that is not only outraged and paying attention, but that also has been fed an incredible amount of moralizing from the corporate and Hollywood class.</p>

<p>The public loves watching hypocrites get their comeuppance. I think now is a unique opportunity that I hope people seize. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>thanks .... but it saddens me to think it&#39;s not OBVIOUS to the masses!</p>

<p>The Truth has a characteristic which clearly defines it; </p>

<p>e.g. The Truth <em>is true</em>, it <em>cannot</em> change.</p>

<p>ergo sum: &quot;allegations&quot; <em>cannot be</em> &quot;True&quot; as they <em>can change</em></p>

<p>it may seem I&#39;m splitting hairs BUT No, words are powerful and have clear meanings when used correctly and there is NO way an &#39;allegation&#39; can be &quot;the Truth&quot; ... <em>that&#39;s why</em> it&#39;s an &quot;allegation&quot; and not &#39;true&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been more than enough cases of people coming out against prominent individuals years later and not having to deal with some legal BS. Bill Clinton and Bill Cosby come to mind right away.</p>

<p>Why say anything at all if you are not going to back it up. I might as well Tweet something next saying some mysterious Hollywood producer raped me 15 years ago. I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t believe a lot of these people but I&#39;m stuck with two major thoughts.</p>

<p>1) Why the vague announcements?</p>

<p>2) Why in the hell didn&#39;t you say something earlier.</p>

<p>And on the #2 there. I don&#39;t accept the old &quot;well it would have affected my career bit&quot;. Still not cool. As someone who has been sexually assaulted I reported that shit straight away because I knew if it was happening to me it was happening to someone else so I needed to help stop the predator. I&#39;d go as far to say that some of them, victims themselves, have only made the problem worse and have blood on their hands because they cared more about walking down a red carpet than protecting their own dignity and that of others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because women who speak up obviously NEVER any experience any backlash or cruelty or ‘punishment’.  In a different world, sure it would be excellent if women felt safe letting authorities know when things like this happen. </p>

<p>In reality they’re told to keep it quiet, that they’ll cause trouble if they pursue anything, and even lose their jobs or opportunities for speaking up. Happens all the time — yes, even in 2017.</p>

<p>It’s not your choice how a woman chooses to handle these situations. Sexual assault and even run-of-the-mill sexual harassment can be extremely stressful, isolating, hurtful/damaging, and even shameful to those who experience it.</p>

<p>My concern is that all this mock-outrage is really based more on ‘I don’t believe them, since they’re not naming names,’ instead of any real worry about other victims. If you were that concerned you’d have empathy for the pain those who are speaking up have gone through over the years.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the &quot;vague announcements&quot; aren&#39;t necessarily about taking anyone down.  In order to take someone down, you must first have the courage to stand up and do so - and it sure as hell isn&#39;t easy nor are the odds in the victims favor (watch what happens with Weinstein - and no woman will be a bit surprised).</p>

<p>Mostly, it&#39;s about speaking up to let people know it&#39;s happening.  In massive numbers.  And not just to &quot;those girls&quot; - but to women the masses wouldn&#39;t think &quot;asked for it&quot;.  </p>

<p>Lastly, it&#39;s providing strength in numbers.  </p>

I don&#39;t expect you to read every comment because I never do but I know it&#39;s hard. I made the choice to do the right thing not just for myself but others as well because I knew if I was being abused others were too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sure does make a lot of distraction with Vegas, Equifax/IRS, Awan scandal, Uranium scandal, and anything else I&#39;ve missed. It also seems like it distracts from the pedophilia stuff because most of this is adult sexual assault or essentially prostitution for Hollywood positions. I feel it also belittles victims that haven&#39;t been heavily compensated. </p>
