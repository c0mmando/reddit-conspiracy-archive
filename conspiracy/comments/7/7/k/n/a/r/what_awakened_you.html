      <p>
       In every free-thinking group of peers I find it compelling to ask the question "what awakened you?"
      </p>
      <p>
       What irrefutable event, piece of information, blatantly obvious false flag, government legislation made you realise that we are all just puppets in some twisted game of chess. That slavery wasn't abolished it was just altered to fit everyone and the only way to change that now is a globally unanimous uprising. The very likes of which is trying to be prevented by the Massacre false flags carrying the sole aim of gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me and im sure so many others it was 9/11. What started as a bunch of mates smoking weed &amp; watching whatever documentary we could find turned into designated 'Conspiracy' nights in which we sought to find out as much as humanly possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I find this question is fantastic on a large scale because it not only allows us to find out how many of us found the same event as the undeniable proof that the Government/Elite are a bunch of evil baby eating fucks, whilst also finding that others started their journey many years before 9/11 or only recently with PizzaGate or Vegas for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pearl Harbour, JFK, PizzaGate, Bohemian Grove, Executive Orders, Operation Northwoods, WikiLeaks, MK Ultra, UFO sightings.. the list goes on but everyone had a start point. What was yours?

       I've been brought up with critical thinking. My entire life I've seen that the established narrative at all levels of western society is different from what we're told and what we're taught to expect.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the rollout of the Internet as we know it today, I was exposed to other critical people that had different points of view and interacting with these people, regardless of their views were supporting or critiquing my world view, I've slowly etched out an understanding of the world beyond history books and press releases.

       Alright, here goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I was 20 years old I was living Vancouver (Canada). I used to frequent a nude beach there known as Wreck Beach. Very clean place. No perversion or anything like that, just a lot of hippies in a  community that was built and run by the people who went there. It was a beautiful place to visit.
      </p>
      <p>
       One afternoon I was sitting with a group of my friends and a guy sat down with us. (People are very sociable there). He started talking to us about music, and then sort of chuckled and said "I'm the serpent right now, offering you the fruit of knowledge" and then went on to talk about symbolism, and the language that is used in art. He talked about how so many artists create things and have no idea what they've created. They'll paint a flower, and have no knowledge of what a flower can symbolize.
      </p>
      <p>
       He told us to find a pre-1964 oxford dictionary. He said that it was published back when common people didn't really have any money, and the definitions of words put into it carried far more meaning and weight than the dictionaries we have today. He said there were all sorts of secrets in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       He talked for a long time about how religion is a control device. That long ago people came up with the idea to tell others that if they didn't behave a certain way, they would burn and burn for eternity when they died. He talked about how Rome never fell, but rather that it just moved. That America is the new Rome.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said that you can tell what is owned by "caesar" because caesar will always have his "sentry" stationed near by. The sentry he was referring to, was Coke machines.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were a lot more things he talked about, and I met with him on various other occasions after that to learn. My friends at the time found him interesting, but I was the only one in the group who really had a switch flicked inside me with what he was saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a tongue piercing at the time, and I remember talking with him one afternoon as I was sort of playing with it in my mouth, and he stopped mid sentence and said "You should really get rid of that thing. It's just a control device."
      </p>
      <p>
       So I did. Took it out of my mouth a moment after he said that to me. I'm still not completely sure what he meant by it being a control device, but I think I kind of understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyways, the conversations I had with this man were what "woke me up". It didn't happen all at once, but over the following years I would begin to see the world from a completely new perspective.

       Man I am.  I just hiked to the top of a mountain, freezing my balls off to see the sun set along the Clinch Mountain.  My body aches all over.  I was  wearing Chacos and needless to say I was freezing.  The sunset was beautiful and I returned with a 1/2 oz of Diesel.  I'm relaxing now and would love to hear the rest of your story.

       For me it was always simple: there's an entire portion of reality that we're excluded from, that isn't allowed to exist in the public domain, and that is all the proof I ever needed to know what I've always felt in my heart –– exoteric life is only 1/8th of the whole picture.

       My grandmothers family was devastated by the Third Reich and many ended up living under the Stazi afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       My great uncle, one of the two of five brothers who survived the war, always kept quiet about his experiences except to me apparently.
      </p>
      <p>
       He told me about all the horrible things he saw during the war. He was in Dresden when the allied bombings occurred. His family was visited by the SS and had friends who got disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
       He told me the thing that had frightened him the most of the period up to and after the war was "We didn't see the evil until it was too late. Those who said something vanished. So nobody said anything."
      </p>
      <p>
       I never 'woke up' per se. I always understood the government and powers that be weren't what I was taught in schools. It never fit the ideal that existed in my and many others heads around me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think my 'wake up' what more of a realization that the flaws in the system aren't due to the harsh realities of running government. Rather intentional barriers to implement better government and society.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are too  many people who disappear when they claim to be telling the truth.  Too many coincidences. Too many that the coincidences form a pattern of silence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tyrants enforce silence.

       My Uncle having flashbacks of Vietnam. Listening to him during those flashbacks was enough for me . Listening to him have “ conversations “ with other “ soldiers “  that were not actually there and witnessing the fear in his eyes , also the screaming and sadness.  Crawling on his belly on the floor.  Begging for someone to pick up body parts and give them back to their families. Crying to not have to kill innocent kids.  I knew then , something was terribly wrong with our government.  This is so vivid to me . I was only 5.

       Exactly. It was heartbreaking for me and our family. And the things he would “ see” are burned into my brain forever.  I honestly believe that is one of the reasons he died so young.  (50) The stress and guilt ate him alive.

       I was having dinner with my friend and she brought up Flouride and the toxins that are put legally in our food, then she brought up pesticides and how fb and google are mass surveilance tools and how if you speak about something fb, it later shows you an ad of what you talked about.

       The 2009 underwear bombing was what made me question everything.

      <p>
       I somehow found Kurt and Lori Haskell's blog, I'm not sure how, maybe I was already researching 9/11 conspiracy theories:

       The 2016 election, Clinton filth, democratic party filth, plus ever increasing control of reddit. Noticeable changes in shill tactics every 1-2 months getting more and more desperate... and here we are. It's real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking forward. The good thing I can see happening is, they'll have 99% control of MSM and internet, but they will just have created an echo chamber just like with the election and be very confident. And that's going to get them and be their downfall.
