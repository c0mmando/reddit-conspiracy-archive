<p>Below is a short list of known anomalies from the 1october event. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>No muzzle flash from Mandalay Bay 32nd floor during entire event.</p></li>
<li><p>No shell casings in photos from room 32-135 but stacks of unused ammo in room </p></li>
<li><p>Multiple witnesses from concert very clearly stated, they thought there was
 a. Multiple shooters 
 b. Bullets flying from different directions and different positions 
  c. Sounds of overlapping gunfire (taxi vid, &amp;, full vid)
  d. Multiple people saying they hear gunfire over the speakers. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is there one narrative that can explain all the above?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But, if he used a flash suppressor (which has been reported) that&#39;s not necessarily true. Also, we have no idea if he was firing with the lights on or off. My guess is the lights were on--- and I don&#39;t know if the tint on those type of windows change anything but it&#39;s something to consider. Plus, camera phones wouldn&#39;t necessarily pick up the distinct flashing. It seems like it&#39;d be more like a flashlight blinking than an entire room lighting up. </p>

<p>I&#39;d think we&#39;d be more likely to see smoke coming out the window. Though I suppose it&#39;d dispate fairly quickly.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no doubt that there was gunfire sounds coming from the speakers because there were several live mics onstage that picked up all sound and blasting them through the surrounding speakers.

    <div class="md"><p>Government agency sets up terrorist plot. Terrorists get wind of it before the meeting. Kill the seller of the weapons used to carry out planned attack (Paddock).</p>

<p>There&#39;s a couple guys in 32135 but more on the ground with long range rifles. (Maybe on the dirt mound maybe in &quot;twin towers&quot;). They start shooting at the concert goers from their positions.</p>

<p>FBI realizes they&#39;re fucked and Paddock is already dead. Terrorists all get away (Maybe not all but it doesn&#39;t really matter... Wouldn&#39;t tell public anyway). Now we have the blame it on this dead guy where we heard all the gunshots from moments earlier. (He had a shootout IN his room with terrorists). The cover up begins...</p>

<p>OR it was a completely orchestrated false flag attack. We&#39;ll never know. Let me know if I didn&#39;t tie any loose ends. It&#39;s probably more likely it was all orchestrated from the start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about this......
Paddock isn’t making millions playing video poker, so maybe he dabbles in small arms deals and chems, and poker is his cover. </p>

<p>Paddock does deals near concerts because the noise from the shows coupled with the transient traffic pattern of a concert (barely controlled chaos) gives him and his buyers annonymity and maybe even the opportunity to squeeze off a round or two without being detected. </p>

<p>Maybe Paddock was dabbling in small arms and chemicals and some of his clientelle just happened to be ISIS or related cartel. Say the government gets wind of it and sets up a sting deal, and sends their snitch (subtheory) in (JC), but he effs it up, takes out Paddock, goes full jihadi Johnny then shoots himself in the leg as cover. Maybe there was no digital presence of JC because he was a cell who got pinched and the government was using him as their tool. The guy sure as shit acted ‘owned’ on Ellen. </p>

<p>Maybe thats why ISIS claimed responsibility and our government is doing everything they can to cover it up. And by everything they can, I mean they are effing this up on an unprecedented scale - oh and throwing up a shi*ton of other high-drama to distract everyone which is working way too well. </p>

<p>Too much of the narrative we’re being force fed makes zero sense. So why not take a big and glorious swan dive off the deep end and start exploring what seems absurd?!</p>

<p>Can’t be any more absurd than whats in the public realm to date. </p>

<p>You have to remember the quality of the cameras aren&#39;t tge greatest. People in the videos were pointing towards the shooter with pure intent.</p>

<p>Whose to say the room wasnt lighting up a bit? Thats how they could easily point that person out. Just because its hard to tell on a grainy video over 400 yards away doesnt mean a thing.</p>

Helicopters everywhere. Bright light at the top of Delano Casino just as the auto fire begins. Stobe light in the center of Mandalay throws off police and they don&#39;t know the floor or room # until it&#39;s over. Zero evidence that Campos reports the shots. The conflicting timeline between police and Mandalay. The crime scene photos look staged. The final 2 handgun shots with glass falling outside. Shooters reported at other casinos.

    <div class="md"><p>Reports of multiple shooters is always bullshit unless they actually find another person. There was an incident at a college where a grad student shot his advisor and then himself, and even then there were reports of like 4 different shooters across the entire campus. Eyewitness testimony is about as reliable as the dumbest most panicked member of the general public.</p>

<p>The gun subreddits seem to be in agreement that the initial gunshots heard were fired by a crank system that could be easily attached to any of these firearms.</p>

<p>Just my two cents.</p>
