    <div class="md"><p>In this particular case, &quot;pandering to his base&quot; involves telling off the largest, most dangerous organization in the country (which puts it pretty high in the running for most dangerous in the world). The last guy to really try and push back the CIA was JFK.</p>

<p>Most people don&#39;t really understand what the CIA is. It was originally supposed to be a temporary organization during WWII, the OSS. But then things changed, we pardoned some Nazi&#39;s, started NASA and now we pretend like it&#39;s normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ha I&#39;m faaaaaaar from leftist.  I&#39;m just suspicious of politicians.  I also doubt the CIA held on to any files that would incriminate them, these were likely already destroyed.  HW Bush is still alive, and his family is still powerful, he&#39;s one of the people who&#39;s speculated (and I believe to be) involved.  The deep state would never put themselves in a situation where a rogue president could out them.  Even if they did hold on to their records about this, what makes you think they wouldn&#39;t have destroyed them as soon as Trump tweeted that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>JFK assassination was a hoax!!!!! I have proven this many times. It is exactly what he wants to do . Trump is a puppet for the Military. Just like VEGAS it was a hoax. They want you chasing down a bunch of bullshit rabbit holes that lead nowhere. What good would this do? Nothing. Just more distraction. Screw the JFK &quot;assassination&quot;. People have wasted so many years on that hoax crap.</p>
