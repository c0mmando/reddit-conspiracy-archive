       Ok, but that is not the point. My point is, he is not working for the deep state by tweeting.

       In this particular case, "pandering to his base" involves telling off the largest, most dangerous organization in the country (which puts it pretty high in the running for most dangerous in the world). The last guy to really try and push back the CIA was JFK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people don't really understand what the CIA is. It was originally supposed to be a temporary organization during WWII, the OSS. But then things changed, we pardoned some Nazi's, started NASA and now we pretend like it's normal.

       Right but like I said above, what makes you think they kept the files, especially after the tweet?  It could be pandering because he was voted in partially on anti-establishment rhetoric.  If there was anything that he could truly expose, why wouldn't they just 'back-and-to-the-left' him like they did before?

       I'm pro-Truth.  Being anti- anything prohibits you from having an open mind because what if something you're against exposes truth &amp; you dont believe it b/c of these ideas you've built up in your head.  So you just become what you hate.  A liar that says this person is incapable of telling the truth because i'm anti-politician &amp; this person is a politician so they cant be telling the truth.  Im not selling a narrative.  I'm using logic to formulate an opinion about what you are telling people &amp; how its incorrect.

       Pandering pandering pandering, why could it be this every time trump does something the left seems as "good" how about Trump ran via the republican party but wasn't a republican, he was an independent running within a major party. Why do you think not only the democrates hated him but so did most of the republicans if not all of them until people realised he would win and started sucking up his arse so they didn't lose their jobs.
      </p>

       I've said this many times if trump was in the deep state he would not have destroyed the tpp. Which is what he did.

       ha I'm faaaaaaar from leftist.  I'm just suspicious of politicians.  I also doubt the CIA held on to any files that would incriminate them, these were likely already destroyed.  HW Bush is still alive, and his family is still powerful, he's one of the people who's speculated (and I believe to be) involved.  The deep state would never put themselves in a situation where a rogue president could out them.  Even if they did hold on to their records about this, what makes you think they wouldn't have destroyed them as soon as Trump tweeted that?

       The Act requires that each assassination record be publicly disclosed in full and be made available in the collection no later than the date that is 25 years after the date of enactment of the Act (which will be October 26, 2017), unless the President of the United States certifies that: (1) continued postponement is made necessary by an identifiable harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations; and (2) the identifiable harm is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure.

       I think that is a different conversation. My response pertained specifically to the ability of the President to 'release or stop' the information.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are actually interested in my opinion, I doubt the release will contain anything that will implicate any of the US government in the assassination of JFK.

       I was talking about being politically out-maneuvered to go one way or the other. Technically yes, he does have the power to do it but political forces control his decision to to do so, and he is not in a position to do one or the other atm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is full of shit, and he only said this as an attempt at gaining some positive political ground, and he wouldn't have said it if it wasn't going to happen anyway (regardless, the only crap that will be released will be sterilized/manufactured anyway).
      </p>
      <p>
       This release will only be meaningful if:
      </p>
      <p>
       A) what they release is genuine.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) release Oswalds tax returns &amp; military service files
      </p>
      <p>
       C) release details of General Landsdale's direct involvement in directing the assassination teams in Dallas that day.
      </p>
      <p>
       D) show orders to kill witnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       E) show the standing military, secret service &amp; law enforcement orders/plans for the Dallas visit.

       JFK assassination was a hoax!!!!! I have proven this many times. It is exactly what he wants to do . Trump is a puppet for the Military. Just like VEGAS it was a hoax. They want you chasing down a bunch of bullshit rabbit holes that lead nowhere. What good would this do? Nothing. Just more distraction. Screw the JFK "assassination". People have wasted so many years on that hoax crap.
