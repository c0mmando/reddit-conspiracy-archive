        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m interested in your personal experience with any type of flu vaccine. Any side effects you experienced, short or long term, how you feel about having taken it and would you take it again. </p>

<p>It&#39;s preferential if you know which type you had, e.g. trivalent, quadrivalent, cell based (for those allergic to eggs), multi or single dose (thimerisol free), where you received the vaccine (drugstore, hospital, physicians office), how you paid for the vaccine (insurance, cash, etc.) and of course the year you received it.</p>

<p>Was it elective or employer mandated?</p>

<p>This is not a post designed to elicit medical debate, a scientific fact stand off or to argue the efficacy of all vaccines - I am interested only in personal experiences with seasonal flu shots. </p>

<p>If you had one, liked it and would do it again, great. 
If you had one and disliked it, why?
If you developed Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, I&#39;d love to hear your story.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you take the flu shot every year then? Do you know which type you take? High dose (65 and over) or... </p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed personally that high quality probiotics have a major impact on how well my body recovers from injury. Major impact. Hugely noticeable, not just a &#39;maybe it did help&#39; situation - as I&#39;m sure you have to continue the use of Kefir. Do you make your own? I have a friend who does and swears by it - but it grosses me out to drink them, I need capsules. </p>

<p>The FDA can squawk all day about how unproven they are to dissuade us from buying into &#39;that&#39;, but I&#39;ve experienced it first hand and even had a surgeon remark on how unusually quickly I healed after a major surgery. When I explained what I&#39;d been doing, he didn&#39;t side-eye me the way I expected, he wanted the name of the product. </p>

<p>My mother was who provided me with this specific probiotic, and her oral surgeon commented to her how unbelievably well her mouth healed after a full extraction. He too wanted to know what it was. </p>

<p>I wonder if this is something that might impact the side effects for people who take mandatory flu shots for their employer. Since I am one of those people (hooray for working in the medical field!) I suppose I&#39;ll try it out - if I can&#39;t find someone to take the shot for me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s disturbing to see places like Wal-Mart and target offering gift cards to get flu shots. I&#39;ve always been against it simply due to an aversion to needles.

<p>Even if vaccination is a good idea on principle that doesn&#39;t change the fact that pharmaceutical companies have a financial incentive to push vaccines, whether you need them or not, and they&#39;re not great at regulating the things that go into your body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in a medical office and get the quadrivalent IM shot. Never had influenza, never had any reaction other than a sore arm when the student nurse gave it one year.</p>

<p>We try to start in early October so people have a chance to make antibodies before influenza season hits, and prioritize seniors over 65, people with chronic respiratory/cardiac illnesses, health care workers, immunocompromised people, etc.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever seen a serious reaction but we have a pretty solid patient population so we know their histories, or the nurse/doctors screens people just stopping by for allergies, etc.</p>

<p>We never did figure out if the lady who had an allergy to duck eggs could take the vaccine, as she was not allergic to chicken eggs? I don&#39;t know we sent her off to Public Health. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad to hear from you! I have some questions, if you don&#39;t mind?</p>

<p>Did you happen to receive the recombinant quadrivalent (called FluBlok Quadrivalent) or another type? I&#39;m extremely interested in any <strong>experienced</strong> side effects (versus <strong>possible</strong> side effects) from that one as it&#39;s new this year. It contains A &amp; B but not the B subtypes in the other quadrivalent. Here&#39;s a link to the package insert if you&#39;re interested <a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM336020.pdf">https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM336020.pdf</a></p>

<p>Does your office administer single dose or multi-dose? The former is the only one I can consider as I have a mercury/thimerisol allergy. Not many offer single dose, which is a shame. I feel like they should all be single dose to just get the thimerisol argument out of the equation. You know that argument right? Of course ya do. You hang out here ;) </p>

<p>As for your allergy lady, there is a cell based vaccine (recombinant trivalent version of FluBlok) for those who have egg allergy, which is grown in mammalian cells versus chicken eggs, but I&#39;m not sure how widely available that one is. It may be as difficult to procure as a single dose quadrivalent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we just have the standard quadrivalent, but I couldnt say for sure off the top of my head. We have single dose vials, Flumist (which barely ever gets used), and some limited single dose vials.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t say we&#39;ve had any reactions I&#39;m aware of and checking the health unit tracking system we don&#39;t seem to have any influenza - like illness in the area, although it&#39;s early days yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly where I am. Employed by a renowned teaching hospital, who this year has decided to make flu shots mandatory and I feel violated before I&#39;ve even received it. I&#39;m nearly twice your age and immune compromised though. When I get sick, it&#39;s usually hospital admission worthy. Still, without having a Guillain-Barr√© DX, I can&#39;t get out of it without quitting. I find it disgusting that you have to risk developing this disease and can only escape it if you&#39;ve been vaccine injured to that degree. </p>

<p>We aren&#39;t offered the mask option anymore sadly. It&#39;s flu shot or be terminated. They may be annoying to breathe through, but having that option would be beautiful. In years past I&#39;ve used funny decorative masks with faces on them. No one has ever failed to appreciate them. I&#39;ve also never contracted the flu - except one year when FluMist was being administered in local schools and literally 75% of school age children were coming in with positive flu swabs. I got it bad that year. Type B. Thankfully they&#39;ve pulled the FluMist and no longer recommend using it on anyone. That was a terrible flu experiment I never thought we&#39;d see the end of.</p>

<p>The deadline for me is 25 October. They say it isn&#39;t being &#39;forced&#39; as employees have the right to quit. What? So I can quit and die from being poor - or I can take it and assume all the risks?</p>

<p>I hope you stay well, but look - don&#39;t be too hard on yourself. You had to make a difficult choice just as myself and probably a million other healthcare workers do. Take some good probiotics, and if you fancy a little boost from nature, Elderberry syrup is a fantastic immune booster.</p>

<p>How long has it been since your shot? The full 2 weeks? Any symptoms yet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not arguing your point, because it&#39;s an absolutely valid point. I am in complete agreement. </p>

<p><strong>But</strong> <em>(you knew there was a but coming, right? hehe)</em> just to clear up one thing for those who don&#39;t know (and if you do know, great), <strong>single-dose</strong> vaccines <strong>lack the mercury component</strong>, which is called <strong>Thimerisol</strong>. </p>

<p>A <strong>single-dose</strong> variation of vaccines (all vaccines) must exist for patients with mercury allergy <em>(I have one, and have been fully vaxxed with single-dose, except for flu shot)</em> and though it may be difficult to find someone in your area who has the single-dose option for any number of vaccines, if you&#39;re ever in a position where you <strong>HAVE</strong> to receive one (say you&#39;ve stepped on a rusty nail and require a tetanus shot), that is an option to bypass the mercury component completely. You&#39;ll simply need to ask for and insist on &#39;Single-Dose&#39; MMR/Tetanus (or whatever type you need). If it isn&#39;t available, call around until you find an office who has it. </p>

<p>For anyone who doesn&#39;t know how to visually tell the difference between single-dose and multi-dose, it&#39;s easy. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>A single-dose vaccine is shipped to medical facilities in pre-filled syringes, where you only need pop the needle on the syringe to administer.<a href="https://i.imgur.com/1fbV0uQ.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/1fbV0uQ.jpg</a></p></li>
<li><p>Multi-dose arrive in little glass jars, contain Thimerisol, and medical staff must use their own syringe to withdraw a dose for each patient. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FjIgLkM.jpg">https://i.imgur.com/FjIgLkM.jpg</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>As for the formaldehyde, it&#39;s used to deactivate toxins from bacteria, so that is impossible to get around. Though it&#39;s said that a Pear fruit contains 50x the amount of formaldehyde than a vaccine, there&#39;s got to be a difference in naturally occurring formaldehyde and synthesized formaldehyde. I just don&#39;t know what it is.</p>

<p>Those two ingredients aside, these are additional potential allergens found in vaccines which are equally controversial. You mentioned 2 of the most commonly known, but there are many others to include in your argument. </p>

<ul>
<li>Amphotericin B</li>
<li>Casein (Bovine)</li>
<li>Chlortetracyclin</li>
<li>Ovalbumin (Egg)</li>

    <div class="md"><p>Alum, Virosomes, and Cytokines are adjuvants used in some vaccines, yes, but not all. </p>

<p>I may be mistaken but I don&#39;t believe aluminum is interchangeable for thimerosol as they don&#39;t play the same role. </p>

<p>Thimerosol is a preservative/antiseptic used to inhibit growth of bacteria. Necessary in vials used across multiple patients. (Necessary according to Pharm companies.)</p>

<p>An adjuvant is a substance that increases the bodies immune response - which is also used in chemotherapy. This explains the role of an adjuvant it a bit more clearly </p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14554157">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14554157</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Inactivated vaccines require adjuvants to stimulate an immune response. The choice of adjuvant or immune enhancer determines whether the immune response is effective, ineffective or damaging. Accordingly, there is a need for new adjuvants that stimulate the appropriate immunity, for example, T cell immunity for intracellular pathogens and cancer vaccines. In several adjuvants, the identification of chemical groups that interact with specific cell toll-like receptors (innate immunity) or receptors for co-stimulatory ligands (adaptive immunity), has enabled the establishment of structure-function relationships that are useful in the design of new adjuvants. Because of the crucial immunomodulating role of adjuvants, sub-unit vaccine development will remain dependent on new adjuvants.</p>

<p>After I got out I (10 years ago) I went and voluntarily had the shot twice with no side effects. I will probably have the vaccine again this year because I have a young kid at home and I would rather get it just to be on the safe side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thought I&#39;d drop this in regarding the Mandatory Flu Vaccination Program I mentioned earlier, for anyone who would like to know what this looks like when implemented. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;For the safety of our patients, trainees, staff, faculty, physicians and students, a mandatory flu vaccination policy is in effect across (Hospital). Implemented in 2012, this program is in line with a national movement to increase immunization rates among health care workers.</p>

<p>This year‚Äôs flu vaccination campaign begins in October 2017. Under the (Hospital) Influenza Vaccination Policy, every staff and faculty member, resident, postdoctoral fellow, medical student and volunteer who works with patients or works in a patient care area must receive a flu vaccination.</p>

<p>(Hospital) compliance deadline is (date)</p>

<p>For general questions about the mandatory flu campaign, contact the (Hospital) Vaccination and Influenza Prevention Steering Committee &quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Obviously you can google the above text and find out exactly where it comes from - if you&#39;re interested</em> </p>

<p>A &#39;Steering&#39; Committee, if you don&#39;t know, is a committee made up of high level stakeholders and/or experts who provide guidance on key issues. </p>

<p>Should we make a guess as to how many of these people are shareholders in the biotech companies which produce certain vaccines? Or nah? If you&#39;re in a spicy mood, you can google that list of board members and do some cross referencing. Maybe you&#39;ll find an actual conspiracy hiding in there. Or not.  </p>

Employed by a renowned teaching hospital, who this year has decided to make flu shots mandatory and I feel violated before I&#39;ve even received it. I&#39;m nearly twice your age and immune compromised though. When I get sick, it&#39;s usually hospital admission worthy. Still, without having a Guillain-Barr√© DX, I can&#39;t get out of it without quitting. I find it disgusting that you have to risk developing this disease and can only escape it if you&#39;ve been vaccine injured to that degree. </p>

<p>We aren&#39;t offered the mask option anymore sadly. It&#39;s flu shot or be terminated. They may be annoying to breathe through, but having that option would be beautiful. In years past I&#39;ve used funny decorative masks with faces on them. No one has ever failed to appreciate them. I&#39;ve also never contracted the flu - except one year when FluMist was being administered in local schools and literally 75% of school age children were coming in with positive flu swabs. I got it bad that year. Type B. Thankfully they&#39;ve pulled the FluMist and no longer recommend using it on anyone. That was a terrible flu experiment I never thought we&#39;d see the end of.</p>

<p>The deadline for me is 25 October. They say it isn&#39;t being &#39;forced&#39; as employees have the right to quit. What? So I can quit and die from being poor - or I can take it and assume all the risks?</p>

<p>I hope you stay well, but look - don&#39;t be too hard on yourself. You had to make a difficult choice just as myself and probably a million other healthcare workers do. Take some good probiotics, and if you fancy a little boost from nature, Elderberry syrup is a fantastic immune booster.</p>

<p>How long has it been since your shot? The full 2 weeks? Any symptoms yet?</p>
