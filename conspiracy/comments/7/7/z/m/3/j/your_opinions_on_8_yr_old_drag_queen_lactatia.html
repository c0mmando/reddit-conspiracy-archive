        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4769604/amp/Eight-year-old-boy-transforms-drag-queen-alter-ego.html">https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4769604/amp/Eight-year-old-boy-transforms-drag-queen-alter-ego.html</a></p>

<p>before you start bashing me for being homophobic, let me just say that I&#39;ve always been friends with people who are gay and trans. We do watch Ru Paul&#39;s race sometimes for entertainment, and find it hilarious. But even some of my gay friends agree this is a bit far. How can a boy classify himself as a girl at only 8 years old? He hasn&#39;t even reached puberty, gender identification should be the least of his concerns. It feels like the childhood becomes shorter and shorter for each generation, kids are greatly encouraged to act like adults. 
Some parents said he&#39;s just playing dress up, its harmless. But he&#39;s also adapting the mannerism, and already his lifestyle is that of a drag queen. </p>

<p>EDIT: I do understand that a drag queen doesn&#39;t necessary mean transgender, it&#39;s just a look/personality people like to adapt, not their sexual orientation. But how can a child understand all these complex definitions and their differences?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drag queens are being shamed by transgenders into being politically correct.    <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/03/02/rupaul-explains-the-difference-between-drag-queens-and-transgender-people/">http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/03/02/rupaul-explains-the-difference-between-drag-queens-and-transgender-people/</a> .<br/>
Drag queens were even banned from a gay pride parade despite the fact that drag queens have been active in the gay rights movement since the beginning.  The reason?  Offensive to transgenders.
 <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/drag-queens-banned-from-pride-event-because-they-may-offend-transgender-people-10403198.html">https://www.standard.co.uk/news/drag-queens-banned-from-pride-event-because-they-may-offend-transgender-people-10403198.html</a> .<br/>
Ultimately the ban was rescinded, but just add drag queens to the list of groups on the transgender shit-list: lesbians who aren&#39;t sexually attracted to transgender penises; transsexuals who have fully, medically transitioned; radical feminists who say you&#39;re not a woman just because you say so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The most disturbing part I found about this, was seeing the kid performing on a stage at what looked like a nightclub, striking sexual poses and dancing provocatively, in front of a crowd of older men. There&#39;s no way a child in that situation is not going to look like easy prey to a predator. Obviously the majority of men in that crowd were probably just laughing/found it amusing and that was that, but all it takes is one, and a parent that isn&#39;t really that concerned about leaving their child in the supervision of one of these people, who puts themselves eagerly forward as a helping hand, for this child&#39;s life to be irrevocably scarred. It&#39;s like hte pedo thing in Hollywood, parents get all excited by the attention their child is getting, the kid likes it too, and before you know it they&#39;re regularly left on their own with an &#39;agent&#39; or &#39;publicist&#39; who &#39;specialises in children&#39; and is asking them if they&#39;ve ever seen a grown man&#39;s penis before, or want a demonstration of what a blow job is. I mean, it seems that particularly in this situation the child is at risk just because they are performing directly in front of an audience, at night clubs etc and they are specifically being paraded as a sexual type being. If you get rampant pedophilia in Hollywood when kids are just exposed to people working in the industry, imagine what this kid doing this in front of hundreds/thousands of people could be exposed to.</p>

<p>As for the dressing up in itself, that&#39;s not really an issue, kids like to dress up. If it&#39;s what the kid himself chose to do and wanted to do that&#39;s one thing, but certainly it&#39;s irresponsible of the parents to &#39;put him out there&#39; like that. Why not let him dress up etc at home, why take him to night clubs etc?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drag has nothing to do with sexual preference or identity, it&#39;s an art form. Generally, it&#39;s gay men or women, who prefer their own gender role. </p>

<p>My disgust with this is ANY fuckin parent who puts their child into a national media spotlight, for anything less than an educational or artistic merit award, like a science fair, spelling bee, piano concert. </p>

<p>Teaching kids to be obsessed with fame is disgusting, including child actors, Instagram modelling, these ridiculous &quot;toddler bitch&quot; videos. Hell, I&#39;m disgusted w one of my facebook friends with how her 7 year old is described, pictured and catered to on her mother&#39;s profile. (I also ripped into a close friend for posting public photos of her 2 year old topless, often with location tags of where they were swimming!) </p>

<p>Your kid playing dressup and dancing in the living room is quaint. Your kid on a modeling shoot and being interviewed is not.  This kid will be on drugs or self harming by 13. Fuck, kids can&#39;t even go to the bus stop for school without helicopter parenting anymore. </p>

<p>A little kid is a little kid. We&#39;ve got to be careful not to swing so far in the other direction we end up going all Handmaid&#39;s Tale or something. There is nothing even remotely sexual about a little kid walking around in their diaper or something. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was a tom boy pretty much my whole childhood and I&#39;ll admit I did have a thought or two about how I&#39;d rather be a boy than a girl, but that just made me confused.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s fine to let your kid express themselves and figure out who they want to be, but bringing them into an adult setting with sexual themes isn&#39;t appropriate. I&#39;ve seen a few clips of this child with their parents at drag shows, to me it looks like that kid is being fed how to act and what to say. I feel like they are putting their child in danger by doing this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My sister was that way. She actually wanted to be a boy, and insisted on changing her name and living as a boy for a few years. My parents were just like &quot;Okay, whatever&quot; so she cut her hair and bought boy stuff and went by a boy name.</p>

<p>Then one day she wanted to be a girl again, and she became really feminine and she&#39;s a wife and mom now. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t a big deal, but she&#39;s so thankful it was the 80&#39;s and she had no idea about transgenderism and my parents didn&#39;t push her to transition or something, because she believes that would&#39;ve really screwed her up.</p>

Drag queens aren&#39;t transgendered, they&#39;re just playing dress up. If you took your argument to a more diverse audience than this sub you would get slammed for not understanding what drag is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t got a problem with him dressing up? but the boy actually IS the youngest drag queen, he&#39;s not pretending. he performs for adults. he has a fanbase called &quot;the lactators&quot;, which all sounds too adult-like. and to top it off, media makes him an icon we should all be inspired by. I&#39;m not suggesting media should shun him, but really this shouldnt go viral in case other kids start getting the wrong idea.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so gross how much sexualization we push on our kids. We already live in a sex filled society in media/ads so limiting the exposure and focus on that at a young age is even more important. I love the argument that we suppress sexuality in this country, compared to what? We are pretty fucking sexually liberal compared to the rest of the world. </p>
