       before you start bashing me for being homophobic, let me just say that I've always been friends with people who are gay and trans. We do watch Ru Paul's race sometimes for entertainment, and find it hilarious. But even some of my gay friends agree this is a bit far. How can a boy classify himself as a girl at only 8 years old? He hasn't even reached puberty, gender identification should be the least of his concerns. It feels like the childhood becomes shorter and shorter for each generation, kids are greatly encouraged to act like adults. 
Some parents said he's just playing dress up, its harmless. But he's also adapting the mannerism, and already his lifestyle is that of a drag queen.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I do understand that a drag queen doesn't necessary mean transgender, it's just a look/personality people like to adapt, not their sexual orientation. But how can a child understand all these complex definitions and their differences?

       Don't focus on the weird exceptions as if they are norms.  MSM focuses on the fringe as if they are the new norm.  Just as PC is phasing out, so will this attention grabbing.

       When I was 8, I was burning my brother's GI Joe's and He-Man toys. We caught the garage on fire. We did a lot of crazy/fun shit unsupervised for hours. We had a whole patch of woods to build a dirt bike path. One dad built us a fort and left us alone! You had to come to our home and watch home videos/slides to see the damn family. The only children I saw on tv were on PBS kids programming.

       Haha, awesome.  Sounds a lot like how I grew up.  Bikes and forts and bb guns.  Hell in the summer if it was daylight i was never home.  Too much fun stuff to do outside.  I too had my share of, erm, fire escapades.  Almost burned down the neighbor's house one time.  Got the belt for that one even though, technically, it was my idiot friends fault I was a participant.   Kids that sit inside all day on xbox are missing out on tons of fun and learning experiences!

       Lol.  My friend and I broke into an abondoned building and found some matches.  So we started a little fire with some dried weeds.  It was starting to get a little big so I told my buddy 'kick dirt on it!'
      </p>
      <p>
       He said 'through weeds on it!' And threw a giant armful of dried weeds on it.  Phwoosh!  Hillside on fire now burning towards a neighor house.  Had to run home and tell my dad to call fire department.  Got my ass whipped real good.  Thanks John, you dummy lol.

       A child feeling that they have a character inside them that they need to dress up as is different than pumping a kid full of hormones. The pageant stuff is creepy, but drag in general is a positive force from the past. The new ultraorthodox LGBTQPR is going to shame it out of existence in new next few years.

       Drag queens are being shamed by transgenders into being politically correct.
       <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/03/02/rupaul-explains-the-difference-between-drag-queens-and-transgender-people/">
        http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/03/02/rupaul-explains-the-difference-between-drag-queens-and-transgender-people/
       </a>
       .
       <br/>
       Drag queens were even banned from a gay pride parade despite the fact that drag queens have been active in the gay rights movement since the beginning.  The reason?  Offensive to transgenders.
       <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/drag-queens-banned-from-pride-event-because-they-may-offend-transgender-people-10403198.html">
        https://www.standard.co.uk/news/drag-queens-banned-from-pride-event-because-they-may-offend-transgender-people-10403198.html
       </a>
       .
       <br/>
       Ultimately the ban was rescinded, but just add drag queens to the list of groups on the transgender shit-list: lesbians who aren't sexually attracted to transgender penises; transsexuals who have fully, medically transitioned; radical feminists who say you're not a woman just because you say so.

       Naw, I'm in the scene and if anything, drag is going through a revival. The current "conflict" is the lack of representation for drag kings. The lesbians aren't getting their fair share of bookings. Hell, the women (lesbian, bi, trans) aren't getting their voices heard in general.

       break any gender stereotypes by all means, dress your girls as superman and boys as fairies. but teaching them the sassy mannerisms and dance moves isn't normal. Ru Paul's drag race shouldnt even be your child's favourite show, the stuff they talk about can be damaging to a clueless child.

       The most disturbing part I found about this, was seeing the kid performing on a stage at what looked like a nightclub, striking sexual poses and dancing provocatively, in front of a crowd of older men. There's no way a child in that situation is not going to look like easy prey to a predator. Obviously the majority of men in that crowd were probably just laughing/found it amusing and that was that, but all it takes is one, and a parent that isn't really that concerned about leaving their child in the supervision of one of these people, who puts themselves eagerly forward as a helping hand, for this child's life to be irrevocably scarred. It's like hte pedo thing in Hollywood, parents get all excited by the attention their child is getting, the kid likes it too, and before you know it they're regularly left on their own with an 'agent' or 'publicist' who 'specialises in children' and is asking them if they've ever seen a grown man's penis before, or want a demonstration of what a blow job is. I mean, it seems that particularly in this situation the child is at risk just because they are performing directly in front of an audience, at night clubs etc and they are specifically being paraded as a sexual type being. If you get rampant pedophilia in Hollywood when kids are just exposed to people working in the industry, imagine what this kid doing this in front of hundreds/thousands of people could be exposed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the dressing up in itself, that's not really an issue, kids like to dress up. If it's what the kid himself chose to do and wanted to do that's one thing, but certainly it's irresponsible of the parents to 'put him out there' like that. Why not let him dress up etc at home, why take him to night clubs etc?

       you pretty much summed up my concern with this. we're witnessing a young boy who is easy prey for pedos. the mother is over the moon from all the money and piblicity, all it takes is one guy with bad intentions and the kid will need therapy for life. but rather than putting news out to warn parents of this, the mass media makes it look like quality entertainment.

       Man, the mother is a train wreck. Kids don't have the maturity to make decisions about gender and sexuality that would affect their entire life and I'm sure this is what his mother approves of and encourages. That poor bastard.

       I can vouch that being a boy raised by a single mother fucking sucks.

       Drag has nothing to do with sexual preference or identity, it's an art form. Generally, it's gay men or women, who prefer their own gender role.
      </p>

       My disgust with this is ANY fuckin parent who puts their child into a national media spotlight, for anything less than an educational or artistic merit award, like a science fair, spelling bee, piano concert.

       Teaching kids to be obsessed with fame is disgusting, including child actors, Instagram modelling, these ridiculous "toddler bitch" videos. Hell, I'm disgusted w one of my facebook friends with how her 7 year old is described, pictured and catered to on her mother's profile. (I also ripped into a close friend for posting public photos of her 2 year old topless, often with location tags of where they were swimming!)

       Your kid playing dressup and dancing in the living room is quaint. Your kid on a modeling shoot and being interviewed is not.  This kid will be on drugs or self harming by 13. Fuck, kids can't even go to the bus stop for school without helicopter parenting anymore.

       It's a sure fire sign of child abuse. 70% of children grow out of gender dysmorphia so in much the same way they can't choose who to marry or what tattoo they fancy getting at a young age, they should be defined and rail-roaded down one path at such an early age.

       we can't really rely on bullies at school to straighten him out, if anything that will lead to more trauma and make him hate himself. the problem is that news put them in a positive light, forcing us to accept it. how fucked up are future generations going to be if this keeps being normalised?

       There are bullies, and there is peer pressure.  He doesn't need his face punched in, he just needs a counter-force to the news putting in a positive light.  The school-yard will sing a different song than the TV (and whatever parenting is happening).

       Fwiw I live(d) in the heart of tranny-land.  Now just outside that.  I used to see dozens of trannies a weekend and partied with the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgences.  Heck, I used to see trannies on a Wed at 7:30 am.

       But I don't wanna see an 8-yr old adopting that persona.

       Eight year olds who are having sex with adults sure do know what it is. I would not assume this child is not sexually active. I would be highly suspicious about it.

       I was a tom boy pretty much my whole childhood and I'll admit I did have a thought or two about how I'd rather be a boy than a girl, but that just made me confused.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's fine to let your kid express themselves and figure out who they want to be, but bringing them into an adult setting with sexual themes isn't appropriate. I've seen a few clips of this child with their parents at drag shows, to me it looks like that kid is being fed how to act and what to say. I feel like they are putting their child in danger by doing this.

       My sister was that way. She actually wanted to be a boy, and insisted on changing her name and living as a boy for a few years. My parents were just like "Okay, whatever" so she cut her hair and bought boy stuff and went by a boy name.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then one day she wanted to be a girl again, and she became really feminine and she's a wife and mom now.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't a big deal, but she's so thankful it was the 80's and she had no idea about transgenderism and my parents didn't push her to transition or something, because she believes that would've really screwed her up.

       One point on your approach: Drag has little to do with gender identification. Dressing up in drag is something that people do for fun. Drag queens aren't transgendered, they're just playing dress up. If you took your argument to a more diverse audience than this sub you would get slammed for not understanding what drag is.

       Drag is basically gender clowning. It's fun and it doesn't need to be sexual... This kid is having fun dressing up and playing a character. How terrible! ??

       I haven't got a problem with him dressing up? but the boy actually IS the youngest drag queen, he's not pretending. he performs for adults. he has a fanbase called "the lactators", which all sounds too adult-like. and to top it off, media makes him an icon we should all be inspired by. I'm not suggesting media should shun him, but really this shouldnt go viral in case other kids start getting the wrong idea.

       I think it's gross and fucked up, and if this shit continues to be normalized imagine what will be happening in a few years or 10 years. Kids should not be focusing their lives on sex/gender really AT ALL until they are learning about sex ed in school.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so gross how much sexualization we push on our kids. We already live in a sex filled society in media/ads so limiting the exposure and focus on that at a young age is even more important. I love the argument that we suppress sexuality in this country, compared to what? We are pretty fucking sexually liberal compared to the rest of the world.
