        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I can&#39;t understand what is going on Trump and Putin. First it clearly seems that Russia has played a part on hacking USA elections to Trumps favour (spreading fake news and implying propaganda). Trump has many times praised Putin especially during his elections and even proposed to cooperate on cyber security with Putin(<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/post-politics/wp/2017/07/09/trump-vows-to-move-forward-in-working-constructively-with-russia-after-putin-denied-election-hacking/">www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/post-politics/wp/2017/07/09/trump-vows-to-move-forward-in-working-constructively-with-russia-after-putin-denied-election-hacking/</a> ).</p>

<p>On the other hand Trump has trying to streghten NATO and increased military activity in Poland for example. Which naturally Russia isnt very happy about. Other thing was when Trump attacked Syria about its use chemical weapons which again Russia(as Syrias ally)didn&#39;t like. (<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/russia-iran-us-america-syria-red-lines-respond-with-force-aggressor-air-strikes-war-latest-a7675031.html%3famp">www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/russia-iran-us-america-syria-red-lines-respond-with-force-aggressor-air-strikes-war-latest-a7675031.html%3famp</a> )</p>

<p>Also there was tension when Russia&#39;s plane flew very close to USA&#39;s plane (<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/russia-us-jet-baltic-sea-american-plant-five-feet-close-encounter-latest-a7799326.html%3famp">www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/russia-us-jet-baltic-sea-american-plant-five-feet-close-encounter-latest-a7799326.html%3famp</a> ) I think there were another happening similiar to this, but I couldn&#39;t found anything about so I probably just remembered wrong.</p>

<p>These were just quick examples(basically took first ones i found on google since my orginal examples are in finnish), but I can&#39;t understand when Trump at the same time seems to be good friends with Putin and Russia but still tries to attack(not directly), tease and oppose them. There has been more and more tension between America and Russia.</p>

<p>So if somebody can give me more info about this and explain to me what is really going on with Trump and Putin, I would be very grateful.</p>

<p>Also please correct me if I&#39;m been misinformed or I have understood something wrong.</p>

<p>Also if you can give sources to your responses that would be big bonus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump believes it is a good policy to get along well with a world power such as Russia, especially in the fight against Islamic terrorism and that Russia no longer poses a threat to the Western world; which is pretty much true. Russia sees Trump as a good president to deal with and hates Hillary so helped push some messaging online, unbeknownst to the Trump campaign. Similarly, countries such as China and  Ukraine aided the Clinton campaign - but the media doesn’t focus on that.</p>

Aren&#39;t they also in Syria bombing the shit out of hospitals? Their unique mafia/fsb run government is responsible for the death of law abiding citizens. And they also provide rockets and aid to North Korea which they&#39;ve been using as a teething ring for their kompromat American president. I&#39;m not American but member of a NATO country, I find that behavior threatening.</p>

<p>I feel that many on here would suggest that the most blatant propaganda in US politics concerns the MSM and their aggressive anti-Trump stance. What did Russia spend on Facebook ads? $100k?</p>

<p>I read this in our finnish news and I think they were based on this article(not sure though). There were couple of same kind articles on internet:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no way to know whether the Russian campaign proved decisive in electing Trump, but researchers portray it as part of a broadly effective strategy of sowing distrust in U.S. democracy and its leaders.  ...“They want to essentially erode faith in the U.S. government or U.S. government interests,” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Best case for helping Trump is speculation about helping Trump.  </p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>A former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael A. McFaul, said he was struck by the overt support that Sputnik expressed for Trump during the campaign,  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Figures the guy in charge of the laughable &quot;reset policy&quot; would be used for filler.  </p>

<p><em>In 2009, McFaul joined the Barack Obama administration as a senior adviser in Washington, D.C., where he was the architect of the so-called &quot;Russian reset&quot; policy.</em><br/>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that&#39;s an observation of reality. The only reason you disagree is because people who are wrong never have any idea as to how or why they&#39;re wrong. You can fuck up and think stupid shit, but you have to admit you&#39;re wrong when corrected. You simply <em>can not</em> do that. Your ego is too fragile. If you constantly deny reality to fit your worldview while also accusing others of the same thing <em>without elaboration,</em> you will never learn anything and will stagnate emotionally until you&#39;re a cut and dry 80 year old fox news watching grandpa that&#39;s hated by their family, if they ever have one.</p>
