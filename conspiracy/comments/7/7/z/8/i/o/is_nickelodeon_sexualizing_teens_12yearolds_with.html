    <div class="md"><p>You are under the childish assumption that because you dont hear about it, or you aren&#39;t aware it is happening, you believe it isn&#39;t. All I am saying is that the fact that they are jewish is irrelevant. Did you know that there are a ton more jewish people working in Hollywood than other ethnicities? So, it stands to reason that a disproportionate amount would be jewish. That does not mean that Judaism is some awful religion that secretly is revolving around pedophilia as your comment would suggest.</p>

<p>Ever heard of the stereotype of the child molesting priest? Or all of the Vatican sex scandals? I guess not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I am just someone who has critical thinking skills, as well as an interest in conspiracy theories. Call me a shill all you want, Hollywood being full of sick shit is not because there are a large amount of jewish people in it. I am not religious at all, I am not here to defend any one religion, I am here to defend common sense. There are not secret meetings in Hollywood where every jewish person gets together to plan and execute all the vile stuff that happens behind the scenes there; Sure, there are jewish people that do some evil shit but there are that in every ethnicity and religious belief. Correlation does not equal causation. Im sorry if I have offended you with my dissenting viewpoint, you are right I clearly must be a shill.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean you obviously don&#39;t understand. So I&#39;ll make it more simple for you. Just because not every Jew in Hollywood goes to secret meetings doesn&#39;t mean everyone at that secret meeting or close to everyone isn&#39;t Jewish?</p>

<p>Is that really that hard to understand?</p>

<p>We know that at the high end Freemasons are or at least seem to be satanic. Does that mean they all are? My grandfather was a freemason and he was Christian and a great man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For one thing, I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re getting the Jimmy Savile (Roman Catholic) and Ted Heath (Anglican) Jewish association. Also, who&#39;s Terry Richardson? Is he Jewish?</p>

<p>So that&#39;s at least two names you can take from your list and move to the Christian list. Then you can add the various catholic priests the church has been protecting for years, and add the husbands of all the child brides boasted by Boko Haram and ISIS. Also, I&#39;m not sure why you would nail Weinstein and Dershowitz as &quot;child rapists&quot; when the allegations against them aren&#39;t that.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Your entire post is littered with fake associations and twisted allegations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When discussing the ethnicity in direct relation to a spat of very similar cases of decades of officially covered up child sexual assault, you most certainly can.   </p>

<p>Again, where are all these high ranking Christian, Muslim, and Buddhist child sexual abusers your friend attempted to claim earlier?</p>

<p>I havw to admit, I do appreciate your attempted apologist schtick here.  But let&#39;s break down and paraphrase what it is you&#39;re crying about:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;Most of the recently exposed high-profile child rapists appear to be of Jewish descent.&quot;</em></p>

<p>&quot;Nuh-uhhhhh!   One of those isn&#39;t Jewish!&quot;  [again, fails to address the others while neglecting to mention any other group with even a fraction of the of these recently highly publicized cases]</p>

<p><em>&quot;Physically, he sure appears to be.  The circles he ran around in were also very predominantly Jewish.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;You can&#39;t say that!&quot;</em> [cries racism!]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As if discussing ANY ethnicity is somehow &quot;racist.&quot;  </p>

<p>Now, about those highly publicized institutional Buddhist child rape cases....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was convinced of a pedo narrative but I would rather believe that there is a more probable cause. More so a conclusion of selling sex as in ads or music is common. Almost a preparedness to our culture of Americans. No I&#39;m not condoning it but there&#39;s proof of this and with the growing solidarity to our lives, don&#39;t you believe that there is a need for sexual expression. If you take away the sports, music, and media what else is there? Don&#39;t you believe that love is the answer. I know the difference between affection and lust but how does a young adult &quot;test&quot; these waters without any shame anymore. Its ok to express sexuality is our countries great freedom. And I will now begin posters regret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>what does sexual exploration have to do with love? children know what love is, they receive it from their parents, relatives and friends. they don&#39;t have hormones present to understand &quot;lust&quot;, and they don&#39;t need to until they become young adults. even then, they don&#39;t need older adults to help them &quot;explore their sexuality&quot;. Once they&#39;re 18, they can choose to be with whoever they want, bearing in mind this is consensual. The age of consent should never change, no matter what american culture wants. let children have their childhood. </p>
