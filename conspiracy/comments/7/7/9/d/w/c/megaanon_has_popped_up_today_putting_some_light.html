       I've mentioned it before here, I'll say it again...Mega Anon is a HUGE LARP. If people would actually look into ALL of his posts, you'd see all the times he contradicts himself. He also gets freakishly angry if you question anything he says. But the main thing is:
      </p>
      <p>
       EVERYTHING HE POSTS IS PUBLIC INFO &amp; HAS BEEN PUBLIC INFO FOR A WHILE. He re-words it into fan fiction &amp; then acts like he's an insider. Which he IS NOT.
      </p>
      <p>
       He goes on /pol/ because he is lonely &amp; wants to talk to people who think similarly to himself. So then he can have conversations without getting called crazy. He has ZERO people skills so he goes about everything portraying himself as some insider, smarter than everyone else person who is gracing us with his presence.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for the past few weeks(Since he started posting again after LV) he switched it up &amp; decided to say he's a girl. Someone said he sounded like a girl &amp; he went with it. Post nasty feet because he knows for some reason, a lot of guys on /pol/ or at least the vocal ones like pictures of gross feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       He uses reverse psychology to explain why he's NOT a LARP. He also posts from multiple IDs to attack anyone who questions him &amp; also to praise himself. It's VERY pathetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       It irritates me because he will make MULTIPLE threads &amp; flood /pol/ with them &amp; also post screenshots of his posts in any thread that even REMOTELY is important. To distract? Disinfo? No idea. But even with his blatantly obvious bullshit people still swoon. /pol/ use to be a good place. When someone came in &amp; said they were an Anon on the inside, they were instantly called Fake &amp; Gay until they gave proof. Now the newfags &amp; tumblr fan-fiction addicts have invaded &amp; annoyed.

       What I take from this: MegaAnon is fake. EllenCampos is
       <strong>
        <em>
         NOT
        </em>
       </strong>
       PictureCampos, real name or not. Wikileaks is comprimised and we shouldnt trust them. MaryLou is a distraction, and the Sheriff made mistakes that nobody has really covered yet. MA is a controlled LARP.

       I think Campos was drugged when he was on Ellen. He droned on at a slow pace talking about nearly being murdered just a few weeks ago, and sometimes looked like he was about to fall asleep. Probably benzos.

       I am all about the LV conspiracy, and I think this guy is bullshit.  He isn't an insider.  As another user stated, he posts information which is already available to the public and very loosely tries to tie it together with his own conjecture.  If anyone remembers the old 4chan, users wouldn't give themselves stupid nicknames and would actually leak legitimate documents or hard evidence.  Anything other than that can safely be taken as a LARP.

       The comments here are Hillaryous!

       Anyone who reads the content in the posted link, then reads these comments afterwards, can see the absurdity.

       At least it's obvious now.
