       Hey everyone,
       <strong>
        the chairman of the FCC, is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd.
       </strong>
       Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services.
       <strong>
        These changes would give ISP's the ability to silence anyone with differing or potentially "offensive" opinions, including groups like the
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">
         /r/conspiracy
        </a>
        community.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com">
         But there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd.
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       We're getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Please, head over to
        <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com">
         https://www.battleforthenet.com
        </a>
        , and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections.
       </strong>
       The time to act is now.
      </p>
      <p>
       To reach the call in like directly by phone,
       <strong>
        call 202-930-8550
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       When you get through to your Rep's office, introduce yourself, be polite, and say:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I support "Title Two" net neutrality rules and I urge you to oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. Specifically, I'd like you to contact the FCC Chairman and demand he abandon his current plan.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Phone calls won't make any difference. If you want different laws, elect different people. It's the only way.

       this shit is neverending, they know people won't keep up with the calls over and over again so they keep doing it until they end up with the desired (paid for) results that were requested.
