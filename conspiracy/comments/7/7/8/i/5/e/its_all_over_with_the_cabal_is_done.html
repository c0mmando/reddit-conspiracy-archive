       I knew they were done in 2016 but now we are seeing them melt down before our eyes as their scandalous behavior spreads through the minds of the sleeping slaves across the world thereby waking them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       This idiot George Soros might launch one last attack by paying people off all over the place to do dispicable things against America and the world but I think we will overcome it. As long as we don't participate and stay indoors on November 4, everything should be OK. He wants a civil war so that he can create a sense of chaos where he can get away with a lot of dirty tricks and crimes against humanity. Being that he pushed billions of dollars into his foundation should be alarming but we should all really just hide out for a while as all his paid protesters milk him for all he's worth. I'm not saying this will happen but in case it does, we can be prepared.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless we are once again being misled, the entire cabal structure should fall apart before our eyes. This is very good news but we need to hold Trump accountable for 4 demands being that the 99% are the kings of the world:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Near total transparency into government.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A new, fully upgraded economic model that actually works.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A release of our hidden resources, exotic technologies, and secret information that's been wrongfully withheld from the people.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The immediate removal of all poisons from our society such as fluoride, the shitty medicines, the horrible media brainwashing, and anything else that is damaging society.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       There is a lot more we can do but this would be a good start. All the hard work is paying off and will keep paying off as long as we keep at it forever. All this is the result of a combined effort of all the white hats of the world against the black hats of the world. Unity is the secret to breaking the cabal and that is why they used the old "divide and conquer" strategy all these years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any remaining cabal members should either quickly switch sides and become a white hat or expect to be destroyed with the cabal. I am already hearing that Mitch McConnell may have switched sides so if its true, that should be an inspiration for all to make the switch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: To clarify, fixing and upgrading life is a lifelong job. When we do nothing, it all slowly falls apart so we still have a lot of work to do but it will get much easier later when the whole cabal is removed.

       If the enemy leaves it will be because they were asked to leave.  Don't ever underestimate your enemy.  Especially this enemy, and especially when you have no idea who they are.   Those that own and control people like Soros are shadows, have more power than you know, and are more intelligent than you know.  This war has cost many people their lives, families have been destroyed, and countless individuals still suffer to this day.  You act very smug about what is a horribly sad chain of events that is still not over.  The entire thing is very sad.  If you knew the truth, you would know why God says to love your enemies.

       You have no evidence that Soros is dying, and there is plenty of evidence of Open Societies Foundation's decades of mayhem on behalf of the US ruling class. It's obvious he's up to something.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, given the high dollar amount, we can even narrow down what he's probably up to. Either a massive push in many countries, or he's going to do a major operation in the US, such as a color revolution against Trump.

       I think the impeachment stuff has to be thwarted and the treason fully exposed...I mean fully. They are certainly acting like this is their last gasp-at least this current wing of the cabal. I am not sure we are going to be able to have a real election again if these people aren’t fully exposed before 2020.

       Can you explain the monarchy's involvement for me? I rarely hear them mentioned in this context and would like to know more.

       Basically the monarchy has had their grip on power for a long time. They infiltrated the US government when JFK was assassinated. George HW Bush is their guy and he's related to Queen Elizabeth II. The Queen would like everyone to think she's just a figurehead, but she is a puppet master. No figurehead get a red box full of intelligence briefings every week.

       I don't necessarily agree or disagree but wanted to point out a few things: Soros made bank on a put on MGM just before the Vegas shooting. This is important because it relates to a larger trend of the merging of truthseeking and financial analysis. Look up what happened with stocks right before 911 - they are being uncovered, they used public means to profit off of these events and that left trails. We are seeing those trails more and more entering the public realm - we are literally going to force their hand in some fashion to cover their tracks. Their hand is also going to be forced geopolitically if the dollar is replaced by either the SDR or the yuan as reserve currency. What will they do to preserve control and their own power/money?
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly...what do you think happens if the govt fails? The rest of the world politely stands by while we try out something new? Think China is nice like that? What happens with Israel without our teeth behind them? That's a conversation I don't see being had anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third...PBB.

       We started step one a long time ago. It's just one step after another so the next step is to see what happens this Saturday. It seems Assange is supposed to release some very damaging info. At that point, we have to read the emails and post findings. The_Donald is pretty good at that. They get it done quickly. Then take take all the bombshells and spread them all over social media.

       I’m on mobile so I can’t type up the whole plan but there are ways to minimize corruption by 95%. One way is to force transperancy into our government and then push this idea worldwide. Evil people work on the shadows. We need a completely open government that has nothing to hide even if it poses some risk to national security. (Keep in mind people aren’t trying to kill us like they claim and all wars are really just banker war rackets.) Establishing true transperancy through and through would greatly reduce corruption by minimizing secrecy. There are other ways too.

       Sure. Just gotta get 7 billion people to all be perfectly transparent with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds easy. Except for the whole humans being egotistical lying machines thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know, how about we invent a pill that makes it so you cant lie, and we require everyone to take it every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you can just ask them "did you take your pill today" and they have to tell the truth because they took it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless they didn't, then they could lie and said they did... shit.

       Turns out getting billions of people to all be perfectly transparent is also pretty hard too. Especially when its in their best interest to lie.

       The government is huge and trickles all the way down into very small, borderline civilian jobs.

       How about Jimmy who runs the mail for the IRS branch in Wyoming, where does he sit on the line between 'Civilian' and 'The Government'?

      <p>
       And a lot of the government's info comes from civilians. If you want  transparency, its Turtles all the Way Down dude. Government can't be transparent if the civilians it gets its info from aren't.

       We have to figure it all out as we go. It’s hard to explain on mobile but we need strike a very good balance. For example, we should be able to see how much of each resource we have in supply, easy access to all the available technology information, web access to camera that see into all major government buildings like the White House or Pentagon, and anything else that can help us understand what’s going on in gov.

       Yes, thats definitely easy to monitor across an entire continent.

      <p>
       "easy access to all the available technology information,"

       "web access to camera that see into all major government buildings"
      </p>
      <p>
       What does this do? No one cares about staring at hundreds and hundreds of empty hallways. Sometimes you get to see a cleaner vacuuming up the floor, and once a week someone walks by.
      </p>
      <p>
       That has nothing to do with transparency of the government. How about auditing systems but then you get into reconciliation systems which is no easy feat

        for an entire country

      <p>
       It's not as simple as "change a few things there, put some webcams up, magically produce programs that can monitor everything live, just post our books online, interview a couple candidates... done"
      </p>
