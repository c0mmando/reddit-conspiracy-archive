        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;and I was going to say I was hit, but I uh, got all over my cell phone, just to clear that radio traffic, for they can coordinate, uh the rest of the call&quot;</p>

<p>My only question: Why would you want to keep the lines clear so they can coordinate, if BECAUSE YOU AREN&#39;T RADIOING IT IN, THEY DON&#39;T KNOW WHAT THEY&#39;RE DEALING WITH?</p>

<p>Am I missing something? This seems so completely bizarre to me. If you take his words at face value, Jesus Campos is saying, ostensibly, &quot;Oh, they probably heard the gunfire, someone else will report this, I don&#39;t want to tie up the lines and confuse any coordination.&quot;</p>

<p>That makes no sense. You&#39;d radio it in SO THEY CAN COORDINATE AN ACCURATE RESPONSE. </p>

<p>AM I LIVING IN A FANTASY LAND?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. Who is he calling on his cellphone, his superior? The front desk? Lmao. In what scenario will that be of more use than directly calling in a SHOOTER WITH AN AUTOMATIC FIREARM over the radio? You will immediately muster a far quicker response over the radio, and you will only be CLEARING UP ANY CONFUSION if you call it in over the radio. You&#39;re making it HARDER to muster a response if you don&#39;t call it in immediately over the radio.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right?  That&#39;s what I&#39;m not getting.  Using the radio just seems like the immediate thing to do.  It&#39;s already in your hand.  Why take the time to take your phone out and dial when you can just push a button and say &quot;Send Help.&quot; But, like I said, I&#39;m not a cop.  I thought maybe there&#39;s some reason to switch from radio to cell phone that someone who is a cop or security guard could explain.  </p>

We&#39;ve all been assuming he was completely laid out with a bullet, but maybe he was grazed near his ankle or something (that&#39;d account for his being ok with resting his arms where he is).

    <div class="md"><p>If after watching this, no &#39;real news&#39; journalist doesn&#39;t dig into what really happened... then we really do have no journalists left.  A guy goes on a show with ties to the Casino, answers minimal questions that he&#39;s been coached on... and the guy on the couch with him appears to be steering the entire thing.  Tell me at 1:30 he doesn&#39;t signal Ellen to get the prop out... and near the end... the double tap on the leg tells Jesus, you&#39;re done.  He doesn&#39;t speak after that.</p>

<p>Forget what he says, look at the bigger picture of how the Casino has completely staged what we&#39;re learning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My somewhat meaningless observations of this...interview, if you could call it that:  </p>

<p>Is the bullet still in Campos&#39;s thigh? As I understand it, he has yet to seek medical attention (he never went to a hospital in the following days of the shooting) There wasn&#39;t much of a limp in his approach to the stage. The bullets I am aware of are on that of Campos&#39;s forehead in the form of sweat.  </p>

<p>For someone who is regarded as a hero, he certainly doesn&#39;t conduct himself as of someone being praised for his achievements and bravery, instead, he slouches over himself, his body language is awful, and I think never cracks a smile in spite of a celebratory interview in which you get to recount how you are said hero.  </p>

<p>A Twitter comment makes note that Campos has no problem resting his body weight for the duration of the interview on his injured leg.  </p>

<p>I think we listen to Ellen herself speak of the matter more so than both of the men combined who were physically there and to top what is a joke of an interview even moreover, she goes on to say that Campos will not speak of this again.  </p>

<p>Ellen emphasis they Campos didn&#39;t want compensation in exchange for the interview - dispelling what some claimed to be his holding out for the highest bitter - leaving me wondering why he wouldn&#39;t like any normal human being out there would not take to every social media platform to disclose your account of the event and offer your corner of the truth.  </p>

<p>Again, my meaningless observations. </p>

<p>That behavior could be pretty typical for people with survivor&#39;s guilt. If there is no conspiracy at all, I&#39;m sure he feels guilty that he didn&#39;t do enough to prevent 500 people from getting shot after him. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll eat him up for awhile.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great catch on those cues. That&#39;s painful now to watch and see how coordinated this effort is, the way Schuck reaches behind Campos to signal to Ellen, you can even watch her start to pick up on the signal as she then grabs the board. The double tap was just bad. It was definitely not for comforting Campos, it was blatantly a signal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All my whats. Dude on the couch was the maintenance guy. Really, tell me right now you think the maintenance guy was coaching him for some nefarious reason. </p>

<p>The interview was not staged. It was rehearsed. All interviews have an element of rehearsal. They all knew the fucking prop was coming out. </p>

<p>It&#39;s clear to me that Campos is still fucked up from getting shot and being the center of attention. Give the guy a break. If he was really practicing the lines the feds gave him for three goddamn weeks... You&#39;d think he&#39;d do a better job. </p>

<p>The only thing the casino is doing is trying to cover their own ass. That kind of shit doesn&#39;t go unnoticed.</p>

<p>Some people&#39;s kids, I swear. Be logical. Use actual facts to back up your delusional bullshit. Ockham&#39;s razor. Look for the simplest solution. The real story, I guarantee you, will not involve ISIS or shoped fucking ear lobes. </p>

<p>Also. Please don&#39;t imply that the casino has the ultimate power to control the entire narrative of this particular event. </p>

<p>Come back to the light. We need you in the real world. </p>

He sees Campos is struggling off piste, signals to her by touching Campos&#39; back (pre agreed sign) and then stops as soon as Ellen goes for the prop (he stops unnaturally soon if offering sympathy). Now, you could argue she was going to do it anyway, but she looks at Schuck then acts excitedly at the prop. So it all seems mistimed by totally rehearsed. In any case the whole interview has the opposite effect of it&#39;s intended purpose. It just make everything even more fucked up. </p>

<p>They clearly are, because the leaps in logic one needs to make turn this event into something more are just massive. Due mostly to the location, the city, the time line and just tons of random people shooting what amounts to hours of video that all match up with each other. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think like any good conspiracy theory there is wiggle room here. Maybe the hotel covering their ass, maybe some other issues we have not even thought about. </p>

<p>if this shooting had happened to people walking out of a club at 2am in down Chicago or Miami then sure, way more room to flex into some of the more let say creative ideas. </p>

<p>but Vegas? A city with a million cameras and a shooter in a dead end room on the 32nd floor and no where to go. Ok fine the FBI etc has not come forward and dropped hours of raw footage on the public but most of us do NOT think the police, even at a federal level, are out to kill/hurt the population. So I&#39;m pretty confident the FBI, even if they don&#39;t share it, have tons of footage of the shooter. Then you have all the random people who filmed the event so we have a decent (and short) time line. That is so rare for events of this nature. Most of the time a person can pitch anytime line they want to fit even the most out there narrative, can&#39;t do that in this case. </p>

<p>Theories of other shooters at other locations might fly if it was 10-15 people at a random Dennys  in Stockton CA, but it&#39;s in Vegas. It&#39;s 1000+ people every few blocks with 100s on the street at all times of the night. Sort of hard to do anything and not have tons of witnesses. No look I get it&#39;s fun to kick around idea but if one looks at this objectively it&#39;s pretty hard to believe most of the ideas people are coming up with right now. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are at least two distinct issues here.</p>

<ol>
<li>That he didn&#39;t report he&#39;d been shot while on the call.</li>
<li>That he mentioned it on Ellen, unprompted. </li>
</ol>

<p>The guy had someone help him prepare for the show. That&#39;s not odd. Don&#39;t waste time wondering why he was prepped, it happens all the time. </p>

<p>The interesting question here is: Why was it important that he mention that detail during the Ellen interview? </p>

<p>There are a bunch of possibilities. I&#39;m not going to write them out, I&#39;ll just jump ahead to what I feel is the most likely: There is a recording of that communication, the police have it, and he doesn&#39;t mention being shot. </p>

<p>If you think it&#39;s reasonable to believe a person who was just shot wouldn&#39;t mention being shot when calling in to report shots fired, I suppose there&#39;s no big mystery here. You can go. </p>

<p>If you think a person who&#39;d been shot would definitely mention having been shot, then there&#39;s a problem. There is a recording, the police have it, and he hadn&#39;t been shot when the recording was made. So when was Jesus shot?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good point, I like your line of thinking. It&#39;s completely unnecessary to bring it up unless it&#39;s setting up further information down the road - the recording as you say that doesn&#39;t include him mentioning he&#39;s been shot. I could definitely see that. So now &quot;the public&quot; won&#39;t ask why he doesn&#39;t mention it, because... oh it&#39;s already been explained, he&#39;s a hero, he wanted the lines clear.

    <div class="md"><p>Your quote of him in the in your selfpost is wrong, here is what he says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“And I was going to say that I was hit, but I got on … my cellphone just to clear radio traffic so they could coordinate the rest of the call.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which makes it perfectly clear what he meant. He&#39;s saying that after telling his colleagues of what is happening, he didn&#39;t want to go into details that he was shot, because that would take time and block radio traffic over his walkie talkie, from more important stuff, like the communication between his boss and everyone else on security on what to do about this. </p>

<p>So he uses his cellphone and calls it in either to 911 or some other person who isn&#39;t going to coordinate security. It&#39;s not unusual to do this and it&#39;s not that complicated to understand. </p>

<p>Just to make it more clear, if he would spend more time talking about his injury, they wouldn&#39;t have any chance of coordinating with everyone else on staff because that would block the traffic on their frequency. </p>

<p>He said that shots were fired, that&#39;s what&#39;s most important in a call like that so they can coordinate a proper response with authorities and get everyone out safe. </p>

<p>The engineer says he heard gunshots but he thought it was a jack hammer, not a drill. Those are two completely different sounds. </p>

<p>Sounds to me like Jesus was shot before the shooting began and notified MB security immediately, then called 911 on his phone. </p>

<p>What was MB security doing for 72 minutes?</p>

<p>If Campos called in his phone when he was shot, there is a clear record of that. </p>

<p>Didn&#39;t MB security call the police right away? That would also leave clear documented proof of the timeline.</p>

<p>Why was there so much confusion with the timeline when they have such concrete evidence to use and several days to examine it?</p>

I remember this specifically because I said the police should&#39;ve been there sooner on r/news and that was shot down by many people (assuming they could&#39;ve been in any part of the hotel-- fair enough).

    <div class="md"><p>Well in the original police scanner audio &quot;a security guy&quot; and &quot;a maintenance guy&quot; are mentioned by the police in the hallway. Unless you also want to believe that is somehow fabricated. </p>

<p>People forget to go back to all the real, first hand evidence, like the tapes and the original interviews. Instead they go on WILD speculation road trips with zero evidence supporting them. Some things don&#39;t make sense in this case, but you should recognize when things do line up and evidence continues to compile towards one theory. Instead of focusing on Paddock&#39;s house being invaded with NOTHING out of place, the multiple airbnb&#39;s rented just before the attack, the flying to Phoenix, then driving a rental car from Phoenix BACK to Las Vegas in the days leading up to the attack, the multiple homes and businesses he owned... this is all so much bigger than some security guard staying out of the public eye because he&#39;s traumatized. </p>

<p>Yeah, I think he sat down with an MGM attorney and they planned out what he was gong to say. Which really isn&#39;t all that odd. It&#39;s that they went out of their way to say he didn&#39;t mention he&#39;d been shot that jumps out. People don&#39;t normally volunteer what they didn&#39;t say during a conversation.

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, part of the control involves selectively giving too little info in certain circumstances, and too much info in others, creating a dizzying situation of theorizing and mental energy output, sapping a population either way. I&#39;ve heard that the power of the Soviet bloc propaganda laid with the fact that everyone knew they were probably being lied to, but they were just pumped full of information and had no access to any other information, so they just went along with whatever info they were given. I&#39;d say it&#39;s similar to conspiracy theorists using the very information they&#39;re given to try and prove the inaccuracy of said information - when in reality, the only way to &quot;win&quot; is to refuse to play the game, and preserve your own mental energy, your life essence.</p>

<p>In essence, heaven and God and spirituality and &quot;goodness&quot; are found in the physical realm of real action.

<p>No - I&#39;m sorry. I completely understand what you&#39;re saying. There are times when that&#39;s a perfectly reasonable reading of the situation - this is not one of them. That doesn&#39;t map onto the situation at all, in my opinion. There&#39;s really no reasonable way to suggest he was in the bystander effect, because, well firstly, there really WAS no one else around to call it in, he had a radio, he had the ability to call it in and stop it, and he didn&#39;t. </p>

<p>The only possibility is that he did in fact &quot;freeze&quot; and had a panic attack or something similar, but in that case... he&#39;s not exactly a hero, and in fact, for over 6 minutes he did not help coordinate a response that could have potentially stopped the following mass shooting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but let&#39;s go through that line of thought:</p>

<p>Why is this &quot;hero&quot; thing being pushed, then? To make one man feel better, and save face from the fact that he actually could have helped stopped a mass shooting?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the FBI&#39;s mandate to help in citizens&#39; self image and self esteem. They&#39;re there to find the facts, yes?</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it&#39;s not the FBI, it&#39;s Ellen. SHE is pushing the hero thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Sure, point taken. But - isn&#39;t this the exact MO of all these types of events? Plausible deniability? For the public, there&#39;s one narrative - this hero Jesus Campos &quot;helping to stay behind and warn people and &quot;save their lives&quot;&quot;, but then after the investigation is finished, the FBI releases &quot;Well actually X Y Z happened&quot;, contradicting the public narrative. It&#39;s like the Shanksville flight, the passengers heroically storming the cabin. The public thinks that&#39;s what happened, because IT IS ALLOWED TO EXIST AS A NARRATIVE, AND THE INVESTIGATIVE POWERS DON&#39;T OPENLY SAY &quot;STOP SAYING THESE THINGS THAT AREN&#39;T TRUE&quot;, only releasing a contradiction in the &quot;final report&quot;, a report that is never really reported on in any detail for the public to ever contradict the various mythologies the public is allowed to believe.</p>

<p>Why is the FBI allowing a star witness to go onto Ellen and allow the public to believe a narrative that is patently untrue? It is their job to investigate, and IT IS IN FACT OBSTRUCTING THEIR ABILITY TO DISSEMINATE THE TRUTH IF THIS HAPPENS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do I personally believe that what I said makes sense? </p>

<p>Fuck no! Lol</p>

<p>I am simply giving the explanation the general public is going to roll with after the FBI reads that comment and says, &quot;hey he&#39;s got a good point.&quot; Lol</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s total bull shit. If I&#39;m fucking shot the first thing I&#39;m doing is calling the cops. The second thing I&#39;m doing to calling my mother.</p>

<p>Sure panic attack makes sense. I personally believe the whole story stinks to high ducking heaven.</p>

<p>The only thing that makes this seem real is that the dude screwed shut the doors. I mean, it&#39;s not every day a person successfully plans a massacre that kills 58 people. Screwing the doors shut was over planning that that actually alerted the building security and macitence before the shooting even started. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the kind of shit I could see happening if I ever did something. Planned too much and ended up alerting people to what was going on by over planning.  </p>

<p>I felt a burning sensation I went to go lift my pantleg up and I saw the blood <strong>that’s when I called it in on my radio that shots have been fired</strong> and I was going to say that I was hit but I got on over my cell phone just to clear the radio traffic for they can coordinate the rest of the call.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Full disclosure, I omitted all the &quot;uh&quot;s.</p>

<p>So what he said was he got hit, radioed it in and cleared the radio line so dispatch could coordinate. The part about the cell phone sounds, to me, like he called someone, MB security or 911, on his cell phone to tell them he was shot. </p>

Your proof is that more people should have been recording. I agree to an extent that there should probably be more footage but at the same time people were running for their life. I&#39;m not trying to say your wrong or anything but I&#39;m just curious how you can feel so strongly that you are right when this hole incident is just a clusterfuck. I think most people aren&#39;t gonna stick around to record when they think someone is firing machine guns into the crowd. I&#39;m not discounting your opinion that no one was shot and I think its important to be able to discuss all theories. You seem like you have already solved this thing in your head.

She could a been lying but I remember thinking she seemed sincere and no reason to lie. Either way, if I believed 100% no one died in any of these instances, I would find answers. Go to where the shooting happened wether in Vegas or Sandy hook and talk to people. Idk man. I don&#39;t buy the mainstream narrative, but I don&#39;t necessarily believe no one died either.

    <div class="md"><p>I personally didn&#39;t find it weird she had a diagram. I thought it was clever and really helped to paint the picture of what Jesus was describing. However every single other part of the interview is suspect as hell. </p>

<p>I also found it a bit weird how the engineer was acting more like a handler. Maybe he knew Jesus was shaken and was just trying to be there for him? They prepped for the show so he knew the diagram is there and perhaps he was kind of trying to take charge by pointing at it and it gave the impression of him being a handler? But he acted too much in charge throughout the rest of the interview so I don&#39;t know.. Very odd.</p>

<p>When did we first even hear about this engineer? That&#39;s honestly my first time hearing about him so he struck me as odd right away.</p>

<p>Not to mention Elen was weird too. Dictating the interview to as far as the details. Again maybe they prepped for it and then during the actual interview they noticed Jesus shutting down so they stepped in?</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to think logically here but this interview rubs me the wrong way. If not totally convinced from the weirdness, I&#39;m very disappointed the least.</p>

I&#39;m saying maybe his mind wasn&#39;t on his leg wound so much as it was on getting help there asap so that no one else got hurt. Seems kinda obvious that if you call and say shots fired that help is going to come and that also means that he knew he would get help for his leg also. Stop trying to make something out of nothing. It is obvious to me that you aren&#39;t able to string together coherent thoughts and apply logic. Who knows what was really in his mind but he did what he could do and that is call for help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something that doesn&#39;t add up for me......the sherriff stated one of the injured policemen on the ground was shot and had 4 wounds and then he clarified it was two gun shots which had entry and exit wounds. Cop was probably 300/400 yards from elevated shooter at time of being shot, cool, totally believe that description.</p>

<p>Now Campos was what 30/40 yards from the shooter and was shot, yet it&#39;s been stated by family members that the bullet is still in his leg? Surely the only way that the bullet wouldn&#39;t have passed through at such a close distance would be if it were embedded in big bone which would be excruciating pain and most likely require immediate medical/surgical attention? </p>

<p>How can someone be shot from a much farther away range and sustain far worse injury than a person shot much closer?
I know the wooden door would have taken some pace out the bullet, but that much??? </p>

The door on the left hand side is lying on it&#39;s side, zoom in and check out the bullet holes, that appears to be the door he shot through from inside.  That I think would give better indication of calibre.  Thing that gets me scratching my head though, there is nowhere near 200.  Agreed on the food cart.

<p>I think Jesus was caught in a lie but is being made to look like a hero and threatened to strict a narrative given to him because the FBI doesn’t want to admit their involvement in illegal gun running or whatever they’re trying to cover up as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a listing of 25 suspicious facets of Jesus Campos’ Ellen interview: </p>

<ol>
<li>Guy vanishes for five days and pops out on a fluff interview with ... Ellen?</li>
<li>Instead of being interviewed by a cable news outlet or investigative reporter, his only interview (more about this later) is with daytime talk show host Ellen.
a. No hardball questions
b. No skepticism, no suspicion of his story.
c. In fact, he was coddled and praised and led through the entire interview.</li>
<li>Unusually, the Ellen Show preleased the video of the interview to the Washington Post, who posted it online before the Ellen Show aired.</li>
<li>Every question Ellen asked was leading. It sounded like she had a better grasp of what happened than Campos did.</li>
<li>Throughout the interview Campos looked nervous as fuck. His body language is hunched over, staring at the floor throughout most of the interview.</li>
<li>Campos is accompanied by a handler, the engineer Steven Schuck, to keep him on message. </li>
<li>Not once did Ellen ask why Campos disappeared for five days or where he disappeared to.</li>
<li>Ellen never asked Campos why his version of events changed repeatedly.</li>
<li>Ellen never asked Campos about his employment status at the Mandalay Bay.</li>
<li>She busted out schematics and pointers. When has Ellen ever busted out schematics and pointers on her show? Ellen using visual aids to help guide Campos along.</li>
</ol>

    <div class="md"><p>Not to mention the main question which is the whole reason Campos is of such interest to this story: Jesus, you were there on the floor during the entire shooting and subsequent suicide of this lone shooter. What did you see and hear? Did you hear him speak at all during this time? Can you confirm you saw nor heard what could have been any other person on the floor during the attack? Is there anything about your experience that might explain why Mr. Paddock chose to kill himself during his own attack?</p>

<p>I mean, isn&#39;t that supposed to be how journalism works? You get rid of conspiracy theory by shining light into darkness. So if this story is all legitimate and there is nothing to hide, why can&#39;t these basic questions be asked? I&#39;m not here on r/conspiracy because I want to believe in a conspiracy. I&#39;m here because I want to be proven wrong. I want to find something that will show, &quot;See, it really did happen that way and isn&#39;t the obvious cover-up of something sinister that it seems to be.&quot; But every new development just puts more points in the &quot;Fishy AF&quot; column. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those are good questions.  I&#39;m with you in just wanting the truth to come out,  not four different versions of the truth that fit the narrative that each of those groups is most interested in, or puts them in the best position to fight future litigation. I hate to ask it this way...but if you&#39;re loved one was killed in this event...wouldn&#39;t you be pissed at what seems to more obfuscation than a transparent search for the truth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the issues you bring up are covered by issues of money. Odds are Ellen, maybe with a kickback from the casino as a PR move, offered up a decent pay off. She &quot;knew more about the event&quot; being she&#39;s not stupid and knew the interview might very well be world news level. So she prepped a bit more than when she is talking to a random celeb about their dog. </p>

<p>She didn&#39;t go into super details being it&#39;s a day time talk show and lets be real here, most people are not digging for info as much as people might do here. Campo crappy ability to talk in front of tons of people and an audience of millions is not all that surprising. I did an oral report in college on porn once and still stumbled around a bit on the topic and like most guys around that age it&#39;s not like I was <em>cough</em> unfamiliar with the topic <em>cough</em>. </p>

<p>I said this in another random post but him doing any sort of interview was/is just flat out stupid. It gains him nothing (well maybe money) and only opens the door to look like a scum back for trading in the death of 50+ people for some nickles and dimes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watching the video, what he says and what OP is &quot;sayng&quot; he said are not at all the same thing. He called on his radio that shots had been fired, but he used his phone to let them know that he had been struck. There are a number of reasons that he may have done this. One, is that it could possibly be their security policy, to reduce traffic as it is a very large facility and others may need to communicate too, 
 or to prevent traumatic information from being broadcast <em>publically</em>, where it may be heard by patrons (especially over a ptt radio where you may not have an earpiece).
Secondly, it is also possible that, since he was just shot, he was not exactly thinking clearly and for some unknown reason, while <em>under fire</em> he made that decision and it was not related to anything else other than it was his immediate decision to do so. I think that OP really fails to consider that people make sudden instant decisions in traumatic situations and it doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to question it afterward in this way, it&#39;s just what happened. Have you ever had to make a decision like that <em>while being shot at</em>? And if so, are you trained to? Do you think Jesus Campos is?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably the wrong post for this question, but all this has made me think about it.  I understand that plans change and the human eliminate of things.  But, what did Campos do that would&#39;ve made Paddock completely think his cover was blown and that he needed to shoot out in the hall way.  I&#39;m completely okay with the idea that he saw him on the &quot;monitor&quot; or whatever, but because the shooting happened after this, it really makes me think.  Maybe Paddock wanted to wait 1 more day, maybe, and me saying that is leaving out other details to suggest he didn&#39;t.  But, worst case scenario is they find the door locked and they fix it.  What were they going to do, knock on every door and ask them if they did this?  So, it is possible Paddock was not ready to begin, and these events led him to it.  Or getting back to my original thought, why did this &quot;mastermind&quot; lose his meticulous planning to shoot 1 person out the door.  If he saw him on the monitor, he could&#39;ve walked out, shot him and dragged him in the damn room.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been reported that Jason Aldean was the last performer on the last night of the concert, which leads me to believe Paddock was intending to open fire at the time he did. <em>Maybe</em> he was planning to wait until the concert ended and the lights came up as people were leaving, in order to have a higher kill count. But I don&#39;t think he was planning on any later time than that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What else was he supposed to say? He said shots fired. That means help was on the way. Why stay on the line? Staying on the line would allow for two major things: one it would alert the shooter to his exact location. Two it would have alerted any guest nearby the other end of the conversation what was going on and cause panic. There was absolutely no reason for him to keep two waying back and forth. No matter what this guy says some people have to look more into it to fit their idea. I would suggest to all of you that want to and his actions to walk in his shoes. Have you ever had someone open fire on you when you least expected it? Prob not. Shock, fear and injured all play into confusion in the heat of the moment. And people wonder why he wants to stay hidden. No matter what he says people want to blame him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He did call in the shooting...he never said he didn&#39;t. He may not have mentioned he was hit. He called for help so help was on the way. Unless any of you have been in that situation...please sit down. You are taking a partial statement and listing it as a whole just for internet points. HE DID RADIO IN THAT THERE WAS A MAN OPENING FIRE.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose we will probably never know the answer to that question so it is speculation on my part. I watched the event from afar (Scotland) and within an hour of the rolling news coverage I had the &quot;something isn&#39;t right here&quot; feeling.  As time has past it seems like there is less information being released now than there was within the early few hours of the incident.  It also doesn&#39;t help that there is so many conflicting official narritaves by police. I now have a &quot;something definitely isn&#39;t right&quot; feeling. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If any part of it is staged, then I legally have the right to assume the entire affair is a complete fraud. This is the legal principle of &quot;fraud vitiates everything.&quot;</p>

<p>If any part of it is staged, it likely all is staged. Mixing actors or agents in with real victims when real bullets are flying is a logistic impossibility. </p>
