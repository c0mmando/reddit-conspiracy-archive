    <div class="md"><p>Yup.  Pretty much all of Clinton&#39;s, Bush&#39;s, and Obama&#39;s executive orders reflect future NAU policy and law.  It was designed to turn the USA into the EU model.  </p>

<p>Knowing the Patriot Act in and out is what frightens me.  Literally will supersede all jurisdiction and the last shreds of sovereignty we have.  That... And the buzz around crypto currency.  I could easily see the Amero being used as an out for the failing petrodollar system, and simultaneously competing against foreign currencies and bitcoin at the same time.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No worries,</p>

<p>There was a treaty called the SPP (Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America), which a lot of people back in the 2000&#39;s had heard rumors it would lead to a union between US, Mexico and Canada.  During the 2008 election it was rather a big deal, just like the TPP was during this last.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Y30k3nkk54">Ron Paul talking about during the debates</a>.  This was also associated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAFTA_superhighway">NAFTA super highway</a>, which Paul mentions in that video.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3E4s4JTzsY">Lou Dobbs also use to cover it all the time back during this time</a>.  This also fed into the Amero, which would be a <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/the-amero-conspiracy-1345011">new currency for all three countries</a>.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Straight answers are not readily available, it seems!  You&#39;re unaware of the term cuz your knowledge base has moved beyond it, and the NAU is a component of the larger globalist/NWO agenda of no state borders (etc), of which your comfort level is prolly high enough to not warrant diving into details like NAU.</p>

<p>The NAU is one of (seven iirc) regions that will function as a state-like entity, without being a state centered around a specific race or creed or anything.  These seven regions are the next step en route to the one world gov&#39;t and religion.</p>
