       I agree, I wonder if there is anything in public records about what security company they used, and if we are able to get a hold of them. I'll look around and see if I can find anything.

       Cool, I've been looking into it a bit, they do manufacture networked alarm systems for hotels, but there don't seem to be too many vendors. Usually places log events (card swipes, card ID, times, etc) on the reader itself, and if something happens they go to the door to read the event log.

       I've worked with systems that require card access. Our system would let us know anytime a door was locked, unlocked, opened, closed, or held open. It would even inform us if a door was forced open where card access was required.

       Good idea, it could be arranged through fiver.com. They must be on extremely high alert though, I wouldn't want to be wrong about this and get someone hassled or possibly hurt, or waste security's resources. That experiment wouldn't exactly be decisive either, they might just not respond for other reasons.

       There were two fire exit doors

      <p>
       The inner door (the one closest to the actual stairs) was braced shut from the hallway side of the door.  The outer door (that opens directly into the hallway) wasn't braced shut.  The theory is that Paddock had the outer door propped open while he put the brace on the inner door.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, as others have pointed out, Campos said he was actually going to check on an open door alarm for one of the guest rooms.

       I feel like they are being deliberately vague regarding why Jesus was there in the first place. It first went from smoke detector to open door alarm, but we have not gotten a definitive answer on what door. Probably because it never happened.

       It was never smoke detector. That came from a self-claimed eyewitness speaking to CNN. The LVMPD refuted the smoke alarm rumor when they were asked about it in one of the first press conferences.

       But they also stated in the beginning that it was a door alarm from a suite  few rooms away at first which made no sense.

       That's the story they stuck to, that it was a guest room near Paddock's, but unless it can be proven that might be a gaping hole in the story. If there are no sensors on the doors, that is a lot harder to spin than the timeline. We would have caught them in a lie.

       There would be a sensor on a stairwell door. There is a reason why they are heavy and have that closing assist damper on them. They would be part of a system that controls air flow to the common corridors keeps all stairwells at a higher air pressure. There would be a physical annunciator panel for the fire dept to read but the main security desk would have all the sensors in the system on a computer graphic interface. The room doors would probably be on the security and card key system. Most likely independent of the fire and smoke detection system.

       Good info, and that makes sense that both the fire dept. and secuity would have access to those sensors, but they have reported that Campos was responding to a sensor tripped by a guest doorway, not the fire exit so I'm still wondering what type of sensor they have for guest rooms. Most hotels log card swipe data on the lock itself, they usually are not networked.

       They would see an open door on their display so alarm kind of means silent unless it is the kind that is right on the door like a fire door on a secure floor.
Security makes hourly rounds 24/7 of all fire doors to physically ensure their operation and status. Campos might have been doing this but I wouldn't have expected him to be so fat.lol. Usually the security guy carries a device that reads a bar code which documents his rounds with timestamps. Maybe a little different now .

       If that was the case, It seems like they would have gone with the simplest narrative: "He was on a routine patrol, found a barricaded fire door and proceeded to investigate." I still think it's worth it to find out whether or not the guest doors are networked because:
      </p>
      <p>
       A. It's a hole in the story that they can't retroactively cover up.
      </p>
      <p>
       B. It would be relatively easy info to get.
      </p>
      <p>
       C. It might imply that other means were used to dispatch Campos to that location that Mandalay Bay doesn't want to reveal to the public, some other form of guest monitoring ... maybe in the shooter's room? Shooting is an incredibly common tourist attraction in Vegas, security is probably used to seeing weapons in rooms, but maybe they keep tabs on those people and when Paddock started to act more suspicious than the average gun owner, they went to check it out.

       Their is some sophisticate stuff installed. While most homes have infrared sensors some buildings would use three different sensors-- motion, temperature and sound. And this was years ago so as far as security systems go I am probably behind in my knowledge. Fire systems are probably of the same tech as when I worked with them.

       I think that Mandalay Bay would have a very advanced state of security system. It would not surprise me if they did not sense a pressure drop in 'Paddock's room when he or the shooters broke out the windows.

       That is very possible, I remember hearing that they sometimes screw with the air pressure and oxygen  levels in casinos to keep people gambling, so it would make sense that the system would be very sophisticated and controllable. Maybe the casino wanted to conceal that info because it's kind of a dirty trick.

       The best info I've seen (sorry, no sources at hand) say it wasn't an "alarm" per the common definition. The claim was that the hotel uses a system called HotSOS that does, in fact, have a door monitor (not "alarm") on every room. The system is meant to help them manage such a large number of rooms by coordinating room service for when you're actually out of the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       One feature of the system, beyond monitoring when you've left, is that it will alert the front desk if a door is ajar for more than a few minutes. It can send alerts through text message or voice, email etc.

       What we should look into is how Paddock hear the door close after he was shooting an automatic firearm inside?  He wouldn't hear shit either 1) His ears would be ringing or 2) He's wearing ear protection and still can't hear shit.

       Good info, and that makes sense that both the fire dept. and secuity would have access to those sensors, but they have reported that Campos was responding to a sensor tripped by a guest doorway, not the fire exit so I'm still wondering what type of sensor they have for guest rooms. Most hotels log card swipe data on the lock itself, they usually are not networked.
