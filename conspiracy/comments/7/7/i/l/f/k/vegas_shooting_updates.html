How have the FBI, Police, etc. the probably 50 different groups of people working on this case still have no motive or hints at all? and the way its being put out of the news like it never happened is scary too, like they just want people to forget about it. its been like almost 2 or 3 weeks i think, thats a decent amount of time. seems sketchy to me...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing they have officially released has been consistent to warrant accepting it as truth. The leaked photos create more questions than answers. The witness videos have helped create questions as to more than 1 gunman, helicopters and actors playing out a scene. No security footage has been  shown paddock out and about as they have  told us. In a city with the best surveillance systems around and still not one single  frame of footage. Was he never seen alone ever so they can support their lone gunman narrative. </p>

<p>We have a sheriff who keeps tripping over his words, changing the time line they are trying to feed us. A security guard who disappears and then gives a performance on the ellen show. They added in a maintenance guy over week later. Now we added a woman told to go back into her room. </p>

<p>We have an Australian guy who said HE was in room 32-134 the second room they say paddock was using to fire from. Someone is lying here. Heck they didnt even get the dates he checked in right for a few days. </p>

<p>We have a 64 year old man carrying up over 20 rifles and 1000&#39;s of rounds of ammo by himself to a suite through a casino with no one noticing anything strange. No history of violence nor mental illness actually very little history at all. A girlfriend who was in the Philippines where paddock wired 100k to. She also has dropped off the face of the earth. </p>

<p>We have police scanner recordings that do not match the &quot;narrative&quot; as the sheriff now calls it. </p>

<p>Multiple witnesses reporting multiple shooters, video and sound  evidence to support that. No ballistics reports on the location or the victims. No account of shell casings in the hotel room to match the amount of shots heard on videos.</p>

<p>We have mgm execs and soros making strange  bets with stocks against mgm in the weeks leading upto this event. They all.profited from this disaster.</p>

<p>I am sure i have missed some other suspicious activity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I thought it was fishy the night of. I got an alert on my phone from the police scanner app and i listened in on it for bout an hour. Then all of a sudden the stream died out, which could have been purposely i guess so that more suspects couldnt listen in. But during that same time, browsing social media and sites like reddit, there were tons of posts from people in Vegas with pics and videos just pouring into the internet. But as soon as the scanner died, new pictures and videos stopped coming in, there were no live streams, and every single news channel had the exact same info, same pictures, same videos, etc. From then on out it has seemed completely controlled, they were keeping it all under wraps so that people could only know what the police or media wanted them to know. Even the next morning half of the sites i checked previously blocked videos and photos from viewing on their sites. It has has been a coverup from an hour into the event.</p>

<p>It was most likely a crisis simulation staged by a company similar to this this one:  <a href="http://www.crisis-solutions.com/">http://www.crisis-solutions.com/</a></p>
