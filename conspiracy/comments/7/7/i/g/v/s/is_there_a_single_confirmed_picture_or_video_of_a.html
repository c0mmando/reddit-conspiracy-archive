       The one with his blood oozing out of the top of his head? I think it is safe to assume there is a bullet hole behind all the coagulated blood... that's the thing with bullet holes in people... blood comes out then ya cant see the hole. It's not the same as shooting a coffee can with yer pappy's .22.

       Im sure there are literally dozens of pictures where the bullet hole is visible... they just haven't been leaked to the public... I really doubt this guy pulled a "Saw" and laid there playing dead until the cops were looking the other way and then ran out of the room.

       The idea is not that he ran away after playing dead, but that the photos were staged, and he didn't die, or was never even there in the first place.

       I don't think anything was staged... I think that is him and he is dead... I dunno if he was the one that shot him... But I think he's dead and dissected by now.

       Oh... for me that picture of him flat on his back with his insides spilling out is convincing enough that someone died. Cause if yer gonna be that skeptical about the world anything you see online could possibly been faked or photoshopped... so yer really can't believe in ANYTHING unless ya see it with your own eye. You can't even prove that Las Vegas actually exists without going there for yourself... right? Right.

       You would just hand wave it away as faked... cause someone in this thread already showed you the dude with a hit to the dome... and you called BS on the video.  Lets get to the real conspiracy... give me positive proof that Las Vegas actually exists! You can't... cause you are prolly part of the cover up.

       Get on my level... stop being a sheep... the conspiracy goes much deeper than a faked shooting... the whole city is faked! It's not real... show me evidence that it exists. You can't. So either show me proof that Las Vegas actually exists or shut the fuck up.

       I'm not trolling... but I can see how it would look like that to someone who hasn't been redpilled. It's simple... you show me proof that Las Vegas exists first... and then we can get working on on the shooting. First things first... duh. Why bother with the shooting if we don't even know if the city is really real?

       There was blood and death all about. There are never "bullet holes", ever, that's movie bullshit. Instead, you see blood soaked shirts, lifeless eyes, and pale bodies. Carnage is all that is left. You would only find bullet holes if you stripped the bodies and cleaned them of blood. If you had the opportunity to watch the video you would likely agree with me that those people were definitely, 100% dead. It is an image seared into my brain. I wish it was still up, so that you could see it and make the judgement for yourself.

       Thanks for the link. This is the best footage I've seen so far, but I can't see any visible wounds there. Let me know if I missed anything.

       I know this sounds horrible to someone who isn't familiar with the history of the completely faked attacks that they've done before.

       had mass carnage but it was clearly faked. Same with Sandy Hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen too many dead bodies to count, and those people don't look dead to me. They look like they are alive and covered in fake blood.

       When you say faked, do you mean False Flag, or hoax? This was definitely not a hoax. It may have been a false flag, but it happened. The logistics of faking an event involving 22,000 people and countless more up the strip, plus media and investigator coverage is beyond the scope of possible. Now, rather than assuming guilty and forcing them to prove innocence, why don't you look at it logically?

       How would even the government be able to stage an event involving over 22,000 people? How do you get that many to go along with It? An elementary school no one has ever heard of is possible (though, that's a bit of a reach). 22,000+ people and not one of them has said it was a hoax or it didn't happen. Not one. Nobody has broken silence. Even if they signed a NDA, I'm sure one of them somehwere told their spouse, friend, parent, someone. And yet nobody has spoken up. That doesn't seem strange to You? I know there's something fucky going on with this case, no doubt. But to jump to conclusions like this, with out evidence, or even a reasonable line of thinking is irresponsible. All you're doing is making yourself look dumb, and the rest of the people who are actually trying to figure out what happened, look bad.

       This Is the exact reason why people don't take "Conspiracy Theories" seriously. They hear some dumb rant and unfortunately the hollow drum is the loudest. I would suggest doing more research and practicing critical thinking, and for the love of god, STOP listening to Alex Jones. He's the worst of all. Be better.

       Oh no, dissenting opinions! I'm not going to argue with you and I'll tell the mods the same thing, provide evidence for your claim. Currently there are videos that show people wounded. Until they're proved to be fake, they're the only evidence from that night. Therefore, the best we've got. If you can show me someone who was there, and witnessed, first hand, the whole "hoax" take place, I'll gladly change my opinion, but until then, you have no ground to stand on. Also, "I messaged the mods..." Ha

       I told you it wasn't 100% and it's possible it could be faked, but it's the only evidence we currently have. You're hunting a ghost. You want a video of a crisis actor getting up and walking away after someone yells cut. If such a video ever existed, it would be wiped before it saw the light of day. If it was a hoax, the only video you saw would be controlled. You're looking for something that does. Not. Exist.

       Depends on the caliber of bullet, speed of the bullet, bullet composition, and angle of impact. Not all bullet holes are created equal.

       Paddock was supposedly using 5.56 and 7.62 NATO, which produce wounds that are much worse than the ones in that video. And so far, that video is the only image I have seen of an actual wound.

       That’s not the point i was arguing. My point was about the comparison of the 2 bullet holes looking different because they were fired into 2 different targets with 2 different densities.
      </p>
      <p>
       A characteristic of the 5.56 ball round is that it can ricochet off bone to cause maximum internal damage, so i wouldn’t be surprised to learn that a shot ricocheted off a skull.
      </p>
      <p>
       A bullet fired into the meaty flesh of a human (or deer) will create much more damage due to trauma of the surrounding soft tissue on impact. There isn’t much soft tissue to impact in the head unless it pierces the skull and enters the brain.

       Don't take this the wrong way, I also believe it was setup. I do believe people died, however. I had seen the one video (already posted, and on mobile). You have to be shooting real bullets to get the ricochet sounds from the videos.

       Actually, the whole Russia thing makes WAY more sense to me than a false flag shooting in Las Vegas killing 58 and injuring almost 500.
      </p>
      <p>
       For such a thing to happen you have to ignore lots of obvious facts. Real people died there and people like you are allowed to mock them all from the comfort of your keyboard wherever that may be located.
      </p>
      <p>
       We may not be as free as we once were and maybe America had a hand in toppling the Soviet Union. If war breaks out here, I'll be blaming Russia. Vladimir spent decades plotting revenge. That's becoming more and more obvious as more details are revealed.

       Have you ever taken a look at the preparation that goes into making TV and movies? Stuff like that doesn't just appear out of thin air.

       Maybe David Copperfield was in on it.

       How credible is your source?
      </p>
      <p>
       It was widely reported that the area hospitals were being pushed past capacity. They even brought in medical personnel from outside to handle the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to think that they didn't treat any of the victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you think that the people who worked at the hospitals would have noticed that there was a discrepancy between what was being reported if there really weren't any victims?

       Sometimes you just gotta think for yourself.

       No clue, saw a report on Reddit but didn't save link. I wasn't there in Vegas so I have no clue how real or fake this whole event was/is. All I can say is that there is an overwhelming amount of evidence that has been presented that is laughable at best and not convincing to me and many others.

       Did you actually try Google?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're being awfully persistent about photos. Not that I feel like you actually want to find any. You've obviously made up your mind and you are only trying in a suspiciously lawyerly way of making a point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be that people were just too freaked out to pose for gunshot selfies as they were running from a madman with a gun and seeking medical attention? Na it's gotta be all fake. That's your narrative?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I did actually use Google and found several pictures of gunshots that were already treated and bandaged. I suppose that's just not good enough for you is it?

       You didn't answer my question.  When would someone take a close up of a gun shot wound?

      <p>
       If you believe no one died, are you going to post a picture of one of the people "killed" with proof they are alive after the attack?  I haven't been able to find one of those.

      <p>
       If you are SERIOUSLY questioning if people were ACTUALLY shot, come to Vegas. I will give you my phone number and I will personally introduce you to DOZENS of people who deal with gun shot victims regularly, AND TRANSPORTED them to the hospital that night.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will introduce you to people who cared for living humans with holes in there chest, head, arms, legs and watched them die In hospital beds
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I was no there that night. But I can tell you NOBODY is going to give you a picture of a bullet hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are seriously skeptical of the injuries, grow some balls and book a flight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I believe some shady sh*t is being covered up? Of course!

       Lots of fake victims (the twins etc..), grouping so tight magic bullets would have been needed (several triple taps from 450M), no muzzle flash.  Again, no muzzle flash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing notably missing is the crack from the crack/bang.  I didn't hear it once.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, there are no pictures of any bullet wounds that I have seen.  Not a single victim that looks real to me.

      <p>
       No muzzle flash.
No crack/bang.
No pictures of wounds.

       No live rounds were fired at Las Vegas.  Obviously.

       Thanks for the link. This is the best footage I've seen so far, but I can't see any visible wounds there. Let me know if I missed anything.

       I know this sounds horrible to someone who isn't familiar with the history of the completely faked attacks that they've done before.

       had mass carnage but it was clearly faked. Same with Sandy Hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen too many dead bodies to count, and those people don't look dead to me. They look like they are alive and covered in fake blood.
