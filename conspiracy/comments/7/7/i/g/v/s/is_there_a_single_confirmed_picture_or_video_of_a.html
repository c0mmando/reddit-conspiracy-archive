    <div class="md"><p>There was blood and death all about. There are never &quot;bullet holes&quot;, ever, that&#39;s movie bullshit. Instead, you see blood soaked shirts, lifeless eyes, and pale bodies. Carnage is all that is left. You would only find bullet holes if you stripped the bodies and cleaned them of blood. If you had the opportunity to watch the video you would likely agree with me that those people were definitely, 100% dead. It is an image seared into my brain. I wish it was still up, so that you could see it and make the judgement for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link. This is the best footage I&#39;ve seen so far, but I can&#39;t see any visible wounds there. Let me know if I missed anything.</p>

<p>I know this sounds horrible to someone who isn&#39;t familiar with the history of the completely faked attacks that they&#39;ve done before. <a href="https://truthandshadows.wordpress.com/2013/05/08/false-flag-theatre-boston-bombing-involves-clearly-staged-carnage/">Boston</a> had mass carnage but it was clearly faked. Same with Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen too many dead bodies to count, and those people don&#39;t look dead to me. They look like they are alive and covered in fake blood.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you say faked, do you mean False Flag, or hoax? This was definitely not a hoax. It may have been a false flag, but it happened. The logistics of faking an event involving 22,000 people and countless more up the strip, plus media and investigator coverage is beyond the scope of possible. Now, rather than assuming guilty and forcing them to prove innocence, why don&#39;t you look at it logically? </p>

<p>How would even the government be able to stage an event involving over 22,000 people? How do you get that many to go along with It? An elementary school no one has ever heard of is possible (though, that&#39;s a bit of a reach). 22,000+ people and not one of them has said it was a hoax or it didn&#39;t happen. Not one. Nobody has broken silence. Even if they signed a NDA, I&#39;m sure one of them somehwere told their spouse, friend, parent, someone. And yet nobody has spoken up. That doesn&#39;t seem strange to You? I know there&#39;s something fucky going on with this case, no doubt. But to jump to conclusions like this, with out evidence, or even a reasonable line of thinking is irresponsible. All you&#39;re doing is making yourself look dumb, and the rest of the people who are actually trying to figure out what happened, look bad.</p>

<p>This Is the exact reason why people don&#39;t take &quot;Conspiracy Theories&quot; seriously. They hear some dumb rant and unfortunately the hollow drum is the loudest. I would suggest doing more research and practicing critical thinking, and for the love of god, STOP listening to Alex Jones. He&#39;s the worst of all. Be better. </p>

<p>I told you it wasn&#39;t 100% and it&#39;s possible it could be faked, but it&#39;s the only evidence we currently have. You&#39;re hunting a ghost. You want a video of a crisis actor getting up and walking away after someone yells cut. If such a video ever existed, it would be wiped before it saw the light of day. If it was a hoax, the only video you saw would be controlled. You&#39;re looking for something that does. Not. Exist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s not the point i was arguing. My point was about the comparison of the 2 bullet holes looking different because they were fired into 2 different targets with 2 different densities.</p>

<p>A characteristic of the 5.56 ball round is that it can ricochet off bone to cause maximum internal damage, so i wouldn’t be surprised to learn that a shot ricocheted off a skull.</p>

<p>A bullet fired into the meaty flesh of a human (or deer) will create much more damage due to trauma of the surrounding soft tissue on impact. There isn’t much soft tissue to impact in the head unless it pierces the skull and enters the brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, the whole Russia thing makes WAY more sense to me than a false flag shooting in Las Vegas killing 58 and injuring almost 500.</p>

<p>For such a thing to happen you have to ignore lots of obvious facts. Real people died there and people like you are allowed to mock them all from the comfort of your keyboard wherever that may be located.</p>

<p>We may not be as free as we once were and maybe America had a hand in toppling the Soviet Union. If war breaks out here, I&#39;ll be blaming Russia. Vladimir spent decades plotting revenge. That&#39;s becoming more and more obvious as more details are revealed.</p>

<p>Could it be that people were just too freaked out to pose for gunshot selfies as they were running from a madman with a gun and seeking medical attention? Na it&#39;s gotta be all fake. That&#39;s your narrative?</p>

<p>Well, I did actually use Google and found several pictures of gunshots that were already treated and bandaged. I suppose that&#39;s just not good enough for you is it?</p>

<p>Autopsies?</p>

<p>Even something like a facebook page with a long history showing they are a real person?</p>

<p>I have yet to see any evidence that people were wounded or died in this so-called massacre.</p>

<p>EMT working in Las Vegas here. </p>

<p>If you are SERIOUSLY questioning if people were ACTUALLY shot, come to Vegas. I will give you my phone number and I will personally introduce you to DOZENS of people who deal with gun shot victims regularly, AND TRANSPORTED them to the hospital that night.</p>

<p>I will introduce you to people who cared for living humans with holes in there chest, head, arms, legs and watched them die In hospital beds</p>

<p>No, I was no there that night. But I can tell you NOBODY is going to give you a picture of a bullet hole. </p>

<p>If you are seriously skeptical of the injuries, grow some balls and book a flight. </p>

<p>Do I believe some shady sh*t is being covered up? Of course!  </p>

<p>People died from bullets. End of story. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lots of fake victims (the twins etc..), grouping so tight magic bullets would have been needed (several triple taps from 450M), no muzzle flash.  Again, no muzzle flash.  </p>

<p>Another thing notably missing is the crack from the crack/bang.  I didn&#39;t hear it once.</p>

<p>And no, there are no pictures of any bullet wounds that I have seen.  Not a single victim that looks real to me.</p>

<p>No muzzle flash.
No crack/bang.
No pictures of wounds.</p>

<p>No live rounds were fired at Las Vegas.  Obviously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the link. This is the best footage I&#39;ve seen so far, but I can&#39;t see any visible wounds there. Let me know if I missed anything.</p>

<p>I know this sounds horrible to someone who isn&#39;t familiar with the history of the completely faked attacks that they&#39;ve done before. <a href="https://truthandshadows.wordpress.com/2013/05/08/false-flag-theatre-boston-bombing-involves-clearly-staged-carnage/">Boston</a> had mass carnage but it was clearly faked. Same with Sandy Hook.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen too many dead bodies to count, and those people don&#39;t look dead to me. They look like they are alive and covered in fake blood.</p>
