       I know this sub likes to imagine nefarious organizations with extremely tight SecOps finishing missions which remain secret for all time, but in my experience any operation with more than a couple moving parts quickly devolves into a long series of fuckups. This is exactly what I think happened recently in Las Vegas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stephen Paddock was recruited by a terrorist organization to sell them firearms. He got an offer too good to refuse to make some quick cash with an under the table deal. He probably had no idea who it was and didn't care. Having never done this sort of thing before, he totally bungled it. First, he got himself killed. Second, there is video of him carrying guns in, parking a van filled with explosives, meeting with known terrorists, taking cash, everything. It's just a long stream of him doing the whole thing, in a crowded casino, probably half drunk, and no one gave a shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Mandalay Bay completely missed all of this. They're watching for cheats and card counters. They don't really give a fuck what luggage people are coming in with, or who they're hanging out with if they don't fit the profile of people who are going to take their money. Paddock has a reputation as someone who is there to spend a boatload of cash, so they don't really pay him any mind, all resources are focused elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the terrorist(s?) shot Paddock and started shooting at the concert below, they had no idea what they were doing. They were probably recently recruited and had never handled guns before. They thought they could shoot a tank of jet fuel and make it explode. They didn't know how to reload their guns so there are long gaps where they're trying to get the old magazine out and a new one back in. They burned their hands on the hot guns, they tripped over things, it was basically Abbott and Costello in that suite. But the key is, they got away. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       The hotel security and then the police force completely screwed the pooch. Jesus Campos got lucky that the terrorist couldn't shoot worth a damn, and only got hit in the leg. But then he got scared, or who knows what happened, but he failed to radio in his location. Maybe he saw the real shooters get away. The police couldn't figure out what floor he was on, they couldn't figure out what room Paddock was in. They showed up with the wrong gear, and who knows what other kind of fuckups there were. This is probably also on video.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this will ever come out because it would be 1) a massive stain on the casino for not catching it before it happened, 2) a clusterfuck for the police force that completely failed to respond quickly and adequately, 3) a huge win for the terrorist who successfully pulled it off and got away only because the good guys screwed up even worse than they did. It would also probably mean huge lawsuits for everyone involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also imagine that the whole Weinstein thing came out when it did because it bumped Vegas out of the news ASAP. It's the entertainment industry, I'm sure they have all sorts of stuff like this saved up for when they need to get something out of the headlines. But that's a whole other conspiracy.

       Ok here is my conspiracy. The FBI had been grooming Paddock. Feeding into some anti government ideas he may have had. Helping him get weapons and planning this big horrible terroristic act. They thought he was under their complete control. The plan was to arrest him before anything happened. But! Something went wrong. Someone messed up. And shit hit the fan. So now we have the FBI covering their ass. We know these types of operations are happening continually.

       I would buy this, but why a 64-year-old? They could have easily found some in-shape 19-30 yr old who would make a much more believable terrorist. Isn't every other terrorist they have set up much younger?

       Good stuff. Probably mostly true.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory about the timing is somewhat inline with yours, except my theory is Weinstein (or someone close to him) knew he was about to be exposed, so this false flag happened to take focus off him.  Thankfully, it didn't work.

       The only reason for Campos behavior / body language on Ellen is he was in on it, or witnessed something far worse than what happened to him "officially". Perhaps he was confronted by several masked armed men who suggested if he kept his mouth shut he'd be considered a hero.

       Or he screwed up and didn't call the shooting in early enough and blames himself for all the death and destruction that ensued, but he can't tell anyone about it because it will open MGM up to billions of dollars worth of lawsuits, so he has to play the role of the hero while knowing he's not.

       Well, if we believe someone shot him then they
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       trying to kill him, they just missed. Maybe he wasn't supposed to survive. He'll probably end up dead or missing again soon enough.

       Yeah I mean I've waited since the incident to say anything about it, and I mean, I think some of the conspiracies are far fetched. Not to say shady shit in terms of investing is and had occurred, but, it is still possible this a nut job.

       Now this wasn't a drug deal but I'm sure arms dealers would live by the same rules. Just absurd he'd do it on the Vegas Strip... unless it was a botched FBI sting.

       There was no shooter. There were actors there. Some to lead the stampede and get it started, cause panic. Some pretending to be shot. EMT's going and "saving".  The most I'm willing to believe as far as shooters is, someone shot some legs to put a few people in to the hospital. Probably had a few "gun men" in the crowd. This is Sandy Hook 2.0. They don't give a shit what you believe as long as you believe people died. That way there is fear. They are pushing all these conspiracy theories. You all still believe people died. It's just so fucking stupid cuz everything down to a T is on camera and somehow this made up guy, they don't know who was in his room, they don't know anything. When I saw his "brother" talk I knew in my heart something was wrong. Also I believe someone pointed out a different nose in the same picture of him. I believe they photoshopped a doll around the image of the brother.  Some of the photographs are from the "drills" before the day(s) of the concert. There's even those actors tents and ambulances parked beside them not doing anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for my theory on the actors, they probably are all from the UN and that's why they all speak English too. Don't these people have their own towns and shit? Nobody knows them except them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's some sources that help shape my theory.

       Should really watch them and see also how the gun shots are possible and how it sounded like "multiple" shooters.

       It was all a crime of opportunity? There just happened to be a concert with 22,000 people going on below and Paddock just happened to have rented a room with perfect sight lines? I donno, seems more planned out than a spur of the moment kind of thing.
