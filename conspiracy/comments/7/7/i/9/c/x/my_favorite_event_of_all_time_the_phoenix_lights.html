       Weeell, there is a story I once read from a channeled personality who is dead and he got to talking, and this is what he said:
      </p>
      <p>
       The northern lights are a phenomenon, and multidimensional energy exchanges with the energy of this plane.  Within the area within the earths electromagnetic field there are locations in which there is a constant attraction and repulsion. Within those points energy is being exchanged. Earth attracts other things, and other things attract earth. So there is relationship not quite physical that is occurring. It's being translated into what we see. But there is also information being exchanged. Some times the objective appearance isn't just variation in light, it can also occur in the pattern within a crop circle, which is them pressed into a field.  There are other types of exchanges I could talk more about, that have to do with actual objects and landscapes.

       In a manner of speaking, yes. There are different types. Different places being exchanged. All over the earth. And in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Phoenix lays along a certain pathway along the plane. The pathway is one of the original energetic frameworks for this plane. It's like a root soaking up water, figuratively speaking.

       There are vortexes or wormholes, whatever you want to call them, but the Phoenix lights were actually a UFO craft. You mention channeling, I wonder if you've ever heard of I believe bashar talking about the Phoenix lights.
      </p>
      <p>
       He mentioned that it was indeed a UFO craft operated by a friendly service to others ET civilization that wants to help "wake us up"
      </p>
      <p>
       Accumulation and warming up to the idea of such truths existing is what they are working towards, but they can't just come out of the closet right away and land their craft. They start by small sightings here and there, and gently nudge civilizations awake to that possibility, instead of forcing it and shocking everyone by coming out right away. I say civilizations because there are many, many, forms of life throughout the cosmos and we aren't the only ones that are awakening and won't be the last or the first.

       My parents are super religious. Like we moved back to Texas from Scottsdale because they didn't want me to go to ASU "with the hippies."
      </p>
      <p>
       That night, we saw the flying V formation but it was too big to be an airplane. We all stood outside trying to figure out how the lights were so bright and close to the city. My brother and I were kids. We thought they were UFOs. My parents scoffed and said it was probably military training because there was a base a town over.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never knew it was a thing that everyone saw and that was unexplainable until I became an adult.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of satisfying to know we experienced something that no one knows what happened.

       Even though I was a child, 8, I still maintain UFO. It was so inconsistent with any plane or aircraft. Also, the biggest thing to me was how low the lights were. They were so low, aircraft should not legally be that low and you couldn't see the top if it was aircraft. If it was human made, you should have been able to see the top of whatever it was. They were more like orbs. Flying perfectly equidistant from each other.

       Not really that interesting but I saw them for about a minute anyways! Was about 18 years old and living in Avondale outside of Phoenix. I was laying in bed reading. My bed was beside a window where I could see the night sky. I looked up saw the big orbs of light and when I ran outside to see what they were and it was gone.

       My best guess is that it was an experimental government craft, and they flew it over the city to gauge public reaction in order to get a sense of what they could get away with.

       It was a service to others ET civilization tasked with helping awakening other civilizations. It's claimed it was the Essessani, a highly conscious race operating on a higher dimension of frequency than ours. They are here at this time and have been helping us wake up to these truths.

       One story I found pretty interesting was the people who seen it and did not remember it.There were groups of people who pulled over watched it got back in their car like nothing happened.Even Kurt Russel came out and said he saw it and reported it while he was flying his plane with his son.He forgot all about until many years later when Goldie Hawn was watching a documentary about it and it all came back to him.
