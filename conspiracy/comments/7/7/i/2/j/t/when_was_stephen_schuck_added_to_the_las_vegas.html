<p>They also indicated in that interview that &quot;we&#39;ve heard this audio recording, now. First of all, how did you remain so calm?&quot; Does anyone have a link to the audio they are referring to (quote appears at 2:19 of the linked Today interview)?</p>

<p>Prior to this interview, I can&#39;t seem to find any reference to Schuck. There are references to Campos, so why was Schuck not mentioned at the time? He seems to be the only factor corroborating Jesus&#39; gunshot wound. </p>

<p>Campos&#39; name first showed up as early as October 5th. Was Schuck added in after the fact to strengthen their story? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74dtrk/lets_talk_about_the_security_guard_jesus_campos/">There&#39;s still the question of whether they were called up there because the door was stuck open, or the door was stuck shut.</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>The &quot;security guard&quot; was mentioned in the story/timeline as early as October 2. </p>

<p>The LVMPD hailed him a hero at their 10/4 afternoon press conference but didn&#39;t share his name. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure who was the first to name Jesus Campos in the media, but the first time he was mentioned in here was in a post linking to a Daily Beast article published on October 4th at 4:41pm. </p>

<p>The LVMPD confirmed his name at the 11/6 press conference. </p>

<p>The maintenance worker was brought into the narrative at the 11/9 press conference, when authorities changed the timeline to reflect Campos being shot before rather than after the crowd shooting. </p>

<p>The undersheriff reiterated the maintenance worker story on a 10/10 radio interview. </p>

<p>On 10/11, the maintenance worker was then named and appeared on Yhe Today Show. The audio MGM released to accompany his appearance is here: <a href="https://youtu.be/QGQC5iogX1k">https://youtu.be/QGQC5iogX1k</a></p>

<p>On the 10/1 police scanner audio, there&#39;s a point where officers in the 32nd floor mention waiting for a maintenance worker to get back with the elevator keys. So I guess that&#39;s technically his first mention, although unclear when he actually arrived. </p>

<p>We still have no audio of Jesus radioing in &quot;Shots fired!&quot; as he claimed to on <em>Ellen</em> yesterday. </p>

<p>This is all off the top of my head. I have supporting links and quotes for everything here, but am on my phone so no easy way to access and embed. If you want the source links, let me know and I&#39;ll add later when I have my laptop. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Jesus Campos was dispatched to the 32nd floor in response to an open door alarm. En route to the door alarm, he discovered the jammed stairwell/fire door. </p>

<p>Stephen Schuck was then dispatched to the 32nd floor to inspect the jammed/barricaded fire door. </p>
