    <div class="md"><p>I wish people could see and understand what&#39;s going on. I feel really sad, so many people just can&#39;t see what&#39;s happening. I don&#39;t blame any of them, they are totally manipulated, and I was one of them. Probably the only reason I&#39;m not still a liberal who thought Clinton would be much safer than Trump as president is because I got sick and had to spend a lot of time home, which allowed me to do a lot of research online, fact checking all news articles myself, and because I&#39;d been so perplexed by people loving Trump so much that I made a concerted effort to get out of my echo chamber on social media.</p>

<p>So I can understand how people remain so brainwashed, I wish I knew a good way to help break people out of it, but unfortunately I can&#39;t even talk about this stuff to my own gf, who will just fly into a rage if I so much as question anything the MSM says. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember when Trump started gaining traction in the election. I didn&#39;t know much about him, but there was a couple posts floating around Reddit at the time, one of Trump and one of Hillary, both of which had them laughing at some point. Hillary sounded like a cackling, robotic sociopath and Trump sounded like an actual human being. For all his perceived faults, the fact he can still convince me he maybe hasn&#39;t sold his soul goes a long way. After all the scandals and condescending, hypocritical accusations, the fake outrage, labeling everybody who wasn&#39;t &quot;with her&quot; a mysoginistic Nazi including a green cartoon frog created by a Latino dude from Frisco of all places</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My question is why? Why is it so important that you inform them, when officially it&#39;s been covered by multiple news sources? </p>

<p>Why is it if there&#39;s already two posts that have successfully been made, there needs to be a third?</p>

<p>I know r/news has a rule about not posting duplicate content, which doesn&#39;t mean an exact article, it means the news that the article presents.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s 7 news sources that cover the same thing, all 7 don&#39;t need to be posted so they? If someone is interested in learning more, can&#39;t they just Google after seeing one of the sources?</p>

<p>My point, why would you be spending <em>&quot;all night&quot;</em> trying to post something that&#39;s several days old? Nothing new has been posted, besides other news sources posting the same thing with their opinion being the main difference..?</p>

<p>And why did you make this post, when there&#39;s been dozens of people making posts here complaining about the same thing?</p>

I saw that trump has already killed more civilains then obama did in 8 year and it makes me wonder how many of them did we radicalize in the process so I&#39;m not sure this is the apporach I would like. Mix that with increases in troop deployment to there and our soldiers now getting killed in chad.

<p>Just because Justin can recite a fairly simple concept and clearly spoken, does not mean his intent is good. Just because someone is apparently intellectually superior, does not mean their vision is a good one or even that they are a good leader.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s statement is a clear faux pas and fumbled like many things, but in essence it&#39;s still true. Uranium is used for some very bad things, like....classified weapons I just recently learned about....you know some very bad things.</p>

I judge people on they way they speak and think it&#39;s a accurate reflection of the way they think and how intelligent they are. If a person can&#39;t articulate what they are trying to express my view is they have trouble understanding the substance of what they are talking about. I do agree something can be high-minded and evil. The Devil wields both the intellectual and the imbecile will equal force.</p>

<p>When given the choice between someone who can speak well vs someone who can&#39;t all other things equal you would always go with the one that spoke well. </p>

<p>In Trumps case he&#39;s the president of the US. His words are suppose to carry great weight with them but he flings them out very carelessly. In my view and it&#39;s only a opinion we have in Trump the worst of both worlds not only can he not speak well but he is also a bad leader.

<p>After SNL did the character assassination on Spicer, and he became a meme, had to do something to stop the parodies from overtaking reality. Mooch took the job and very quickly became basically the same target.</p>

<p>However, we&#39;ve landed on this Sanders chick and the late night show types are simply unable to do the same to her for some reason.</p>

Most people don&#39;t bother watching them because the information is so suspect. No reason to go after her because you know the next one is going to be the exact same maybe worse. SSH Imo has some comic gold thats untapped like her constant pivots to her kids or messy house but at this time it&#39;s a target rich environment. Sessions is back in the news. I love the SNL Sessions. I would love to see a Bannon VS Ryan McConnil Civil war skit where they both show up with confederate flags and fight about who gets the southern voters. Then they all three get flanked by a Roy Moore army made up of Christians and Scientologist that he some how united. </p>

Publicly he&#39;s got in to some kinda trashy fights. When we tweeted about megan kelly during the debate and Mika saying she was bleeding from her face he kinda went a bridge to far especial for the Potus.

    <div class="md"><p>You mean after a loss/win people get depressed/active?</p>

<p>Your proof to the positive is inconclusive at best. Is politics not already left leaning like most the rest of reddit? How many times do subs like <a href="/r/dankmemes">/r/dankmemes</a> and <a href="/r/me_irl">/r/me_irl</a> posts reach the front page complaining about their own memes?</p>

<p>Heres a few hints: The_Donald&#39;s type was accepted in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> due to their rabid anti-clintonism. More people already liked clinton over sanders. Sander&#39;s own slow loss and support for clinton after the DNC picked up many of his platform&#39;s interests resulted in plenty of his supporters joining clinton for the general</p>

    <div class="md"><p>theres a huge difference between &quot;left leaning&quot; &amp; being a progressive. there were tens of thousands of active progressives going to r/politics so goddamn often and after Bernie WON but had his victory stolen from him via voter fraud (ask Stanford abt that) those progressives saw the 6 months ahead, and were hurt. We weren&#39;t going to keep up against the shills on r/politics day to day because the blue tide a Bernie nomination would have brought was lost when Clinton &amp; the entire establishment prioritized keeping the power with themselves. r/politics was infested with CTR from the moment Bernie followers started making that their homebase for online outreach aside from the Bernie subbreddit itself. If you really are arguing against that then I recommend you look into CTR &amp; its budget, including how much it spent and what on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It shows nothing of the sort. The report has such sampling bias that it can&#39;t be used on its own. They are not, there&#39;s been plenty written about that.  Even the authors admit that it has not been placed under scientific rigor. That by itself should show you that this is pushing an agenda and not scientifically sound. Exit polling on its own is also regularly unreliable due to its sampling bias. Hell, you don&#39;t even know that their point was that exit polls varied from reality and that they were analyzing the difference between the percentage of delegates that voted for clinton and the reputability of the paper trail (or lack thereof) in the state&#39;s primary. <strong>You don&#39;t even know what the study is using as evidence.</strong> The assumption that states without paper trails swung to clinton and didn&#39;t reflect the states with paper trails is proof that the election was fraudulent is shoddy at best. They bring up no point or reason that would explain this difference presumably as that would weaken the already weak paper.</p>

<p>CTR is a bunch of people on twitter responding to tweets.</p>

<p>The fact that you think that bernie won despite all the evidence at your fingertips shows you don&#39;t want to accept reality. The fact that you&#39;re so deluded to think that CTR took over an entire subreddit so suddenly despite participants explaining exactly how your evidence is inconclusive shows you&#39;re ignoring reality. Especially your point that anyone on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> that attacked clinton was a &#39;progressive&#39; shows you don&#39;t know the first thing about how people act on reddit.</p>

<p>half ass rebuttal shows hypocrisy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>there&#39;s the good ol leaps of logic I like to see in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>supply proof</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You mean the thing you didn&#39;t supply? The closest thing being the &#39;study&#39; that you don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re talking about?</p>

<p>I know you&#39;ll just move goal posts or ignore all evidence to the contrary anyways but here goes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>astroturfing is a huge issue across all platforms and to think your response is &#39;dismantling&#39; that claim then you should really look into CTR more or you have an agenda to protect their reputation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your claim of their participation is completely lacking in any level of valuable evidence, especially on reddit. You&#39;re poisoning the well by claiming that I must either not know of their reputation or must be protecting their reputation instead of the more logical position of claiming that perceived opinions on a forum change are not representative of the forum&#39;s occupants. Which has been explained to you a number of times: attacking hillary = trump supporters + bernie supporters result in a drowning out of hillary supporters, bernies slow decline in the primary + dnc platform including more progressive positions = increase in progressive support for dnc candidate (aka Hillary), etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I didnt claim they took over super suddenly, I mentioned that they were there before Clinton &quot;won&quot; and merely stayed after the traffic of progressives plummeted.</p>

<p>The fact that you&#39;re so deluded to think that CTR took over an entire subreddit so suddenly despite participants explaining exactly how your evidence is inconclusive shows you&#39;re ignoring reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please show me where that excludes &quot;them&quot; already existing? Are you saying <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> was taken over by trump bots immediately after the the general election going trump? Because daily participation also dropped then? As it did when ron paul lost his primary. There is nothing about this that points anywhere near exclusively to astroturfing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&amp; there is a lot more to voter fraud then trying to squeeze the narrative into &quot;paper trail or not&quot;. I knew what evidence they used, because their findings turned the paper trail into swiss cheese. Theres footage of voting machines highlighting HC when Bernie is selected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No shit there&#39;s a lot more to voter fraud, yet there is nothing to support it. Their entire basis of evidence of fraud was about the paper trails vs no paper trails when you exclusively argued from exit polls. Show me those videos and their resulting changed votes, or you&#39;re just not going supplying literally any evidence at all?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There has never been a dramatic difference in exit polling in our countries history. Any time an exit poll varies by 2% in another country our state department warns them of fraud immediately.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You want to submit evidence of literally either of these claims? How does that 2% figure account for margin of errors included in the polls? Because exit polls are notoriously biased. I&#39;ll even give you a fellow conspiracy believer:</p>

<p><a href="https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2011/11/13/1988-2008-unadjusted-state-exit-polls-statistical-reference/">https://richardcharnin.wordpress.com/2011/11/13/1988-2008-unadjusted-state-exit-polls-statistical-reference/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was a massive 8% discrepancy between the exit polls (52D-42R) and the recorded vote (48D-46R)</p>

<p>There was never a primary where there was pressure to ensure there wasnt an exit poll done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So are you claiming there was one here? Want to submit evidence that supports that (both there had never and that this did)?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The machines are beyond weak &amp; the system is corrupt to the core. There are moves being made that clearly are over your head.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re not over my head, they&#39;re shitty talking points to rally counterculture <a href="/r/TheRedPill">/r/TheRedPill</a> types with conservatism and baseless claims of cheating. Easiest to show this is the belief that trump was a suitable vote replacement for sanders voters that rotated during the election on reddit. Look at pizzagate, it was literally created on <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> and 4chan. Then when there wasn&#39;t a scrap of evidence for it they tried to tie it into general pedophilia cartels that people have already existed with no evidence to Podesta. Hell wikileaks, the basis of many conspiracies during this election <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/786650357468454912?lang=en">linked directly to /r/the_donald</a> where literally any moderating discussion is removed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Get out of r/conspiracy if you&#39;re just here to start arguments, pretty obnoxious.</p>

<p>Get off the internet if you&#39;re too stupid to see you&#39;ve already fallen for such shitty baseless propaganda.</p>

You linked me some analysis of national election exit polls not even related to the 2016 democratic primaries. There is a lot more proof for voter fraud against Bernie &amp; Pizzagate then you will ever let yourself admit to there being. Your cognitive dissonance is clearly pretty strong. Tell me, why did they have a basement at Comet and try to refute that later? Why was the exit poll differential in New York over 20%? What about Ohio? Arizona? Don&#39;t even get me started on the amount of polling stations that were closed down in Arizona just prior to the 2016 Election. How can I submit proof of something never happening before? You want me to spoon feed you on the rarity of forcing a state to not conduct an exit poll?</p>

<p>They never had a basement, that was 4 Chan larping. Why are you not backing up your claims with anything?

<p>Fair enough, he said he kept them in the basement. In one interview where he knew they didn&#39;t have a basement? Yet it couldn&#39;t have been in their residence&#39;s basement or anything? And this is somehow evidence of something?</p>

<p>[links]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you think these support for you? None of them submit the 2% exit poll error for evidence of fraud, only that it could be used. They each admit that exit polls have a serious case of selection bias to be compensated for.  Here&#39;s some choice quotes from them to support me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The following are examples of the most egregious, widely observed and reported examples of election-day fraud on November 21:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>none of these accusations in the dnc primary</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the second approach, interviewing samples in a larger number of precincts, the margins of error in each precinct would be quite large.  Mitofsky would not speculate on the sampling error in a precinct, because it depends on the size of the sample.  But given sample sizes of 100 to 200 voters, the margins of error could be in the 8% to 10% range. When the data are aggregated into regions and across the state as a whole, the margin of error would still be substantial -- at least in the 2% to 3% range.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The exit polls have never been cited as primary evidence of fraud, but only as a reason to take that primary evidence to heart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and yet there isn&#39;t any &#39;primary evidence&#39; of voter fraud in the primary</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who is laura silsby again</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Nine of the ten missionaries were later released but NLCR founder Laura Silsby remained incarcerated in Haiti. By the time she went to trial on May 13 the charges had been reduced to &quot;arranging irregular travel&quot; and the prosecution sought a 6-month prison term.[4] On May 17, she was found guilty and sentenced to the time served in jail prior to the trial.[5]&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In an interview, the United States Ambassador to Haiti Kenneth Merten, stated that the U.S. justice system would not interfere and added &quot;the Haitian justice system will do what it has to do.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>In the days following the group&#39;s initial arrest, Dominican Jorge Puello falsely portrayed himself as the group&#39;s lawyer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, but since there&#39;s a majority on one side then only that side will get exposure. You understand this, right? And you can tie the same logic to r/conspiracy and others. When 60% of the people downvote anything that&#39;s anti-trump then 0% of the material will be pro-trump. It&#39;s not reflective of actual views, the same way that r/politics is not.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not news - it&#39;s literal propaganda. Even when they&#39;re not &quot;reporting&quot; on opinions, the headlines about actual news are nearly always editorialized. </p>

<p>There are lots of Trump related posts but only 1 is a celebrity attacking Trump but a political one (Barack).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Really? Only one? </p>

<p>These are some of the titles I see on the front page of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> right now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rep. Frederica Wilson: Kelly lied about FBI ceremony</li>
<li>Barack Obama implies Trump has set US back 50 years in first political speech for a year</li>
<li>New U.S. Budget Is a &#39;Hoax,&#39; Says Republican Senator Bob Corker</li>
<li>Brits Tell Trump to Mind His Own Business After Crime Tweet</li>
<li>Winston Churchill&#39;s grandson calls Trump a &#39;daft twerp&#39;</li>
<li>Protester hugs Nazi outside Richard Spencer talk, asks &#39;Why do you hate me?&#39;</li>
<li>Khizr Khan, Gold Star Father Who Spoke at DNC, Wants John Kelly to Stop &#39;Mopping Up&#39; After Donald Trump</li>
</ul>

<p>All of those are examples of &quot;this person has an opinion so you should have it, too.&quot;</p>

<p>They&#39;re technically  appeal to authority fallacies, despite some of the opinions not actually coming from any authority at all. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your claim was disproved by simply clicking on the link you supplied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nah, not really, based on the examples I just provided. </p>

<p>I also specifically avoided making any quantitative statements because the front page obviously changes, and I knew someone wouldn&#39;t be able to resist &quot;proving me wrong.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit: I do agree there are too many opinion pieces posted though. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>True. Like these, also on their front page right now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gold Star families are coming out en masse and disputing Trump&#39;s claims amid his latest controversy (&quot;en mass&quot; is an obvious exaggeration) </li>
<li>Three Richard Spencer Supporters Arrested for Attempted Murder of Protesters in Gainesville (attempting to blame politicians for everything their supporters do is a textbook guilty by association fallacy)</li>
<li>Hilarious Paul Ryan Forgets to Mention That He&#39;s Concealing Trump Tax Returns (obviously editorialized title)</li>
<li>Barack Obama Is Back and Reminding Us What a President Looks Like (obviously editorialized title)</li>
<li>Trump’s mindless cruelty to a soldier’s widow speaks to the core of his character (obviously editorialized title)</li>
<li>John Kelly’s defense of Trump was absurd. And he surely knows it. (obviously editorialized title)</li>
<li>Donald Trump links UK crime rise to ‘radical Islamic terror’, despite complete absence of evidence to support claim (obviously editorialized title, with added hypocrisy considering how many other stories are merely unsubstantiated opinions)</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok, maybe I forgot to include &quot;regular people&quot; in my comment, but it&#39;s absolutely clear from the rest of what I said that the focus on opinions at all (and using them to influence people) is the issue, not whose opinions they are. </p>

<p>Textbook hypocrisy right there. </p>

<p>If your point was that they weren&#39;t celebrities, then you wouldn&#39;t have first said they&#39;re all politicians. </p>

<p>But no, my goalpost hasn&#39;t moved; you just haven&#39;t even entered the field yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You post is pretty subjective.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s level of mental capacity does not fit the definition of a &quot;moron&quot; That is hyperbole.</p>

<p>Many people do like Trump. Some do not.</p>

<p>He does not fit the definition of &quot;obese&quot;</p>

<p>Trump claims to be non-establishment, because that declaration, however accurate fits his political persona. It does make sense that his supporters believe it, because that is the narrative that serves their belief model. Even if it is not true, it makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>I voted for Sanders. Trump behaves like he is a nitwit, though he is not. He lacks certain communication skills, which is a real embarrassment....it does not make him a &quot;moron&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can supply huge amounts of examples of him behaving moronic. A very obvious one is constantly claims of the size of his inauguration crowds. I think almost all rational people would classify that as moronic.</p>

<p>He is literally obese. By definition of obese in medical terms he is definitely obese.</p>

<p>Him claiming to be anti-establishment is nothing but a claim. It does fit his political persona at all. It doesn&#39;t fit his persona in general.</p>

<p>Trump doesn&#39;t just behave like a &quot;nitwit&quot; he is one. Again there are a huge number of examples and not only in regards to his lack of articulation. He is certainly a moron. He has never done anything in his life to prove otherwise. A silver spoon does not denote intelligence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s a completely different search that you’re dangling up as evidence. Sorry that news and politics are inextricably linked to a degree and it hurts your feelings, but if you really do sort <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> by top it really does do a surprisingly good job for a default sub of staying away from politics. </p>

<p>Anyway I wandered in here from <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> because I was interested in learning about the story but the circlejerk about how much we hate reddit and are bad at finding appropriate subreddits to post in really undermines the truth.</p>

However, on top of my own experiences getting banned without explanation from Hillary  getting baited repeatedly by Correct the Record and Sharblue as well as getting my own vote count manipulated after criticizing them and the fact that there have been numerous posts in this sub talking about getting banned at /news for posting about this topic, I believe there is definitely a concerted effort to flush this scandal down the toilet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, thanks for that I guess, I know it&#39;s gotta be hard, but is that the best defense? I mean this claim was made at least a few times after Orlando, if they had any smarts they&#39;d have put together a copypasta them that they could use anytime this claim got thrown out there. Now I&#39;m wishing I&#39;d dug into it deeper myself at the time. Is /news so above everyone here in tinfoil hat country that they can&#39;t come down off their horse for a bit and help us see the light? I&#39;d think it be quite a boon for them at this point to call this comment out if it&#39;s not true. As of right now your comment is about as valuable as his, but he&#39;s got a lot more votes and u r the only one disputing. This isn&#39;t just an ordinary claim of censorship, it&#39;s a pretty gross accusation.  But wtf do I know? I will say I wish Tendies would give a little more context to back up his own claim as well.</p>

<p>Trump rolls back access to free birth control (bbc.com)</p>

<p>submitted <strong>13 days ago</strong> by Shanashy</p>

<p>News or Politics?
As an aside, the headline is misleading, as is tradition. It&#39;s not a ban  on access by Trump, it allows organizations to not provide free birth control if they decide. I won&#39;t be buying from those organizations, and I&#39;m not mad at Trump because he gave them the ability to show their hand to the public so that I can make an informed deicsion to not give them my money.</p>

<p>But I guess it&#39;s possible the rules changed for the better.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who&#39;s misleading now? It says rolls back, not ban, which is 100% accurate. It&#39;s not primarily political because it focuses on birth control for millions of people. </p>

<p>Primarily politics would be exactly what everyone here is freaking out about... a corruption case featuring politicians, that only affects politicians.</p>

<p>If it was something like &quot;Hillary Clinton embezzles $3b in UAW pension funds, funnels them to Foundation&quot; then you bet your ass it would be news because  it effects actual people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Obama administration approved the sale of 20% of America&#39;s uranium reserves to a Russian company,Rosatom, who employed extortion and bribery to gain power over our atomic energy industty. SoS Clinton personally oversaw the transfer, and her foundation took a $145 million dollar check for her trouble. Obama&#39;s own AG had evidence of criminal conduct, and yet the deal went through.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t just political commentary. It&#39;s a MAJOR news story. Uranium is critical to our energy sector, and our national defense. We control less than 1% of the global supply. Russia now has 9%.</p>

You don&#39;t need veto power to get a deal like this killed. All you have to do is raise a fuss about the investigation to the media. Hillary kept her mouth shut, then Hillary collected $145 million. </p>

<p>What makes more sense to you - some low level state dept guy unilaterally decided to conceal incriminating evidence from his boss, for no apparent reason? Or did he do as he was told, by a superior whose husband had just flown back from Russia with $500K in a suitcase; a superior who pushed for a Russian &quot;reset&quot;, opposed the Magnitsky Act&#39;s sanctions, and whose department had just released 10 SVR spies arrested by the FBI back to Moscow? </p>

<p>Just like with the 2008 Wall Street scandals, its the people at the top who are guilty - even though their lackeys take the blame.</p>

<p>Oh, and Rosatom can ship the uranium back to the Motherland. As long as its used for &quot;nuclear research and nuclear power production&quot;, it&#39;s A-OK for export! Because we can definitely keep track of it once it&#39;s outside our borders...</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m more bothered by the corruption and hypocrisy than anything else.  It&#39;s depressing how often our rulers ignore their own regulations, as if they&#39;re above the law. But i guess they&#39;re right - they always get away with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Their are literally 2 news stories that came out this week being suppressed right nowby MSM and social media, one about how Comey let hillary off the hook months before even seeing the evidence about her emails and one about how hillary gave 1/5 of our uranium to Russia illegally and with the help of Obama. Of course you wouldn&#39;t know anything about that though would you? </p>

<p>You believe something with 0 evidence that&#39;s been investigated for almost a year now but when evidence is presented directly to you, you deny it.</p>

<p>The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, <strong>giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America’s uranium supply</strong>.</p>

<p>You guys are willing to believe the Head of the State department knew every single active FBI investigation currently underway, to the point that they’d be able to preempt collusion as part of a collection of government agencies approving the sale of an unrelated Canadian Uranium company, BUT you same people refuse to believe Trump knew that the pretense of his son directly meeting with a Russian informant, explicitly for disinformation.</p>

<p>What evidence of corruption and collusion is there again?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what evidence is there just recently uncovered about corruption with the Clintons and Obama admin?</p>

<p>Well lets see, there was the IRS targetting conservatives, Eric Holder who was fired for Fast &amp; Furious, Obama admin unmasking of political enemies, and now we have Uranium 1</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Using Wikipedia as a source negates sourcing your information in the first place. It&#39;s like you wrote down &quot;The Library&quot; as your source. Wikipedia&#39;s articles are written per-sources cited (go to the very bottom of any Wiki article to find the sources for pretty much the entire write-up). It is up to the author of a paper (in this case, a student) to review and collect information from the sources within the Wiki article, and then make their best decision/judgment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you wrote down literally just &quot;wikipedia&quot; as the citation but we knew back then to include the link, I assumed that went without saying today.  Also going through all the sources in a wiki just to get tidbits is just a make work exercise.  It&#39;s a waste of time and not teaching someone how to actually get anything done.  The information is compiled already, why are you making some recompile it?  In what field is this a useful skill to have?  </p>

<p>The only time I can see this being advisable is if you need further information in a certain area.  Like say you want the early life of a historical figure, the wiki has a short piece on it but links to 1-2 books on the subject.  Sure, go refer that specific information.  If your paper just needs something citing a brief overview of that person&#39;s early life though there&#39;s no reason to go read those 2 books to come away with a little more useful information than what&#39;s in the wiki.  </p>

<p>This skill is almost purely limited to scholarly ventures which the vast majority of us will never be working in.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See, I agree on a lot of your points. The only issue here is the crowd-sourcing that Wikipedia offers: anyone can edit anything. There are alienable contributions, and academic research isn&#39;t considered complete with Wikipedia citations for that reason. This is another reason why going through the article and finding the sources cited is a better alternative. Sure, it&#39;s an extra step, but research shouldn&#39;t be &quot;get my information as quickly as possible&quot; in the first place.</p>

<p>I do agree with you, though, that Wikipedia is a great place for gathering huge portions of research citations pointed in the right direction, I just feel I understand professors more when they say it isn&#39;t a reliable source to cite.</p>

It would be much better if they were teaching people how to filter information, how to properly find good sources through google rather than just telling them some sources are off limits or making individual students produce work that is not going to be close to the work we have available for free in our pockets.  </p>

<p>I get upset thinking back to the classes I spend thousands of dollars on that I passed by basically rewriting a wikipedia article.  The classes I remember as being actually valuable are the ones that thought me how to think and how to find relevant information but that&#39;s difficult and why most of my professors didn&#39;t do it.  Nevermind high school, they were irrelevant to the demands of the market years before I even took their classes.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this may be a reason professors ask for sources cited that aren&#39;t a Wikipedia article. The articles are great for finding the information, but digging deeper into the citations is where a student can build their own foundation of character about a topic or opinion.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really saying one way or the other, because I agree that it can sound like a waste, but the idea that I believe scholarly instructors are trying to instill is that more fluid, and complex research can sometimes even lead to an epiphany where a change of stance on a subject could occur. Again, I&#39;m not saying one way or the other, I just think that a <em>quick</em> answer using Wikipedia articles can often lead to a quick conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what happens with most topics it&#39;s just wiki the source itself changes while with books you need to find ones with updated information.  Look at the food pyramid as an example.  If you found books on nutrition from the 70s to 90s it&#39;s probably going to go on the idea that a low fat, high carb diet is best.  If you go with books after Atkins came out in the early 2000s the books will show a high/moderate fat, low/no carb diet is much better.  Wiki can update automatically to adjust to this change is new research while if you&#39;re only using book sources and don&#39;t know about these new developments you could write a work that&#39;s completely false by modern research while using all proper sources.  </p>

<p>Everyone leans on wiki being live updated as a bad thing when it&#39;s one of the biggest strengths it has.  It changes when new information is discovered.  There isn&#39;t a wide spread problem of wiki having blatantly false claims except when people are trolling and even that usually gets corrected quickly.   </p>

<p>I 100% would not say that wikipedia being live updated is a bad thing in regards to wikipedia being an information source, I would however 100% say that wikipedia being live updated is a bad thing when you are using it to defend a point you are making at a specific moment in time. </p>

<p>If you cite it in your writing, your writing does not change with the times like wikipedia does. If I cite a book in a paper that I write, and later new information becomes available that completely invalidates my point, I don&#39;t want my citation to provide the most up to date information available, I want my citation to provide the best information available at the time that I made my point.</p>

<p>This is a completely valid point, but I would argue that it supports using wikipedia as a resource to research a topic. Given that had you wrote your paper using the best information available in the 70s to 90s, but you had (lets pretend Wikipedia was available in the 70s to 90s) cited wikipedia, if someone read your paper today, they would be reading a paper that supports a low fat, high carb diet, that cites something that supports the opposite. </p>

<p>The point is that all information is built on what comes before it, a citation is not provided to give your reader further information, a citation is provided as context for your argument.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re debating what is and what isn&#39;t an appropriate source to cite in a paper, I&#39;m exclusively referring to these types of papers. A significant purpose of these papers is to become acquainted with research standards, the entire reason a professor would bother restricting sources is that they take these papers seriously. Even if the vast, vast majority don&#39;t go into academia, establishing research habits is a fundamental part of education.</p>

<p>The reason you don&#39;t cite wikipedia is the same reason that citing any obscure source is frowned upon. Citing a local newspaper would probably have been frowned upon in the 70s, but today you can easily provide a link to some archive, making it a potential source. I would even ask your teacher/professor if citing an archived wikipedia page might be appropriate.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If your book is being bought, people are probably going to notice that it is no longer up to date and not buy your book. If you write something general enough to make sense in the face of new information, you probably aren&#39;t making much of a point at all. This also doesn&#39;t address the point that providing information to an actively updated source is something I would encourage, but it is not a substitute for a citation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would I read a 100-200 page source when a 2 min browse of wiki gets the same thing done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same technology that enables a 2 minute view of wikipedia enables a link to a page of a book providing the same. I&#39;m really not trying to make a case against technology here, a journal article or hell even a blog are reasonable.</p>

<hr/>

<p>If you still feel that I&#39;m not really arguing within the scope of the point you wanted to make, I would like to add that I fully support (I mean, we all do it), pseduo-citing wikipedia by writing something as if you were citing wikipedia, then checking and running all the wikipedia sources for the relevant section through easybib and citing them in your paper just as wikipedia does in the article (with proper MLA/APA/whatever formatting, of course).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not an issue with Wikipedia itself, but because Wikipedia is an encyclopedic source. Many teachers either dont know, or dont bother explaining the difference, but you cannot use encyclopedias in academic research at all (baring a few limited exceptions). The reasons that stop you from using wiki are going to stop you from using Britannica as well. They arent considered scholarly sources, and they arent primary sources, so they dont count. They are a wonderful way to get introduced to a topic, however, and are often recommended as your first line of research. The reason is they are trying to teach you how to conduct research, not just make you learn about the topic itself. If they wanted you to learn about the topic, they would just assign a textbook (like many classes do).</p>

<p>Sorry to go on a rant, this is just a popular misconception (that a lot of bad teachers reinforce) and so I wanted to take a second to clear it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry kid, I&#39;m glad you just woke up, but I know all about the Council on Foreign Relations, the Tri-Lateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, etc.  I&#39;ve actually read the Creature from Jekyll Island from cover to cover.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ve also listened to guys who have spoke at Bilderberg, and while I do believe the rich put their interests first, I don&#39;t believe there is a concentrated effort to destroy the world.  You give them too much credit.  They are looking out for themselves and trying to get richer, no doubt, but they aren&#39;t trying to round you up into concentration camps.  That could very well be a <em>side-effect</em> of their efforts to enrich themselves, but it isn&#39;t written in stone anywhere.</p>

<p>Also, and probably for personal reasons, I&#39;d love to see Clinton rot in jail for all the horrible things she&#39;s done.  Hence why I want the MSM to cover this story.</p>

<p>You need to read the book How to Win Friends and Influence people.  Because spamming someone with a lot of URLs (none of which I will click on) is not the best way to convince anyone of anything.  And your tantrum was also a complete derail from the entire topic of this thread.</p>

<p>You can have your own government propaganda thread, and feel free to correct anyone who says something wrong, but seriously, this is a thread about Clinton and Russia, so please, fuck off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Starting out calling someone kid and spouting some popular phrases reduces credibility, but I hate to break it to you, but the warning of the NWO and Military Industrial complex was not dreamed up by some reporter or conspiracy person. In fact those warning came before the words conspiracy theorist had any public usage at all, and they came from the Presidents of the USA. Eisenhower warned us about exactly what has happened. JFK spelled it out in greater detail and took a bullet for it. </p>

<p>Second, those links are called sources and evidence, you use those in a debate, credible people expect them.</p>

<p>And Finally, it is not even a question of the US being under an oligarchy, it has been stated outright, so here is some more sources you can ignore, so that you can continue with your own closed minded road of mind controlled BS.</p>

They are spending many, many millions trying to connect Trump and Russia, and then there is all this obvious, right in your face most likely illegal stuff the Clintons have done that is swept under the rug by just about every news source. Used to be you could get some straight news from Youtube but Google is taking care of that right now. We are really getting like North Korea when it comes to being told the truth. Very sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry kid, I&#39;m glad you just woke up, but I know all about the Council on Foreign Relations, the Tri-Lateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, etc.  I&#39;ve actually read the Creature from Jekyll Island from cover to cover.</p>

<p>But I&#39;ve also listened to guys who have spoke at Bilderberg, and while I do believe the rich put their interests first, I don&#39;t believe there is a concentrated effort to destroy the world.  You give them too much credit.  They are looking out for themselves and trying to get richer, no doubt, but they aren&#39;t trying to round you up into concentration camps.  That could very well be a <em>side-effect</em> of their efforts to enrich themselves, but it isn&#39;t written in stone anywhere.</p>

<p>Also, and probably for personal reasons, I&#39;d love to see Clinton rot in jail for all the horrible things she&#39;s done.  Hence why I want the MSM to cover this story.</p>

<p>You need to read the book How to Win Friends and Influence people.  Because spamming someone with a lot of URLs (none of which I will click on) is not the best way to convince anyone of anything.  And your tantrum was also a complete derail from the entire topic of this thread.</p>

<p>You can have your own government propaganda thread, and feel free to correct anyone who says something wrong, but seriously, this is a thread about Clinton and Russia, so please, fuck off.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m talking with papers in high school and college which are going to be completed and graded in a week or two</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we&#39;re debating what is and what isn&#39;t an appropriate source to cite in a paper, I&#39;m exclusively referring to these types of papers. A significant purpose of these papers is to become acquainted with research standards, the entire reason a professor would bother restricting sources is that they take these papers seriously. Even if the vast, vast majority don&#39;t go into academia, establishing research habits is a fundamental part of education.</p>

<p>The reason you don&#39;t cite wikipedia is the same reason that citing any obscure source is frowned upon. Citing a local newspaper would probably have been frowned upon in the 70s, but today you can easily provide a link to some archive, making it a potential source. I would even ask your teacher/professor if citing an archived wikipedia page might be appropriate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your book is based on wikipedia articles, it&#39;s not whether or not it&#39;s reliable, it just makes it irrelevant and no one is going to want to buy it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If your book is being bought, people are probably going to notice that it is no longer up to date and not buy your book. If you write something general enough to make sense in the face of new information, you probably aren&#39;t making much of a point at all. This also doesn&#39;t address the point that providing information to an actively updated source is something I would encourage, but it is not a substitute for a citation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would I read a 100-200 page source when a 2 min browse of wiki gets the same thing done.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same technology that enables a 2 minute view of wikipedia enables a link to a page of a book providing the same. I&#39;m really not trying to make a case against technology here, a journal article or hell even a blog are reasonable.</p>

<hr/>

<p>If you still feel that I&#39;m not really arguing within the scope of the point you wanted to make, I would like to add that I fully support (I mean, we all do it), pseduo-citing wikipedia by writing something as if you were citing wikipedia, then checking and running all the wikipedia sources for the relevant section through easybib and citing them in your paper just as wikipedia does in the article (with proper MLA/APA/whatever formatting, of course).</p>
