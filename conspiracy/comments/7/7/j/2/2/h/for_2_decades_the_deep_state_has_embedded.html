        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The following is a <strong>FUN</strong> list. Most are proven, some are <strong>FUN</strong> and INTERESTING ideas FROM INSTINCT (so prove me wrong and I am happy to debate), doesn&#39;t mean I am 100% correct but this is &quot;conspiracy&quot;, no? I will update and revise or even add after further discussion so help out if you want. Last word, yes, the entire thing is all about Divide and Conquer and it is not about left vs right. HOWEVER, consciously or unconsciously, the liberals are helping the DS with it&#39;s overall agenda. This is a fact. This balance is out of whack. Also, not in any order.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>MSMs fakery</strong> - proven fake news propaganda machines - WSJ, WaPo, abc News, NBC News, BBC, HuffPo, CNN, LA Times, MSNBC, POLITICO</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MSMs polls are 100% correct!</strong> - Hillary had a 95% of being POTUS, 1 week before elections LOLL. This one will never die ....</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BLM are downers</strong> - Soros funded. Stats: In this year 17 blacks were killed by cops. In 2015, 6000 blacks were killed by other blacks ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ANTIFA are really commies</strong> - Soros funded. Supposedly fighting fascism but they use violence and stop speakers from speaking. Funny ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gender benders</strong> - Creating divide by introducing 32,758 types of genders. So how can one human being communicate with each other if there is so much confusion? Dividing us more ....</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trump Russian collusion</strong> - Whole year, no proof. Enough said ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google Youtube Facebook</strong> - Censorship of alternative news and conservative opinions. They act as the &quot;fact checkers&quot; of what is right and wrong but the point is they are liberal. No bias here ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Uranium One</strong> - Mueller, Obama, Hillary, Bill, Podesta, <strong>CONGRESS</strong> proved to have an interest in selling 20% of Uranium to Russia. yet, no one is investigating this?? 145 million dollars is chump change I guess ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weistein</strong> - Hollywood loves sex predators. Polanski drugged and rape a 13 year old and yet he gets a standing ovation and an award. Weirdos ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Podesta cheesy emails</strong> - Everyone loves a good pizza. The clock is ticking on this one ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cheating to win, didn&#39;t help lol</strong> - Donna Brazile handing questions over debate questions to Hillary prior to a national debate. Classy ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Las Vegas shooting</strong> - 200, powerful, rounds through a door, only hits Campos in the leg. Ok. 200 rounds and the door is still there. Ok. One shooter. Ok. Don&#39;t go there, gets whispered. Ok. LV Cameras everywhere but no footage. Ok. No conspiracy here ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Campos on Ellen</strong> - Love this one. 59 people dead and he goes, if it really is Campos, on an Ellen talk show to give &quot;facts&quot;. Not fooling anyone here ... </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Campos fat boy</strong> - Love this one too. Campos gain a lot of weight in one week from the time he got an award to his appearance on Ellen. Not fooling anyone again ... </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trumps is a fat bastard</strong> - 2 scoops of ice-cream. CNN are geniuses ....</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Melania fashion sense</strong> - reports of wearing heels. HOW DARE SHE! </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Puerto Rico libtard</strong> - Liberal mayor plays politics and trashes Trump ... when her people are desperate. Makes sense ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sanctuary suck up money cities</strong> - I never understood the point of these cities. They house criminals and tax payers give them money!? HUH???</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No news is good news !?</strong> - Over 400 sex related crims arrested nationwide yesterday. Over 3000 this year. Where is MSMs reporting on this one????? HUH???</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Awwww, how sweet</strong> - Satanic drag queens reading to our kids. Therapy required afterwards. Lots of therapy needed ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is Obama really an American?</strong> - His birth certificate is fake ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Loretta Lynch tarmac meeting with Bill</strong> - just catching up on grandkids news, nothing to see here ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ISIS</strong> - Took Obama 8 years to try and get rid of rats. Has taking Trump 11 months to do it. Incompetence or deliberate on Obama behalf? </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FURTHER ADD ONS:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ellen casino slots connection</strong> - So how insensitive is that? Putting Campos on Ellen, where 59 people died in LV, and Ellen has her own slots machines at MGM? Bizzarre ...</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MSMs politicizing deaths of soldiers</strong> - So why would POTUS, or anyone for that matter, call the family of a deceased serviceman, and be insensitive? Does that make sense? MSMs true stripes ...</p></li>
</ul>
