<p>There are 2 factions involved, who they are exactly I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Terrorists and law enforcement, not ISIS.</p>

<p>Law enforcement of some type are in the helicopter shooting at individual terrorist suspects on the ground with a rifle and with semi-auto burst.</p>

<p>Mandalay bay shooter is shooting at the helicopter, not the crowd. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>We have fully automatic gunfire with long pauses in between. If they were shooting at the crowd, why not just keep shooting? You&#39;d have to wait for the helicopter to be in range.</p></li>
<li><p>We have bullet holes in the fuel tanks even though that wouldn&#39;t blow those up. This shows the shooter was aiming high</p></li>

<p>The crowd is collateral damage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, because a chopper that is being shot at is certainly going to come back around to be shot at some more. No, not even. The chopper that was in the sky wasn&#39;t close enough to MB for this to even be a feasible idea. The chopper is a tour chopper.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me address each of your points in order.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>No one actually saw a second shooter. People said it seemed like it was coming from here or there but nothing was ever actually seen.</p></li>
<li><p>The woman who made the statement was a concert going herself. Would she have put herself in harms way to deliver a message? It has been said she was drunk and had had an argument with someone there.</p></li>
<li><p>There are zeros photos or video of an actual shooter at any other location. Zero evidence of gunshots anywhere other than MB. What you did see was people running. Mass hysteria after hearing what happened. There are no victims that were shot at any other location. Dead suspects in the street? No...I don&#39;t even know where you got that from please link.</p></li>
<li><p>Campos had business on that floor. He was sent there by his superiors to check on an alarm on a door. He was doing his job. He wasn&#39;t there without reason.</p></li>
<li><p>Paddock may have stopped shooting for any number of reasons. Tired, switch guns, hands hot...any number of things. If he was shooting the helicopter it would have gone down. He would have had a good line of sight on something that big with flashing lights. And no the lights flashing on the helicopter do not match up to the gunfire. Again, if the chopper was his target it would have been hit and taken down.</p></li>
<li><p>The fuel tanks. Either he was aiming for them or they were hit in the crossfire of him trying to aim at the crowd. Fuel tanks are ground level not chopper in the sky level. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are tour choppers on the strip all the time. If the chopper was his aim he would have shot it and it would have gone down. If the chopper was firing in the crowd the injuries would have been much worse and there would have been more casualties. The choppers were doing what they do every night. It isn&#39;t unusual at all that they were there. </p>

<p>This theory doesn&#39;t hold weight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt this, but maybe.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what type of outfit would have a helicopter and be able to get it into that airspace unnoticed. </p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re suggesting our own law enforcement was purposely gunning down civilians for no reason. I&#39;d find that hard to believe though.</p>
