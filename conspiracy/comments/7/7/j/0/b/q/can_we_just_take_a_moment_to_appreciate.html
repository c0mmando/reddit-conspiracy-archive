<p>Sure, there are some absolutely abysmal things that get discussed in this subreddit, from the crackpot to the down right racist... and thankfully there are enough people here to call these things out when they crop up. But the moderators let them stand. They let the discussion run its course. They let the free market of ideas operate unhindered. </p>

<p>With reddit moving farther and farther away from the vision Schwartz originally had... r/conspiracy ironically, seems like one of the only sane places left on this website. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know what the point of the post is and I&#39;m saying that it&#39;s debatable. Anyone who has had the slightest bit of experience here will tell you that what you are saying is not necessary true. </p>

<p>It is true that you can for the most part post anything but, if it doesn&#39;t fit it will never see the light of day and no quality discussions will ever come of it. This is still Reddit. There is a hivemind here in this sub. Manufactured consensus.</p>

<p>As for the mods, once again it&#39;s debatable. The opinion is not always pushed in a way most people think or would suspect. It&#39;s subtle. The fact that I have to walk on eggs shell merely mentioning this goes to show what I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>Better than most places but, still has many issues by design.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, found the answer to some questions I just asked. You&#39;re saying because conversation is manipulated by shill tactics, forum sliding, brigading and such right? Is that what Chomskey refers to with his quote? Because that doesn&#39;t seem like limiting conversation the way I thought he originally meant it. That seems more like message manupulation that can be largly overcome if a user is motivated to really find the most important parts of the conversation. Maybe I&#39;m picking it apart, but full out censorship, which is what I though Chomskey was talking about, seems more devious and would take a more dominant power to pull the strings than what I think we have here with gaming the system to try and increase or reduce visabilty of certain topics.</p>

<p>The moderators take doxxing very seriously because the admins are strict and aggressive in their policy (and protecting their shareholders).</p>

<p>What is weird is that you can&#39;t link to sites that could contain doxxing, which is why you no longer see Voat links here.  A very strange policy as, in theory, a link to any external site could contain personal information, either now or in the future. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well put. Reddit is (of course) gatekeeped, but the crucial thing with gatekeeeping is that the majority needs to feel like its not. Otherwise the great freedom of speech US and western world would be like Russia or China.</p>

<p>And to simulate a free speech situation, vast amounts of disinformation is created so that the &quot;conspiracy nuts&quot; have something to talk about and places where they talk like r/conspiracy are taken under control.
So if I for example say something about Pizzagate, Snowden, James Corbett the JFK &quot;murder&quot; or that the earth is flat then I get updvotes and we can have a &quot;free&quot; discusiion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh how I wish people concerned with this could start using their brains. If rockets worked in the vacuum of space they would be the only vehicle in the universe that could move by <em>pushing against itself</em>. And NO this is not about disputing Newton but Newton is not applicable since a rocket cannot <em>act against itself</em> and by that produce a reaction. If the rocket was like a gun it would be another thing since the <em>chemical reaction</em> where rocket fuel is converted to gas would have something to act against - the bullet, and hence we would have a reaction.</p>

<p>The experiment you linked is not proving anything because the gas in the can <em>acts</em> against the fluid and end cap of the can, sending it in one direction and the can <em>reacts</em> by going in the other. This is not how a rocket works and the rocket fuel cannot act against itself. Wake the f. up.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.</p>

<p>Because rocket fuel <em>transforming</em> into gas is NOT &quot;propelling mass&quot; no matter how fast that chemical reaction is. And the gas molecules cannot bounce off each other because they can effortlessly spread in the vaccum. The molecules following the first ones will never catch up and interact because they have the <em>same speed</em></p>

<p>Think about it. And this <em>is</em> provable by experiment, just not these deceptive ones put on YouTube for obvious reasons. If you had a bottle with a firecracker in it suspended in that chamber, the bottle would move in pressure because the gas resulting from the cracker rushes out and meet resistance from the air, but NOT if there is a vacuum in there.</p>

<p>But the gas molecules begin in a semi-enclosed environment (diagram below).  Wouldn&#39;t they bounce off each other (and the chamber) before exiting into the vacuum?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here is a video similar to what you&#39;re describing where a vehicle in a vacuum is pushed by a bottle rocket.  Supposedly because the reaction acts against the car to push it forward.  If your assertion is provable by experiment (either a video or a paper with methodology), could you link me an example?  I can&#39;t find any experimental evidence to support your claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try to visualize what happens.. You have rocket fuel transforming into gas. That only means the molecules in the fuel starts moving more. So if you where in a &quot;rocket car&quot; - a big bottle on wheels and where sitting in it with a box full of magic tennis balls that starts bouncing around like crazy when you open the box, would this make the &quot;rocket car&quot; move forward? No because the balls finding their way out of the bottle would just disappear without interacting with the other balls. If the outside of the bottle was full of magic balls the scenario would be different because then some ball would bounce back into the bottle and there would be a pressure difference on the front wall pushing the car forward. Same with rockets. They work with sufficient air molecules outside the rocket, but not without them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting video, but it seems that the vacuum cleaner would create drag by pulling air across the car no matter how it&#39;s propelled.  I&#39;d be interested to see your experiment.</p>

<p>I like your bottle example, but I&#39;m having trouble following the logic.  Let&#39;s simplify it by saying the bottle is a stationary cylinder in space and there&#39;s only 1 ball.  Can you tell me which of these steps I&#39;m making a mistake in?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The bottle is stationary.  The ball is at the center moving rapidly toward a wall.</p></li>
<li><p>When the ball bounces off a wall, the bottle will move in the direction of that wall.</p></li>
<li><p>When the ball bounces off a wall, the ball will move in the opposite direction of that wall.</p></li>
<li><p>When the ball bounces off a wall, the ball will move in the opposite direction of the bottle.</p></li>
<li><p>On average, the bottle will remain in the same position because the ball hits all sides equally and the bottle spends the same amount of time moving in each direction.</p></li>
<li><p>We remove a wall from the bottle.  The ball and bottle continue moving normally.</p></li>
<li><p>The ball eventually bounces toward the exit.  The bottle is currently moving in the opposite direction of the ball.</p></li>
<li><p>The ball exits the bottle.  The bottle continues to move in the opposite direction of the ball.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine standing on a frictionless wagon throwing tennis balls on the front wall of the wagon and letting them bounce out the open back end. That would not make the wagon move forward because when you bend your arm and throw the ball, the wagon will move backwards the same amount it moves forward from the bounce. There must be something <em>outside</em> the system to interact with. Like air molecules. And again a gun is not the same because there the propellant acts on something that <em>leaves</em> the system - the bullet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been thinking about what you said and it really doesn&#39;t make sense.  If I expend 10J of potential energy to give 5J of kinetic energy into the ball and 5J of kinetic energy into the wagon, I have to end up with 10J of energy.  If the ball bounces perfectly and retains 5J of energy, then the cart must have the other 5J.  And if we&#39;re only working with one axis, that 5J has to be movement away from the ball.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see any logical way this can be wrong without allowing energy to spontaneously disappear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If u r saying that this sub is censoring people so that certain subjects cannot even be discussed, could you be more specific? Can you name a conspiracy topic that is not allowed to be discussed? I don&#39;t think this sub is limiting  the spectrum of acceptable discussion topics in any meaningful  was as far as dis-allowing conversation via rules and removal of comments or content, it seems to me literally no topic is taboo. If you are saying that they can be discussed, but might not be being heard due to advanced shadow ban tactics, like putting the most disruptive people in a shadow prison with a bunch of bots that never sees the light of day, I think it&#39;s totally possible. I&#39;d love to see some evidence.</p>

Threads were tagged with &quot;Hoax&quot;, deleted if they got too many upvotes, comments put into contest mode, etc. All completely unprecedented for any story on this subreddit. Compare that especially to the Obama/Russia story from this week that was instantly featured in the sidebar and allowed to fill up the front page with 10+ submissions to the same link.</p>

<p>There&#39;s an official <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> narrative that the mods and several power users try very hard to keep here.</p>

I&#39;ve found when you don&#39;t come off as overtly partisan one way or another that you do better here. I&#39;ve talked shit about Trump and Clinton on here and have gotten upvotes—people like to see someone who is to awake to how both sides of the political spectrum are fucked. </p>

<p>Instead of saying something like &quot;Fuck Trump&quot; and then defending Hillary Clinton—just as an example, not saying you&#39;d do that—you should remain open minded and fluid and you&#39;ll do well here.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had my fair share of downvotes but it comes with the territory. I&#39;ve stopped giving a fuck what other people think and if I get downvoted then o well. I was downvoted a ton today on <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> but I&#39;m not bothered—I still spoke my truth.</p>

No, but they push this Trump-Russia thing non-stop and conflate it with the Russian government supposedly interfering in the US elections via Facebook ads and Twitter bots.

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I actually tagged you because I hoped we might get to hear your side of things. I don&#39;t like people smearing your efforts around here and generally agree with your outlook on the problem that needs to be addressed, just didn&#39;t quite agree with the &quot;how&quot; during the big blow up and I ended up conflating the admins re-instating the other mods and you leaving as having been voted out. Appreciate your response.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Historically we had always allowed it because it wasn&#39;t destructive to the purpose of the sub as the volume of such submissions were minimal outside of some tragedy unfolding in real time. This recent election however laid waste to 99% of every half decent/half awful news sub and the refugees flooding to this free place eventually outnumbered the actual Conspiracy theorists in the community. Now we can&#39;t even discuss Conspiracy theories as they drown in a sea of trump-this/trump-that. It doesn&#39;t matter to me if the &quot;news&quot; is positive or negative about Trump. I enjoyed having a sub to discuss things outside of the MSM narrative, it&#39;s a shame that it&#39;s almost completely dead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not being dead &quot;yet&quot; is the only reason I attempted to fix it with drastic methods and admittedly failed to do so thanks to admin intervention.</p>

<p>The eternal stalemate which had been reached by the mods in trying to decide a course of action prompted my attempt to remove all the mods and only reinvite those who were &quot;Conspiracy-first&quot; mods.  Which is imho the problem.  We have mods who while they mean well in their &quot;free flow of information at all costs&quot; mindset, fail to realize that the actual cost being paid for their idealisms is the nature of the sub itself.  It time this will prove to be the salt that poisons the land.  These people here who&#39;s intent is to destroy the utility of this subreddit as a place to discuss the unthinkable are equally protected by the &quot;free flow at any cost&quot; school of thought.</p>

<p>It&#39;s analogous to the paradox of the antifa crowd saying that all immigrants should be welcome no questions asked, and when asked how they feel about fascist immigrants from the Ukraine being welcomed they suddenly find themselves trapped between idealisms and reality.</p>

<p>There are no easy answers, no perfect solutions but to do nothing is to relinquish your power to the mob, and the mob is a reactionary entity not a thoughtful one.  That&#39;s why subreddits like pizzagate etc have been quickly banned from Reddit.  The mob doesn&#39;t care about tomorrow, it&#39;s a selfish unthinking reactionary force devoid of reason and incapable holding itself accountable.  </p>

The objections to me ridding this place of destructive and hyperargumentative personalities only began after Trump won the election (it&#39;s probably more accurate to speak of it as Hillary losing) and the gridlock of the modteam that developed from this political rift is why the sub is now lorded over by hyperargumentative nobodies.</p>

<p>In my mind this place to still more free than almost any other subreddit on here.

Bernie didn&#39;t want to endorse, and was worried HRC would indeed lose, as is evidenced by several articles and the conference call he put out right after the Democratic Primary ended. Because of his endorsement he has come out stronger, because the DNC can&#39;t &quot;Nader&quot; him by blaming him for the loss since he didn&#39;t run 3rd party. He has since founded Our Revolution, which has taken 8 state parties from the DNC and put them in the hands of Progressive Citizen activists, as well as founding the Sanders Institute and continuing to campaign for his ideals. I do not believe Bernie was compromised.</p>

<p>He&#39;s literally the most popular politician in the country. They could rig it again and I&#39;m sure they&#39;re planning to, but you can&#39;t know what will happen when that does. I&#39;m personally looking forward to see what he does when they try it.

<p>Why the Bernie hate? He didn&#39;t want Trump as president so he swallowed his pride and endorsed the next best option. And now she has blamed her loss on him not being supportive, which was a giant lie. She threw Bernie under the bus but now he&#39;s attempting to reform the Democrat party even though he&#39;s an independent. I respect the man.</p>

He&#39;s still got generally good policies, at least domestically, and he is legitimately better than almost every single other person in DC even with his bending over backwards to try to get the one who cheated him elected. But I hate that they rigged the primaries and then he turned around and tried to get those criminals into the White House. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not why I go to r/wayofthebern. I go there because the mods are trustworthy and the people there are good. I&#39;ve been banned from about 15 different politics-related subs on this site despite not breaking any rules to warrant it. This sub and r/wayofthebern are the only two I&#39;ve participated so actively and not been banned to censor my dissidence. </p>

<p>How do you know?  I have gotten warnings by private message.  Shit, I have gotten warnings by permanent ban lol.  </p>

<p>Here is why I think they are good:</p>

<p>I fuck up and break the rules.  Sometimes I get banned for it.  When I message the moderators they respond.  I can pitch my case and sometimes they listen, sometimes they point out that I am a dick.  Sometimes both.  </p>

<p>I guess my point is that the moderators are accessible people.</p>

<p>Well, let&#39;s assume that the information we have about you (your account) is all the information about you that exists.  You are new.</p>

<p>You are showing an interest in joining an established community that is open to newcomers.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s assume that this community has rules.  Those rules may be worded in an open ended way to ensure that those who enforce those rules have the ability to enforce them based upon the information they have.</p>

<p>If said rule was:  &quot;Don&#39;t talk shit&quot; and they had two people who could be interpreted as having broken that rule what would be the proper course of action?</p>

<p>I would argue that the person that they don&#39;t know, that they have no information on, and that is trying to join their already established community would perhaps be the most likely to have broken the rules, broken them without knowing, and be in need of a warning. </p>

<p>As to the other person I don&#39;t think that it is important that you know how, when or why or if they may have been punished.</p>

<p>Your behavior is your own.</p>

<p>Either 95% of the people that come here are completely unaware that political affiliations exist to <strong>divide</strong> the population against one another, or they just choose to ignore it.</p>

<p>Everyone feels it&#39;s a great use of energy to fight about the smallest intricacies of an issue rather than focus on the greater issue in itself. Case in point this Vegas bullshit.  You&#39;ve got the legions of pro/anti Trump idiots who, despite hanging out on the conspiracy subreddit, seem to not realise that all politics, <em>US politics in particular</em>, is circus to keep you on the internet fighting over stupid bullshit.</p>

<p>This sub is the least constructive place to have these sorts of discussions because all you&#39;re going to do is spend days trying to change the opinion of some shit head from r/topminds who is just here because they think being the most ignorant person in the room is cool.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Either 95% of the people that come here are completely unaware that political affiliations exist to divide the population against one another, or they just choose to ignore it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think most of the &quot;people&quot; like you&#39;re describing are shills. And they DEFINITELY don&#39;t make up 95%, although I can see why their vote manipulating would give you that impression sometimes when they flood the front page with artificial bullshit. Even so, we frequently have popular topics here where we discuss how the powers that be use artificial partisan division to divide and conquer with wedge issues. THAT is what the real people in this sub tend to think more so than wanting to stick to partisan bullshit. Even the misguided Trump fans we have tend to have an awareness of the artificial political divide, they just see Trump as a wrecking ball who can do damage to the broken political establishment. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>all you&#39;re going to do is spend days trying to change the opinion of some shit head</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you think reacting to trolls is what this sub is for, then I&#39;d say you&#39;re using this sub the wrong way. Far better to ignore shills. Try actively participating in productive conversation instead of being a reactionary or trying to change the minds of someone who has no interest in discussing ideas openly. </p>

<p>If this place is &quot;a giant sewer that you have to wade through to find the tiny kernels of truth&quot;, then how would you describe the rest of reddit? A big pile of pure shit in an open field that doesn&#39;t have ANY &quot;tiny kernals of truth&quot; anywhere due to them having been censored and banned? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t advocate censorship, but I don&#39;t need 75% of posts to tell me that Hillary Clinton is a shitty person. I&#39;m not a Trump supporter, but I already hate Hillary for all the same reasons they do, I don&#39;t need constant reminders. She is irrelevant now, but the posts keep coming, which seems to simply be a tactic of T_D flooding this sub with politically loaded reposts from their echo chambers, not conspiracy theories. The mods need to just give them their space to vent in one stickied post at the top: why we hate HRC and all of our political opponents. The top comments are always a slight permutation of the same message, it becomes shitposting. I would much rather see this place as a discussion of things that affect everyone. For example: Ajit Pai just got 5 more years in his position as FCC chairman to gut net neutrality, lets talk about how that happened and who is conspiring behind the scenes to create an internet where the ISP monopolies are the only ones with a voice. That affects everyone... and I&#39;m just using it as an example, there is more going on in the world than the red team vs. the blue team. Let&#39;s start talking about a variety of topics. Come on mods, step up your game, give the T_D shitposters a stickied post at the top to appease them and give everyone else a space to discuss more important topics. You don&#39;t have to look too far to see that a bunch of white nationalists and T_D posters are consistantly posting the top threads here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.</p>

<p>Because rocket fuel <em>transforming</em> into gas is NOT &quot;propelling mass&quot; no matter how fast that chemical reaction is. And the gas molecules cannot bounce off each other because they can effortlessly spread in the vaccum. The molecules following the first ones will never catch up and interact because they have the <em>same speed</em></p>

<p>Think about it. And this <em>is</em> provable by experiment, just not these deceptive ones put on YouTube for obvious reasons. If you had a bottle with a firecracker in it suspended in that chamber, the bottle would move in pressure because the gas resulting from the cracker rushes out and meet resistance from the air, but NOT if there is a vacuum in there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try to visualize what happens.. You have rocket fuel transforming into gas. That only means the molecules in the fuel starts moving more. So if you where in a &quot;rocket car&quot; - a big bottle on wheels and where sitting in it with a box full of magic tennis balls that starts bouncing around like crazy when you open the box, would this make the &quot;rocket car&quot; move forward? No because the balls finding their way out of the bottle would just disappear without interacting with the other balls. If the outside of the bottle was full of magic balls the scenario would be different because then some ball would bounce back into the bottle and there would be a pressure difference on the front wall pushing the car forward. Same with rockets. They work with sufficient air molecules outside the rocket, but not without them.</p>
