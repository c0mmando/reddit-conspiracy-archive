       If you are gonna hide bribes or collusion or whatever... yer not gonna hide it in your tax forms. I think he just won't release them cause he knows it sends everyone into a tizzy to withhold them.

       I think he is not hiding anything specific, I mean any multimillionaire's tax returns are going to look criminal to us plebes. But they pay a lot of money to a lot of lawyers and accountants to make sure that is not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the real reason I think he hides them is because he can, and because it makes his enemies insanely angry.

       I don't know. Trump loves thr opportunity to flaunt his wealth. If his taxes showed nothing interesting except that he was mega rich I think he would have released them. He loves bragging about how successful he is.

       I don't necessarily disagree with that. But, I think he did some math here, and decided the outrage caused by keeping his taxes secret was of such greater advantage that he was able to set aside satisfying his narcissism.

       I'm going to guess that the total amount of people in the US who didn't vote President Trump, solely due to his taxes, is somewhere between 5-10 people total.

       Hard to say. This is a synthetic political issue that was rolled out in the days of Nixon, iirc. It is just one of the small pieces of the overall design to make politicians look criminal with no real proof. Don't get me wrong, they are all criminals imho, it is just in this one area I see it as a kind of trap, and they spend a lot of money to make sure their taxes at least look legitimate. The IRS also reviews all of these tax returns (of the super rich) very carefully already.

       The numbers show it all, when people see how the tax system works and how he makes it work for him many would awaken and follow. Is it necessarily good is the question? If people view and learn we will see a lot of unforeseen change.

       Probably something along these lines.  Due to his business dealings he may not have had to pay taxes for years due to capital gains/losses.  Itemization of many things that could be damaging as far as surface value.  Who knows?  Donny is very ego-centric, it's not my belief that he looks at itemized failures as acceptable, especially for publication.

       I think it's pretty obvious that he has done lots of business within Russia and used Russian banks for a lot of deals. This only matters because of the MSM narratives that Trump is Putin's puppet. IMO, it's not proof of where his loyalty lies. Give the man a chance. The news has never been more fraudulent in their covering of a president.

       Anyone who thinks he hasn't been under IRS scrutiny for most of his public life is dreaming. Wasn't he recently under audit? If they had found something, he wouldn't be president, he'd be sharing a cell with Wesley Snipes, Richard Hatch, and Martha Stewart.

       I’m sure he’s s taxes “look” shady to a non-businessman. Didn’t he say during the debates that he took advantage of loopholes and incentives?  I’m sure he took all kinds of write-offs that would seem unfair to most. As he said... he didn’t make them... he as a smart businessman used what was written to his advantage.

       Nothing illegal.  Most likely a low tax rate by using clever loopholes like everyone else at that level of wealth.  Also likely some business losses that might hinder his ability to get investors.

       Hard to say. This is a synthetic political issue that was rolled out in the days of Nixon, iirc. It is just one of the small pieces of the overall design to make politicians look criminal with no real proof. Don't get me wrong, they are all criminals imho, it is just in this one area I see it as a kind of trap, and they spend a lot of money to make sure their taxes at least look legitimate. The IRS also reviews all of these tax returns (of the super rich) very carefully already.
