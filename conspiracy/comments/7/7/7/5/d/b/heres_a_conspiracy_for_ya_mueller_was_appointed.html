       I fully expect people to ask for evidence. I'd encourage you to look at the timeline. Trump wasn't supposed to win.
       <a href="http://observer.com/2016/10/exclusive-wikileaks-guccifer-2-0-teaser-exposes-pay-to-play-and-financial-data/">
        Clinton roped as many people as possible into her campaign.
       </a>
       . Her whole campaign was done in a very reckless way and had many loose ends that were mysteriously swept under the rug (see: Seth Rich)... the feeling that this was a last ditch effort is undeniable.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a theory and I am posting here to get some discourse going. I am posting this as a conspiracy in a nonpartisan way and am hoping you guys can prove me wrong or help me connect the dots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: downvoting this post won't help hide this plausability. I feel bad for the idiots that think it will.
      </p>
      <p>
       u/terminalyo brings up a great point:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That doesn't fit with what actually happened, though. Rosenstein was basically forced to appoint Mueller due to the political fallout of Trump firing Comey. Rosenstein is a Trump appointee...and, as Deputy Attorney General, if his goal was to cover up a crime, he wouldn't need to appoint a special counsel to investigate Trump. If anything, that would increase the likelihood of evidence being uncovered and exposed to the wrong people (since it's not just Mueller, but a team of lawyers and investigators at this point), while also jeopardizing his boss.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I guess the big question I'd throw at your theory is: why do you think the appointment of a special counsel investigating Trump's ties to Putin would be a good strategy for hiding evidence of a seemingly unrelated Russia conspiracy?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The theory (poorly) postulated was insinuating that the Russian investigation was a way for them to get unsuspicious access to Russia-US interaction that may have been documented before even Trump's time.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the info that's surfacing -and to answer terminalyo's question- the FBI has sat on the fact that there were bribery kickbacks from the Russian government to people in power in the US government that were approving of the deal.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <a href="https://www.circa.com/story/2017/10/17/national-security/the-fbi-uncovered-russian-nuclear-kickback-scheme-months-before-the-obama-administration-passed-uranium-one-deal-with-moscow">
         Fifteen months before the 13 members of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, approved the sale of the Canadian company Uranium One to Russia’s nuclear arm giant Rosatom, the FBI began investigating persons who were connected to the Russian state corporation. The FBI said in court documents and in interviews conducted by Circa that by 2010 they had gathered enough evidence to prove that Rosatom-connected officials were engaged in a global bribery schedule that included kickbacks and money laundering. FBI officials said the investigation could have prevented the sale of Uranium One, which controlled 20 percent of U.S. uranium supply under U.S. law
        </a>
        .
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Let's be honest, Trump didn't have a choice and wouldn't be smart to deny a special council. Nor would he personally have reason to, or so it would seem up to this point.

       That doesn't jibe with recent evidence: official government documents exposed in articles published by The Hill this week which implicate the FBI in covering up damaging information regarding the Clinton Foundation and possible bribery of the same by interests related to the Russian government to steer control of US Uranium deposits into Russian hands.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you notice, at least two Hill articles related to the matter reference a confidential FBI source who was blocked from testifying before Congress about the Russia/Clinton bribery affair. The source apparently worked indirectly for Rosatom (Russia's state-controlled uranium production company) and
       <em>
        This means two things: 1 - Mueller *can't
       </em>
       destroy the evidence. There is a direct witness who was working as an FBI informant at the time. From the Hill article:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The information the client possesses includes specific allegations that Russian executives made to him about how they facilitated the Obama administration's 2010 approval of the Uranium One deal and sent millions of dollars in Russian nuclear funds to the U.S. to an entity assisting Bill Clinton's foundation. At the time, Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of State on the government panel that approved the deal, the lawyer said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       <em>
        Somebody
       </em>
       very high up in the FBI or Justice Department was actively running defense for the Clintons/Obama vis a vis this bribery scheme. They actively prevented the source from testifying before Congress, and threatened prosecution. From another article in the Hill:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The undercover client witnessed “a lot of bribery going on around the U.S.” but was asked by the FBI to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) that prevents him from revealing what he knows to Congress, Toensing explained.
       </p>
       <p>
        When he tried to bring some of the allegations to light in the lawsuit last year, “the Obama Justice Department threatened him with loss of freedom. They said they would bring a criminal case against him for violating an NDA,” she added.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not only does this implicate political figures such as Obama,
       <em>
        it calls into question the integrity of the FBI itself.
       </em>
       Robert Mueller was the head of the FBI during this investigation. Rod Rosenstein and Andrew McCabe are also entangled in this web, having direct knowledge and supervision of the case.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump’s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is absolutely huge. I think you're right about Mueller basically running cover for himself and others...but it doesn't appear to be working. If The Hill knows, a lot of other people know too. I'm eager to see where this all leads, and what consequences it could have for Mueller's role as Special Prosecutor.

       Assume they have 8 lawyers on the case, and a 40 hour work week, that's 390 per hour for each lawyer.

       So no, it's not "a lot" - but that wasn't the point.

       The point is that it is a fraudulent expenditure to begin with and the fraud hiding behind it is MASSIVE - and yes it is a lot!

       According to the Government Accountability Office , $180,000 per hour of Air Force One flight due to all the support required. Small note, the source data is from Oct 2016 so it doesn't assess Trump's travels.

       It's the concept. It's like turning a blind eye to Awan charging $499 for staplers. It's a slap in the face to the American people and to say it's not a big deal because it's a small percentage is perpetuating the problem.

       If you would prefer we all just let the bureaucratic fucks in office slide because the money they weasel out of us are just percentage points out of our paychecks... Just make sure you don't bitch when those percentage points are paying for a Wall.

       I get that anti trumpers are under the assumption that given enough time everyone has dirt, but if it hasn't turned up yet under the very powerful, professional and expensive scrutiny of some of the best investigators in the world... Maybe it's time to move on and stop supplimenting the false ideologies of partisan division.

       "Hasn't turned up yet?" I know every day feels like a week under this administration, but Mueller was appointed Special Counsel five months ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was 15 months between a Special Counsel and Nixon's resignation and over 4 years between an Independent Counsel and Clinton's impeachment. I think we can wait a little bit longer before we say enough is enough.

       As Special Counsel, Mueller has special legal powers to
       <em>
        uncover

       evidence of a crime. What makes you think that his appointment could in any way facilitate a coverup? In other words, how is Special Counsel Mueller any more equipped to cover up a crime than Citizen Mueller -- or for that matter, Deputy AG Rosenstein?

       Mueller's powers are legal in nature. He can subpeona documents or testimony for use in a trial. Almost anything he does pursuant to Trump/Russia will tend to leave a paper trail.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the plan is to delete something from a federal database, that would arguably be much easier for Rosenstein to do himself, or have an aide do unofficially.

       I strongly believe this is what's going on and the sides are just playing different. One says he's the devil and one is all buddy buddy because he has dirt on and could expose them both, or got over on them. Moved from one to the other.

       That doesn't fit with what actually happened, though. Rosenstein was basically forced to appoint Mueller due to the political fallout of Trump firing Comey. Rosenstein is a Trump appointee...and, as Deputy Attorney General, if his goal was to cover up a crime, he wouldn't need to appoint a special counsel to investigate Trump. If anything, that would
       <strong>
        increase
       </strong>
       the likelihood of evidence being uncovered and exposed to the wrong people (since it's not just Mueller, but a team of lawyers and investigators at this point), while also jeopardizing his boss.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess the big question I'd throw at your theory is: why do you think the appointment of a special counsel investigating Trump's ties to Putin would be a good strategy for hiding evidence of a seemingly unrelated Russia conspiracy?

       Politically, Trump doesn't have much choice. You may not agree but the fact is Trump's firing of Comey caused a massive political backlash; appointing a special counsel was the only way to defuse the situation, and Mueller was a choice with broad bipartisan support at the time. Mueller is still broadly popular even with Congressional Republicans, and if Trump were to try to impede his investigation, he'd be putting himself at great risk of impeachment; at the very least it would cost him a ton of political capital (which he's already short on).
      </p>
      <p>
       Again: you might not agree with those salient facts, but it doesn't matter. Even if Mueller is part of a conspiracy against Trump and for the Clintons, the important thing is popular perception, and everything I've said about perception is true. There's no way the Senate lets Trump impede Mueller.

       WASHINGTON — A Congress utterly fractured by partisan bickering came to rare bipartisan agreement Wednesday night as members of both parties effusively praised the selection of former FBI director Robert Mueller as special counsel in charge of the FBI's investigation into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election.

      <p>
       Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, called Mueller “a great selection” with “impeccable credentials.” Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the former FBI chief “has a strong reputation for independence, and comes with the right credentials for this job.” Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado said Mueller had “an incredible reputation.” “It’s the right decision,” he said Thursday morning at an event hosted by The Atlantic. “Let’s get the facts, let’s get the information, and let us proceed with all haste.”

       Ok? Many things are "bipartisan"
      </p>
      <p>
       usually when something is bipartisan it means it's bad for  America
      </p>
      <p>
       The only bipartisan support for him about people who are never trumper's and Democrats
      </p>
      <p>
       Some could fire call me and there wouldn't be enough political backlash to do anything. He was absolutely right to fire Comey . And it wouldnt be impeding an investigation (wich he technically and constitutionally is allowed to do)
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump should absolutely fite him if hes politicizing an investigation. Just because u hate trump doesnt mean its impeding an investigation
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as Rosenstein. It's obvious that when Trump fired Comey they were desperate to keep the Russia thing going. So they  worked to find the guy that was good at keeping bullshit investigations going. Neither sessions nor rosenstein are pro trump. Trump just hired the wrong people

       If there's one misconception I see all over reddit that I'd like to correct, it's this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Just because POTUS technically has a power, that does not mean he practically has that power.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an extreme example: as Commander in Chief, POTUS
       <em>
        technically
       </em>
       has full control over the US nuclear arsenal.
       <em>
        Technically
       </em>
       , if he felt like it, he could nuke Los Angeles, and
       <em>
        technically
       </em>
       all of his subordinates would legally have to assist him with this. In reality, if POTUS attempted this, he would be immediately removed from office and institutionalized.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason we grant POTUS these powers is for emegencies; practically speaking, abusing his powers costs him political capital.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yes,
       <em>
        technically
       </em>
       Comey worked at Trump's discretion and
       <em>
        technically
       </em>
       Trump was within his rights to fire Comey for any old reason. But practically, Trump's actions -- including inappropriate attempts to get Comey to exonerate Trump prior to the firing -- may have been attempts to obstruct justice. It's in the best interests of the American public that POTUS should not be able to abuse his powers to escape justice, so we have an investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       tl;dr: although on paper POTUS's reason for firing Comey doesn't matter, in practice it does.

      <p>
       Whilr there might be laws against nuking your own country. If he did that he would remain in office. He would have to be impeached by congress and voted on by congress. They probably would. But hr wouldnt be "immediately removed" the way your never trump fantasies work
      </p>
      <p>
       If we could do that. Barry obama wouldve been removed ages ago for incompetence.

       I'm sorry but you're mistaken. I'll repeat myself: there is no law against POTUS nuking America. But practically speaking, there doesn't need to be. If he tried it, he would be immediately physically restrained, and he could yell and scream all he wanted, but he would not be POTUS anymore because nobody would be taking orders from him. The VP would be sworn in eventually, but that would be a formality at that point. People aren't robots blindly following logical rules, after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       And like I said, that's an extreme example. No POTUS, Obama included, has ever attempted to nuke an American city. Obama never did anything to merit his immediate removal from power...clearly. That's a very high bar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me put it another way for you: POTUS has vast powers, but he can be impeached for abusing those powers. It's in the Constitution. And you can't abuse a power that you don't have and use. So if Trump did fire Comey to obstruct justice, that's impeachable. This is not a controversial opinion. It is widely accepted. That's why there's an investigation.

       Anybody that physically restrained the potus and defied a direct order. Would be charfed with treason and executed. Per military law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of the order.
      </p>
      <p>
       All people involved and secret service who didnt protect him woulf also be charged and sentenced.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens to the order is unknown but it woulf cause a crisis as a coupe had just been attenpted. One that u advocate.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the military arrests all conspirators trump would resume his duties pending an impeachment by congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are correct that no potus has ever nuked an American city. Trump included.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if obama did he would be impeached.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by your standards should have been restrained and removed multiple times
      </p>
      <p>
       Potus is potus until impeachment is finished. U obviously dont understamd the law (not that im advocating nuking a city)

       Presumably we'll never get a chance to test this theory out, but it's pretty clear to me that no American would be "executed" for saving an American city from a deranged POTUS. Again, people are not robots. They don't have to follow the letter of the law in extreme cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, by the "nuke America" standard, Obama should not have been restrained and removed, because he never attempted to nuke America. And no, I'm not comparing nuking America to firing Comey; I'm using the nuke as an extreme example to illustrate the limits of POTUS's power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please understand that these are not political statements I am making. They're not in support of or against anyone; they would apply to any president. The last POTUS who fired multiple people investigating him was Richard Nixon, and he would have been impeached had he not resigned in shame. He was actin within his power, but his actions were considered an abuse. Abuse of power is impeachable. That's still true today.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you, meanwhile, are well within your right to vote out your representatives who vote for impeachment; in fact that's exactly why the GOP-controlled Congress doesn't want to. Frankly they'd probably prefer President Pence, but their hands are tied politically unless Trump does something REALLY bad. Again...hence the investigation.

       This is a great point I did not think about. It pretty much debunks the entire theory.

      <p>
       Unless Mueller was pushed on Trump. A common thing people faulted Trump with during that period was taking whoever's side he had talked with most recently. He was also trying to extend an olive branch to the left to diminish the lashing out during the campaign.

       It's funny because there's literally no new evidence of any wrong doing related to the Uranium One deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole "breaking news" from The Hill is them reporting that the FBI was investing a man in 2010 that was essentially defrauding a russian state nuclear fuel company into awarding a contract to an american transport company without a bidding process, so no competition hence illegal (also all the bribery and collusion between Mikerin and the folks at TLI). But sure, this is totally related to the Uranium One deal.

       This is actually too much. If the Clintons don't go to jail over this mountain of corruption and evidence, then it is clear they have won(TPTB) . They have become too powerful, untouchable even by the worst of wrongdoings. Humanity is doomed.

       According to the Government Accountability Office , $180,000 per hour of Air Force One flight due to all the support required. Small note, the source data is from Oct 2016 so it doesn't assess Trump's travels.

       So 3 hours of flight is more than a month of Mueller's investigation.

       "Hasn't turned up yet?" I know every day feels like a week under this administration, but Mueller was appointed Special Counsel five months ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was 15 months between a Special Counsel and Nixon's resignation and over 4 years between an Independent Counsel and Clinton's impeachment. I think we can wait a little bit longer before we say enough is enough.
