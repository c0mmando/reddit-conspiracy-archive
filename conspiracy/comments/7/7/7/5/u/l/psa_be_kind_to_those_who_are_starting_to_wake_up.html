They might see some of the things they have dismissed in the past as &quot;crazy conspiracy&quot; and begin to see it in a different light.  </p>

<p>If you should be so lucky be included in their shock and surprise BE KIND.</p>

<p>I had to go back to a friend of mine and just reassure him that I could have nicer to him when he was coming to grips about 9-11.  His response to me was of gratitude and that as of late with the media and gov&#39;t he&#39;s been connecting the dots and waking up.</p>

<p>Please share any other suggestions of thoughts regarding this PSA.</p>

<p>Keep fighting the good fight and stay frosty!</p>

The occurrence of cognitive dissonance is a consequence of a person&#39;s performing an action that contradicts personal beliefs, ideals, and values; and also occurs when confronted with new information that contradicts said beliefs, ideals, and values</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes people panic and freak out. There should be a sticky about reasonable preparation and emergency planning with your friends/family. And once someone is reasonably prepared for the worse, you can&#39;t really worry about things out of your control.</p>

<p>I knew a guy that took the red pill and ended up taking his whole life saving (85k) and buying physical gold with it. It was a fucking disaster and he lost a ton of money doing it. We have to reassure people that might make irrational decisions in the panic state of realizing 911 was bullshit or things like this.</p>

<p>This sounds difficult to achieve as gold is constantly appreciating in value compared to the US dollar.</p>
