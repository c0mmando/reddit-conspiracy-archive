       At first, I was extremely confused about the new update mostly because I didn't know/understand the details of the actual collusion, so I'm making this post to help those that are still stuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton and Obama had struck a deal with Russian officials in 2010 which would sell 20% of US uranium. They sold this uranium to a Canadian company called Uranium One which would act as a proxy to cover their tracks while hundreds of millions of Russian dollars were being transferred into the Clinton Foundation (another proxy). One year prior to the finalization of the deal, the FBI had gained knowledge of a potential bribery scheme by Russia to give large sums of money to the Clinton Foundation in return for a massive amount of uranium, however, the FBI did not interfere.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Hannity explained it perfectly, "Clinton and her husband sold out America to the Russians as [money] flowed to the Clinton Foundation."
      </p>
      <p>
       If I made a mistake or left something out, let me know in the comments and I will update my post!
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I guess I didn't make this clear enough, but Hannity is NOT the source of the information I provided. I referenced him in a quote that I thought was a good tl;dr of the post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit 2: Most of my counterarguments to the comments arguing against my post are rather long so I'm very sorry to those who have/are willing to read through them (unless you enjoy it lol).

       What confuses me about all of this is that:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Uranium One has mining stakes accounting for 1/5 of US production.
       </li>
       <li>
        The Uranium is still in the US.
       </li>
       <li>
        95% of the donations were from one person well before Clinton was SOS.
       </li>
       <li>
        Even as SOS, the committee of 9 had to approve the sale.
       </li>
       <li>
        The nuclear regulatory committee had to sign off on it.
       </li>
       <li>
        All that was transferred was the mining rights that Uranium One owned.
       </li>
       <li>
        No one could have stopped the sale of a Canadian company anyway. They may have stopped the transfer of mining rights but there had to be clear evidence that it posed a threat.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       None of this is really news-worthy because it's all loosely connected and there has been zero impact. It wasn't like we just packed up and shipped Uranium to Russia, they still have to mine it.

       I hate having arguments with people who use identity politics to push a narrative. Yes, I agree that yournewswire is not always a reliable source, but you have done nothing to show me why I should believe Snopes is trustworthy.

       Further, I only reference Hannity in my post as someone who explains the situation, not the source of my information. And last but certainly not least, besides stating that I despise both Trump and Clinton in another comment, this entire post has nothing to do with Trump, so why should I be suspected of being a Trump shill?

       Your references and source material are pure conspiratorial trash and yet you still act like you're authoritative on anything about "ree-surch".  Only 2 types of people would dare reference Hannity: A Trump shill OR A incredibly naive and gullible useful idiot.  A suspect the latter.

       On a personal level, what is your issue? You really confuse me and here's why: apparently you have a problem with me using the term "identity politics." I'm not sure what your reasoning is but it could be one of two things: you think it doesn't exist or you hate that I called you out for it. If you think it doesn't exist, I'm sorry for you. If you hate that I called you out for it, I apologize that I made you upset, but typically facts win arguments, not assertions based on the person reciting those facts.

       Nope; nobody here trust the FBI.  The new information is that there is a witness who is documented as an undercover operative who was silenced by the previous admn's DOJ from speaking out on the Russian bribery and collusion with politicians/administration officials and a direct effort to bury said proof from being disseminated to Congress or Senate

       My apologies, the source was the FBI (or at least for the articles I've read), but then this definitely does raise questions. Why would they indirectly throw themselves under the bus? Was this released because of the uprising in doubt regarding the official narrative of the Vegas shooting? Time to do more research!

       This sounds way more unlikely and unbelievable than Trump colluding. Why would the Russians help Hillary if they supposedly had this huge money deal with the party that is vehemently anti-Russian expansion.

       I, OP, can tell you for certain that I despise both Trump and Clinton. And, although I can't really prove this, I am not a Russian nor was I paid to spread the truth. There was no evidence to support Obama's claim that the Russians helped Trump, but there is evidence to support that the Russians made a shady deal with Clinton.

       "There's no evidence to support the claim that the Russians helped Trump" except 3rd party claims from Google and Facebook that Russians did in fact campaign for Trump (via fake news)... and Trumps social graph leaning heavily baltic, with numerous documented meetings with Russian officials... and DNC hacking traced to Russian orgs like Fancy bear... and the massive Russian bot net / Troll farms... and so on.

       To suggest it's JUST Obama claiming the Russians are involved is so hilariously misguided that I HAVE to assume you're being dishonest. Unless youre just using that as a Trigger word to garner support from the Right.

       If you still believe that the DNC hacking was traced back to Russian organizations, you will not be taken seriously here. Julian Assange has hinted (however not completely proven yet) at Seth Rich being the person who supplied Wikileaks with the DNC emails. If you did not know, Seth Rich was a staffer for the DNC before being murdered in a supposed "robbery" where the "robber" did not steal a single item of Seth's possession. This is a conspiracy in itself too.

       Lol this has nothing to do with common sense. For one who believes in common sense over research, a remark that states that Assange is working for the Russians would be typical. You're probably unaware of this (because common sense &gt; doing research), but Wikileaks has over a decade, that's ten years, of consistent 100% accuracy regarding its posts. Here's a great example: prior to 1822, it was common sense to believe in geocentrism. The research that proved otherwise (heliocentrism) was there, but no one wanted to believe it because it challenged the norm.
And here we go again with people accusing a quote that summarizes the situation as a source. He is not the source of my information, he just so happened to summarize my post rather well.

       Except for last 4 years of wikileaks life, it's been in geopolitical limbo, with Assange in hiding. In that time period, they've never released anything contrary to the Kremlin's wishes, acting as a consequence-free tool to destabilize the west. But that must be something you missed in your "research" right? For someone who sure loves doing your own "research" you've certainly proved in a short time you're incapable. Let me know what Alex Jones thinks of this.

       I'm not suggesting that Wikileaks is anti-Russia. All I'm stating is that Wikileaks does not favor any specific nation, all they want to do is shine a light on the corruption that plagues these nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not disagreeing with you that Wikileaks caused an interference during the time of the US election, and plausibly the election itself. If the Podesta leaks caused Trump to win, then that just goes to show how many Americans stopped putting up with Clinton's shady activity.

       It's not really that difficult to believe. I mean if you're at his knees and revere him as a god as many users here (which is contrary to the general rules of true conspiracy theorists... because he is an establishment) I can see why. Pretty much every release he's made has been a pointed attack on western values and the US government. You have to start asking yourself "Why?" Wikileaks completely neglected to cover Crimea, which was one of the most successful covert land grabs of this decade, because it was made by Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, because you and other users here idealised him, you refuse to ask questions. Which, in the context of this Sub, is also hilarious to me. How ironic a sub about not being a shill can become one so easily because... what? He cucked your government?

       I think you misunderstood. Why would Putin fuck over a political candidate he has sway over? (As in, the uranium deal.) It doesn't make sense to piss them off. That's only a hypothetical, Hillary Clinton didn't even have enough clout to meaningfully decide on the uranium issue.

       No, because in the real world, if corruption exists within a government, it's the job of the people to publicize the corruption in an attempt to get rid of it. If Trump/Russia collusion were true, I would undoubtedly take a stand against Trump.

       There is an abundance of evidence telling us that the Trump/Russia collusion is fabricated. EVERYONE have been up his ass for two years, and nothing. Did you miss when congress recently came out and admitted they had found no evidence of trump Russia collusion, or evidence of russian influencing the votes. And they really did not want to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you believe the wikileaks are legit? 
FYI, liberals loved him during the Bush/Iraq thing.
Because I could link you a email chain where they(Hillary/dnc) discuss this Russian collusion as a last resort. Wikileaks have 100% proven trackrecord, many have gone to courts to prove them wrong, and have lost every time. Julian have even questioned why congress nor any other government body have come to him and asked him what is true. This was before Julian Assange allegedly got abducted and half the internet stopped trusting him.

       Riiiiight. Because everyone has been super open minded about all the FBI sources here over the past 6 months right? People here only believe the source when it's something they like to hear. That's why larps from 4chan get posted here all the time and people are like "oh shit!"

       "There's no evidence to support the claim that the Russians helped Trump" except 3rd party claims from Google and Facebook that Russians did in fact campaign for Trump (via fake news)... and Trumps social graph leaning heavily baltic, with numerous documented meetings with Russian officials... and DNC hacking traced to Russian orgs like Fancy bear... and the massive Russian bot net / Troll farms... and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       To suggest it's JUST Obama claiming the Russians are involved is so hilariously misguided that I HAVE to assume you're being dishonest. Unless youre just using that as a Trigger word to garner support from the Right.
