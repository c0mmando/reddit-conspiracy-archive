        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello, saw a post yesterday about Masons.  Having not listened or read anything online except unnecessarily paranoid rants that come across unwittingly via nature of the internet, I have not searched out much on masons because I wanted to experience the lodge first.  I haven&#39;t made up my mind yet, and I was just wondering... what&#39;s the deal?  </p>

<p>The only hang up I have is that I don&#39;t know what it is I&#39;m committing to and that men run the organization so it could be good, it could be bad, or it could just be a waste of time.</p>

<p>Is there anything I need to be aware of, or questions to ask the lodge or myself before doing my EA?  I had old family in the organization and I have been tired of being isolated in the world and was using this as a means to continue growing, be mentored, and spend time with other men helping people and exploring the unseen world and how to make a positive impact.  Everything of course sounds fine on paper.  I don&#39;t necessarily see any spiritual fruit or advanced living going on at the lodge though which is what first made me question it, then on top of that the homogeny of people.</p>

<p>AMA, open to advice, just want to hear responses before next lodge meeting when I&#39;m going to look at doing my first thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on what your looking at. </p>

<p>Lucifer literally means light-bringer. So if you believe that Jesus brings light, then I mean yeah. That&#39;s what the word means. </p>

<p>If your asking instead if Jesus is Satan, beelzabub, devil, Saddam&#39;s bed companion, well no I wouldn&#39;t think so. </p>

<p>Now why your asking ME this, I don&#39;t know. Masonry has nothing to say on the matter. Besides a couple of quotes about Masonic things in the old testament, there&#39;s not much religion specific in the ritual work. </p>

<p>As for myself, I consider myself a Deist. I think the big G is so... wow. That we can&#39;t comprehend it. And it&#39;s foolish to try. Very often I want to ask my more religiously vocal friends &quot;really?  You think God fits into that tiny little box?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>was jesus lucifer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to point out that while individuals are going to give different answers to this, Masonry itself offers no dogmatic views (other than a belief in some form of immortal soul/afterlife). You can have any religion and believe in any deity you want. <em>(I was recently debating with another Mason this past week on whether or not Lucifer exists and is mentioned in the Bible at all. The other Mason was adamant that Lucifer does not exist and is never mentioned once in any religious text. That is far from advocating Lucifer worship).</em></p>

<p>When people suggest that Masonry is convincing people to worship the devil, they quote one passage from Albert Pike in Morals and Dogma. I&#39;m pretty sure the majority of Masons have never read Morals and Dogma. It is never brought up, nor taught in lodges.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read and studied the annotated Morals and Dogma for a voluntary Master Craftsman program in the Scottish Rite (that even non-Masons can sign up for). The passage in question is Pike questioning the oddity of the name Lucifer, and semantically what that name means. But the very same passage decries Lucifier and does not advocate worship of Lucifer.</p>

<p>In another section he calls Lucifer false. But this is the quote that has everyone convinced that all of Masonry is about devil-worship.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Apocalypse is, to those who receive the nineteenth Degree, the Apotheosis of that Sublime Faith which aspires to God alone,
and despises all the pomps and works of Lucifer. LUCIFER, the Light-bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give to the Spirit
of Darkness! Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish Souls? Doubt it not! for traditions are full of Divine Revelations and Inspirations: and Inspiration is not of one Age nor of one Creed. Plato and Philo, also, were inspired.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Morals and Dogma is public domain. You can Google for it, find a copy and read the entire passage in a larger context if you think I&#39;m editorializing it by only including this one paragraph. But look at what Pike writes here.</p>

<p>He merely points out what the name Lucifer means (light bringer) and then says Lucifer uses light to blind feeble, sensual and selfish souls. This is very much in line with others who suggest the Devil quotes scripture to deceive.</p>

<p>Pike also very clearly starts the paragraph stating that Scottish Rite Masons aspire to God alone, which completely contradicts the oft-stated notion that Pike is telling people to worship the Devil.</p>

<p>The definition of a secret society is one where its members are secret. Masonry does not hide its membership. Most members openly display Masonic rings, symbols, emblems on their cars, etc. Lodge websites list officer names and contact information.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t seem very secretive.</p>

<p>Masonry has secret modes of recognition (grips and passwords) just like every other fraternity on the planet.</p>

<p>While most of what you will read about Masonry on the internet is false, actual real exposes with our secret passwords and grips can also be found with a simple Google search.</p>

<p>We have no real secrets.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of weird, or speculative, or odd, or true information on the internet. Sure, we&#39;ve had some nutjobs pass through. Just like any other organization.</p>

<p>There&#39;s this conspiracy theory that we &quot;run the world&quot;, or that we&#39;re the illuminati or that jay-z control us or something. </p>

<p>Masonry is a fraternity of men that want to make themselves better. Whatever that definition is to you. Some guys didn&#39;t have many friends growing up, so this helps them gain new friends. </p>

<p>Some men want structure in their lives. </p>

<p>Can Masonry do something that the elks / kiwanis / odd fellows / your local church can&#39;t? That&#39;s up to you. That depends on what you&#39;re looking for. </p>

<p>Each lodge is different, just like any other group or club or church or whatever. You have to find the types of guys that fit in with best. </p>

<p>But for all the people that say &#39;masons run the world&#39;, I say that I would agree that the top 1% of the 1% probably make most of the decisions in the world, but whether or not they&#39;re masons has nothing to do with their wealth or success. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>P2 or Propaganda Due was an Italian Lodge that lost its Charter some 40 years back. They made the mistake of bringing in an unsavoury character, Licio Gelli, a far-right nationalist, who leveraged his influence in the Lodge to bring in some Italian politicians and other power-broker types. This gave him even more influence in the lodge, which he used to control the members public/private lives outside of the lodge, even resorting to blackmail to get what he wanted. When the Grand Orient of Otaly got wind of what was going on, they pulled the lodge&#39;s Charter and severed all ties with them. The members of the lodge, led by Gelli continued to operate, more like a mafia or cartel. They embezzled funds, bankrolled political appointments and elections, and even resorting to murder before it was all shut down by the police a few years after they were all disavowed as Masons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Explain to me the logical fallacy you perceive in that statement. Please speak plainly. </p>

<p>As it see it you got 3 choices. Take me at my word, believe I am a liar, I am not &quot;High Enough.&quot; </p>

<p>Well, does it seem to you I am lying? Have I not continued this conversation, treating you with respect, though admittedly a little chippy at times.You have been not entirely conciliatory yourself.  And I do apologize if you were offended. On the whole do you feel I have mistreated you?</p>

<p>Besides all the evidence that exists including the exposes of our ritual, the Facebook and web pages of our Grand lodge. If there was more to it, wouldn&#39;t there be more proof than a PDF talking about new Rome and Atlantis? </p>

<p>Sure I guess you could be right, but I am an empirical man, the evidence I have experienced for myself says all of this is nonsense. You bring up logical Fallacies in your argument to me and don&#39;t see the following formal logical fallacies in your argument:
Appeal to probability – is a statement that takes something for granted because it would probably be the case (or might be the case).</p>

<p>Argument from fallacy – also known as fallacy fallacy, assumes that if an argument for some conclusion is fallacious, then the conclusion is false.
Base rate fallacy – making a probability judgment based on conditional probabilities, without taking into account the effect of prior probabilities.
fallacy – assumption that an outcome simultaneously satisfying multiple conditions is more probable than an outcome satisfying a single one of them.
Masked-man fallacy (illicit substitution of identicals) – the substitution of identical designators in a true statement can lead to a false one.
Jumping to conclusions – the act of taking decisions without having enough information to be sure they are right.</p>

<p>For the final, All I can leave you is this from our thread with MANY active Masons on it: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/freemasonry/comments/72gf30/mm_monday_when_someone_tells_you_youre_not_high/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link">https://www.reddit.com/r/freemasonry/comments/72gf30/mm_monday_when_someone_tells_you_youre_not_high/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link</a></p>

<p>You will choose for yourself, and nothing more I can say will change your mind so, as much as I truly enjoyed the debate, I think we are finally done here</p>

<p>You never heard of a Shriners hospital? You know at the University of Minnesota we got like 5 hospital buildings that were built with our money? 
My lodge last month donated 8k to our food shelf. With their buying power and the match from our state charities fund they&#39;ll turn that in the over 100k of food. </p>

<p>I mean..  I could go on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Re: this and your previous reply, yes you have written well though-out replies, even in the face of venom.  Your more recent reply showed empathy and humility I did not see before.  Also to be fair, yes, you and your lodge sound like you could be just good noble folks.  The things you have done have improved the community, and am thankful to you for all the above.  The elements we disagree on, the global pedophile blackmail ring as well as illuminati-crafted satanic pop-culture, does present a roadblock to trust.  Especially since they are often veiled in &quot;good deeds,&quot; charities, cartoons, science, history, these people claiming to be masons have begun to poison the masonic well.  To the onlooker, it&#39;s easy to see just an entire well of poison.</p>

<p>Again, I know of no such ring or cabal and I should be close enough to have at least gotten wind of them. The illuminati was disbanded centuries ago. I am afraid all the poison that is seen is merely the poison of humanity itself. Or rather, could it be that all talk of a global conspiracy simply be a scapegoat so we do the have to look at ourselves and ask what we have become?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well..  it&#39;s not. Why shouldn&#39;t that be taken into account?</p>

<p>Occam&#39;s Razor
Realistically, explain to me why the author of this article would know more about Masonry than me, a Mason? I have first hand experience, they do not. It also fails to grasp the basic structure of freemasonry. Lodge-&gt; Grand lodge, etc.</p>

<p>First off, I&#39;m not going to read all that. That&#39;s not the issue. It&#39;s one person&#39;s ideas and beliefs taken from context. Great. Good for them. </p>

<p>It&#39;s the author&#39;s interpretation. For example &quot;This fourth Beast represents both old Rome and revived Rome.&quot; Who said?  Has the Author talked to John personally and conveyed that this was his intended allegory?  I interpret it as a flying spaghetti monster. What authority does his ideas have that makes his more valid than mine?  And now we are at it, who IS the author? From what I scanned, it says that no less than 4 different places as the new Rome. They all can&#39;t be the new Rome and there&#39;s also well, Rome. The author uses a Psychic as a reference. Atlantis? Really you buy that? Sorry, don&#39;t buy it.</p>

<p>If the endtimes are supposed to be so much upon us, why haven&#39;t the happened yet?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a fellow Masonic apologist, let me clarify three things.</p>

<p>Masonry doesn&#39;t have a cabal or top-down control. There is no inner circle or secret masters. Each jurisdiction (state level in the US) is independent. We have a Grand Lodge of Nebraska, who rotates leaders every year. There is literally no one higher than that. There is no international group who tells us what to do.</p>

<p>Secondly, while I&#39;ve seen headlines of individual Masons who have committed various crimes (including pedophilia) that is a sad reality of any large group of human beings. There will be some rotten apples. The same thing applied when I was in the Marine Corps. A couple idiot Marines raped an underage girl in Okinawa and people were questioning if that represented all of the Marine Corps. I&#39;d like to believe it does not, though I&#39;m wondering if the Marine Corps does have a bigger problem than they think given the recent photo scandal.</p>

<p>Lastly, we do take great care to prevent child abuse in particular. We have three youth organizations (Demolay, Rainbow Girls and Job&#39;s Daughters). I believe at least Demolay and Rainbow Girls performs background checks on the adult volunteers to prevent any bad seeds from having close proximity to the kids. If I recall, the Grand Lodge of Texas refused to allow any Masonic connection with Job&#39;s Daughters because they were not performing these background checks. The organization said it didn&#39;t have the funds to do so, but the Grand Lodge wasn&#39;t willing to take the risk of allowing a predator near kids if Masonry was going to associate itself with it. <strong>We actively take steps to prevent child predators.</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s all in the Bible. That&#39;s where the Masons got it from. You can find it there yourself without becoming a Mason. What&#39;s unique to Freemasonry is <em>how</em> we teach that knowledge. And it&#39;s not something that should be read in a book, it&#39;s something that should be experienced first-hand for it to make any impact on you. That&#39;s just human nature. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be difficult to source a document stating that Mason&#39;s weren&#39;t involved with the Kennedy assassination, and impossible to prove a negative. Do you consider a document held on a website and citing a book about the occult and &quot;hidden history&quot; to be a good primary or secondary source?</p>

<p>I&#39;m given up trying to convince people that Masonry is nothing but old men drinking and arguing about the price of hot dogs, but together in a friendly we like each other kind of way. No one who believes in a conspiracy theory thinks themselves stupid enough to trust any document on the internet anyway, since Mason&#39;s control the whole thing, right?</p>

<p>So two things for you to think about: if we have the grip, the power, and the control to orchestrate something like assassinating the leader of the free world, why would we be so foolish as to allow some jackwagon to post about it on the internet?</p>

<p>And secondly, since I doubt any Masonic teaching, article, book, or newspaper write up would convince you of said hot dog cheapness, drinking, or oldmanishness, why don&#39;t you come down to a local lodge for dinner and see it yourself? If we&#39;re full of shit and evil man killers, you can witness that and trust your own eyes, instead of a youtube video. </p>

<p>As a Mason, this is half true. We do always say you have to ask to be a Mason. In truth, you have to be willing to volunteer of your own free will to join, but since membership is down, I do think we are encouraged to recruit to a certain extent.</p>

<p>I hate to use corporate speak, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;re down: I think we&#39;re rightsizing. After WWII there was a massive influx of men into the fraternity. We&#39;re returning to pre-war numbers. We never could have nor really should have sustained a lodge in every small town. </p>

<p>Either way brother, I wish you luck. If you&#39;re GL allows it and you know good men, go for it. I personally think a man needs to be seeking something before he&#39;s ready to enjoy the full package, though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, I missed it in the small print of the album titles. I would direct you to the associated <a href="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/fiction/marilyn_manson.html">Marilyn Manson link</a> which points out &quot;The title of the song &quot;King Kill 33°&quot; is less a reference to Freemasonry than it is to an obscure anti-masonic conspiracy theory&quot; as well as clarifying that what some people perceive to be Masonic paraphernalia/symbolism, is not necessarily recognized as such by Masons though you did link to the one picture that clearly show him sporting a Masonic ring, as opposed to some of his many other &quot;goth&quot; accoutrements. So, yeah, &quot;Kill King&quot; has nothing to do with a Masonic degree. I started to read your (apparently 40+ page) explanation of the &quot;concepts&quot; but didn&#39;t make it much beyond the phrase &quot;Masonic sorcery,&quot; before realizing it wasn&#39;t going to be anything more than <a href="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/alt.illuminati_FAQ.html#kennedy">Mr. Downard&#39;s</a> mental circle jerk, perhaps as bolstered by the always humorous <a href="http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/rivera_a.html">Jack Chick</a>. I&#39;m sorry, while there may be some Masons out there who dabble in sorcery or &quot;magick,&quot; there is no such thing as &quot;Masonic sorcery.&quot; It is nonsense, and I&#39;m not sure how I can explain that any further. </p>

<p>With all due respect, I&#39;m not sure if &#39;my camp&#39; refers to me alone, or to Masons/Mason redditors in general, but much like you I&#39;ve provided some <em>links,</em> which are certainly not the same as <em>citations</em> whether provided by you or me. Though my good Brother Trevor at the Grand Lodge of BC &amp; Yukon does provide citations at those links, since for him Masonic (and anti-Masonic) research is more or less a full time job, as opposed to me reading and commenting on Reddit when I have a few spare minutes. I don&#39;t know if you treat /conspiracy as a full-time job or just a fun place for conjecture, but for myself and many other members of /freemasonry, we generally don&#39;t need to provide citations because we&#39;re speaking from firsthand knowledge (as opposed to your conjecture), and are just having a friendly conversation here, not writing academic papers. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So... anecdotal then?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Entirely, but we&#39;re exchanging conversational anecdotes not having an academic discussion. Of course our collection of anecdotes on reddit, with a wide variety of sources and opinions would probably make an excellent academic source, in the sense that such hints exist about freemasonry, if the right person sat down and collated them. Unless the minutes I took at my meeting last week are somehow less valid than ones taken by some dead Masonic Secretary of a hundred or more years ago, in terms of explaining who we are and what we do. </p>

<p>That aside, I&#39;ll have to fully check out your links again at another time (though they are all somewhat familiar), as it&#39;s well past my bedtime, so I&#39;ll leave you with a quick comment on them and your question. </p>

<p>To say that &quot;the lodge [is] corrupted in its upper levels&quot; is to fundamentally misunderstand the structure of Freemasonry. I am the upper levels of my Lodge, there being only one Past Master more senior to me who regularly attends meetings, and sadly he&#39;s starting to lose it upstairs a bit. There is nothing that could be said or done at the District or Grand Lodge level that could cause corruption among our members, particularly not without being strictly against policy put in place by that same Grand Lodge. What form do you envision this corruption to take, because I just can&#39;t picture it. </p>

<p>As far as the articles, the headline in the first is very misleading. As I read the article, the gangs were infiltrating police departments, and Masons were using their extradepartmental connections through Lodge to weed out the criminals, not the other way around. </p>

<p>The second article only states that many rich and powerful, or famous, or members of law enforcement or the judiciary were Masons, because &quot;secret records were found.&quot; Well, we already knew that because 1) Freemasons love to toot their horn about who else is or was a member, covering the rich and famous, and 2) Like many other professions, there exist &quot;affinity Lodges&quot; for Masons who are police officers...we had a railroad Lodge and an aviation Lodge in my former region in addition to my own Australian expat Lodge, but nobody ever accused them of conspiring to do much of anything beyond the generic &quot;they&#39;re Freemasons, so they have to be up to something&quot; stuff. Not to mention the fact that the Grand Lodge of England released 200 years worth of membership records not long ago, which in my mind just falls under the tooting of our own horns again. It doesn&#39;t say how they &quot;kept [a] grip on Britain&quot; or in what way being a Mason reflected on their position of power, especially given the thousands of Masons not in positions of power, and the hundreds of other groups those people would have belonged to, except that we&#39;re an apparently &quot;secret group&quot; that members openly discuss on the internet, advertises its meetings on billboards and/or in newspapers, and publicly releases old membership records. </p>

<p>P2 was an aberration, and they had their Charter pulled and their members (or at least leadership) disavowed as members once the &quot;upper levels&quot; got wind of wrong doing...as it should be according to our rules. The fact that they continued operating as a pseudo-Masonic lodge while going on to do even more crazy illegal shit can no more be held against us than if you started a &quot;Masonic lodge&quot; in your garage and starting sacrificing babies would make that a thing actual Masons do. </p>

<p>As to the Jesters thing, I hashed it out a bit elsewhere in the thread, and probably some in the linked thread too (I don&#39;t actually recall), but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever heard about the Jesters beyond maybe the name before that popped up, despite my wife&#39;s (late) great-uncle being a Past Imperial Potentate of the Shrine. I&#39;ve never attended a Jester event, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever even met a Jester, but if they&#39;re doing seriously illegal shit, they should be kicked out. </p>

<p>My opinion on these links is that there is no corruption <em>in Freemasonry</em>, but that doesn&#39;t mean there haven&#39;t been/aren&#39;t corrupt Freemasons. As I stated elsewhere, the whole idea behind the Jesters is a group that requires you to be a Freemason but doesn&#39;t require you to do anything Masonic, encouraging guys who want to get in on that to do the bare minimum to meet the Masonic requirement and then ignore (Craft Lodge) Masonry in favour of that other group thereafter. Maybe if American Masonry loosened up a bit, there would be a need for &quot;party groups&quot; and we could keep a better watch on who we let in, knowing that they&#39;re not just using it as a stepping stone to membership in another group. The same goes for the P2 lodge - a few bad people slipped through the cracks, but the Grand Orient shut it all down when they saw what was happening. And then the people continued to be bad people even though they were no longer actually Masons. A mistake was made, the &quot;upper levels&quot; didn&#39;t encourage it, they corrected it. </p>

<p>I feel that freemasonry is akin to government, the church, etc. Evetything important is infiltrated and subverted. You may deny corruption based on the apparent sanctity of your branch, but that seems a bit disingenuous. You guys wield power. Power begets corruption.</p>

<p>To write off your corrupt members after conviction or to deny any corruption takes place seems silly. I know for a fact Freemasons have taken advantage of your brotherhood in my town, especially in regard to legal matters.</p>

<p>You guys  have been civil and that speaks volumes. I honestly wouldn&#39;t expect the same treatment from many other large groups being questioned.</p>

<p>Perhaps the town I lived in had an evil, pervasive lodge, and that influenced my opinion. That doesn&#39;t mean every lodge is corrupt.</p>

<p>I hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I feel that freemasonry is akin to government, the church, etc. Evetything important is infiltrated and subverted. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In what way?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You may deny corruption based on the apparent sanctity of your branch, but that seems a bit disingenuous. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, I deny that corruption based on my experiences with 4 Lodges under 4 different independent Grand Lodges. Not to mention 3 other <em>mostly</em> independent Supreme/Grand bodies. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You guys wield power. Power begets corruption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some few of our members wield power. Some few of those may be corrupt. History shows that a few have been, but such is the nature of man; joining Masonry isn&#39;t supposed to make us perfect, but it should make us strive to be better men, not better than our non-Mason peers, but better than we were before. Some individuals don&#39;t take those lessons to heart, and some will be kicked when found to be breaking serious laws. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>To write off your corrupt members after conviction or to deny any corruption takes place seems silly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Silly how? We cut ties with people convicted of serious crimes because we don&#39;t want criminals in our organization. With that in mind, I&#39;ve never said there are no corrupt people in the organization, only that once their corruption is found out, they inevitably cease to be members. It&#39;s not encouraged like in the P2 lodge, where corruption was so rife, they dropped the whole lodge from existence. What are we supposed to do, let them hang around and just hope they don&#39;t reoffend? When one lawyer is disbarred, you don&#39;t write off the legal system, but when an entire Bar Association is disbarred, you probably want to review your standards and ethics. Most examples of corruption in Masonry are individuals, but they still make us review our membership standards when they occur. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know for a fact Freemasons have taken advantage of your brotherhood in my town, especially in regard to legal matters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way I see it, a lot of businesses have a friends and family discount, being a Mason simply expands your circle of friends and family. If you&#39;re hiring someone to work for you, or even to perform a service, are you more likely to go with a complete stranger or someone with the same qualifications whom  you&#39;ve know for years? In that sense, being a Mason is like a word of mouth recommendation. As far as legal matters, you&#39;ll see from other posts in our sub that being pulled over/busted by a fellow Freemason could go one of two ways. 1) He might throw the book at you, knowing that as a Freemason, you should hold yourself to a higher standard (this same argument could be made for Christians or any other group that professes to a stronger morality than the average person). 2) He might extend to you, as a Brother, the courtesy of a warning for a minor infraction, probably the same as he would for cousin Susie, Bob from next door, Jim from bowling league, Sally from the PTA, or Pastor Brown. Conversely, some of the guys in our sub talk about how they specifically don&#39;t put Masonic emblems on their cars because they know they succumb to road rage, and don&#39;t want to give people the impression that <em>that&#39;s how *</em>Masons** drive.* Its similar to how lots of cops give a free pass/warning to other cops and their families for minor things, whether they know them or not. Of course the major things are a bigger issue which I&#39;ll address below.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If a mason has a case in front of a Mason judge, you&#39;re telling me the hand signals and dogwhistles have no bearing on the outcome of the case?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Setting aside the fact that I have no idea what dogwhistles you reference, no. If a Mason appears before a judge who is a Mason, especially in a smaller town, they probably already know each other to be Masons (or both have no idea), so hand signals across a crowded courtroom probably aren&#39;t going to accomplish much. If they do, you run into the same issue as with the cop where either you get held to a higher standard or you get the same level of preferential treatment that would be offered to anyone else the judge was on friendly terms with. </p>

<p><strong>A lot of people hear and latch onto about the part of our Masonic oath where we swear to keep the secrets of our fellow Masons, but conveniently miss where it goes on to specifically except &quot;murder, treason, and other violations of the laws of God or the ordinances of the land&quot; from the secrets we should keep</strong>. And we all know that the Masonic punishment for serious legal transgressions is expulsion from the order. So if Brother Jim tells me he&#39;s in love with his neighbor&#39;s wife I won&#39;t let that slip to his wife, but if he tells me he raped his neighbor&#39;s wife, I have no obligation to keep that secret and am more likely duty bound (as a good man and Mason) to report him for it. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s corruption for people to play favourites with their friends and family over the general public, then I guess Masons are corrupt, but so is pretty much everyone else. Otherwise, all we&#39;re guilty of in increasing our circles of <em>friends and family.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Catholic Church officially states that no Catholic can be a Mason. In practice, plenty of Catholics are Masons, Masonry does not exclude Catholics in any way.</p>

<p>There is a common misconception that Masons all hate Catholics. That misconception seems to be at the heart of this theory that Masons would want to kill a Catholic president.</p>

<p>Where I live (Omaha) we have a very large Catholic population, and tons of Catholic Masons.</p>

<p>Catholicism started their own version of Masonry called the Knights of Columbus. I believe there is an unofficial &quot;Green Hat&quot; club for people who are both a Knights of Columbus and a Mason. But I&#39;m not Catholic and I don&#39;t know much about them.</p>

<p>I tried reading the link to see what Masonic symbols might be connected to JFK and I honestly stopped reading when it is mentioning Macbeth imagery (non-Masonic) and &quot;roughly&quot; 32 miles away.</p>

<p>If you are aware of any specific symbols tied into the JFK assassination you think might be Masonic, let me know and I should be able to confirm if they are a Masonic symbol or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First of all, the Jesters is a subset of the Shriners, not the Scottish Rite. The Shrine was founded to be the party arm of American Freemasonry in response to it becoming overly restrictive with regards to its public image following the Morgan Affair. The Shrine balanced this party aspect with great charitable works, most notable their network of children&#39;s hospitals. The only thing that the Shriners have to do with traditional Masonry is that they required you to be a Master Mason (originally either a 32° Scottish Rite Mason, or Knight Templar in the York Rite) before you could join. This led to <em>some</em> men only joining Lodge in order to join the party in the Shrine, often never returning to their Lodge after being accepted into the Shrine. The Jesters then became the party arm of the Shrine, presumably formed for the members who only joined for the party and still thought there was too Masonry going on. I don&#39;t know much about them beyond that, except that they have made headlines a few times in the US with regards to things like hiring prostitutes. Criminal charges like that generally see Masons expelled from their Lodge. </p>

<p>your PIN is secret. You&#39;d hope your coworkers don&#39;t know how much you make unless you&#39;re in a union. You don&#39;t go around posting how much money is your bank account. You don&#39;t post your cell number on the back of your car. Unless you&#39;re Equifax, you don&#39;t go around publicly displaying your social security number (if a US citizen)</p>

<p>That last bit is a great comparison. How do you prove you are you to a bank, car dealer, medical professional? You have a number that is unique to you.</p>

<p>Masonry is the same way. How do I prove myself to be a mason when I travel to another lodge? We have modes of recognition that we learn to gain entrance into a lodge. that is all they are good for. Nothing more.</p>

The &quot;higher degrees&quot; aren&#39;t significantly weirder than the early ones, just a series of morality plays which any &quot;regular joe&quot; Mason can undertake if he so desires - it&#39;s only the KCCH and 33° that you can&#39;t simply decide to do (at least within the Scottish Rite - they are more like honours conferred for long and dedicated service to Freemasonry. </p>

<p>As to your friend&#39;s dad saying it&#39;s Satanic, some people say that about anything that doesn&#39;t line up perfectly with their church&#39;s view of how the world should be - I&#39;ve heard Christians fling that term around about other Christian churches, such  as the Catholics and there Mormons. The closest we come to being Satanic is allowing men of different beliefs to come together and maybe even say Amen together at the end of a non-denominational prayer. </p>

<p>There are definitely some secrets there but the really fucked up stuff will be happening in the societies higher up the &#39;pyramid&#39; so to speak. Though some of their members will certainly be Masons as well.</p>

<p>The funny thing is a lot of the ones at the &#39;bottom&#39; are really quite accessible to the public. For example I&#39;m pretty sure anyone can join the Rosicrucians so long as you pay the membership fees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a mason but have been interested in the esoteric stuff because I&#39;m curious like that.  What I&#39;ve gathered without their help is that, yes, it&#39;s probably a worthy endeavour if you&#39;re up to the task.  Whether that is the case has more to do with your character and values than anything else.  Either way you&#39;ll only know if you try, unless you dedicate yourself to learning outside of the box.  If you&#39;re not a fit you won&#39;t rise to the information that they feel they need to shelter society from.  So there&#39;s not really a risk that way.  Personally I&#39;m not down with contractually binding myself to things as a general rule so I probably won&#39;t be joining.  But overall it seems like it&#39;s a decent organization (although each lodge is different).  A word of caution about the secret stuff - people are kinda brainwashed and tend not to think for themselves.  Information can be easily misinterpreted or misunderstood.  You&#39;d be going in with the risk that you could be one of those people who tend to do that, as most people do.  That might be of concern for you.  But you won&#39;t know until you try. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We don&#39;t shelter information from society.</p>

<p>Look at how old Masonry is. Think about the penalty of discussing science as the reason for the way things are and not accepting that G-d made everything the way it was. There was a time when you could be put to death, your property seized and your family name ruined if you did such a thing. Ask Galileo how the church felt about his theories? He spent the rest of his life under house arrest for his scientific theories and findings.</p>

<p>These things were discusses by Masons. Secrecy kept them alive. Not so much for discussing the Trivium, but for discussing the Quadrivium from a scientific standpoint.</p>

<p>Now, the quadrivium is general education in modern-day society. Masonry has evolved beyond being the educational structure it once was to a symbolic representation of that time.</p>

<p>Then there is the personal journey that is taken by the individual. It means something different for everyone, but the bond of Brotherhood is there for everyone.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t explain it. It has to be experienced. It&#39;s not the secrets. It&#39;s the friendships and bonds you form with people. I could reach out to a Brother half way across the country who has no idea who I am on a personal level. If I ask for help and he is able to give it, I will get the help I need.</p>

<p>within the confines of the lodge it&#39;s shared.  sort of.  there are levels to that.  the higher levels i imagine are sharing certain things like &quot;everything is everything&quot; and the consequences of this design.  it&#39;s not easy to absorb or grok for some people for the same reason people don&#39;t want to see the ugliness in themselves that they&#39;ve long suppressed as this will seriously fuck with the ego(trap).  there&#39;s a reason why you don&#39;t give children firearms without instruction.  same thing.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does outing mean to you? Why is it so damned important to you that you can&#39;t answer a question? It&#39;s at the heart of issue. If you think there is a link between Masonry and the Roman Empire, what is it?  </p>

<p>So you think that by showing that a Mason can get upset? That I&#39;m frustrated that you can&#39;t answer the question? Well guess what? I am. All I have to GO on is what you wrote. That is the issue. What you wrote makes no sense. And you are incapable of defending what you wrote but have to instead of my &quot;tactics&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. Not really. </p>

<p>What is it about?  I pulled this from my Brother Mason. Thus is the best explanation I have come across:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My answer is a little dramatic.</p>

<p>The world is a shitty place, and there&#39;s not much that we can do about that on the macro scale. What we can do,  however, is give men the opportunity to change and improve themselves using moral tools, allegory, and teachings in order to better implement the moral values they already had. By doing this, a man not only changes himself, but the world immediately around him - and sometimes reaching even further than that. So, we can&#39;t change the world on a macro scale, but we can change it many, many times on a micro scale. <em>Masonry is an organized effort to save the world, one man at a time.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I agree with that, that seems very low level to people who have already accomplished that.  If that is the end goal, it seems the craft is FAR more general and base level than I understood.  A man should be able to do this himself in my opinion or have a relationship with God that forms him in a better way.  If that&#39;s where the craft stops at 3rd degree, where do all the other ones go?  I figured 3 degrees would be useless to me.  I&#39;m trying to grow, and I&#39;m wondering if there is anything in there that would help me accomplish that goal so I can improve my surroundings </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believed I could find marvels and wonder of all sorts within the craft but the more masons I talk to the more aghast I am at why I ever thought that.  Perhaps it is in the craft and they just do not see it.  My family said they thought I&#39;d find what I was looking for,  but it seems like if that&#39;s the truth an intentional smokescreen is placed in front of me to push me away from it.  What I observe and what I am told are at total odds , and using deduction results in scenarios but none of them have enough data to be the most likely case.  Which is why I opened this forum before starting my own research.  My Dad said he didn&#39;t join because it just seemed like a good ol boys club.  Seems the same to me.  Perhaps it is my location and the masons I&#39;ve interacted with and perhaps not</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every lodge is different. Some have monthly philosophical discussions during their meetings. Others might be more social, where you can take up those topics in a less formal way if you&#39;d like, but it isn&#39;t required. I&#39;ve seen brothers switch lodges to one more suited to their interests before and there was no ill will for that choice. </p>

<p>There are also the appendant groups. If you wanted to engage in more charitable work than your lodge normally did, and didn&#39;t want to organize new fundraisers yourself, you might look to join the Shrine and raise money for childrens hospitals and the like. If you wanted to look into other philosophical questions you could look into the degrees of the Scottish and/or York Rite. </p>

<p>Masonry is a lot of things to a lot of people, and doesn&#39;t have to be the same thing for everyone. </p>

<p>Personally I am interested in joining the Shriners, once I can responsibly balance that commitment with the rest of my life. My lodge gives money to charities, but my role is typically voting yes or no, and I&#39;d like to be more directly involved in charitable works. I may join Scottish Rite at some point, I find it interesting but it isn&#39;t necessarily calling to me at this point in my life. I think as far as philosophy goes, there is more for me in blue lodge that I should explore before expanding my views. Another man may take an opposite view, wanting to dig further into the symbolism and moral teachings. Neither view is wrong, and the fraternity is well served by having both of us, becoming better people in our own way.</p>

<p>Is that what this post is about?  Recruitment?  It&#39;s own members decry this expansion initiative.  Perhaps it&#39;s all an attempt to normalize?  Or do they like to come out of the shadows occasionally to &quot;fact check&quot; for us?  It&#39;s a bit of having it both ways: nothing&#39;s secret except some of the secrets, and nothing is bad but some have done bad things, you wouldn&#39;t understand, you&#39;re not a mason, the only way to know is to experience it.  That last one is right out of the CIA cult-shaping playbook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, this reply was the closest you have come to helping me understand with an ounce of human approach, by giving a semblance that you&#39;re at least aware of masons doing &quot;bad things.&quot;  In doing so, it shows honesty, as opposed to &quot;trust me&quot; or &quot;trust that&quot; or shirking responsibility cause &quot;crimes of our forefathers.&quot;  Humanity is everyone&#39;s responsibility.  So in turn, how can it be that masons do bad things, and yet remain masons?  Follow up, how can it be, that a fraternity only for good has rules which would allow for people who do bad things to rise through the ranks?  I have eyes to see my friend, so you can probably understand my mistrust.  Wouldn&#39;t your org, with all the answers, welcome a skeptic asking tough questions?

<p>The question shown a fundamental misunderstanding of the structure of the lodge. The 3rd degree is the highest rank a Mason can have.

<p>Have all the answers. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This shows another fundamental misunderstanding. Masonry has not given me any answers. It has only made me ask better questions. But along with the questions it also provides me the tools both literally and figuratively to answer them for myself. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome a skeptical</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course. I am willing to be tried. Have I not stayed here to speak to you? Have I not attempt to answer your questions? That you think I lie complicates the matter, but what can I do to change that? Would you have me break a promise I made  before God to satisfy your curiosity? How moral is that?</p>

<p>As for the final question, (it&#39;s not going to be is it?) all I can tell you is what I have come to know. What can tell you, it&#39;s an initiatic experience. If you haven&#39;t experienced it, you cannot know. You can hate the answer all you want. But Even if I broke my obligation to do so. The best way to describe it for me is sex. </p>

<p>Stay with me here. </p>

<p>You can read all about sex all you want. You can read the karma Sutra to know different positions, study the bio-chemical changes in the brain. Track the endorphins released. The biological part of the act and the merging of chromosomes. All this is available to you in any library. </p>

<p>But until you&#39;ve experienced it for yourself will you truth understand it?</p>

<p>If you go to my Grand Lodge website, go to the resources you will generally find a book that does describe in plain English what are considered Masonic Secrets. It has as well every working tool and describes it&#39;s use by both operative and speculative masons. But that won&#39;t tell you how I&#39;ve been able to use the concept of the 24 inch Gauge to change my life so that I make more time for my wife and family. I can&#39;t tell you that feeling I had when I stopped before telling a harmless white lie to my wife with the thought &quot;What would my Brothers think of me?&quot;</p>

<p>Nor can I describe the feeling of kneeling at an altar and saying (roughly) the same thing my father and great grandfather whom I had never met did before me over 100 years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I think I&#39;ve been overestimating that phrase and just realized it.  My standard of good men is higher than what is being discussed there - it is the only conclusion I can draw based off he feedback I&#39;m getting.  And then it stops at better and doesn&#39;t concern itself with elite or even great.  I enjoy my lodge and fit, everyone is nice.  They completely scoped me out and have answered my questions as they&#39;ve come up.  I don&#39;t ever get to think long enough to get to my deep questions or get a private discussion though.  I thought it was a more esoteric and philosophical society than what I&#39;m being conveyed here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What does outing mean to you? Why is it so damned important to you that you can&#39;t answer a question? It&#39;s at the heart of issue. If you think there is a link between Masonry and the Roman Empire, what is it?  </p>

<p>So you think that by showing that a Mason can get upset? That I&#39;m frustrated that you can&#39;t answer the question? Well guess what? I am. All I have to GO on is what you wrote. That is the issue. What you wrote makes no sense. And you are incapable of defending what you wrote but have to instead of my &quot;tactics&quot;. </p>
