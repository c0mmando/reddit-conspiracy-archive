        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Young kids today have no frame of reference. All they know is now. Well kids, the USA used to actually be a great country to live and raise a family in, then 9/11 happened and the mass paranoia infected everyone’s minds. That’s why instead of playing outside and building social skills and long lasting friendships, you have to stay in and play your video games. Wouldn’t want those pesky kidnappers to get you.</p>

<p>It’s why you can’t get on a plane without being cooked in a machine and sexually assaulted by a high school dropout who can hardly read. Its why your government is spying on you and knows everything you do at all times. It’s why pretty soon you won’t be able to enter a store without going through extensive security screenings.</p>

<p>I’m very glad I grew up in the 80s/90s. Kids today have no idea what they missed out on. They’re slaves to pleasure and don’t even know it.</p>

<p>Also, we were nowhere near as politically divided. People just chilled. Now everyone is a fucking wannabe activist. And people were nowhere near as obsessed with celebrities. People were people. Now it seems like everyone puts on a fake personality and tries to be whatever the media is pushing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m so old I remember when loved ones could walk you right on to the plane, and I remember ashtrays on the arm rests and people smoking in planes...high school was smoking pot and drinking beer, no zombie drugs...no cell phones, no internet/social media....we used pagers and finding quarters to use a pay phone was the most stressful thing we faced. This was the age of Tupac when you’d have to go to Tower Records and get the <em>cassette tape</em>....CD’s were the most advanced technology when they came out and you’d have to buy a <em>CD player</em> and those were luxury items....if you had a question about history you’d have to use an <em>encyclopedia</em> or go to the library. Such amazing times I miss it so much. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went to a fairly fancy seafood restaurant a few nights ago for my Dad&#39;s birthday. It&#39;s one of those places that hasn&#39;t changed since 1983. It has a piano bar with a dude playing songs from the 40s, and there&#39;s a glass chandelier. </p>

<p>We were sitting there for 10 minutes when he commented that it feels so different without the think veneer of blue smoke filling up the room. The lighting never changed, but the atmosphere was so different. This is a guy who stopped smoking a decade ago because of lung issues, complaining about the lack of smoke in the air. It made me miss it too. Kinda funny if you think about it, cause it obviously better without the smoke, but man... that atmosphere. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. I miss taking off early from work and landing at the bar on a Thursday while being able to light up as the bartender passes you that <em>insanely</em> inexpensive beer. Smoke in the air most definitely added a certain ambience to things. Especially a jazz bar haha</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m Canadian so they&#39;ve done their best to hammer down on us smoking for a long time now, but I smoked for a few years back when I was in my early twenties... I quit for a while until I went to Europe and you could smoke wherever you wanted. Something special about being able to sit at a bar with a few strangers and everyone is smoking and drinking and watching sports. The ritual is important, and the ritual is stronger when smoking is involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>do it anyways. fuck them, its hard AF to get caught vaping. I blow the vape inside the toilet paper holder things (the industrial ones) so it dissipates without being overly visible from the top of the stall.</p>

<p>but these fucking slavedrivers don&#39;t even want you to have a smoke break when work is dead and there are no customers for hours these days. its stupid.</p>

<p>I always went out back and smoked cigs/weed whenever I wanted. made sure to look for jobs with inadequate security because of it.</p>

And no I don&#39;t hate younger Generations I just I just feel a little sorry for them because they will not get to experience some of the simpler freedoms that older Generations have and with that being said more more is taken away each generation just like you said even my parents who grew up in the 70s and late 60s had more freedom than I did and at the same hand they did not just like the generation now they have more and less freedoms all at the same time.

    <div class="md"><p>Looking back at my childhood, I have no idea how my parents did it. Was born in the early 80s and by the time I was 8-9 years old I was just parading around town with my friends, riding on bikes all over the place and had to be home by dark. Would physically go knock on my friends doors without calling because we didn&#39;t really have cell phones at the time, at least not easily accessible ones until I was in high school. I would get into all sorts of shit that my parents had no clue about and as long as I was home by dark they didn&#39;t give a shit, sleepovers all the time and playing video games. I&#39;m sure kids do similar shit nowadays but if I&#39;m being honest, it&#39;s going to be hard for me to let my son have that kind of freedom when he&#39;s that age because the world seems so fucked up now that we have such easy access to information. I&#39;ve sat and contemplated so many times, when should I let my boy go off with his friends and do shit by himself? When do I give him a cell phone? Who do I trust to watch my kid? Who&#39;s house do I let him sleep over? I haven&#39;t even reached that point yet as my son is only 4 but I lose sleep over it sometimes and I still have years to go before any of it is going to be a situation. Fuck, now I have anxiety great.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s safer now as well, the instant access to information distorts reality a bit though, considering every bad thing that happens is going to be plastered all over the net. So as a parent with one kid and no experience raising any children I get anxiety when I am constantly reading terrible stories of pedophilia, murder etc. etc. </p>

<p>While they may not be common occurrences, I&#39;m still going to have those things in the back of my head when I let my son go do stuff with his friends. I imagine once he gets older and I think he can be more self sufficient I&#39;ll be a little less concerned but I think I&#39;ll always have some sort of anxiety about his safety because he&#39;s all I got really.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely, I actually don&#39;t use social media outside of Reddit with the exception of keeping in touch with family on FB once in a blue moon but I am constantly keeping up with news be it local, national and international which usually consists of chaos and destruction. I think it just puts irrational fear in people including myself, though I&#39;m not really concerned about myself just my child and even without the constant fear mongering I&#39;d still be concerned just not to the degree that I am currently. Hopefully some things will change between now and the time he&#39;s wanting to go out and do things on his own but I truly doubt it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll check it out. It&#39;s just the constant fear that everyone has now. That and the smart phone apps and social media that distract. Most people I know my age don&#39;t even have hobbies. Instead of facing their fears and confronting the truth, they passify themselves and each other with nonstop agenda driven distraction. If they faced the fear they are essentially unaware of at this point because of how tptb have conditioned it, the possibilities would open up and they&#39;d feel comfortable perusing whatever passion they have. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When Donald Trump <a href="http://www.gregpalast.com/election-stolen-heres/">stole the election</a>, and the Republicans held the Senate thanks to gerrymandering with &quot;surgical precision,&quot; I had that sinking feeling that we were in for a rerun of the George W. Bush era -- only this time, we started out from a much worse position. Things are turning out worse than expected. The guy sitting in the stolen Supreme Court seat may be the deciding vote in the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/blog/5-things-know-about-wisconsin-partisan-gerrymandering-case">Wisconsin gerrymandering case</a>. There, 48 percent of the population get to control over 60 percent of the legislature.</p>

<p>Other than that, yes, HRC played dirty in the primaries. If Hillary had taken office, we would have been guaranteed little to no progress. With Donald Trump in office, we will be treated to slipping deeper into the George W. Bush hole -- and we never got out of it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was listening to a podcast the other day and a guest talked about when he went to a highschool recently and as he reflected on his younger days with the students, the idea of &#39;selling out&#39; came up, and how that was a real barb to throw at another musician/artist/whatever, calling somebody a &#39;sell out&#39;. The kids he was talking to didn&#39;t understand the concept. They all wanted to sell out. They all strived for enough Instagram followers to sell corporate goods through. The dreams of each individual kid, more or less, was to &#39;sell out&#39;.</p>

<p>I legit would love to go to war with them economically and socially.

<p>I would tell them if they were more than cheap whores, they would say no to contracts, and sacrifice their careers instead of selling out. that money and popularity amongst retarded brainwashed fools was no indication of success, and that the best thing that could happen for the world was if they failed and the competitors that DIDNT succeed took their place out from under them and totally replaced them,</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Kids today have merely ok childhoods but then fall off a cliff when they hit their teen years. Teens today are under such incredible pressure that didn&#39;t exist when I was growing up in the 80s. I had my first job when I was 13 and then I paid for my college with various part time jobs and graduated with no debt. There wasn&#39;t even such a thing as student loans back then. People worked their way through college. That was the norm. That is just not possible in today&#39;s world. I can&#39;t imagine having to sign a mortgage sized student loan at 17 just to go to college. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t hate the younger generations. I feel sorry for them. I don&#39;t have kids of my own because I saw the writing on the wall 20 years ago. That great sucking sound that Ross Perot warned us about happened. The future we were promised was sold down the river and never materialized.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well!  I didn&#39;t mention whether I was homeschooled myself.  I was, and yes there are things that I wish had been done differently, but the gifts and benefits far outweighed the problems.</p>

<p>I am not a smart person, but homeschooling prepared me for the real world in a way that regular schooling never would have.  I would have been the special needs kid, over-medicated and bored out of my mind.  Instead, I started working a productive, well-paying job immediately out of high school.</p>

<p>When it came time to actually sit down and go to school, I started at Calculus and aced my way through all the hard science I needed in order to get into medical school, while working full time.</p>

<p>My parents were largely absent from my education from about the 8th-grade on.  I learned to teach myself.  It was a fucking terrible struggle.  I still resent not have summers, all the things I missed doing as a teenager, and so on.  Yet on the flip side, it gave me an iron will, a talent for self-teaching, and a huge edge over most other people despite (like I mentioned) not being a particularly smart person.</p>

<p>I think everyone finds something to resent about their parents.  It helps give you the impetus to spread your wings and fly away and form your own household.</p>

<p>I&#39;d do it again in a heartbeat, but honestly if I were to do it again, I&#39;d say fuck the high school curricula and jump into community college at 16 and get a 2-year degree by 18.  Then the world is open, you can do whatever you want, you are 2 years ahead of everyone else, and nobody cares about your lack of a high school diploma if you have a college degree.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You overlook two world wars and a miserable depression between them that things were anything but good for ordinary people even before those came along. My parents and grandparents understood more about the realities and hardships of life and how precious and beautiful it all was no matter how difficult or desperate it ever got and that&#39;s what they always tried their best to impress upon me. </p>

<p>When you don&#39;t have much you get really good at &quot;making-do&quot; as we called it. You don&#39;t have much of a choice but to get creative and inventive if you don&#39;t want to get utterly depressed and despondent in that kind of a situation and the interesting thing about that is that it comes with a great deal of satisfaction with whatever the small victories you can win in that battle and it only makes you more enthusiastic and determined to fight the good fight with it and win some more.</p>

<p>Children are innately curious and creative, you can buy all kinds of toys for a toddler when what you were actually given in my time would have been a glass milk bottle and a handful of clothes-pins that you&#39;d tirelessly work away at trying to simply put them into it.</p>

<p>They make a nice klink when they go in, too. It&#39;s not the toy, it&#39;s the challenge, and that&#39;s where the &quot;action is&quot; not being amused or entertained but actively exploring and engaging with elements of the real world that is quite simply all around you and entertaining yourself with it. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t begin count how many trees I climbed up to the top of before I was 10 or how many times I walked atop the backyard fences from one end of the block to the other, not to mention any old block that I was curious to see the back as well as the front of the houses that were on it, just for the sheer deviltry of it and no one really to stop me. </p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t just me, either, but most of my friends and classmates that had the same kind of attitude about exploring just about anything. Dragged my bike under a barricade and down an embankment one bright summer day to ride straight down the middle of a five mile stretch of a freshly paved and flawless freeway before it had any lines painted on it or was open to cars. Cranking-up and coasting-away the likes of which you can&#39;t begin to imagine as I literally flew along it with the hum of the tires wind in my face and not a soul around. I mean I know I wasn&#39;t supposed to do it but how could I pass up an opportunity and an open invitation like that?</p>

<p>Never, ever, thought of myself as particularly daring or devil may care and yet I surely was by today&#39;s standards and no, no kids today are very likely to ever know that kind of freedom and exhilaration that&#39;s just there for the taking and being so attracted by it you&#39;re just drawn right into it without a second thought.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My own kid days were in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s and far more enjoyably primitive and adventuresome than that, I can assure you. </p>

<p>Nothing was &quot;fashionable&quot; except that your clothes were reasonably clean and the holes were patched, not that we particularly cared. Rapid transit was a bicycle, most of which we re-built and refurbished from antique frames that virtually every home garage always had a few hanging around in that someone was glad to get rid of. Rims, spokes, tires tubes and chains were all cheap and easy to get and nothing could be anymore satisfying than finally pumping-up  the tires and rolling-out and into a world that was a whole lot larger and full of so many more things than it did before that moment arrived.</p>

<p>The punishment for any of our petty crimes, routine trespassings, and misdemeanors we were discovered to have committed consisted of being kept in and confined to our rooms. </p>

<p>Freedom and liberty had a real meaning to us because we actually lived outside and barring bad weather and the setting Sun there was nowhere better to be than out and about. Our parents never worried or fussed. Their youth had been spent in the dog days of the depression where you were expected to make your own fun and games and enjoy being alive. </p>

<p>Nowadays you need a crowbar to pry the kids out of their rooms and the world outside is this big scary thing they&#39;d never consider venturing out into alone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>me either personally. I&#39;m offended that they want to tax weed as &#39;recreational drugs/alcohol&#39;. very offended.</p>

<p>that money should go to the growers, and the point of sales, and the state should merely benefit from people having excess funds with which to hire more people, invest in property etc.</p>

<p>but nooooooooo we can&#39;t have one of the PRIME BENEFITS of legalization, which is lower cost to the consumer because its a FUCKING PLANT.</p>

<p>even heroin should be cheap as shit -- I&#39;m talking like 50 cents for a hardcore addicts single fix. but if they legalized that shit it would be twice street price and the crime would just continue and they&#39;d say &quot;SEE LEGALIZATION DIDNT WORK!!&quot;</p>

<p>pompous sons of bitches who feel they are entitled to everyone elses money.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not even against liberal social programs, in fact, often I&#39;m for them. the question is where the money comes from -- and it shouldn&#39;t be this.</p>

<p>its like because they know people deal with high taxes on other shit they&#39;ll deal with it too.</p>

<p>and it also keeps the whole charade of &#39;drugs are for the rich, bust the poor!&#39; going.</p>

<p>because these right wingers can cry and scream about drug use all they want, all the while their congressman is doped up or more likely on coke on the daily.</p>

<p>rules don&#39;t apply to the OWNERS, don&#39;t you know. they DESERVE the right to do what they want with their own money, they don&#39;t have to be &#39;productive&#39; slaves like you.</p>

<p>and when prices are high and the substance is legal, it crushes street dealers who would sell at lower prices.</p>

<p>never once did I imagine i&#39;d see marijuana legalized in some places, yet higher prices than on the street.</p>

<p>I&#39;m kind of glad I can buy weed from friends, or even harder drugs at lower cost than the system would provide for non-insurance or prescription related purchase.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t even be against a sales tax if it were legal,</p>

<p>but it would be the same flat sales tax as other non-essentials. there would be no extra easy money for the state just because they knew it would fucking sell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not &quot;legalisation&quot; that&#39;s needed, particularly in the case of cannabis it&#39;s &quot;de-criminalizing&quot; it and restoring it to the rank and file of useful plants that anyone can grow for their own particular purposes and there&#39;s something like a few thousand of those besides smoking or eating it and getting a pleasant buzz for a few hours. </p>

<p>It&#39;s those &quot;other&quot; potential uses that caused the government to criminalize it in order to protect the status quo in the first place, not a few jazz musicians sparking-up in alleyways between gigs.</p>

<p>Henry Ford developed an organic plastic from cannabis oil that was lighter and about ten times stronger than steel and even went so far as to make a car out of it that he also used cannabis oil for fuel in before the law prevented that development to go any further. </p>

<p>There&#39;s also nothing that&#39;s made from cotton that can&#39;t be made out of hemp, but also made far better... longer lasting, softer, more durable and far cheaper all at the same time. The plant can be grown almost anywhere not just in the warm southern states, is virtually immune to insects and disease, and can be mechanically harvested and processed far easier and more economically on both a large and small scale, to boot. Some of it&#39;s medicinal properties were also well-known and starting to be further explored when the axe fell. So you can get some idea of the all the vested interests that wanted and needed to put a stop to any of that.</p>

<p>drugs help me WANT to work and not care what I do or be so judgmental on myself and everyone around me.</p>

<p>I dream of using hard drugs and injecting a lot, ive been clean for awhile but I really don&#39;t want to be anymore.</p>

<p>it just sucks getting physically addicted, not getting high anymore and being sick 24/7 when you don&#39;t have shit.</p>

<p>I personally would try to abstain from those drugs, but often times I&#39;m not sure I care anymore. money and availability are the only things stopping me now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was pretty &quot;multicultural&quot; in those post war years with all kinds of Europeans who left the wreckage behind and had their own kids here, just as my own, who were born here did right after WWII but we were all simply kids packed in together in public school classrooms who found each others different backgrounds curious and interesting which made most of us even more eager to befriend and get to know one another. It was strictly a working-class neighbourhood and we were all pretty much on the same footing. Any &quot;new car&quot; in the neighbourhood was something three to five years old in good shape. The only brand spanking new ones we ever saw outside of a showroom were strictly passing through on their way to somewhere else.</p>

<p>We also played lots of team sports in school which was a great leveller when the hero and winning goal scorer was black kid whose parents were from the Caribbean, or some tall skinny Scandinavian, or some little Italian dude who could run faster than anyone. We all had our brief moments in the Sun, laughed a lot and simply had fun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the adult world, certainly, but the world of kids was far more protected and we were unable to get any real information about sex or sexuality besides gutter-talk and crude jokes, and with no way to separate the bullshit from the reality or know what to believe about anything associated with it until we were supposedly &quot;old enough to know&quot;. </p>

<p>Since boys and girls were generally kept apart on opposite sides of the school-yards there was a distinct disinclination for either to really get to know or associate with the other until mother nature finally provided that change of heart in our teens. Two very different worlds before that with practically nothing in common with each other. Not quite, but almost disdainful towards each other. </p>

This reality seems to be a shared hallucination and what you think or visualize seems to manifest in ways science can&#39;t account for. Constantly watching TV, the news and social media entrains the mind and re-enforces the reality that is being projected. TV&#39;s are everywhere. You can&#39;t even wait to get on an elevator without a TV there locking you into to their version of reality and control. Staying informed is good but there must be a balance.

    <div class="md"><p>The parental paranoia isn&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s making the kids paranoid and afraid of the world they have to live in that&#39;s bad for them and will be even worse for their own children one day if they carry that attitude about it through life. </p>

<p>Try as I might my own children are far more apprehensive about the world out there than I am and it&#39;s not me that&#39;s made them that way but their peers and their peers parents. I have a cell phone that I only rarely ever get a call on and never think to call anyone on because I&#39;ve lived most of my life without one. I&#39;m forever forgetting it or having the battery go flat which means absolutely nothing to me, but what a reaction that gets out them. Living dangerously? Not in my world, but it sure is in theirs.  </p>

<p>You have to find ways to compensate for that and what it does to their self confidence and actually having to contend simply with rather ordinary difficulties they&#39;re bound to encounter in the outside world without freaking-out about them or making them worse than they&#39;d otherwise be. </p>

<p>Giving your children a sense of freedom and independence doesn&#39;t require putting them in jeopardy or mean that you don&#39;t keep an eye on them, just not letting them know about that side of it anymore than you absolutely have to and not interfering with or embarrassing them about that or giving that away unless it&#39;s absolutely necessary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The city I grew up and still live in had a million people back then and about three million now and when I say &quot;city&quot; I mean that the cars didn&#39;t get up to more than 30 mph before hitting a stop sign or traffic light on every corner and the only major thoroughfares would square off about ten residential blocks by ten residential blocks that were all just a safe to ride a bike in, along, and through anywhere in that local neighbourhood today as they were back then. </p>

<p>You cross at a light at any of those major intersections and you&#39;ll find three other roughly ten block by ten block neighbourhoods that are all just as safe and you could ride your bike on the sidewalk for one block before turning off into any of them if those main thoroughfares looked too fast or busy to risk riding along them that far which was how we negotiated getting around between them when I was a kid. We were all street-wise and expert riders who kept most of our stunt riding to places that were safe to do it, not that any of the stunts themselves were exactly what you&#39;d call &quot;safe&quot;. </p>

I will add though that it depends on the people. It&#39;s very prominent this &quot;societal acceptance,&quot; in my generation but me and the people I associated with had very similar childhoods, and teenage years as my parents and some similarities with grandparents. </p>

<p>I do agree I live in a different time and 90/80s were nothing compared to today. But not everyone in my generation is conformed to today&#39;s societal standards. </p>

Through the awakening of consciousness and that whole journey, I&#39;ve had to come to terms with <em>very personal</em> inner flaws, one of them being the degree to which I&#39;d go to point blame at others so long as it meant I could disregard acknowledging my own self. I was a professional manipulator. So, now, whenever I see someone say something that <em>could be taken the wrong way</em>, I  try to clarify. I guess I just care about what&#39;s fundamentally true.

<p>It might have something to do with the suspicion shown by hospitals/clinics when an adult brings in an injured child. And if a &#39;male&#39; brings in an injured &#39;female&#39;, he might as well call the cops on himself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those were seriously my favorite days.  I grew up in Southern California and the neighborhoods out here were awesome.  Every one of them was different and had their own cliques, sights, sounds and smells.  Kids rode bikes, got dirty, got lost for hours.  They built forts, bike jumps, tunnels, rivers and monuments made out of whatever they could find.  Dinner time meant five more minutes.  Street football games meant using the lights as endzones.  Video games were around, and they were awesome, but they were played with your friends in the same room.  Sleepovers were the best thing in the world because you could stay up all night, sleep and then wake up and immediately do it all again.  </p>

<p>I miss it so bad.  I only mentioned a fraction of the things we did as kids.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 was a coup that shattered the illusion of our carefree society and opened its&#39; eyes to the realities of our leaders&#39; imperial agenda. </p>

<p>Just yesterday saw this when reading Molly Ringwald&#39;s account of her troubles in the industry. The image of the 80s kid, the promise of a good future, the beauty, and then it emerges sue also had to submit, play the ugly game, sush and still getting her career stalled.</p>

<p>No, America wasn&#39;t the utopia we now remember. Racial tension existed, greed and corruption still created generations of <em>nouveau poor</em> at every bomm &amp; bust cycle, it was all about the old boys&#39;s club no matter what, and the tendrils of global intervention to <em>protect our interests</em> were planted firmly in the ground. It&#39;s just that 2001 came and with the help of propaganda and technology the Plan laid its ugly face bare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah I came here to say something like this:</p>

<p>Its funny because 2000/2001 is the time when 9/11 happened - but that was not the triggering event.</p>

<p>the event that pulled the trigger and changed everything was a couple years earlier when the internet went mainstream. In 1995 - the internet was an idea that only the goofiest nerds were using.
by 1999 - everyone knew how to get online. But by 2001 - right about the time of 9/11 - the internet was mainstream.</p>

<p>Suddenly - we had the most horrific terrorist attack on U.S. Soil - and we had an incredible avenue to discuss it. </p>

<p>Once 9/11 happened - the internet went from being the way you emailed grandma and did crazy chatroom trivia sessions - to suddenly it was how people were getting their news on current events. Not always true or false - but suddenly everyone was given full access to read/consume countless hours of unverified information.</p>

<p>This has a strong influence of the rise of total coercion, as perpetrated by the state and private companies, but it&#39;s important to consider the chicken and the egg, here. Most private companies have been enveloped by federal agencies, and it&#39;s not important which one controls the other, from my view. Those byzantine organizations in turn strongly focus the messages that are then magnified into hysteria via social media. People are really angry to the point of violence based on non-existent threats. And they&#39;re all non-existent. We have no legitimate fears now, outside of our neighbors who have been radicalized against some other segment of their own population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re joking right? Do you forget about the heroine and crack epidemics throughout the urban communities in the 70s and 80s? That was a terrible time. I&#39;m glad we are treating this most recent drug epidemic as a tragedy and as a health problem, instead of a purely criminal problem. But I just wish we would have had the same empathy towards those addicted to crack in the 70s and 80s, instead of the zero tolerance, maximum sentences that were handed down which further tore apart communities. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>That’s why instead of playing outside and building social skills and long lasting friendships, you have to stay in and play your video games. Wouldn’t want those pesky kidnappers to get you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eh, this was already happening in the &#39;90s. I was born in 1989, and my parents wouldn&#39;t allow me to play outside unsupervised and warned me about strangers/kidnappers. Most of my friends had the same experience. Our generation also had Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo, and you can find tons of contemporaneous news reports from the early &#39;90s (and even earlier) asking &quot;Are kids spending too much time playing video games?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its why your government is spying on you and knows everything you do at all times. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has more to do with the technology not being available at the time. Considering what the CIA/government has done in the past (Project MK Ultra, Project Mockingbird, the War on Drugs etc.) there&#39;s always been an effort to manage public opinion and police the populace, even if it wasn&#39;t through direct surveillance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, we were nowhere near as politically divided.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Partially true, but again, the lack of an internet meant that opinions that fell outside the mainstream of acceptable thought (Overton window) simply had no platform. Leftists, libertarians, anarchists, socialists, right-wing individualists....those voices were rarely heard. You only heard from center-left and center-right, because those were the opinions elevated by the press. This created a false sense of consensus (and  it was far easier to indoctrinate people without the internet, as well).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And people were nowhere near as obsessed with celebrities. People were people. Now it seems like everyone puts on a fake personality and tries to be whatever the media is pushing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not even remotely true. Fads had been engineered by corporations since at least the &#39;40s, possibly before. Look how people glommed onto Elvis and The Beatles (or Sinatra, before them). During the &#39;90s, periodicals like <em>People</em> and <em>Us Weekly</em> were huge. <em>Entertainment Tonight</em> was consistently one of the top ten highest rated syndicated television programs. </p>

<p>I loved the &#39;90s, and have a lot of fond memories of that time. But let&#39;s not idealize them as a halcyon era, or gloss over decades of corruption. Most of today&#39;s problems existed then; it&#39;s just that they&#39;ve gotten even worse over time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, once I got to 13 or 14, the same was the case for me.</p>

<p>The &quot;kids used to be able to play outside!&quot; complaint has been around for decades, though. I vividly remember being told by my parents (and friends&#39; parents, and even a few teachers) that &quot;We used to be able to play outside without worrying about [insert whatever here]!&quot; very frequently.</p>

<p>Ever watch <em>The Wonder Years</em>? You know how it&#39;s the story of a kid growing up in the &#39;60s, as told by his (then present-day) adult self in the late-&#39;80s? Even <em>they</em> mention it, as the narrator once made a crack about how &quot;this was back when nobody locked their doors, and you could play outside without worry.&quot;</p>

<p>So, &quot;kids used to be able to play outside&quot; has been a complaint for 30+ years; certainly, people have more reason to be worried now than they did then, but it&#39;s not new.</p>

When we were like 6-10 we used to play hide-and-seek around a bunch of my neighbors property (like 4-5 houses, some of which didn&#39;t have kids). All of which was unsupervised (for the most part, we were within walking/biking distance to our houses usually). My brothers and I used to walk by ourselves to the nearby park that was about a mile and a half away during the summer when we were like 7.

    <div class="md"><p>Well they&#39;d be erroneously comparing a completely different time period to their modern day standards. I don&#39;t know what fantasy land you&#39;re comparing America in the 1700s to. Slavery was ubiquitous everywhere, not specific to America. There was no place more free at the time. Its foundation was the very essence of freedom from tyranny and a government that actually represents and serves the people instead of being lorded over by despots like everyone else was- and a lot of people still are today. Comparatively speaking, America has always been &quot;great&quot; and &quot;free&quot; unless you&#39;re comparing it to some ideal in your mind that doesn&#39;t actually exist.</p>

<p>By the way women&#39;s happiness has been decreasing more than men&#39;s. Feminism and &quot;women&#39;s lib&quot; have not been good for us.</p>

<p>This information can be spun in numerous ways. But the way I see it is that life expectancy has risin for 22 years straight and then drops for one year. If it continues to drop for a couple of more years I think you can then say life expectancy is dropping, but in my lifetime it has still increased. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of the country was booming economically in the 80s and jobs were plentiful. Only certain areas were bad such as the rust belt. There was a lot of crime in the 80s but it wasn&#39;t racially motivated. It was mostly confined to inner city ghettos that have always been crime ridden and still are crime ridden in 2017. The crack epidemic was mostly anti-drug propaganda. Cocaine isn&#39;t going to kill you but the gang banger drug dealer might and of course the police will ruin your life if caught. This is when harsh mandatory minimum sentencing for drug use was just getting started. DARE and the failed war on drugs was worst thing to come out of the 80s. The war on drugs was just a euphemism for a war on poor people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you seem to be open minded about it, I spent some time digging deep into the scientific research. I believe that there hasn&#39;t been a single experiment where they were able to create an increase in lung cancer rates in animal models.</p>

<p>This article talks about the problem no one likes to mention:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17661225">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17661225</a></p>

<p>Mostly all of the studies that point to increased rates in humans are epidemiological or cohort studies, meaning they gather a bunch of info from the wild population and try to sort out all the confounding factors. The problem is that the confounding factors are often assumed, taken for granted, or guessed at. Crude example, they&#39;ll disregard people who have high stress jobs but not people who are overweight...because everyone &quot;knows&quot; obesity doesn&#39;t cause cancer.  Well what if obesity does cause cancer? Or obesity mixed with smoking causes so much stress to the body that cancer results?</p>

<p>Furthermore, there hasn&#39;t been a single study on the effects of PURE tobacco (without all those cigarette additives). In fact, the studies typically don&#39;t even mention what brand of cigarettes are used. I&#39;d really like to see a pure tobacco study. I have a feeling we might see a parallel with the physiological effects of marijuana...another weedy plant traditionally revered as sacred and medicinal.</p>

<p>And even furthermore, there was a study in 1963(? IIRC) that suggested pipe smokers actually lived longer than non-smokers.  Later studies claimed to reverse that finding...but if you look, you find out that ever since that first study, they&#39;ve been lumping in cigar smokers with pipe smokers. Those two groups are not the same for many, many reasons.</p>

<p>And from the anecdote files, my girlfriend&#39;s father smokes like a chimney but he&#39;s going strong into his old age whereas one of his non-smoker, non-drinking friends died early in his mid 50&#39;s from, you guessed it, cancer. It&#39;s not proof of anything by any means, but it does make you think - about the irony at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My personal experience: a neighbor called the homeowners association on us as kids after moving to a more upscale neighborhood because we were riding our bikes up and down the main road and cul-de-sacs a few streets away in our subdivision without parental supervision. Her reasoning was that we could be hit by a car or taken by a stranger. HOA told her there were no rules against it. Then she called because we were practicing chipping golf balls into a practice net. Then because we were skateboarding without helmets.</p>

<p>One weekend, she told the HOA that she had seen us (my brother and I) with her own two eyes throwing all of the furniture into our neighborhood pool after it was closed for the night. Which was funny, because we&#39;d been out of town since Friday for a hockey tournament and had returned that Sunday evening. Basically she was an uptight homemaker who never let her kids do anything and didn&#39;t think it was right that other kids were out doing kid stuff.</p>

<p>She threatened to call CPS and my dad called her a cunt and I&#39;m pretty sure he farmed her yard one night when he knew she was asleep, but CPS never contacted anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but I was still on the prowl in early college when the big shift to social media happened right alongside the cops chasing everyone from 13 to 30 from dozens of hangouts all over the city and then issuing tickets to people who returned.  They hunted us into the hills, woods and remote beaches until the critical social mass had dissipated.  Everyone then transitioned to social media and people only went to their final destination and returned home.  There was suddenly a lot less lingering of all sorts.  Those fortunate enough to have arranged a private party in a house went there and otherwise went to a bar to generate tax revenue while the bar owners cynically played the music ever louder as we nodded at each other gulping beer.  Then in just several years an entire new batch of young people entered the social scene who never knew that people used to wander around the city speaking with each other, meeting, flirting and hooking up.  After they tamed us they were able to reduce the police force.  There were so people outside and they had hooked up cameras everywhere in center to watch us as well as all of the roads entering and leaving the city.  Then we stayed home since it was cheaper to buy from a store than to order in a restaurant.  Who would want to be outside?  There is nothing to do out there.  That is for children.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>DO you remember watching Back to the Future II in 1989 and thinking that by 2015 we would really have at least something futuristic. It was 25 years in the future, 30 from the movie time period and the same as 1955-1985.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve essentially gone nowhere for almost 40 years.</p>

<p>Take a look at a 1995 Toyota Camry driving around in 2017. 23 years later and it doesn&#39;t look as out of place as a 1972 Chevy driving around in 1995. That 95 Toyota gets better gas mileage than most new cars in 2017.</p>

<p>I&#39;m living in what is called a modern house, and it&#39;s from 1962. In the 80s and 90s it was possible to travel from New York to London in 3 hours on the Concorde. Today that same flight takes 10 hours. We have gone backwards. Life in 2017 feels less advanced and futuristic than it did 20 years ago in 1997 when I first got broadband internet.</p>

<p>I feel like I&#39;ve been stuck in a time warp since 2000, that is when the tech bubble burst. It&#39;s like everything stopped and we never moved the needle. Wall St stole the future from us and pocketed trillions that could have been used to advance society. I really find it odd that my nephew is essentially living the same exact childhood I had with the same movies and toys. He really wants an X-wing fighter from the new Stars Wars movie just like I did when I was 8. I seriously doubt my dad was asking for a hoop and stick like what his dad played with when he was 8 in 1955. I wasn&#39;t asking for 1955 toys in 1985.</p>

<p>Kids today have merely ok childhoods but then fall off a cliff when they hit their teen years. Teens today are under such incredible pressure that didn&#39;t exist when I was growing up in the 80s. I had my first job when I was 13 and then I paid for my college with various part time jobs and graduated with no debt. There wasn&#39;t even such a thing as student loans back then. People worked their way through college. That was the norm. That is just not possible in today&#39;s world. I can&#39;t imagine having to sign a mortgage sized student loan at 17 just to go to college.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t hate the younger generations. I feel sorry for them. I don&#39;t have kids of my own because I saw the writing on the wall 20 years ago. I wouldn&#39;t bring a kid into this world knowing that he would be living through on hell on Earth. That great sucking sound that Ross Perot warned us about happened. The future we were promised was sold down the river and never materialized. It will only get worse from here.</p>

<p>A 2017 Toyota Camry has a touch screen, but I do agree that older things back then tend to last a long time. </p>

<p>I&#39;m apart of the younger generation (born 96) and a lot of people in my generation dress and listen to music from the 90s. There is so much nostalgia marketing now, was it like this before? I&#39;ve heard people in the 80s dressed and listened to music in the 50s, but I&#39;m not sure if they had video game reboots or remakes of every popular 50s movie. </p>

It is just a distraction when before I could operate the controls without looking by feeling the knobs. Try using a touch screen with your eyes closed and see how useful it is.</p>

<p>Maybe old people who grew up in the 50s were still listening to their 50s music in the 1980s. As a child of the 80s I listened a genre called &quot;New Wave&quot; synth music. Think Rick Astley (Rickroll meme) Never gonna give you up.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the phenomenon of listening to older music and borrowing older styles existed in the 80s and 90s.  It didn&#39;t generally go as far as back the 50s (although there was some), it was more 60s and 70s, although there was a swing craze in the 90s.  I think it generally goes in 20 year cycles because yesterday&#39;s 20 year olds are today&#39;s 40 year olds.</p>

<p>Black kids were listening to rap songs that sampled and paid homage to Diana Ross, James Brown, Motown, etc.  White kids liked the Beatles, classic rock, Pink Floyd, etc.  People loved movies set in earlier times like Dirty Dancing and Back to the Future, and the shows like Happy Days and The Wonder Years.  The 80s seemed to really usher in the era of the comeback and elongated careers for musicians.  Michael Jackson, Tina Turner, Aerosmith, the Rolling Stones, Cher, etc. all reinvented themselves and made huge comebacks.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there were quite as many direct remakes and reboots of movies and TV shows but children will inevitably tend to enjoy whatever their parents have been watching and listening to in the house and adults will be nostalgic.  Maybe the degree and intensity has changed with the more 24/7 entertainment cycle and so many more ways to experience entertainment inside the home and on demand but it was always there to some extent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is certainly part of the equation. Many Chinese middle class live better lives than America&#39;s middle class. They have more disposable income than Americans because their housing is cheaper, their food is cheaper, their transportation is cheaper, and their healthcare is so cheap it is practically free. Americans can hardly afford the basics without going into debt and our middle class is dying.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While many Chinese remain poor, a large number of people (millions) have been raised from extreme poverty to upper lower class or lower middle class. This was of course due to the efforts of the Chinese people. But, we did our part by buying their cheap garbage....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The cheap garbage thing is a myth. The cheap goods we started importing from China merely replaced the cheap junk we were already importing from Mexico. Remember when made in Mexico was a thing? I do. When Mexico lost its competitive edge to China they stopped exporting things to America and started exporting people in the form Mexican immigration. </p>

<p>Cheap Chinese crap didn&#39;t really hurt the American middle class until China started becoming more high end and taking jobs that required a college education. In 2006 I was working in a data server farm for a large insurance company when they announced they were shutting the whole operation down and moving to Hong Kong. It was mentioned even if we worked for free it wouldn&#39;t be worth it to stay in the US. For less than the cost of just renting the building and paying local taxes they could have a fully staffed facility in Hong Kong and still have money to spare. They left practically over night and didn&#39;t look back. Question is was that due to the efforts of the Chinese people being harder workers than Americans or currency manipulation by governments on both sides of the Pacific? I tend to believe it was the later. I blame the Federal Reserve more than I blame the Chi-coms for manipulating the currency to benefit the multinational oligarchy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe the rent of the building and the local taxes had something to do with it. It is hard to believe that the rent is higher in the US than HK, so that leaves taxes. US taxes do not seem that high compared internationally. Chinese guys probably work harder, but US guys probably work smarter, so a wash? Both sides are definitely manipulating the currency. I would guess that the Fed is more evil than the Central Committee but both are evil.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When 9/11 went down and they offered up the Patriot Act, no one was involved in politics very much. I had to call my senator and beg for them to vote no, but was met with a resounding no and if I was against it I was against protecting Americans. 9/11 was a very sad day for me, not because people died, but because I saw our freedom being stolen. I was no architect, but I knew when those buildings went down it was not because of an airplane.</p>

<p>When I think about the 90s it was a great time. Everyone was happy, all races and religions were intermixing happily.</p>

<p>When I think of today, it disgusts me as to how people act. They are terrible, blaming, hateful, and race blaming. </p>

<p>I remember being anywhere without worry of checking my phone or having to be near one. That&#39;s what I miss most, people had to find you out and about versus picking up a phone and posting on facebook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was 12 in 8th grade when this happened. Before 9/11, all I had to worry about was my parents coming home and abusing me. After 9/11 my C/O  step dad finally was deployed consistently, his abuse was worse when he came back, but he was gone, and everyday I prayed he would die. </p>

<p>My mom, stressed out at suddenly being an only working parent, continued to take her frustrations out on me, to the point where she backhanded me with her engagement ring to the face, going to school with a big black welt. She knew all the counselors, so when I went to one for help, I was punished.</p>

<p>9/11 made my narcissistic parents even more abusive, parts of my life taken away before I even had the legal ability to make my own choices. </p>

<p>I never had a great, free life. The entirety of it has been spent having my human rights trampled on. This is why I&#39;ll always question authority, because all authority had taught me is that someone will abuse it. The few good ones who understand responsibility are an exception. Sadly, I don&#39;t believe there has been an administration that I&#39;ve felt comfortable with. They always feels like a snake righting it&#39;s group to suffocate it&#39;s prey, just like at home. </p>

I mean how many times), media consolidation/censorship, the birth of the regulated internet.. anti-rave laws FFS. </p>

<p>The one thing that&#39;s markedly different in my mind about post-9/11 US is the complete absence of counterculture. People simply no longer have the time or energy for it, and when they attempt it it&#39;s SHUT DOWN. And look where we are now. Still children playing Pokemon and getting nostaglic about &quot;real hip hop&quot; which was always just mainstream pop. I really do feel sorry for kids these days. Literally the only place they&#39;re allowed to act out and be creative is 4 Chan.</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoy my days in this country, and wakeup grateful for all that I have. Yes there&#39;s a lot of evil but if you are decent, people will return the gesture. We are not a barbaric species anymore. We need to accept that finally. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sometimes I think about how absurd the whole situation was.  If there were a radical group out of Canada that attacked us in a similar matter and then sought refuge in the caves of Mexico, would we invade the entirety of Mexico.  In the process of going after this extremist group would we have 100,000+ civilian casualties.  </p>

<p>The fact that we declared war at all in this situation when this group (technically) wasn&#39;t the military of another government stinks to high hell.  Shouldn&#39;t we have just sent in the seals and marines to wipe them out with some SPEC OPS group?</p>

<p>These guys apparently came from Saudi Arabia and were hiding in Afghanistan (I won&#39;t even get to the actual illegality of the Iraq war)</p>

<p>IDK.  I hate war and the military industrial complex in general.

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like people are less obsessed about celebrities today. Maybe it&#39;s just me and being born in 1990 but I feel like the general population is more awake to real issues rather than 80s/90s where all you had was TV fed shit then the internet happened and it connected us like never before. Everyone I talk to knows most or have heard of the &quot;conspiracy&quot; theories surrounding our government so that&#39;s a good thing not a bad. Sure life used to be more carefree but you were also more ignorant to the real workings of those in power. That&#39;s why censoring the internet is one of the biggest things the elite want to get under control because the spread of information is letting us see their workings and they don&#39;t like it.</p>

They also have access to the entire history of the world in the palm of they&#39;re hand complete with gps, camera and connection to the greatest innovation in mass communication of all time. I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t have social media when I was in high school, but I don&#39;t miss traveling miles to the library to read some ancient scrolls telling me what a hero people like Cristopher Columbus was. When I was in college I knew a guy who got lost skiing in the back country. Turns out he fell headfirst into a tree-well, got stuck and died. Not sure if he froze or suffocated and I can&#39;t help but wonder if he had had a cell phone if he could have wiggled out of his pocket and called in his location. Also, I think there are a lot of important stories that are being exposed thanks to mass media. Overall worth the trade off to me, but I do feel very lucky to have grown up before the internet blew up.</p>

It was something families looked forward to as part of the vacation.  Now it&#39;s just the hell you have to go through to get wherever you&#39;re going.  It&#39;s so sad that current and  future generations will never know any different and think that it has to be like this and think that this is normal and acceptable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s true if OP was early 80s they’d be closer to or in their twenties. It’s always bizarre for me to think about 9/11 because   while I was in the area I was too young to think about the political side of it. </p>

<p>I definitely remember the insane amount of security that popped up everywhere right after, kinda freaked me out actually. It was right after I started seeing people getting questioned on the streets and arrested and whatnot. I mean it always happened but it was just a lot more often, not to mention I started getting walked everywhere after that when before I was trusted to get to school on my own and whatnot. That was a blow to me preteen ego lol. </p>

<p>Both you and OP have good points.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Eh it wasn&#39;t that free. 9/11 was a big turning point, but columbine was a big shakeup too. So was that Oklahoma City bombing. </p>

<p>After 9/11 though you pretty much surrender your privacy to board a plane. Then this country kind of turned into a weird one where you get accused of being anti American when you question these wars. Now we&#39;ve got everyone talking about football players not standing during a national song. That&#39;s still all over Facebook. </p>

<p>And on that subject, Facebook just as well took away a lot of freedom. It&#39;s great for keeping with with friends and family, but it&#39;s terrible because now employers and government people get some insight into what would otherwise be a private conversation. </p>

<p>I&#39;d never ever believed in such things before. I was a definite &quot;scoffer&quot; of such phenomena. A &quot;mocker&quot; if you will. </p>

<p>But I did indeed experience something very odd, a vision, and I&#39;ll never forget it. I honestly don&#39;t want to go into it here as it will take so much time and I don&#39;t want to type that much. Suffice it to say the news reported a man who had the exact same experience the night before his wife boarded one of those planes that crashed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>9/11 was a massive turning point in our nation&#39;s history. I can&#39;t put my finger on how exactly everything changed or the cause besides towers falling, but things are so much different and much worse than pre-9/11 times.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like the government sacrificed hundreds of people in order to make life miserable for the country in exchange for wealth or something. </p>

<p>I know, I know... sounds stupid, but meh, I just don&#39;t know anymore. </p>

Internet is great, but like any other tool, it can be used for good or evil, and TPTB have taken full advantage of it. Not to say 9-11 wasn&#39;t a big part of the changes, but the explosion of the internet played a major part as well.</p>

Maybe because they have never really experience the &quot;freedom&quot; of riding your bike to the mall to play arcade games or played throughout your neighborhood with your friends?

Who knows. Maybe its something else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah I came here to say something like this:</p>

<p>Its funny because 2000/2001 is the time when 9/11 happened - but that was not the triggering event.</p>

<p>the event that pulled the trigger and changed everything was a couple years earlier when the internet went mainstream. In 1995 - the internet was an idea that only the goofiest nerds were using.
by 1999 - everyone knew how to get online. But by 2001 - right about the time of 9/11 - the internet was mainstream.</p>

<p>Suddenly - we had the most horrific terrorist attack on U.S. Soil - and we had an incredible avenue to discuss it. </p>

<p>Once 9/11 happened - the internet went from being the way you emailed grandma and did crazy chatroom trivia sessions - to suddenly it was how people were getting their news on current events. Not always true or false - but suddenly everyone was given full access to read/consume countless hours of unverified information.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looking back at my childhood, I have no idea how my parents did it. Was born in the early 80s and by the time I was 8-9 years old I was just parading around town with my friends, riding on bikes all over the place and had to be home by dark. Would physically go knock on my friends doors without calling because we didn&#39;t really have cell phones at the time, at least not easily accessible ones until I was in high school. I would get into all sorts of shit that my parents had no clue about and as long as I was home by dark they didn&#39;t give a shit, sleepovers all the time and playing video games. I&#39;m sure kids do similar shit nowadays but if I&#39;m being honest, it&#39;s going to be hard for me to let my son have that kind of freedom when he&#39;s that age because the world seems so fucked up now that we have such easy access to information. I&#39;ve sat and contemplated so many times, when should I let my boy go off with his friends and do shit by himself? When do I give him a cell phone? Who do I trust to watch my kid? Who&#39;s house do I let him sleep over? I haven&#39;t even reached that point yet as my son is only 4 but I lose sleep over it sometimes and I still have years to go before any of it is going to be a situation. Fuck, now I have anxiety great.</p>

<p>The rise of social media and smart phones </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has a strong influence of the rise of total coercion, as perpetrated by the state and private companies, but it&#39;s important to consider the chicken and the egg, here. Most private companies have been enveloped by federal agencies, and it&#39;s not important which one controls the other, from my view. Those byzantine organizations in turn strongly focus the messages that are then magnified into hysteria via social media. People are really angry to the point of violence based on non-existent threats. And they&#39;re all non-existent. We have no legitimate fears now, outside of our neighbors who have been radicalized against some other segment of their own population.</p>

<p>Then there was the college marketing bomb, which forces us to make life changing decisions we were not prepared for, while we never learned how to do taxes or pay bills on time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks to the internet I&#39;ve been able to educate myself. I was never exposed to much marketing thanks to adblockers and hating TV. I&#39;d like to think I made the right decision in terms of college. The school I go to has decent OCR for CS and I have a nice scholarship so my parents can pay it out of pocket.</p>
